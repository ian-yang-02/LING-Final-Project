 many student groups on campus are dedicated to serving others. among them is the american red cross club (arcc), which sponsors several initiatives to help communities in atlanta and beyond. the group’s major focus is on blood drives throughout the semester, and the next one will take place on march 9 in the exhibition hall. 
 the red cross is experiencing its worst blood shortage in over a decade. coming out of the pandemic, blood donations must increase. there has been a 62% drop in college and high school drives. fortunately, the arcc makes it easy for students, faculty, and staff to give blood. 
 many of the club’s drives are done in partnership with other student organizations for increased advertising and community building. everyone involved, from the people donating to those volunteering, is brought closer together through this vitally important cause. 
 if you can’t make it to this month’s drive, the arcc will host another on april 5-6. the club also offers many other volunteer opportunities, such as food for families, where participants sort, bag, and restock items at local food pantries. transportation is provided for all outings, and the club welcomes students who are looking to help others and meet others who share that passion. 
 sign up for a time slot to donate blood on march 9.
