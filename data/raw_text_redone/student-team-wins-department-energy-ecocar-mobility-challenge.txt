 a team of georgia tech students and faculty members has won the 
 u.s. department of energy’s (doe) ecocar mobility challenge . the four-year competition tasked 11 universities with transforming a 2019 chevrolet blazer by adding advanced propulsion systems and automated vehicle technology. the goal was to improve the car’s energy efficiency while balancing emissions, safety, and consumer acceptability factors. 
 originally a six-cylinder, the georgia tech team converted its blazer to a four-cylinder hybrid vehicle with adaptive cruise control. its vehicle-to infrastructure communication technology allows it to “talk” to stoplights and adjust its speed for optimization. 
 the team of approximately 60 graduate and undergraduate students represent six of the 
 college of engineering ’s eight schools. the group also includes students from the 
 college of computing , 
 scheller college of business , and georgia state university.
