 for the seventh year, t he georgia tech police department (gtpd) is organizing a care package drive to assist those in need near campus. last year, with the help of the campus community, gtpd packaged and distributed more than 150 care packages to individuals experiencing homelessness in and around the tech community. 
 “for the last six years we have surpassed our goal for the number of packages to create, so this year we will not set a goal. our only mission is to fulfill our purpose of generously sharing with those in need,” said lt. jessica howard, gtpd. “as we approach the holiday season, please remember those who find themselves in less fortunate circumstances than ourselves.” gtpd will fill gallon-size bags with travel size toiletries, snacks, and food items. 
 collection bins are in the police department’s lobby and patrol suite at 965 hemphill ave. nw, atlanta, georgia. if you would like a collection bin to place in your department, please email 
 outreach@police.gatech.edu . items will be collected until friday, dec. 15.

 toiletries / miscellaneous: hand sanitizer, lotion, wipes, deodorant, lip balm, hand warmers, gloves, beanie caps, socks, and feminine hygiene products. 
 snack / food items: tuna packets, noodles, granola bars, mints, fruit cups, vienna sausages, jerky, and crackers.
