 dewatering of cellulose nanomaterials using ultrasound . she is a pse fellow in the lab of 
 saad bhamla , assistant professor in the school of chemical and biomolecular engineering. 
 “udita ringania’s research is an impressive example of innovation in the forest products industry with great potential to help paper and packaging manufacturers advance sustainability,” said 
 heidi brock , af&pa president and ceo. “on behalf of af&pa and our members, we congratulate udita and look forward to seeing this exciting research progress.” 
 the theme for the 2020-2021 award program was “boosting the forest bioeconomy: nature-based solutions toward a lower carbon economy.”

 af&pa and tappi manage the u.s. blue sky award application and selection process, nominating up to three candidates for the international competition. the u.s. judging panel was organized by the alliance for pulp & paper technology innovation. 
 the international blue sky awards program is sponsored by the icfpa, a worldwide network of forest and paper associations that promotes cooperation in areas of common interest to its members and serves as the industry’s advocate at the international level. 
 the 2021 blue sky award competition included 21 contestants from nine countries around the world. this year’s judging panel included representatives from the food and agriculture organization of the united nations, united nations forum on forests secretariat, international union of forest research organizations, monash university and university of british columbia. 
 the top three finalists presented their work at the icfpa’s virtual global ceo roundtable discussion and were awarded cash prizes for their achievement.
