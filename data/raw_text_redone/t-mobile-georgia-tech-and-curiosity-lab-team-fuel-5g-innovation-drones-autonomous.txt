 the new 5g incubator is located in the city of peachtree corners’ 500-acre smart city technology park, a living lab powered by t-mobile 5g where more than 8,000 people live or work. the facility features a 25,000 square foot innovation center and 3-mile autonomous vehicle test track. t-mobile has deployed its extended range 5g and ultra capacity 5g network across the park enabling developers to build solutions in a real-world environment. here developers will build and test new 5g use cases such as autonomous vehicles, robotics, industrial drone applications, mixed reality training and entertainment, remote medical care, personal health and fitness wearables, and more. 
 “what a match-up! america’s leading 5g network, the brilliant minds of georgia tech and the most advanced living lab in the country — now that’s a powerhouse combination,” said john saw, evp of advanced & emerging technologies at t-mobile. “we cannot wait to see the innovation that occurs as entrepreneurs and developers build the next big thing in 5g backed by these world-class resources.” 
 the new incubator, managed in collaboration with georgia tech’s advanced technology development center (atdc), is an expansion of the t-mobile accelerator and part of the un-carrier’s efforts to fuel 5g innovation. t-mobile supports numerous initiatives to help startups and entrepreneurs develop, test and bring to market groundbreaking new 5g products and services. t-mobile accelerator is an award-winning program founded in 2014 that originated in the smart city corridor of kansas city. 
 companies participating in the 5g connected future program will work directly with technology and business leaders at t-mobile accelerator, georgia tech, and curiosity lab as they build, test and bring to market new products and services that unleash the potential of t-mobile 5g. atdc is a globally recognized technology incubator. the 5g connected future vertical is the fourth of its kind at atdc and follows other targeted programs in health, retail and financial technologies. 
 “in addition to the normal startup concerns, entrepreneurs in the 5g space face a unique set of challenges such as regulatory issues at the state and local levels, network security, and integration testing,” said atdc director john avery. 
 atdc brings a unique framework that combines its startup curriculum, coaching, connections, and community, as well as direct access to georgia tech resources, research expertise, and student talent, to help entrepreneurs learn, launch, scale, and succeed. in this effort, atdc will offer programing, recruit and evaluate startups, and hire staff to manage the vertical in peachtree corners. 
 “this collaboration is a great opportunity for atdc and georgia tech, the city of peachtree corners and curiosity lab, and t-mobile, a fortune 50 company, to create a unique collection to work with these companies, refine their ideas into scalable companies, and bring these solutions to market more quickly,” avery said. 
 such a partnership underscores “georgia tech’s commitment to enabling tomorrow’s technology leaders, which remains as strong as when atdc was founded 41 years ago,” said chaouki t. abdallah, georgia tech’s executive vice president for research. “innovation cannot take place in a vacuum, which is why entrepreneurs and startups require the knowledge and resources provided through partnerships such as ours.” 
 “the city of peachtree corners and curiosity lab continue to affirm our commitment to technology innovation through programs, partnerships and engagements with industry leaders such as t-mobile and georgia tech,” said betsy plattenburg, executive director of curiosity lab. “these two organizations were instrumental in the launch of curiosity lab and our continued collaboration will create opportunities for the next-generation of intelligent mobility and smart city entrepreneurs.”
