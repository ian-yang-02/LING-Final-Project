 beginning february 22, georgia tech faculty, graduate teaching assistants (gta), and students will have the opportunity to participate in a series of listening sessions focusing on their classroom experiences this semester. 
 the one-hour sessions, hosted by the academic restart task force, will help inform continuous improvement efforts for spring and will be shared with campus administrators and the institute restart task forces.
