 stamps health services will again offer flu shots at no charge to all georgia tech students who have paid their health fee and $25.00 to all faculty / staff. 
 no appointment is necessary to get a flu shot at the flu clinic, but come early to beat the line. your buzzcard is required when checking in for the flu shots. 
 two other ways to get a flu shot: 
 students can make an online appointment in the allergy and immunization clinic at  health.gatech.edu / appointments . 
 if you have an appointment to see a provider at stamps, just ask to have your flu shot given while you are there. any of the nursing personnel will be happy to administer the shot for you at this time.
