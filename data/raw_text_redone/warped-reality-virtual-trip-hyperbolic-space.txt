 hold tight for a psychedelic trip to hyperbolic space, where the floor drops out from beneath your feet. 
 math just met “warp drive” in a virtual reality headset to transport anyone who dons the visor to a reality twisted by hyperbolic geometry. the program was co-created by sabetta matsumoto, a physicist and applied mathematician at the georgia institute of technology as a visual aid to researchers exploring geometries that deviate from the everyday norm. 
 splashed in color, the virtual space’s graphics can seduce even the most math-phobic mind to roam, crawl or slither about. but mathematicians and physicists can make great use of it.
