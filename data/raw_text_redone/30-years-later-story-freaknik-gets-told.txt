 what started as a picnic for 
 b lack college students in 
 1983 
 turned into a national — even international — party that filled the parks and streets of atlanta. it turned into 
 freaknik , and 
 it’s 
 now the subject of a hulu documentary. 
 joycelyn wilson , assistant professor in the school of literature, media, and communication, says the release of 
 freaknik : the wildest party never told 
 continues to raise the profile of atlanta’s role in hip-hop overall, not just in the south. 
 “it was 
 b lack college weekend, and it attracted folks from all over. it grew into a big weekend for 
 b lack youth and 
 artists 
 to come together and enjoy the weekend and each other,” she said. 
 wilson, who grew up in 
 atlanta 
 and 
 is 
 a black 
 media 
 studies and hip-hop scholar, has been familiar with 
 f reaknik 
 since she was in middle school 
 — although, the first time she was there, she 
 d idn’t 
 even realize it . 
 “i was with my cousin, and he told me to sit in the car while he talked to his friends,” she said. 
 the documentary , produced by lu ther 
 campbell, jermaine dupri, 
 and 21 savage,  highlights 
 freaknik 
 in 1994, which wilson says was a 
 pivotal 
 year for hip-hop. it brought the release of 
 outkast’s 
 debut album, 
 southernplayalisticadillacmuzik , 
 along with albums from 
 nas 
 and biggie smalls. 
 “ freaknik 
 was a platform for them to perform and really expanded how hip-hop came together,” wilson said. 
 as 
 freaknik 
 grew, so did its problems. amid 
 reported 
 sexual assault s , traffic, and safety concerns, atlanta police 
 attempted 
 to shut it down in 1999. wilson covered the decline of 
 freaknik 
 as a journalist for 
 rap pages 
 at the time with her article, 
 “ they don’t freak no mo ’ . ” 
 “visitors were welcomed 
 only 
 to 
 the sweet auburn fest, while downtown was filled with nothing more than ghosts of 
 freakniks 
 past,” she wrote 
 in the august 1999 issue . 
 still, the essence of the original 
 freaknik 
 fellowship lives on elsewhere in 
 black 
 culture , 
 at hbcu events such as homecoming and music festivals. wilson 
 recalled 
 the one music festival in 
 atlanta’s 
 piedmont park last year, where , 
 as kendrick lamar performed, 
 she felt a similar feeling 
 to wh at 
 freak nik 
 once evoked. 
 others have 
 attempted 
 to revive the event in the past. 
 whether the documentary’s release could spur a nother attempt 
 remains 
 to be see n — but, as wilson said, “i t could get a remix ."
