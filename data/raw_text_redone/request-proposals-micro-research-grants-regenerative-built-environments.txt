 the  kendeda building advisory board  conceived of this pilot program in 2021. it will provide micro research grants ($50 to $500) to eligible participants to conduct limited, but novel, research experiments, design exercises, crafting of models or prototypes, or development and analysis of datasets. research relevant to the topic of regenerative built environments is required. if you are thinking, “what is a regenerative built environment?”, then we recommend a review of  www.livingbuilding.gatech.edu . the research must incorporate the campus itself or its operations. we encourage submittals that explore ways in which our campus can continue to innovate, demonstrate, prove, and promote the adoption of best and next practices in regenerative design and operations. in your proposal, define “regenerative” design and / or operations as it pertains to your proposed project. we encourage you to relate the project to one or more of the united nations sustainable development goals (sdgs,  https: / / sdgs.un.org / goals ). proposals are especially sought from staff and students at georgia tech that have not traditionally been directly involved in research, though proposals from all members of the georgia tech community are welcome.
