a journey to the origins of multicellular life: long-term experimental evolution in the lab 
 over 3,000 generations of laboratory evolution, georgia tech researchers watched as their model organism, “snowflake yeast,” began to adapt as multicellular individuals. 
 macroscopic snowflake yeast with elongated cells fracture into modules, retaining the same underlying branched growth form of their microscopic ancestor.

 the world would look very different without multicellular organisms – take away the plants, animals, fungi, and seaweed, and earth starts to look like a wetter, greener version of mars. but precisely how multicellular organisms evolved from single-celled ancestors remains poorly understood. the transition happened hundreds of millions of years ago, and early multicellular species are largely lost to extinction. 
 to investigate how multicellular life evolves from scratch, researchers from the georgia institute of technology decided to take evolution into their own hands. led by  william ratcliff , associate professor in the  school of biological sciences  and director of the  interdisciplinary graduate program in quantitative biosciences , a team of researchers has initiated the first long-term evolution experiment aimed at evolving new kinds of multicellular organisms from single-celled ancestors in the lab.
