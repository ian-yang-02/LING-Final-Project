 though ethics is a year-round priority, 
 ethics awareness week 
 puts a spotlight on how to make ethical decisions, where to find related resources, and georgia tech’s office of ethics and compliance. 
 this year’s events, taking place nov. 9 – 13, will be a mix of scheduled online presentations, on-demand activities, and in-person ethics tables around campus. campus experts from the college of computing; veterans resource center; lgbtqia resource center; institute diversity, equity, and inclusion; office of international education; and human resources, among others, will join the office of ethics and compliance to showcase ethics in a variety of contexts. 
 kara tucker, lead counsel and director of ethics and compliance in the office of the general counsel, said partnering with campus departments was intentional to ensure there is something for everyone in this year’s programming. 
 “ethics is embedded in everything we do at georgia tech,” tucker said. “we want everyone’s brains to churn around ethical topics in application, like ethics in ai, global collaboration, and diversity.” 
 the week begins with an introduction of “ reporting concerns — understanding internal investigations ,” monday, nov. 9, at 10:30 a.m. campus internal investigation leaders melissa hall (associate director of forensics audits), ivy gardner (director of employee relations), and kyla ross (assistant vice provost for advocacy and conflict resolution) will share the ins and outs of what happens when a student or employee reports an ethical concern. this virtual presentation is all about georgia tech’s investigations process. register at
