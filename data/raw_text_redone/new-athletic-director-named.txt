 “we’re excited to welcome j to georgia tech. his leadership experience at one of the most competitive programs in the nation and his extraordinary track record in fundraising and revenue generation will bring great value to georgia tech,” said georgia tech president ángel cabrera. “as a former acc student-athlete, j has a keen appreciation for what it takes for students to compete at the highest level while pursuing a degree at a top academic institution. he values and shares our culture of excellence and integrity and our commitment to student well-being and success. i look forward to working with him to secure and invest the resources necessary for a successful athletics program.”

 “my family and i truly appreciate president cabrera and his team for this opportunity, and we are incredibly excited to join the georgia tech family,” said batt. “i look forward to working with our student-athletes, coaches, staff, supporters, and fans to reach new heights, on and off the field, and to build on the rich tradition and history of this storied athletics department. we can’t wait to become a part of the atlanta community. go jackets!” 
 batt was named the top candidate by cabrera following a national search. the selection process included interviews with a committee comprised of a coach, senior athletics administrator, student-athlete, student-athlete alum, and faculty member who recommended a set of finalists for consideration by the president. the board of trustees of the georgia tech athletic association voted unanimously to approve cabrera’s proposal to appoint batt.
