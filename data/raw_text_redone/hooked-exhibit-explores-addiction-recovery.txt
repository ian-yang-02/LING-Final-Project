 an exhibit this summer curated by a georgia tech graduate explores addiction and recovery, showing how addiction can affect all of us. 
 hooked : when want becomes need 
 is curated by floyd hall, interim director of 
 science gallery atlanta . for the exhibit, 
 science gallery international 
 partnered with emory university to explore addiction through art and science by way of multimedia art installations.“this exhibition is about unpacking all that we think we know about addiction and approaching the topic from a public health perspective,” 
 said hall , who holds a bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering from georgia tech. “no one is exempt from the effects of addiction on society.” 
 caroline greiner, a georgia tech graduate student in mechanical engineering and engineering education, is a mediator for the exhibit. she guides guests as they explore the installations, answering questions about the art and science behind each piece. 
 “with a background in engineering, science, and art, i have an interest in how the arts collide with stem topics and how that can enhance learning and experiences in both fields,” greiner said. 
 hooked , the inaugural exhibit for science gallery atlanta, runs through sept. 4 at pullman yards. admission is free at the door, and guests can also 
 reserve a ticket online . 
 georgia tech’s connection to science gallery international goes beyond atlanta. in march, tech alumna jahnavi phalkey 
 became the founding director 
 of 
 science gallery bengaluru.
