researchers find they can stop degradation of promising solar cell materials 
 engineers uncover the chemical interactions that make perovskites unstable and can prevent them.

 georgia tech materials engineers have unraveled the mechanism that causes degradation of a promising new material for solar cells — and they’ve been able to stop it using a thin layer of molecules that repels water. 
 their findings are the first step in solving one of the key limitations of metal halide perovskites, which are already as efficient as the best silicon-based solar cells at capturing light and converting it into electricity. 
 they reported their work in the 
 journal of the american chemical society . 
 “perovskites have the potential of not only transforming how we produce solar energy, but also how we make semiconductors for other types of applications like leds or phototransistors. we can think about them for applications in quantum information technology, such as light emission for quantum communication,” said 
 juan-pablo correa-baena , assistant professor in the 
 school of materials science and engineering 
 and the study’s senior author. “these materials have impressive properties that are very promising.”
