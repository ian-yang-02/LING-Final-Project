 at the corner of hemphill avenue and ferst drive sits a lush, green, 8-acre treasure — a study in ecological sustainability, innovative pedagogy, and individual contemplation. 
 known as the ecocommons, the space is a far cry from the dated beringause building and surface parking lots that once occupied the area. it is an extension of 80 acres of greenspace throughout georgia tech’s campus that follow the original naturally occurring stream paths of this region before urbanization. these revitalized greenspaces are designed and engineered to reduce stormwater runoff while also supporting increased biodiversity and living-learning laboratories on campus. within the most recently completed 8 acres of the ecocommons are three distinct programmed areas — an area to engage, an area to learn, and an area to reflect. 
 georgia tech president ángel cabrera is already a frequent visitor. “in the institute’s new strategic plan, we pledge to lead and inspire by example — to become a model of efficiency, sustainability, ethics, equity, and inclusion through deliberate innovation in all our practices,” he said. “the ecocommons beautifully showcases each of these values.”
