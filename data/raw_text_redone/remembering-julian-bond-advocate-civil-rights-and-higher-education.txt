 institute diversity is saddened by the passing of julian bond, an advocate for civil rights and higher education. “another major icon of the modern civil rights movement is gone,” said archie ervin, vice president of institute diversity. “even though we have progressed enormously in the past 50 years, we, as a society, still have work to do, evolving from civil to human rights.” georgia tech was honored to have bond as the keynote speaker at this year’s martin luther king, jr. celebration. as bond stated in his lecture, “there needs to be a constantly growing and reviving activist, progressive movement across america if we are to maintain and expand the victories we’ve won. sometimes the simplest of acts—sitting at a lunch counter, going to a new school, and applying for a marriage license—can challenge the way we think and act.” to view his lecture at georgia tech earlier this year, please visit
