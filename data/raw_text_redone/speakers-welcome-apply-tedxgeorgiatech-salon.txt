 tedxgeorgiatech 
 will host a virtual speaker salon focusing on the accomplishments of women at georgia tech. all students, faculty, and staff with a story that would fit the theme are eligible to apply to speak by 11:59 p.m. on tuesday, dec. 15. 
 tedxgeorgiatech hosts both salons and conferences each year. salons usually feature members of the georgia tech community (often students), while the larger conferences host professional speakers from across the country. the upcoming salon is part of tedxgeorgiatech’s theme for the 2020-21 academic year, “embark.” the organization chose this theme to encourage listeners to try new things even amid the pandemic, whether it’s starting a new hobby or exploring a new idea. 
 “we might not be able to go anywhere, but we can still embark on a new journey in a figurative sense,” said alea legg, an industrial engineering major and director of media for tedxgeorgiatech. with this next salon, listeners will be able to experience the spirit of the “embark” theme while also celebrating georgia tech women. 
 everyone is welcome to attend. the event is free, and those interested in speaking or attending can learn more
