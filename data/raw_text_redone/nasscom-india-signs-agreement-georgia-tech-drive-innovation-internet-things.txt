 the national association of software and services companies (nasscom) announced dec. 19 that it has signed a memorandum of understanding with the georgia institute of technology to begin collaborating on advancing the internet of things (iot) and fostering innovation through an iot ecosystem. 
 nasscom, which is india’s information technology and business process management sector industry association, operates the 
 centre of excellence for internet of things 
 (coe-iot), which will work closely with georgia tech’s atlanta-based center for the development and application of internet of things technologies (cdait). the main objective of nasscom’s coe-iot is to create innovative applications and domain capability, which is similar to cdait’s mission of expanding and promoting the internet of things’ potential and transformational capabilities. 
 “we are honored to collaborate with a premier high tech organization such as nasscom to promote the many benefits of the fast-growing internet of things,” said alain louchez, managing director of cdait. “in close cooperation with nasscom’s iot center, we intend to explore ways to leverage iot technologies to accelerate and optimize the pace of digital transformation throughout the economy.” 
 the agreement between nasscom and georgia tech will allow both organizations to combine their efforts to raise awareness of iot and create iot-related events for the purpose of developing a vibrant global iot ecosystem facilitating the effective and efficient adoption of iot technologies. the partnership will also prompt conversations around iot that will promote interoperability across industry and geographic markets. 
 “the disruptive nature of iot will have a major impact in all areas of the consumer’s life – across all industries including industrial, healthcare, agriculture and smart homes,” said sanjeev malhotra, chief executive officer of coe-iot. “iot will also be used across these industries to improve productivity with minimum usage of natural resources. we are happy to be partnering with georgia tech, a leading institute with a focus on emerging technologies, leading to a mutually beneficial agreement that will help us combine georgia tech’s advanced technology research along with the thriving innovation ecosystem in india.” 
 through its coe-iot located in bangalore, nasscom is focusing on systemically expanding the technology ecosystem, with the center providing a platform to address challenges such as the lack of understanding that leads to low adoption levels and security issues faced by the industry.

 (pronounced "sedate") is a global, non-profit, partner-funded center located at georgia tech in atlanta, georgia, that fosters interdisciplinary research and education while driving general awareness about the internet of things. it aims at efficiently identifying, understanding and solving for its sponsors challenges and problems that may arise along the whole iot value chain. cdait bridges sponsors with georgia tech faculty and researchers as well as industry members with similar interests.
