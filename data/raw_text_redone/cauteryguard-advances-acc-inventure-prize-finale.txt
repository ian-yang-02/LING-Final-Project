 — atlanta, ga 
 four biomedical engineering students from georgia tech will compete in tonight’s acc inventure prize finale. 
 the team invented cauteryguard, which adds a retractable tip to current electrocautery devices. this change prevents the risk of burns many doctors and patients face from the device’s exposed tip. it also eliminates the chance of fires in operating rooms caused by an exposed tip coming into contact with flammable materials. 
 the 
 acc inventure prize 
 awards $30,000 in prizes to undergraduate students whose innovations aim to solve world problems and make our lives easier. 
 each of the 15 universities in the atlantic coast conference (acc) selected a team of student entrepreneurs for the competition, which is taking place at georgia tech. a preliminary round held thursday evening narrowed the field to five finalists.
