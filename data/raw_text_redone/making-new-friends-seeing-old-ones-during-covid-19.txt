 as we cross the midpoint of the semester, people across campus are looking for ways to stay connected and socialize safely. whether you want to take advantage of increasingly warm weather or are simply trying to make new friends, opportunities abound. 
 getting started socializing 
 it can already be difficult to make friends in college, and that can be worsened by students feeling isolated during the pandemic. 
 “feeling shy or experiencing some level of social awkwardness is nothing to feel ashamed about, and for many students, the pandemic has amplified those feelings,” said tiffiny hughes-troutman, director of the center for assessment, referral, and education (care). “start by seeking out environments that suit you.” 
 some suggestions for how to do this include attending residence hall events for students who live on campus, as well as developing social media networks. volunteering can also help students make friends while giving back to their local communities, and 
 pen pal networks 
 are regaining popularity in light of the pandemic. 
 if you know someone is new to campus, or could use a connection, ask them to join you to do something outdoors. this, too, can be uncomfortable — but everyone needs a friend, especially these days. 
 you can also find student organizations across a wide variety of topics on
