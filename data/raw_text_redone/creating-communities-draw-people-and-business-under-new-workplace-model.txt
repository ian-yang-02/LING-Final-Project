 atlanta — 
 as communities move past the effects of covid-19 and the economic turmoil stemming from the pandemic, economic development professionals are fully engaged in recovery. 
 the 
 56th annual georgia tech basic economic development course 
 (bedc) will arm these professionals with the tools and strategies needed to maximize opportunity and potential for local communities in a four-day course from august 28-31. ( register:

 the new realities of today’s workforce in a post-pandemic economy means communities must reimagine themselves in ways that make them more attractive to people as places to live and for businesses to operate. 
 presented by georgia tech’s 
 enterprise innovation institute 
 in collaboration with the 
 international economic development council   and the  georgia economic developers association , 
 this comprehensive course will explore the use of placemaking as an economic development tool to help professionals create quality places where people want to live and businesses believe they will thrive. 
 the 2023 theme is 
 placemaking and economic recovery: creating communities where people want to live and businesses want to be. 
 keynote speakers include 
 eric kronberg , founder of 
 kronberg urbanists architects , and 
 elizabeth ward williams , that firm’s director of urban design. 
 “we know the pandemic has changed the way we operate in a lot of ways with telecommuting and remote working being a fixed reality for business and job seekers,” 
 said alan durham, bedc course director. with work-from-home or hybrid commuting schedules the norm, communities need to rethink how they create strategies and make them more appealing to potential residents and business investments, he said. 
 “our course is designed to teach attendees how to maximize opportunities in this new reality. people aren’t moving to a given community simply to be closer to work if there’s no central office or even a requirement to go into one,” durham said. “so, it’s imperative that officials looking to boost their communities’ economic development opportunities shift their thinking.” 
 part of that shift means focusing on strategies that create an attractive quality of life both for residents and business, plan for economic recovery and resilience, smart incentive packages, and other tools. communities must also find creative ways to address the shortage of workforce and entry-level housing options. 
 bedc course speakers will address several topics over the four days that will help attendees capitalize on their communities’ unique assets and how they can effectively use and maximize placemaking as an economic development tool. 
 among the course topics: 
 workforce housing strategies 
 business retention and expansion 
 real estate development and reuse 
 business credit analysis 
 workforce development 
 strategic planning 
 economic impact and incentives 
 managing economic development organizations 
 ethics in economic development 
 small business and entrepreneur development 
 marketing and attraction 
 disaster recovery and resilience 
 media strategy 
 this four-day conference gives attendees opportunities to network with industry peers and experts, deeply explore the fundamentals and emerging concepts of comprehensive economic development and prepare them to immediately implement tools and skills gained during the course. 
 since its inception in 1967, the georgia tech bedc has prepared more than 3,300 economic developers from all over the world for the  iedc certified economic developer 
 (cecd) examination. the certification is considered an essential component of a career in economic development. bedc at georgia tech is
