 in a new study led by georgia tech and university of helsinki, researchers have discovered a mechanism steering the evolution of multicellular life.

 will ratcliff, 
 the study, “ proteostatic tuning underpins the evolution of novel multicellular traits ”, was published in 
 science advances 
 this month, and uncovers how altered protein folding drives multicellular evolution. 
 the team’s research centers on the ongoing multicellularity long term evolution experiment (multee) experiment, in which laboratory yeast are evolving novel multicellular functions, enabling researchers to investigate how these functions arise. 
 among the most important multicellular innovations is the origin of robust bodies: over 3,000 generations, these ‘snowflake yeast’ started out weaker than gelatin but evolved to be as strong and tough as wood. 
 from an evolutionary perspective, this work highlights the power of non-genetic mechanisms in rapid evolutionary change. 
 “we tend to focus on genetic change and were quite surprised to find such large changes in the behavior of chaperone proteins,” says ratcliff. “this underscores how creative and unpredictable evolution can be when finding solutions to new problems, like building a tough body."
