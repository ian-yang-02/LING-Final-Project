 “we are building on the success of last year’s inaugural program, and a critical focus of this effort is innovation because it remains a key issue, according to our mbe manufacturers,” said donna ennis, atlanta mbda advanced manufacturing center director. “our summit is designed to facilitate critical one-on-one meetings between our attendees and corporations, as well as provide the opportunity for our mbe attendees to network with one another.” 
 the atlanta mbda advanced manufacturing center is a program of the enterprise innovation institute (ei 2 ), georgia tech’s chief economic development and business outreach arm. a sister program to the atlanta mbda business center, the atlanta mbda advanced manufacturing center was created via a grant from the u.s. department of commerce mbda awarded to georgia tech in 2016. 
 one of four such centers across the country, tech will receive $1.25 million over a five-year period to operate the center, which is charged with providing targeted assistance to mbe manufacturers. the funding is designed to help identify, screen, promote, and refer mbes to specialized advanced manufacturing programs, and provide technical and business development services and assist with access to capital, opportunities and markets. 
 according to data from the u.s. census bureau’s 2012 survey of business owners, the number of minority-owned manufacturers increased 30 percent between 2007 and 2012 to nearly 107,000. these firms generated $80 billion in annual revenue in 2012. more than 25,000 minority manufacturers employ almost 332,000 workers. 
 the summit is an outgrowth of the atlanta mbda business center’s connecting advanced manufacturing program (camp), which is now the atlanta mbda advanced manufacturing center, ennis said. “the vision behind camp and what led to us creating the summit is to connect mbe manufacturers in the ecosystem to business opportunities, research, innovation, funding, and critical information they need to grow and thrive as businesses,” she said.
