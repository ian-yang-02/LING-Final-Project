 stargazers are invited to the georgia tech observatory for public nights this semester. the next event is thursday, march 10, from 7 to 9 p.m. on the grounds between the howey and mason buildings. several telescopes will be set up for viewing, or you may bring your own telescope. 
 jim sowell, principal academic professional and director of the georgia tech observatory, is excited that public nights have returned after a break during the pandemic. “i describe my role these days as a tour guide, and i greatly enjoy hearing the squeals and gasps as people see craters on the moon, or the rings of saturn, or moons orbiting jupiter,” he said. “a clear evening with some celestial objects visible is as much a delight for me as it is for the visitors.” 
 sowell and members of the georgia tech astronomy club will be available to answer questions. the viewing targets for march 10 are the moon and orion nebula. successful viewing depends on clear weather, so visitors should check for updates on the 
 astronomy website . the event is free but remember to pay for parking if you use a visitor lot. 
 two more public nights will be held this spring, on april 7 from 8:30 to 10:30 p.m. and on may 5 from 9 to 11 p.m.
