 the state of georgia will host a runoff election tuesday, jan. 5, for the state’s two u.s. senate seats. the results will determine which party will control the senate for at least the next two years. 
 incumbent sen. david perdue (r) is seeking another six-year term against jon ossoff (d). for the other seat, incumbent sen. kelly loeffler (r) is running to win the last two years of retired sen. johnny isakson’s term, a seat to which she was appointed by governor brian kemp in 2019. she’s facing off against rev. raphael warnock (d). 
 if one or both republicans win, the gop will retain its senate majority. if the two democrats win and create a 50-50 split, vice president-elect kamala harris would be able to break any tie votes in the chamber.
