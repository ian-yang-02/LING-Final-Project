 happy friday it community! 
 please join me in today’s observance of international women’s day by reflecting on the many contributions of women in technology. i would be remiss if i did not acknowledge the very critical role that women play across the office of information technology and the it community. i am grateful to work alongside and benefit from your contributions. i am also proud to serve among a leadership team where women are represented and reflect the broader community. 
 women continue to steer the advancement of technology and its success in our academic, research and operational spaces at georgia tech. earlier this week, the monthly women in technology meeting featured a few of those voices – highlighting experiences that range from authenticity in the workplace to narratives and norms that advance how women are represented in it. next week, oit will publish a story that highlights additional voices and their diverse perspectives on progress that has been made in technology and the work still to be done. in the meantime, i encourage you to check out some of the events that will celebrate 
 women’s history month across our campus . 
 i thank each of you for all that you to advance it at georgia tech. have a great weekend.
