 georgia institute of technology and the trammell crow company are transforming atlanta’s booming skyline with the launch of the first phase of science square, a pioneering mixed-use development dedicated to biological sciences and medical research and the technology to advance those fields. a ribbon-cutting ceremony is planned for april 25. 
 “the opening of science square’s first phase represents one of the most exciting developments to come to atlanta in recent years,” said ángel cabrera, president of georgia tech. “the greatest advances in innovation often emerge from dense technological ecosystems, and science square provides our city with its first biomedical research district, which will help innovators develop and scale their ideas into marketable solutions.” 
 science square’s first phase includes science square labs, a 13-story purpose-built tower with state-of-the-art infrastructure to accommodate wet and dry labs and clean room space. to promote overall energy efficiency as well as sustainability, the complex houses a massive 38,000-square-foot solar panel. the solar panel system is in addition to an energy recovery system that extracts energy from the building’s exhaust air and returns it to the building’s hvac system, reducing carbon dioxide emissions. electrochromic windows, which tint during the day to block ultraviolet rays and steady the temperature while also controlling the environment — key in research labs — are also featured throughout the building. 
 equipped with technologically advanced amenities and infrastructure, science square labs serves as a nexus for groundbreaking research, enabling collaboration between academia, industry, and startup ventures. portal innovations, a company specializing in life sciences venture development, is among the first tenants to establish operations at science square, as atlanta takes center stage as the country’s top city for research and development employment growth. 
 the opening of the complex’s first phase, just south of georgia tech’s campus and totaling 18 acres, also features retail space and the grace residences developed by high street residential, tcc's residential subsidiary. the 280-unit multifamily tower, already welcoming tenants, is named in honor of renowned atlanta leader and georgia state representative grace towns hamilton who spent many years championing this community. 
 beyond its scientific endeavors, science square embodies georgia tech’s commitment to uplifting the local community. by collaborating with organizations like westside works, science square aims to empower residents through targeted workforce development initiatives and economic opportunities. 
 “this mixed-use development adds immense value to atlanta’s west side and will lead the development of pioneering medical advances with the power to improve and save lives,” president cabrera added.
