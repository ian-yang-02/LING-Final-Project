 georgia tech is not alone in its ambitious mission to transform the way students, faculty, and staff relate to the natural environment and how these relationships must continuously strive for sustainability. facilities management hosts a forum every year to share with the campus and other community members how georgia tech is achieving its sustainability goals. 
 this year's forum , which will take place tuesday, oct. 27, kicks off with speakers from stanford university, uc santa cruz, and biohabitats, who will share their efforts and experiences in reducing energy and water consumption and minimizing material waste on their campuses. 
 next, facilities management staff will lead four tracks for exploration: sustainable resource management, the eco-commons, the kendeda building for innovative sustainable design, and the historic sector: preserve to conserve. 
 the event will be hosted virtually and is free for all students, faculty, and staff to attend. 
 more about this year's tracks: 
 sustainable resource management

 eco-commons 
 a new 7-acre section of the campus eco-commons will be opening soon. take a virtual tour of the space, learn how its interpretive signage will relate to equity and wellness in outdoor spaces, and discover how georgia tech is enabling data collection and access for researchers in this on-campus ecosystem. 
 the kendeda building for innovative sustainable design
