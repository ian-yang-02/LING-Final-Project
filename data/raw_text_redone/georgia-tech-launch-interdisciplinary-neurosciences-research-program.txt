 this fall, the institute will launch a foundational, interdisciplinary program to lead in research related to neuroscience, neurotechnology, and society. the neuro next initiative is the result of the growth of gtneuro, a grassroots effort over many years that has led in the hiring of faculty studying the brain and the creation of the b.s. in neuroscience in the college of sciences, and contributed to exciting neuro-related research and education at georgia tech. 
 neurosciences research holds enormous potential for wide-ranging health and societal impact, and georgia tech's culture of applied research and integrated interdisciplinary liberal arts scholarship is uniquely positioned to create the environment in which neuro next can become an international leader in the discovery, innovation, and translation in neuroscience and neurotechnology. 
 guided by faculty members 
 christopher rozell , professor and julian t. hightower chair in the school of electrical and computer engineering; 
 simon sponberg , dunn family associate professor of physics and biological sciences; and 
 jennifer s. singh , associate professor in the school of history and sociology, the neuro next initiative at georgia tech will lead the development of a community that supports collaborative research, unique educational initiatives, and public engagement in this critical field. 
 “georgia tech has a very strong, but decentralized, neuroscience community,” said sponberg. “the neuro next initiative really sprung from a lot of thoughtful input from dozens of people across many schools, colleges, and roles, which reflects how neuro interfaces so broadly. our goal with this initiative is really to open a new front door to the neuro community here, to highlight the leadership that georgia tech is already taking in many areas of neuro-related research, and to create new ways to support our interdisciplinary work.” aiming to foster a diverse and inclusive community that is passionate about shaping the frontiers of neuroscience and neurotechnology to better serve humanity, the initiative will launch in october. 
 “neuroscience and neurotechnology have advanced dramatically in the last few years, making it clear that there are few endeavors that have as much potential societal impact as our study of the brain,” rozell said. “georgia tech is uniquely positioned to build on its existing strengths to create an effort tailored to meet the scientific, technical, and social needs of these promising research trajectories. i'm excited that the neuro next initiative represents the next step in creating that collaborative community.” by bringing together a diverse cohort of faculty experts from varied disciplines, members aim to create a holistic, integrative, and inclusive approach to neuroscience and neurotechnology that centers real human impact and broad accessibility. 
 singh noted, “neuro next is an important and exciting initiative that is prioritizing the inclusion of a range disciplinary expertise, including social science, humanities, business, and the arts, to critically investigate how we can research and develop neurotechnologies that are accessible, responsible, and socially just. building a collaborative neurocommunity that centers societal impacts from the start shares the commitment of georgia tech to developing leaders who advance technology and improve the human condition.”
