bold move to columbus marks first 
 semiconductor manufacturer in region 
 chips4chips strategy, georgia tech collaboration, prove successful 
 jan 24, 2024 
 columbus and atlanta, ga — 
 innovative partnering proved successful as 
 chips4chips 
 announced the locating of the first semiconductor manufacturer in the chattahoochee valley. 
 micromize , a pioneering semiconductor manufacturer specializing in energy-efficient electronics for wearables and mobile devices, has chosen columbus as the location for its inaugural manufacturing facility. 
 the move is the result of strategic partnerships between  micromize , chips4chips (chattahoochee hub for innovation and production of semiconductors / c4c), and several programs at georgia tech’s 
 enterprise innovation institute , including its 
 advanced technology development center 
 (atdc), its 
 georgia manufacturing extension partnership , and the 
 center for economic development research . it also signifies a collaborative effort to harness the cutting-edge innovations in semiconductor packaging available at  tech’s  institute for electronics and nanotechnology . 
 "our decision to locate in columbus was driven by several crucial factors, and we are thrilled about the opportunities that this vibrant city presents for our growth and development,” said prashant patil, micromize founder and ceo. “the work of chips4chips in supporting the semiconductor industry is commendable, and we are excited to be part of this innovative ecosystem.” 
 this exciting development was announced tuesday, jan. 23, at the marcus nanotechnology center on georgia tech’s campus to a large group of state legislators and other state officials, a delegation of business and civic leaders from columbus, and leadership from georgia tech and atdc. the announcement is a true look at how statewide partnerships can lead to success for the columbus region. 
 micromize, a spinoff of the massachusetts institute of technology, selected georgia as its new home, in part, to take advantage of the semiconductor packaging expertise at georgia tech. the company plans to establish its headquarters and manufacturing facility in columbus, further solidifying its presence in the state’s vibrant technology 
 ecosystem. additionally, micromize will center its cutting-edge research and development on georgia tech's campus. 
 "the collaboration with micromize is a significant milestone for chips4chips and the entire region,” said ben moser, president and ceo of united way of the chattahoochee valley and chair of chips4chips. “ this announcement marks the first of what we believe will be many to come, and we are thankful that micromize recognizes the potential of our region for this industry. columbus is poised for remarkable development, and we look forward to the positive impact that micromize will bring to our community.” 
 the strategic relocation is expected to create significant economic opportunities in the region. micromize will bring 20-25 jobs to columbus through its headquarters and manufacturing facility, contributing to the local workforce, and fostering growth. 
 micromize will center its research & development lab at georgia tech’s 
 3d systems packaging research center , which is regarded as the world’s best for semiconductor packaging research. this partnership represents a synergistic collaboration of industry leaders, research institutions, and the entrepreneurial ecosystem. micromize's move to columbus not only underscores the city's growing prominence as a technology hub, but also highlights the collaborative efforts driving innovation and economic development in the state of georgia. 
 in addition to c4c’s nationally recognized workforce development efforts, the fort moore army base, and its skilled workforce, the region’s proximity to a port and airport will facilitate efficient shipping, and columbus played a pivotal role in supporting the company by providing essential infrastructure, he said. 
 “our collaboration with georgia tech enriches our talent pool, adds exponentially to our research and development capabilities, and access to mentorship at atdc enhances our commercialization potential,” patil said. “we are also proud to be part of the effort to revitalize semiconductor manufacturing in the united states, with columbus serving as our starting point as we embark on this exciting journey of growth and innovation.” 
 georgia tech, a leader in microchips and nanotechnology research, innovation, and fabrication, provides fertile ground for micromize's relocation. the institute’s commitment to advancing semiconductor technology aligns with the national push at the federal level (via the chips and science act) to bring more semiconductor production to the u.s., making it more competitive in research, development, and manufacturing. 
 “as the state’s technology startup incubator, we’re excited to welcome micromize into our portfolio and to support them into the next phase of growth and expansion,” said atdc director john avery. 
 “microchips, semiconductor packaging, and microelectronics are critical to our national economy and national security. micromize’s choosing georgia as its home to grow reflects what is proving to be a successful model when business, government, and research institutions such as georgia tech collaborate.”
