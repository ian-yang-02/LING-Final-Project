 this semester, two wellness days — march 16 and march 24 — are planned for students and instructors to take a break from classes. to encourage the tech community to take time off and enjoy the spring weather, a variety of activities will be hosted leading up to and during the wellness days. the events range from virtual paint parties to in-person yoga at the campus recreation center (crc). in-person events will require social distancing and face coverings. 
 most events are open to all students, faculty, and staff, who are encouraged to get tested through the 
 campus covid-19 testing program 
 before and after they participate in events. 
 instructors have been asked to not schedule assignments during or immediately following these wellness days to give students a chance to recharge. and, staff are also being encouraged to prioritize wellness on these days, whether that’s by incorporating exercise into their day or clearing nonessential meetings to allow for more focused mental activity. 
 human resources offers more suggestions for prioritizing well-being .
