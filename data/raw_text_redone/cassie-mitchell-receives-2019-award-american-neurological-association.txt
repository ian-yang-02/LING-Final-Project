 2019 scientific awards , to be presented at the 144th ana annual meeting, to be held at the marriott st. louis grand, october 13-15, 2019. the awards recognize leaders in academic neurology and neuroscience who have exemplified excellence in research, teaching, and clinical practice across the gamut of clinical neurology and neuroscience disciplines.
