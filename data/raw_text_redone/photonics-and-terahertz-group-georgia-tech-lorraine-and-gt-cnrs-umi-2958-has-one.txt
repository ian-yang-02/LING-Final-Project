 a recent paper from the  photonics and terahertz group  ( equipe photonique et térahertz ) out of 
 gt-cnrs umi 2958  at georgia tech-lorraine, is the 6th most read physics paper out of more than 3000 published in 2017 in the nature publishing group journal, "scientific reports," making the  top 100 most read papers in physics  list. 
 the paper, " global mapping of stratigraphy of an old-master painting using sparsity-based terahertz reflectometry,"  reveals the stratigraphy of the paint layers employed by xviith artist sassoferrato, in an easel painting entitled, “ madonna in preghiera ,” using a novel technique based on the combination of terahertz waves and signal processing. 
 this innovative work has been receiving considerable attention from the 
 international press . 
 the photonics and terahertz group is led by professor david citrin and dr. alexandre locquet. kudos also go to junliang dong, then doctoral student, for his hard work, and also to the 
 musée de la cour d'or 
 in metz, for lending the painting.
