 the georgia manufacturing extension partnership (gamep) at georgia tech has launched a new program to help manufacturers boost their competitiveness by implementing energy management best practices in iso 50001. 
 a 12-month effort, the southeast mep energy management program is being funded with a grant from the u.s. department of commerce’s national institute of standards and technology (nist) manufacturing extension partnership (mep). 
 “the program aims to help companies in the southeast accelerate their energy and cost savings and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by incorporating best practices as outlined by iso 50001,” said bill meffert, the gamep’s group manager for energy and sustainability projects. 
 the iso 50001 energy management system — an international standard in which the gamep had a role in developing when first drafted in 2011 and its 2018 revisions — provides business and industry with an energy performance improvement framework. 
 “that’s the focus of the iso 50001 training and coaching. we’re assisting companies in their efforts to bring energy costs under control and make smart energy usage part of their daily processes,” meffert said. 
 participants in the southeast mep energy management program will take a series of classes and webinar sessions, and receive on-site coaching over a 12-month period. completing the program allows them to be certified by the u.s. department of energy as 50001 ready by showing they’ve implemented the standard into their operations. they can also take an additional step to become certified, meffert said. 
 the class for the first cohort launches in early 2019 and applications are being accepted at this link :  https: / / gamep.org / southeast-energy-management-program / . 
 the federal grant covers most of the cost for the training, but participating companies will pay about 25 percent of that. as part of the grant, the gamep will partner with meps in tennessee, north carolina, south carolina, alabama, and texas. those sister meps will find clients in those states to work with them to implement the iso 50001 management system. 
 “for many companies, energy use is a critical component of their ability to maintain a competitive edge,” meffert said. 
 a medium- to large-sized company with 250 employees or more could spend more than $1 million a year on energy, including electricity, natural gas, fuel, and water. 
 “what we see with the companies that we’ve worked with to adopt the iso standard in the past is that they achieve energy performance improvements that go beyond the typical approaches,” he said. “roughly 70 percent of the savings achieved are through operational controls and behavior change.” 
 since the iso standard’s adoption in 2011, the gamep has helped more than 70 facilities in north america to implement iso 50001, with most becoming certified, including nine in the southeast. 
 “this energy management system is applicable to a whole host of industries from textiles and floor coverings to food and beverage to automotive manufacturing,” meffert said. “one of the reasons we sought to get more companies in the southeast to adopt this energy standard is because we have such a strong manufacturing presence in all of these sectors. 
 “incorporating these standards and changing processes for energy usage can really make a difference to the bottom line, while also helping companies meet their competitiveness and sustainability objectives,” meffert said.
