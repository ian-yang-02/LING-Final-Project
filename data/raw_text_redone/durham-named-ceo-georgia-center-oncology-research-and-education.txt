 lynn durham, vice president for institute relations, has been named president and ceo of georgia center for oncology research and education (georgia core). she will depart georgia tech following 25 years of service. 
 after joining tech in 1995 to lead the legislative advocacy program, durham went on to serve under three tech presidents. in 2006, she joined the office of the president under then-president g. wayne clough. in 2010, durham was named chief of staff to then-president g.p. “bud” peterson and a member of the president’s cabinet. in 2018, durham was appointed as a member of the executive leadership team. in 2019, she was named vice president for institute relations by president ángel cabrera. 
 “we celebrate lynn and wish her all the best in her new role at georgia core,” said president cabrera. “her tremendous contributions to tech over the past 25 years leave an undeniable mark on the institution and, for that, we are incredibly grateful.” 
 during her tenure, durham proudly taught gt 1000 for seven years and was instrumental in the campus effort to bring then-president barack obama to campus in 2015. she also played pivotal leadership roles in campuswide well-being initiatives, serving as co-chair of the mental health task force in 2013 and the sexual violence prevention task force in 2014. additionally, she provided direction and day-to-day oversight of the path forward together effort, working with groups of faculty, staff, and students to identify and make improvements for the campus community. while at tech, she completed the doctor of education (ed.d.) in higher education management from the university of georgia.
