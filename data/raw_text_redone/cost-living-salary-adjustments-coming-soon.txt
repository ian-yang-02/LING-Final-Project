 in the wake of very challenging times for many in the campus community, there is good news to share. in april, eligible georgia tech employees will begin receiving a $5,000 cost of living adjustment (cola) recently approved by governor brian kemp and state legislators. 
 the majority of pay adjustments will be completed in april, but there are many unique situations, such as mid-year hires, job changes, and leave statuses, that will require manual pay adjustments into may. 
 "we are very appreciative to governor kemp, the general assembly, and the state of georgia for the continued investment in state employees, including those within the university system of georgia. the increase provides recognition for the talented individuals who continue to work tirelessly at tech and at our sister institutions across georgia,” said georgia tech president ángel cabrera. “the recent action is also a welcome addition to the investments georgia tech has made as an institute, including $13.9 million committed to market and equity adjustments to date for this fiscal year that included an increase of the minimum wage to $15 per hour. overall, these adjustments show a continued commitment to our employees’ well-being, which includes financial wellness, and are an extension of the values set forth in our strategic plan.”
