 “dr. kaminsky’s international focus puts him squarely within our strategic plans for expanding georgia tech’s global footprint,” said ivan allen college dean jacqueline j. royster. “his international profile in the world of poetry and his multi-dimensional experience working and teaching poetry within a technological context hold the promise not only of sustaining the momentum of poetry@tech, but also of creating the next vanguard for poetry within the 21st century technological university.” 
 dr. kaminsky will begin at georgia tech on august 1, 2018. 
 royster added, “we are thrilled to have him with us as he continues his remarkable record as a poet, and as we carry forward georgia tech’s trajectory as a place for excellence in poetry, for the articulation of its relevance and importance in our contemporary world, and for how poetry can be taught in our technological age.”
