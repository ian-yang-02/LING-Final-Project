 georgia tech graduate kelsey watkins will be turning heads at commencement with a unique and eye-catching graduation dress. watkins, who studied economics and industrial design at tech, created a dress entirely out of vintage georgia tech ties. the ties were sourced from various places, including family and friends, as well as thrift stores and online marketplaces like ebay. 
 one particularly special tie featured iconic graphics of georgia tech's tech tower, the official seal, and the ramblin' wreck. watkins says she received help from her grandmother in creating the dress and is especially proud that her family has shared in the special moment. 
 watkins took her graduation photos in her homemade design, but it may have also brought her some extra luck. she recently accepted a full-time offer from delta airlines, but her connection to georgia tech won't end there. watkins plans to pursue a master's degree in analytics while starting her career. 
 watkins' tie dress is a testament to the creativity and innovation that many georgia tech graduates will carry with them along with their degrees. she says it's a unique and memorable way to celebrate her time at tech and the connections she's made here.
