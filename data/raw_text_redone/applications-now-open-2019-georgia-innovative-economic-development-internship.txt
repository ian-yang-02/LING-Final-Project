 are you a georgia tech graduate student interested in pursuing your own research opportunity that links science, technology, and innovation to economic development? 
 the science, technology, and innovation policy (stip) program at georgia tech is now accepting applications for the 2019 georgia innovative economic development internship program. (for details and requirements, apply here:  stip.gatech.edu / apply / ). 
 the highly competitive, 10-week, paid internship is designed to allow graduate students to further develop and pursue research in an innovative economic development project. at the end of the internship period, interns, who will receive a $6,000 stipend, will have an opportunity to present their project findings to economic development and innovation groups. 
 applications will be accepted through feb. 28, 2019 and the internship is open to any graduate student who has completed the first year of a two-year master’s program or enrolled in a doctoral program at a public university in the university system of georgia. 
 those accepted into the program will be notified by the end of march 2019. 
 stip is a globally recognized program that conducts research-based policy analyses and reports of innovation policy, science, and technology for organizations and governments domestically and internationally. 
 “students can delve deeply into their research and apply that analysis and study to real-world challenges,” said jan youtie, stip program director. 
 “this is an excellent opportunity for enterprising students who want to explore how their own ideas can have an impact on any number of subject areas ranging from strategic or emerging technologies and economic modeling, to research commercialization and sustainability.” 
 former interns, such as mirit friedman, a graduate student pursuing a master’s degree in city and regional planning at georgia tech’s school of city & regional planning, say the experience is a rewarding one. 
 her research explored ways the atlanta community food bank could activate its vast partnership network in new ways to better support its clients’ economic mobility. 
 “i was able to explore my research interests under the guidance of economic development experts and restricting the research to the summer period forced me to focus on an initial research question i could test and explore in the short period,” friedman said, adding the program’s pace and structure was invaluable. 
 “we had to develop our research substantially each week and being held to that pace of research development helped prepare me for the demanding deadlines the workforce expects,” she said. “additionally, having my research be pushed in directions i hadn't anticipated required me to respond to and explore new ideas that ultimately helped me hone in on a more explicit research topic.” 
 supraja sudharsan, a doctoral candidate studying comparative urban governance in tech’s sam nunn school of international affairs, echoed friedman’s sentiments. 
 “i evaluated the smart city projects that have been piloted, underway or completed in three cities in atlanta, austin, and pittsburgh,” she said. “by comparatively studying their plans, initiatives, associated partnerships, and the organizational process involved in their development and implementation, the study served to look beyond the hype of smart cities to understand how cities develop and implement smart city projects. 
 “the program provided exposure to organizational processes within city government organizations and the challenge of effecting change, which is an area of interest in my doctoral research.”
