 research institutions such as georgia tech are already key players in efforts to prevent athletic injuries and shorten recovery time once an injury does occur, president g.p. “bud” peterson said in  a message about the competition . 
 lessons learned from research also have application in other fields, such as pediatric medicine and our military’s efforts to keep service members safe and healthy, he said. 
 “yellow jacket fans love our sports teams, and the opportunity to partner with the nfl to advance collaborative innovation in athletics, particularly around safety and performance, is one we wholeheartedly endorse,” peterson said. “1st and future’s innovative spirit dovetails with the energy that propels georgia tech’s robust startup culture and spurs the entrepreneurial drive for which the institute is well known.”
