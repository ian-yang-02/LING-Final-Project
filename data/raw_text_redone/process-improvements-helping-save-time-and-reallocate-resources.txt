process improvements helping to save time and reallocate resources 
 positive changes in finance and planning improve the tools and processes used to support the charge for administrative excellence 
 jun 15, 2023 
 since the launch of 
 georgia tech ’s 
 s trategic 
 p lan , 
 many positive changes 
 have occurred 
 across the finance and planning 
 (f&p) 
 landscape 
 and 
 have led to improvements to the 
 administrative 
 tools and 
 processes 
 used to support the charge for administrative excellence , or 
 adminx . 
 “departments within finance and planning have made a concerted and collective effort to streamline processes that 
 affe ct the entire georgia tech community,” said jim fortner, vice president for finance and planning and interim chief financial officer. “we are thrilled to see 
 the commitment to continuous improvement and the way 
 these departments have 
 worked to identify and address 
 these business needs .” 
 the office of the bursar was one of the 
 first 
 departments in f&p to adopt process 
 improvement s 
 in alignment with 
 t he 
 adminx 
 initiative . 
 one recent example is the implementation of 
 the 
 flywire banner kit 
 that 
 help s 
 international students 
 wire 
 funds 
 to 
 georgia tech . 
 this 
 automate d process of 
 posting funds to the student’s account 
 eliminates 
 the need for 
 manual 
 data 
 entr y 
 and 
 has shortened the 
 processing tim e 
 by two days 
 — 
 saving more than 
 800 hours 
 a year . 
 this 
 has enabled 
 staff 
 to focus 
 on other student payment support activities , 
 including refunding credit balances on 
 student 
 accounts 
 within 24 hours . 
 procurement and business services 
 (pbs) 
 has 
 also made 
 substantial changes . 
 earlier this year, 
 in partnership with the office of information technology (oit), 
 they deployed robotic process automation 
 for several processes, including one to help reduce the number of supplier invoices for which payment is held due to missing receipts . this ended up saving 
 more than 
 600 
 hours 
 per month , and those hours have 
 now 
 been 
 reallocated to 
 providing 
 ca m pus services and addressing more complex purchasing is sues . 
 additionally, t he pbs team 
 updat ed the purchasing process by 
 identify ing 
 opportunities to 
 expand the types of items available for purchase 
 in 
 amazon, staples, and other 
 authorized 
 catalogs . 
 these 
 purchases 
 are typically low er -cost and 
 require fewe r approvals, 
 which makes 
 purchasing 
 easier and faster . 
 also 
 i n partnership with 
 oit , 
 the 
 office of 
 institute budget planning and admin istration 
 is planning to 
 deploy 
 workday adaptive planning 
 in the fall . 
 workday is a 
 reporting , 
 forecasting , 
 and analytics tool 
 that 
 will 
 enable the institute to seamlessly compile data from multiple sources to inform business decisions and 
 further 
 support the institute’s new budget model. 
 looking ahead, the georgia tech community can expect to see continued improvements and innovations to the administrative processes 
 from f&p 
 in support of the 
 adminx 
 initiative.
