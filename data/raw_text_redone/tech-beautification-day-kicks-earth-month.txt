 mar 27, 2023 
 organized by the undergraduate student government association in collaboration with greek week, tech beautification day returns in full force this saturday, april 1. the event was scaled back in recent years due to the pandemic, but this year, plans are on track to offer a full slate of projects focused on improving the campus landscape — and the campus community is invited to participate. 
 georgia tech’s landscape services collaborates with student leaders to develop projects that have a big impact yet are easily completed in a few hours. this year’s opportunities range from planting wildflowers, shrubs, and trees to laying sod, pulling weeds, and spreading pine straw. 
 the event begins with breakfast and a welcome by student leaders. groups of eight to 10 volunteers are then given tools and gloves and directed to the various worksites across campus. one ambitious goal this year is to plant 200 native azaleas. 
 “our department enjoys working with the students not only because we are able to get a lot of work done in a short amount of time, but it also gives students a small window into the hard work our teams do daily,” says interim associate director of landscape services neil fuller. “students also gain a sense of pride when they can look at a completed job and say they did it.  and it gives the students a chance to make their mark on campus and be able to come back and point out a specific plant or tree and tell their family how they planted it years ago.” 
 tech beautification day has a long history of engaging students, faculty, staff, and family members on a spring saturday. campus archives reveal that during one event more than 1,000 volunteers worked together to beautify campus. additionally, photographs from 2012 show the entire football team, along with coaches and families, participating. organizers are working toward increasing participation to pre-pandemic numbers, and this year is just the beginning. sign up now to spend a morning making the georgia tech campus even more beautiful than it already is.
