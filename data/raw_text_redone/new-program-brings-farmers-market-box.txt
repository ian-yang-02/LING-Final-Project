 georgia tech is always looking for new and innovate ways to add resources for the health and well-being of students and employees. this semester, campus sustainability has teamed up with 
 rise ’n’ shine , which works with local georgia farms growing organic food, to offer a weekly fresh produce box to the campus community. 
 this is a restart of the previous campus farm share program, with new benefits and a new provider. while produce is always an option, rise ’n’ shine also provides pasta, cheese, and milk through its partners. boxes start at $30 a week, and people can choose the amount of food they buy. every thursday, customers will receive an email of the food they are set to receive along with other products at similar prices. you can also choose the frequency of box delivery – weekly, biweekly, or less often. box delivery can be put on hold at any time to ensure you are not paying for food when you are off campus. 
 this program is intended to connect members of tech to the greater atlanta area and provide them with fresh, healthy food. all of the food is sustainably produced, and people can share boxes with friends while expanding their horizons by trying new types of produce. every tuesday, their box will be delivered to the kendeda building for innovative sustainable design for easy pickup. ordering is open now — learn more at
