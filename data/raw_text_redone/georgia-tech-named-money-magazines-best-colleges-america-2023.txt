 cites georgia tech’s quality, affordability, and outcomes in awarding the institute a 5-star rating. 
 this year, the personal finance brand and website, formerly a monthly publication, revamped its college ranking system into a 
 star-tier list , naming georgia tech one of 34 institutions nationwide to its new 5-star category. instead of ranking institutions from highest performing to lowest, 
 money 
 gave colleges and universities a rating between 2 1 / 2 and 5 stars. 
 money 
 praised the institute , saying, “georgia tech gets results: the school has a graduation rate of 89%, and students go on to earn median salaries of around $96,000 a decade after enrolling, according to the federal college scorecard.” 
 to compile the ratings, 
 money 
 evaluated 736 institutions on 26 factors that span three categories: quality, affordability, and outcomes. the new approach is intended to offer a better window into the variety and diversity of high-value colleges and universities across the country. 
 the rating is a continuation of georgia tech’s reputation for being a good return on investment. last month, the princeton review ranked tech as the no. 1 best value public university in the country. in its 
 “best value colleges for 2023” 
 report, the educational services company ranked a total of 209 schools, 74 of which were public institutions.
