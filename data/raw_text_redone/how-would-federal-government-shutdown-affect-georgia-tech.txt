how would a federal government shutdown affect georgia tech? 
 as a result of proactive financial planning, most institute operations would not be immediately affected. the longer a shutdown lasts, the greater the likelihood that operational changes would be necessary.

 the united states government is rapidly approaching its sept. 30 deadline to reach an agreement on federal spending for the next fiscal year, which begins october 1. if an agreement is not reached by the deadline, it will result in a government shutdown, which will affect many programs, including the federal contracting work performed by georgia tech. 
 “currently, georgia tech receives approximately $85 million per month of federal funding for research activities,” said jim fortner, vice president for finance and planning and interim chief financial officer. “if there is a prolonged federal government shutdown, we would most likely need to slow down some research, reduce our subcontracting, and potentially delay some projects or activities.” 
 in preparation for this possibility, georgia tech assembled a working group to assess the potential impact and develop mitigation strategies to help ensure business continuity in the event of a federal government shutdown. more information will be provided as it becomes available.
