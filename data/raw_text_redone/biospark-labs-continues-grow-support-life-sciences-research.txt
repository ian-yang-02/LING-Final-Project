 developed and managed by georgia advanced technology ventures inc., an affiliate of the georgia institute of technology, biospark labs is helping to advance the life sciences ecosystem in atlanta. strategically located in the science square district adjacent to georgia tech’s main campus in atlanta, biospark labs is already home to several bioscience startups, including arnav biotech, exvade bioscience, synthbiome, and karnelian x, an innovator in cancer treatment with significant expansion plans. microelectronics startup saras micro devices also occupies space in biospark labs. 
 “the biospark labs space is truly tailored to support early-stage companies that need turnkey laboratory amenities for their operations,” said tony zivalich, associate vice president for real estate development. “in addition to its flex-use configuration, it is attractive lab space because of its location in the science square district and proximity to georgia tech — and to some of the brightest minds in life sciences research right here in atlanta.” 
 as a bonus, companies moving into science square — a designated federal opportunity zone — may benefit from this program, which is designed to provide tax benefits for long-term investors in the district. 
 zivalich added that the science square district is just getting started. phase one, which includes the science square labs building, the apartment community, and a new parking deck, are all on schedule to be completed in march 2024. you can learn more about it here
