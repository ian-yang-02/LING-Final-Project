researchers create first functional semiconductor made from graphene 
 the technology could allow for smaller and faster devices and may have applications for quantum computing. 
 jan 03, 2024 
 researchers at the georgia institute of technology have created the world’s first functional semiconductor made from graphene, a single sheet of carbon atoms held together by the strongest bonds known. semiconductors, which are materials that conduct electricity under specific conditions, are foundational components of electronic devices. the team’s breakthrough throws open the door to a new way of doing electronics. 
 their discovery comes at a time when silicon, the material from which nearly all modern electronics are made, is reaching its limit in the face of increasingly faster computing and smaller electronic devices.  walter de heer , regents’ professor of  physics  at georgia tech, led a team of researchers based in atlanta, georgia, and tianjin, china, to produce a graphene semiconductor that is compatible with conventional microelectronics processing methods — a necessity for any viable alternative to silicon.
