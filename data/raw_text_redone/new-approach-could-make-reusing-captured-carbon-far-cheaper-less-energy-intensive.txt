new approach could make reusing captured carbon far cheaper, less energy-intensive 
 a team led by marta hatzell designed a new electrochemical reactor to seamlessly integrate into direct air capture systems and turn co2 into useful raw materials.

 engineers at georgia tech have designed a process that converts carbon dioxide removed from the air into useful raw material that could be used for new plastics, chemicals, or fuels. their approach dramatically reduces the cost and energy required for these direct air capture (dac) systems, helping improve the economics of a process the researchers said will be critical to addressing climate change. the key is a new kind of catalyst and electrochemical reactor design that can be easily integrated into existing dac systems to produce useful carbon monoxide (co) gas. itâ€™s one of the most efficient such design ever described in scientific literature, according to lead researcher 
 marta hatzell 
 and her team.
