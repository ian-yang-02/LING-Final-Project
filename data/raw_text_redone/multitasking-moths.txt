 it’s difficult enough to see things in the dark, but what if you also had to hover in midair while tracking a flower moving in the wind? that's the challenge the hummingbird-sized hawkmoth must overcome while feeding on the nectar of its favorite flowers. using high-speed infrared cameras and 3-d-printed robotic flowers, scientists have now learned how this insect juggles these complex sensing and control challenges — all while adjusting to changing light conditions.  what the researchers have discovered could help the next generation of small flying robots operate efficiently under a broad range of lighting conditions.  read more about this fascinating study in the
