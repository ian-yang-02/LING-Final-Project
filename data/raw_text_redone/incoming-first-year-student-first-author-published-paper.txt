 undergraduate engineering students interested in research typically enroll at georgia tech with an eye on joining a lab within its eight schools. their long-term goal is to write and submit a study, hoping for an eventual publication in a peer-reviewed journal. 
 rohan datta, however, reversed the usual timeline. the 18-year-old recently graduated from the galloway school in atlanta. by the time he attends his first classes on campus this fall as a stamps scholar, datta will already have a published paper on his resume. 
 with guidance from and collaboration with both a professor and an alumna of the  school of materials science and engineering  (mse), datta is the first author on a recently published study in the  journal of chemical physics . in the paper, “ conductivity prediction model for ionic liquids using machine learning ,” datta describes his construction of a deep neural network capable of making rapid and accurate predictions of the conductivity of ionic liquids. 
 datta’s publication marks a fitting conclusion to high school while serving as the next phase of his georgia tech experience. read the entire story .
