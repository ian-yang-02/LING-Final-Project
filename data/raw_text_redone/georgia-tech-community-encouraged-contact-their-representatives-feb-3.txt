 on wednesday, feb. 3, the student government association (sga) is asking members of the georgia tech community to contact their elected officials and talk about what’s important to them. the daylong event, called 
 ring your rep , is being hosted by sga’s government relations committee. 
 despite what the name suggests, ring your rep isn’t just about making phone calls. participants can also email, fill out a contact form online, or reach out any other way that their representatives are accessible. the committee encourages people to talk to any and all of their representatives (local, state, or federal) about issues that matter to them. many offices will have staff members specifically dedicated to logging constituent opinions and passing them up to the elected official. 
 “we saw exciting student participation in the november and january elections, but it’s important to remind students that civic engagement doesn’t stop at elections,” said kate cullen, co-chair of the government relations committee. “being an engaged citizen means learning to advocate for causes you are passionate about, that affect you.”

 “your representatives depend on your input to effectively represent your interests,” said samuel ellis, sga’s vice president of external affairs. “i hope that students leave this event feeling empowered to contact their representatives and make calling politicians a part of their habits as involved citizens.”
