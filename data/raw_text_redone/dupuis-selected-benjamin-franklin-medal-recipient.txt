 russell dupuis has been named as a co-recipient of the 2022 benjamin franklin medal in electrical engineering. he and his fellow laureates will be honored for their achievements during the franklin institute awards week, to be held may 2-5, 2022 in philadelphia, pennsylvania. 
 now in its 197th year, the franklin institute awards program pays tribute to its namesake and america’s first citizen scientist, benjamin franklin, by honoring 13 individuals for their extraordinary achievements in science, engineering, and business leadership. this awards program is the oldest comprehensive science and technology awards program in the united states and has recognized more than 2,000 of the most pioneering scientists, engineers, inventors, and innovators from across the globe. 
 dupuis is being honored for pioneering the technology known as mocvd (metalorganic chemical vapor deposition). this technology provides the materials quality and ultra-precision required for many device components central to modern life, including leds, transistors, lasers, and high-performance solar cells. 
 his contributions to the development of mocvd are among the most significant contributions made in the growth of semiconductor devices in the last 40 years. his work on the understanding and improvement of the mocvd process was the key development that led to the demonstration of the first mocvd-grown iii-v compound semiconductor heterostructure solar cells, injection lasers, the first cw room-temperature quantum-well lasers grown by any materials technology, and the demonstration of high-reliability mocvd lasers. these important achievements have had a great impact on the efficient use of energy in the world. 
 dupuis has been a faculty member in the school of electrical and computer engineering (ece) at georgia tech since 2003. he holds the steve w. chaddick endowed chair in electro-optics and is a georgia research alliance eminent scholar. dupuis also leads the center for compound semiconductors. prior to his arrival at tech, he was a chaired professor at the university of texas at austin and worked at texas instruments, rockwell international, and at&t bell laboratories. 
 dupuis has received several major honors in the last six years. earlier this year, he and four of his colleagues were awarded the 2021 queen elizabeth prize in engineering for the creation and development of led lighting. in 2019, dupuis was honored with the  materials today  innovation award for his development of the mocvd technology and seminal contributions to compound semiconductor materials and devices. in 2015, he was one of five pioneers to receive the draper prize for engineering in recognition of the significant benefit to society created by the initial development and commercialization of led technologies. 
 dupuis has also been recognized with the ieee edison medal and as a fellow of the ieee, osa, the american physical society, and the american association for the advancement of science.
