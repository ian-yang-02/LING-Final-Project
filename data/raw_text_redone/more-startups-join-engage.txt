 eight additional technology startups will go through an early-stage venture fund created by georgia tech and 10 leading global corporations. 
 the engage ventures growth program differs from other accelerators in that it targets later stage companies and helps them develop and execute go-to-market strategies.

 half of the startups have georgia tech connections. three are current portfolio companies in georgia tech’s 
 advanced technology development center 
 (atdc) and a fourth participated in 
 create-x , a series of entrepreneurship programs for undergraduate students.
