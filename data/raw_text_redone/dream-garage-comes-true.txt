 with the new reck garage, officially unveiled this spring next to the john lewis student center, georgia tech's iconic mascot will always have a prime parking spot in the heart of campus. 
 the garage includes a fully functioning repair station with a lift, work benches, plenty of storage for tools, an outdoor car wash station, and dual entrances, making the space as functional as it is stylish. the crowning design piece though is a spinning turntable that allows for 360-degree views of the vintage car. when it's not rambling though campus sounding its distinctive horn, the ramblin' wreck can now be enjoyed almost 24 / 7 by its most loyal fans—students. 
 "in the reck club, we always say that the wreck belongs to the student body; it's a representation of students," says omar khan, the new 2023 driver. "but there's always been some distance because we had to keep its location secret. this is a special moment to see it find a permanent home right here in the middle of campus."
