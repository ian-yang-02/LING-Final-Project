 with rising costs affecting everything from food to gasoline, many may be asking the question: is seeking a higher education worth the price? 
 a recent effort involving the university system of georgia (usg) partnering with the u.s. census bureau on a project called post-secondary employment outcomes (pseo) helps answer that question affirmatively. the project, which provides national employment outcomes for usg graduates that has been published on the 
 pseo explorer website , indicates that georgia tech stands out as a particularly advantageous financial decision. georgia tech had the highest earnings of all usg colleges for baccalaureate graduates at one ($43,579), five ($61,200), and 10 years ($74,633) after graduation. 
 “we are proud that tech consistently provides an excellent return on investment for our students and their families,” said president ángel cabrera. “the returns are equally valuable for the economy of the state, as many of our talented students begin their careers in georgia. in fact, 54% of our baccalaureate graduates still work in the state five years after graduating.” 
 computer and information services graduates had the highest average salaries at $73,936 one year after graduation, $94,314 five years after graduation, and $124,663 10 years after graduation. 
 georgia tech also rose to the top in the roi realm in february when georgetown university shared 
 data 
 from the college scorecard on 4,500 colleges and universities to compare net present value (npv). the npv calculation considers costs, future salaries, investing, and earning a specific amount of money. tech ranked highest among public universities in georgia for 20-year npv, at $958,000, and it ranked no. 20 at the 20-year mark out of all 4,500 schools listed, placing it solidly as one of the best choices for npv in the country.

 “we are fortunate to find ourselves growing, hitting records in both enrollment and applications,” said cabrera. “thanks to state investments, enrollment growth and fiscal prudence, we are able to offer a growing number of excellent students an affordable education with one of the best values in higher education.”
