 invention is a heads-up-display 
 that attaches to a firefighter’s mask and measures heart rate, respiratory rate, blood oxygen level, body temperature, external temperature and other vital signs. this information will help firefighters determine whether they are overexerting themselves and are at risk for cardiac arrest. the device also transmits data to the incident commander on the scene, who can view it on a computer through an app.
