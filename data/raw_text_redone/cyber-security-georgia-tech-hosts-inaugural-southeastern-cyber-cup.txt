 community 
 responsibility – a responsibility that’s not the job of just one person,” said chief information security officer leo howell. “teams got the chance to learn how to spot 
 web vulnerabilities and participate in various exercises on topics such as cryptography, forensic investigations, and incident response," continued howell. "next year, the competition will be bigger and better!”
