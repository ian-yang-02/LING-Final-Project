 sustainable development goals action and awareness week 2023 
 is march 6 – 10. the campus community is invited to participate in a variety of events that increase awareness of and encourage actions that advance the 
 17 united nations sustainable development goals 
 (sdgs). 
 the sdgs were adopted by the un general assembly in 2015 as part of the 2030 agenda for sustainable development. they address the world’s most monumental challenges, including poverty, inequality, climate change, environmental degradation, and peace and justice. some of the objectives are improved industry, innovation, and infrastructure; affordable and clean energy; and sustainable cities and communities. the sdgs appear by name in the 
 institute’s strategic plan 
 as long-term goals that should guide teaching, research, and operations. 
 sdg action and awareness week 2023 will focus primarily on sdg13: climate action and intersecting sdgs. georgia tech strives to be a leader in climate action across the institute in operations, education, research, and economic development, and the development of a comprehensive climate action plan is underway. president ángel cabrera encourages the tech community to participate in virtual and in-person climate action events throughout the week. 
 on thursday, march 9, at 8:30 a.m., cabrera will convene a panel of faculty to discuss climate action. joining him will be: marilyn brown, regents’ professor and the brook byers professor of sustainable systems in the school of public policy; andrea calmon, assistant professor in the scheller college of business and faculty fellow in the brook byers institute for sustainable systems; tim liewen, regents’ professor, david s. lewis chair, and executive director of the strategic energy institute; and brian stone, professor in the school of city and regional planning and director of the urban climate lab. 
 the panel is a hybrid event, with remote or in-person participation (at the scholars event network theater in price gilbert library).
