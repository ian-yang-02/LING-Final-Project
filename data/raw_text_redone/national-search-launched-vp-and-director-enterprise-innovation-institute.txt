 “i feel very fortunate for such a diverse and challenging career and to have shared so many good years with the georgia tech family, and i am very appreciative of the many faculty, staff and students who have made my time at georgia tech so interesting and inspiring,” 
 downing 
 said. “although i am leaving my full-time duties, i look forward to staying connected to georgia tech and supporting its mission of progress and service.”

 manufacturing extension partnership , and supports startup companies through the 
 advanced technology development center . other ei2 programs help faculty members commercialize technology developed in georgia tech labs, serve minority businesses, support economic development activities, and provide a connection to georgia tech’s talent and resources.
