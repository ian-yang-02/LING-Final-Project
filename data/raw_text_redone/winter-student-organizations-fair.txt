 studies have shown that students who are involved on campus have higher success in the classroom and post graduation, and are ultimately more satisfied with their undergraduate experience than peers who aren’t involved in an organization or other activity outside the classroom. 
 it can be overwhelming to get started. here are a few tips for students about getting involved and participating in the winter org fair: 
 try something new. college is all about new experiences. with hundreds of organizations on campus, you can step out of your comfort zone and join something you may not have previously tried. 
 don’t overwhelm yourself. don’t try to join every single organization you come across. find the ones that you are genuinely passionate about and go from there. 
 it’s never too late to get involved. you don’t have to be in your first year or first semester to get involved. if you didn’t get as involved your first couple years at tech, jump in now. 
 it doesn’t have to be hard. be adventurous — go to the org fair, go to open club meetings, and use the resources that tech provides. if you need support finding a place to start, you can always reach out to the 
 center for student engagement 
 for advice.
