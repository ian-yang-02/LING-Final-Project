 on june 19, 1865 — more than two years after the emancipation proclamation — union general gordon granger issued general order no. 3, which communicated news of the executive order to texas and freed the remaining enslaved people in the state. this date became known as juneteenth. 
 each year on juneteenth, african american, black, and indigenous communities hold commemorations to honor those who suffered and survived the bonds of enslavement. it also serves as a reminder of the contributions of these communities to the nation.
