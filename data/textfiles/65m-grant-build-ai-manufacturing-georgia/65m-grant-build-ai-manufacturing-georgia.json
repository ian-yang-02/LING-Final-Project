In his cover letter, he promised \u201cto establish the Georgia Institute of Technology as a world leader in additive manufacturing of solid materials (ceramics & metals) R&D, especially in the fusion of data sciences and AI to create new, world-leading technologies.\u201d\nStebner thought it would take 10-15 years of incremental steps and funding to achieve the goal. He was wrong.\nThanks to a new\u00a0 $65 million grant from the U.S. Department of Commerce\u2019s Economic Development Administration , announced by President Joe Biden,\u00a0 Stebner\u2019s plan will begin to become a reality \u00a0\u2014 and include the entire state of Georgia and all of its manufacturing sectors from agriculture to airplanes \u2014 two years after arriving on campus.\nThe largest of the nine projects within the larger Georgia AI Manufacturing (GA-AIM) technology corridor grant will allow Stebner and Georgia Tech to transform the\u00a0 Advanced Manufacturing Pilot Facility (AMPF) \u00a0into the Artificial Intelligence Manufacturing Pilot Facility (AI-MPF). The 24,000 square-foot facility on 14th Street will more than double in size after Georgia Tech and statewide GA-AIM partners were selected as one of 21 Phase II awardees in the $1 billion\u00a0 Build Back Better Regional Challenge \u00a0(BBB) competition, part of the\u00a0 Investing in America\u2019s Communities \u00a0initiative under the\u00a0 American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 .\nAMPF has been a shell waiting for a vision like Build Back Better to fill it out,\u201d said Stebner, associate professor the\u00a0 George W. Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering \u00a0and the\u00a0 School of Materials Science and Engineering . \u201cNow we will transform the facility into one of the nation\u2019s first manufacturing labs designed for autonomy with the goal of helping the state and the nation to be world AI manufacturing leaders.\u201d Read the entire story\non\u00a0the College of Engineering website.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nJason Maderer\nCollege of Engineering\nmaderer@gatech.edu\nEmail\nmaderer@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
