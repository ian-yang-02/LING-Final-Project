Its FinTech program, launched in 2015, has focused on building and growing FinTech companies in Georgia. Since its launch, the program has evaluated more than 250 startups, has 25 companies in its current portfolio, and produced one unicorn,\u00a0 Greenlight , a 2018 ATDC graduate now valued at more than $2 billion.\nVisa\u2019s financial sponsorship and leadership in the FinTech category will allow for continued growth and startup support for entrepreneurs in the program. As part of the sponsorship, Visa executives will mentor program participants and create connections to maximize opportunities to bring their FinTech innovations to Visa and its partner network.\n\u201cGeorgia is our nation\u2019s FinTech command center and we at ATDC are proud to partner with Visa to continue to drive innovation forward in this sector,\u201d said John Avery, ATDC director. \u201cWe are dedicated to our FinTech ecosystem\u2019s continued growth and success, and ATDC serving as the nexus to entrepreneurs, industry, investors, and Georgia Tech\u2019s resources to help these startups thrive.\u201d\nStartups accepted into the incubator\u2019s program will be integrated into Georgia\u2019s robust FinTech ecosystem, where more than 200 FinTech companies generating $72 billion in annual revenue call home. Over 70 percent of all U.S. financial transactions are handled by payment processing firms headquartered in Georgia.\nATDC has hired\u00a0 Robert E. Daniel \u00a0as the FinTech catalyst who will oversee the vertical, manage the pipeline, and evaluate these startups and their innovations for acceptance into the portfolio.\n\u201cWe view Atlanta as a thriving FinTech community and an epicenter of financial technology expertise where Visa can become an integral part to its continued growth. A partnership with ATDC provides Visa the opportunity to get involved with supporting local startups as the future of payments continues to look bright, thanks to this world of innovative entrepreneurs,\u201d said Patrick Williams, Visa\u2019s head of digital partnerships in North America.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nP\u00e9ralte C.
