The bars, which fold up to the size of a large suitcase with wheels, are designed to accommodate children as young as 15 months and as old as 10.\u00a0The invention is one of six competing for Georgia Tech\u2019s 2017 InVenture Prize.\nIndustrial design majors\u00a0Veronica Young and Nora Johnson invented the device.\nPhoto by Rob Felt.\nMar 14, 2017\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nThe road to the InVenture Prize for Veronica Young and Nora Johnson began with a challenge from a faculty member in the College of Design.\nHe told the two industrial design majors about a problem facing a friend who works as a pediatric physical therapist. She travels to people\u2019s homes to work with their children, but the transportable parallel bars needed for physical therapy were hard to move. Worse, they were designed to work with children only between the ages of 1 and 3.\nYoung and Johnson stepped in and created Gaitway, a set of transportable parallel bars designed for children who need ambulatory physical therapy. The bars, which fold up to the size of a large suitcase with wheels, are designed to accommodate children as young as 15 months and as old as 10.\nThe invention is one of six competing for Georgia Tech\u2019s 2017 InVenture Prize. The annual contest encourages and supports interest in innovation and entrepreneurship by rewarding students with cash prizes for inventions that have the potential to solve the world\u2019s problems. The finale will be held on March 15 at the Ferst Center for the Arts.\nAbout 50,000 children born in the U.S. every year will need ambulatory physical therapy, said Young, who is from McDonough, Ga.\n\u201cEarly intervention is key for these children,\u201d said Johnson, who is from Tampa. \u201cThey need physical therapy every day.\u201d\nThey tested the device with six professionals and two children. The parallel bars are designed to provide support and catch the children if they fall. The bars can sit at waist or chest height, depending on the therapy activities. The device is painted coral and turquoise to make the bars more inviting.\nThey constructed much of the device in Young\u2019s father\u2019s workshop.\n\u201cI learned how to weld to make this,\u201d Young said. \u201cThat\u2019s why this has been such an amazing experience. If there was something that needed to be done and we didn\u2019t know how to do it, we learned how to do it.\u201d\nThe prototype, made out of pine and welded aluminum, weights about 35 pounds.\nThey drew hundreds of sketches and made 10 small-scale versions of the device to determine the adjustable and collapsible nature of the bars.\nThe two, who also work in the Delta Air Lines innovation center in Tech Square, showcased Gaitway this winter during the Capstone Design Expo. They are graduating in May and plan to continue working on the device.\n\u201cWinning InVenture will get us closer to having a new way to help families all over the world,\u201d Young said.\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nGeorgia Tech's InVenture Prize\nContact\nLaura Diamond\nMedia Relations\n404-894-6016\n@LauraRDiamond\nEmail\nlaura.diamond@gatech.edu\nAdditional information\nThe winning InVenture Prize team will take home $20,000 and represent Georgia Tech in the annual ACC InVenture Prize, taking place on campus March 31.\nThe second-place team earns $10,000.\nA $5,000 People\u2019s Choice Award will go to the fans\u2019 favorite invention.
