This award is open to full-time Tech employees teaching credit courses who administer the Course Instructor Opinion Survey (CIOS).\nEach January, 40 to 50 instructors are selected for the award for courses taught the previous calendar year. Winners receive a $1,000 stipend courtesy of the Class of 1940 and Jack and Frances Mundy endowments.\nThe CIOS Award acknowledges instructors with exceptional response rates and scores on the CIOS, emphasizing respect for students, enthusiasm about teaching, and fostering interest in the subject matter. A minimum 85% student response rate is required, and ties are resolved based on response rates.\n\u201cReceiving this award is a great honor, and I\u2019m delighted that students were motivated to learn and tackle some very difficult programming assignments as part of the course,\u201d said Laurie Garrow, professor in the School of Civil and Environmental Engineering. Garrow was selected for the award based on her work in CEE 8813: Special Topics \u2013 Airline Revenue Management. As part of the course, she interviewed over 30 academic and industry representatives, then created a simulation tool for research and teaching. Her work has expanded outside of Georgia Tech and is currently being used by airline practitioners around the world.\nThe distribution of CIOS Awards between small and large classes aligns with the proportion of these classes in the Georgia Tech catalog over the past three years. Nominations are not accepted, and certain categories of employees, such as visiting or part-time faculty, postdoctoral scholars, graduate students, and upper-level administrators, are ineligible; however, part-time faculty will be considered eligible for the 2024 calendar year.\nThe awards underscore Georgia Tech's commitment to excellence in teaching and highlight instructors\u2019 roles in creating a thriving learning environment.\n\u201cWe\u2019re delighted to recognize the exceptional teaching taking place at Georgia Tech,\u201d said Laura Carruth, associate vice provost for Transformative Teaching and Learning and executive director of the Center for Teaching and Learning.\nIn addition to the CIOS Awards, the Center for Teaching and Learning and the Office of Academic Effectiveness also publish\nCIOS Honor Rolls . Instructors who make the honor roll receive a certificate of recognition.\nTo see a full list of the 2023 CIOS Award winners, visit the Center for Teaching and Learning\u2019s\nblog .\nRelated links\nCenter for Teaching and Learning\nCIOS Honor Rolls\nContact\nBethany Harris\nCenter for Teaching and Learning\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
