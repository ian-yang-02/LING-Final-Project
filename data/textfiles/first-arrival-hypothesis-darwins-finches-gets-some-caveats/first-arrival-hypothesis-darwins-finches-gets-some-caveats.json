That is among the conclusions in a new study testing the importance of \u201cfirst arrival\u201d in controlling adaptive radiation of species, a hypothesis famously proposed for \u201cDarwin\u2019s Finches,\u201d birds from the Galapagos Islands that were first brought to scientific attention by the famous naturalist.\nResearchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology tested the importance of first arrival with bacterial species competing in a test tube. Using a bacterium that grows on plant leaves, they confirmed the importance of first arrival for promoting species diversification, and extended that hypothesis with some important caveats.\n\u201cWe wanted to understand the role of species colonization history in regulating the interaction between the rapidly-evolving bacterium\nPseudomonas fluorescens SBW-25\nand competing species and how that affected\nP. fluorescens\nadaptive radiation in the ecosystem,\u201d said Jiaqi Tan, a research scientist in Georgia Tech\u2019s\nSchool of Biological Sciences . \u201cThe general pattern we find is that the earlier arrival of P. fluorescens allowed it to diversify to a greater extent. If the competing and diversifying species are very similar ecologically, we find a stronger effect of species colonization history on adaptive radiation.\u201d\nThe research is reported April 26th in the journal\nEvolution\nand was supported by the National Science Foundation. The study is believed to be the first rigorous experimental test of the role colonization history plays in adaptive radiation.\nEvolutionary biologist David Lack studied a group of closely-related bird species known as Darwin\u2019s Finches, and popularized them in a book first published in 1947. Among his hypotheses was that the birds were successful in their adaptive radiation \u2013 the evolutionary diversification of morphological, physiological and behavior traits \u2013 because they were early colonizers of the islands. The finches filled the available ecological niches, taking advantage of the resources in ways that limited the ability of later-arriving birds to similarly establish themselves and diversify, he suggested.\n\u201cThe bird species that arrived after the finches could only use the resources that the finches weren\u2019t using,\u201d Tan explained. \u201cThe other birds could not diversify because there weren\u2019t many resources left for them.\u201d\nTan and other researchers in the laboratory of Georgia Tech Professor\nLin Jiang\ntested that hypothesis using\nP. fluorescens , which rapidly evolves into two general phenotypes differentiated by the ecological niches they adopt in static test tube microcosms. \u00a0Within the two major phenotypes \u2013 known as \u201cfuzzy spreaders\u201d and \u201cwrinkly spreaders\u201d \u2013 there are additional minor variations.\nThe researchers allowed the bacterium to colonize newly-established microcosms and diversify before introducing competing bacterial species. The six competitors, which varied in their niche and competitive fitness compared to\nP. fluorescens , were introduced individually and allowed to grow through multiple generations. Their success and level of diversification were measured by placing microcosm samples onto agar plates and counting the number of colonies from each species and sub-species.\nThe study also included the reverse of the earlier colonization history, allowing the competitor bacteria to establish themselves in microcosms before introducing the\nP. fluorescens.\nThe competitors included a broad range of organisms common in the environment, some of them retrieved from a lake near the Georgia Tech campus.\nThe experiment allowed the scientists to extend the hypothesis that Lack advanced 70 years ago.\n\u201cIf the diversifying species and the competing species are very similar, you can have a strong priority effect in which the first-arriving species can strongly impact the ability of the later species to diversify,\u201d said Jiang, a professor in Georgia Tech\u2019s School of Biological Sciences. \u201cIf the species are different enough, then the priority effect is weaker, so there would be less support for the first arrival hypothesis.\u201d\nAdaptive radiation has important implications for new ecosystems, particularly with organisms that evolve rapidly.\nP. fluorescens\nproduces as many as ten generations a day under the reported experimental conditions, which allowed the Georgia Tech scientists to study how they evolved over 120 generations \u2013 changes that would have taken hundreds of years in finches.\nThe bacterial population studied in Jiang\u2019s lab included as many as 100 million organisms, far more than the number of birds on the Galapagos Islands. The asexual reproduction of the bacteria meant the mutation rate likely also differed from that of the birds. Still, Jiang and Tan believe their study offers insights into how different species interact in new environments based on historical advantages.\n\u201cFrom the perspective of evolutionary biology, scientists often focus only on the particular species that interest them,\u201d said Jiang, who studies community ecology. \u201cWe also need to think about the surrounding ecological context of the evolutionary process.\u201d\nIn future work Jiang hopes to study how the introduction of predators may combine with species competition to affect adaptive radiation.
