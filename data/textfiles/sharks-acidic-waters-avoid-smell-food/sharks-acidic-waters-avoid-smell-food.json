Elevated carbon dioxide levels impaired the odor-tracking behavior of the smooth dogfish, a shark whose range includes the Atlantic Ocean off the eastern United States. Adult sharks significantly avoided squid odor after swimming in a pool of water treated with carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide concentrations tested are consistent with climate forecasts for midcentury and 2100. The study suggests that predator-prey interactions in nature could be influenced by elevated carbon dioxide concentrations of ocean waters. \u201cThe sharks\u2019 tracking behavior and attacking behavior were significantly reduced,\u201d said\u00a0 Danielle Dixson , an assistant professor in the School of Biology at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta. \u00a0\u201c Sharks are like swimming noses, so chemical cues are really important for them in terms of finding food.\u201d The study is the first time that sharks\u2019 ability to sense the odor of their food has been tested under conditions that simulate the acidity levels expected in the oceans by the turn of the century. The work supports\u00a0 recent research from Dixson \u00a0and other research groups showing that ocean acidification impairs sensory functions and alters the behavior of aquatic organisms. The study was published August 11 the journal\u00a0 Global Change Biology \u00a0and was sponsored by the National Science Foundation (NSF). Carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere is absorbed into ocean waters, where it dissolves and lowers the pH of the water. Acidic waters affect fish behavior by disrupting a specific receptor in the nervous system, called GABA A , which is present in most marine organisms with a nervous system. When GABA A \u00a0stops working, neurons stop firing properly. Dixson\u2019s previous research has shown that fish living on coral reefs where carbon dioxide seeps from the ocean floor were\u00a0 less able to detect predator odor \u00a0than fish from normal coral reefs. Study co-author Philip Munday, from James Cook University in Australia, has shown in previous work that a tiny coral reef predator fish, the dottyback,also loses interest in food in waters that simulate ocean acidification conditions forecast for the future. In the experimental part of the new study, conducted at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute in Cape Cod, Massachusetts, 24 sharks from local waters were studied in a 10-meter-long flume. The flume resembled two lanes of a swimming pool. Odor from a squid was pumped down one lane of the flume, while normal seawater was pumped down the other side. Sharks tend to prefer one side of a tank over the other, so researchers first assessed each sharks\u2019 side preference. Then the research team ran control experiments under normal ocean conditions to ensure that the sharks were tracking the food cue. Under present-day water conditions, sharks adjusted their position in the flume to spend a greater amount of time on the side containing the squid odor plume, regardless of the individual shark\u2019s natural side preference. Next, sharks spent five days in holding pools of three different carbon dioxide concentrations: local water concentration today (405 \u00b1 26microatmospheres \u00a0( \u00b5atms) CO 2 ), projected midcentury concentration (741 \u00b1 22 \u00b5atms CO 2 ),projected concentration for 2100 (1,064 \u00b1 17 \u00b5atms CO 2 ). Sharks were not fed while in the holding pools to ensure they were motivated to track a food odor. The sharks were then released into the flume and their tracking behavior was observed. Sharks from the normal seawater pool and mid-level carbon dioxide pool spent more than 60 percent of their time in the water stream containing the food stimulus. Sharks from the high carbon dioxide pool spent less than 15 percent of their time in the water stream containing the food stimulus. These sharks avoided the odor plume even when it was on the side of the flume that the sharks\u2019 naturally prefer. The food odor stream was pumped through bricks to make the plume flow better and to give the sharks a target to attack. Sharks treated under mid and high CO 2 \u00a0conditions also reduced their attack behavior. \u201cThey significantly reduced their bumps and bites on the bricks compared to the control group,\u201d Dixson said. \u201cIt\u2019s like they\u2019re uninterested in their food.\u201d Exposure to carbon dioxide did not significantly affect the sharks\u2019 overall activity levels. The gill rate of the sharks \u2013 an indicator of heart rate \u2013 held in different water conditions was not significantly different, suggesting that differences in stress to the sharks was not likely affecting the experimental results. Dixson noted that the study was carried out under laboratory conditions and thus does not allow for the full evaluation of the potential effects of ocean acidification on predatory abilities of the smooth dogfish. Live food was not used as the odor cue because sharks can detect prey with their other senses, such as hearing and their ability to detect electrical impulses. By using an odor cue, the researchers were focusing on only the chemical sensing of sharks. Dixson\u2019s future work will explore how sharks\u2019 other senses might be affected by ocean acidification. Sharks are an ancient species, and in the past have adapted to ocean acidification conditions projected for the future. But they\u2019ve never had to adapt to changes happening as quickly as they are today. \u201cIt\u2019s the rate of change that\u2019s happening that\u2019s concerning. Sharks have never had to deal with it this fast,\u201d Dixson said. This research is supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF) under award number NSF-IOS-0843440.
