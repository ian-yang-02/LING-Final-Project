Two earthquakes, one magnitude 7.8 and one magnitude 7.5, occurred nine hours apart, centered near the heavily populated city of Gaziantep. The total rupture lengths of both events were up to 250 miles .\nThe president of Turkey has called it the \u201cdisaster of the century,\u201d and the threat is still not over \u2014 aftershocks could still affect the region.\nNow,\nZhigang Peng , a professor in the\nSchool of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences\nat Georgia Tech and graduate students\nPhuc Mach\nand\nChang Ding ,\nalongside researchers at the Scientific and Technological Research Institution of T\u00fcrkiye (T\u00dcB\u0130TAK) and researchers at the University of Missouri, are using small seismic sensors to better understand just how, why, and when these earthquakes are occurring.\nFunded by an NSF RAPID grant, the project is unique in that it aims to actively respond to the crisis while it\u2019s still happening.\nNational Science Foundation (NSF) Rapid Response Research (RAPID) grants\nare used when there is a severe urgency with regard to availability of or access to data,\nfacilities or specialized equipment, including quick-response research on natural or anthropogenic disasters and other similar unanticipated events.\nIn an effort to better map the aftershocks of the earthquake event \u2014 which can occur weeks or months after the main event \u2014 the team placed approximately 120 small sensors, called nodes, in the East Anatolian fault region this past May. Their deployment continues through the summer.\nIt\u2019s the first time sensors like this have been deployed in Turkey, says Peng.\n\u201cThese sensors are unique in that they can be placed easily and efficiently,\" he explains. \"With internal batteries that can work up to one month when fully charged, they\u2019re buried in the ground and can be deployed within minutes, while most other seismic sensors need solar panels or other power sources and take much longer time and space to deploy.\u201d Each node is about the size of a 2-liter soda bottle, and can measure ground movement in three directions.\n\u201cThe primary reason we\u2019re deploying these sensors quickly following the two mainshocks is to study the physical mechanisms of how earthquakes trigger each,\u201d Peng adds. Mainshocks are the largest earthquake in a sequence. \u201cWe\u2019ll use advanced techniques such as machine learning to detect and locate thousands of small aftershocks recorded by this network. These newly identified events can provide new important clues on how aftershocks evolve in space and time, and what drives foreshocks that occur before large events.\u201d\nUnearthing fault mechanisms\nThe team will also use the detected aftershocks to illuminate active faults where three tectonic plates come together \u2014 a region known as the Mara\u015f Triple Junction. \u201cWe plan to use the aftershock locations and the seismic waves from recorded events to image subsurface structures where large damaging earthquakes occur,\u201d says Mach, the Georgia Tech graduate researcher. This will help scientists better understand why sometimes faults \u2018creep\u2019 without any large events, while in other cases faults lock and then violently release elastic energy, creating powerful earthquakes.\nGetting high-resolution data of the fault structures is another priority. \u201cThe fault line ruptured in the first magnitude 7.8 event has a bend in it, where earthquake activity typically terminates, but the earthquake rupture moved through this bend, which is highly unusual,\u201d Peng says. By deploying additional ultra-dense arrays of sensors in their upcoming trip this summer, the team hopes to help researchers \u2018see\u2019 the bend under the Earth\u2019s surface, allowing them to better understand how fault properties control earthquake rupture propagation.\nThe team also aims to learn more about the relationship between the two main shocks that recently rocked Turkey, sometimes called doublet events. Doublet events can happen when the initial earthquake triggers a secondary earthquake by adding extra stress loading. While in this instance, the doublet may have taken place only 9 hours after the initial event, these secondary earthquakes have been known to take place days, months, or even years after the initial one \u2014 a famous example being the sequence of earthquakes that spanned 60 years in the North Anatolian fault region in Northern Turkey.\n\u201cClearly the two main shocks in 2023 are related, but it is still not clear how to explain the time delays,\u201d says Peng. The team plans to work with their collaborators at T\u00dcB\u0130TAK to re-analyze seismic and other types of geophysical data right before and after those two main shocks in order to better understand the triggering mechanisms.\n\u201cIn our most recent trip in southern T\u00fcrkiye, we saw numerous buildings that were partially damaged during the mainshock, and many people will have to live in temporary shelters for years during the rebuilding process,\u201d Peng adds. \u201cWhile we cannot stop earthquakes from happening in tectonically active regions, we hope that our seismic deployment and subsequent research on earthquake triggering and fault imaging can improve our ability to predict what will happen next \u2014 before and after a big one \u2014 and could save countless lives.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nContact\nWritten By:\nSelena Langner\nMedia Contact:\nJess Hunt-Ralston\nEmail\njess.hunt@cos.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
