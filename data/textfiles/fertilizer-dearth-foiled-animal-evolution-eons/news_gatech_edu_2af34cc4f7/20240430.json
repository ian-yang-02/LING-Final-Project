But the breathable oxygen it likely required wasn\u2019t there, and a lack of simple nutrients may have been to blame.\nThen came a fierce planetary metamorphosis. Roughly 800 million years ago, in the late Proterozoic Eon, phosphorus, a chemical element essential to all life, began to accumulate in shallow ocean zones near coastlines widely considered to be the birthplace of animals and other complex organisms, according to\u00a0 a new study by geoscientists from the Georgia Institute of Technology and Yale University .\nAlong with phosphorus accumulation came an oceanic chemical chain reaction, which included other nutrients, that powered organisms to pump oxygen into the atmosphere and waters. Shortly after that transition, which in geohistorical terms can mean about 100 million years, waves of climate extremes swept the globe,\u00a0 freezing it over twice \u00a0for tens of millions of years each time, a highly regarded theory holds.\nThe elevated availability of nutrients and bolstered oxygen also likely fueled\u00a0 evolution\u2019s greatest lunge forward .\nAfter billions of years, during which life consisted almost entirely of single-celled organisms, animals evolved. At first, they were extremely simple, resembling today\u2019s sponges or jellyfish, but Earth was on its way from being, for eons, a planet less than hospitable to complex life to\u00a0one bursting with it.\nEarth\u2019s true genesis\nIn the last few hundred million years, biodiversity has blossomed, leading to dense jungles and grasslands echoing with animal calls, and waters writhing with every shape of fin and color of scale. And most every stage of development has left its mark on the fossil record.\nThe researchers are careful not to imply that phosphorous necessarily caused the chain reaction, but in sedimentary rock taken from coastal areas, the nutrient has marked the spot where that burst of life and climate change took off. \u201cThe timing is definitely conspicuous,\u201d said Chris Reinhard,\nan assistant professor in Georgia Tech\u2019s School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences .\nReinhard and\nNoah Planavsky, a geochemist from Yale University , who headed up the research together, have mined records of sedimentary rock that formed in ancient coastal zones, going down layer by layer to 3.5 billion years ago, to compute how the cycle of the essential fertilizer phosphorus evolved and how it appeared to play a big part in a veritable genesis.\nThey noticed a remarkable congruency as they moved upward through the layers of shale into the time period where animal life began, in the late Proterozoic Eon.\n\u201cThe most basic change was from very limited phosphorous availability to much higher phosphorus availability in surface waters of the ocean,\u201d Reinhard said. \u201cAnd the transition seemed to occur right around the time that there were very large changes in ocean-atmosphere oxygen levels and just before the emergence of animals.\u201d\nPhosphorus at the beach\nReinhard and Planavsky, together with an international team, have proposed that a scavenging of nutrients in an anoxic (nearly O 2 -free) world stunted photosynthetic organisms that otherwise had been poised for at least two billion years to make stockpiles of oxygen. Then that balanced system was upset and oceanic phosphorus made its way to coastal waters.\nThe scientists published their findings\nin the journal Nature\non Wednesday, December 21, 2016. Their research was funded by the National Science Foundation, the NASA Astrobiology Institute, the Sloan Foundation and the\nJapan Society for the Promotion of Science .\nThe work provides a new view into what factors allowed life to reshape Earth\u2019s atmosphere. It helps lay a foundation that scientists can apply to make predictions about what would allow life to alter exoplanets' atmospheres, and may inspire deeper studies, here on Earth, of how oceanic-atmospheric chemistry drives climate instability and influences the rise and fall of life through the ages.\nCyanobacteria, the mother of O 2\nComplex living things, including animals, usually have an immense metabolism and require ample O 2\nto drive it. The evolution of animals is unthinkable without it.\nThe path to understanding how a nutrient dearth would starve out breathable oxygen production leads back to a very special kind of bacteria called cyanobacteria, the mother of oxygen on Earth.\n\u201cThe only reason we have a well-oxygenated planet we can live on is because of oxygenic photosynthesis,\u201d Planavsky said. \u201cO 2\nis the waste product of photosynthesizing cells, like cyanobacteria, combining CO 2\nand water to build sugars.\u201d\nAnd photosynthesis is an evolutionary singularity, meaning it only evolved once in Earth\u2019s history \u2013 in cyanobacteria.\nSome other biological phenomena evolved repeatedly in dozens or hundreds of unrelated incidences across the ages, such as the\ntransition from single-celled organisms to rudimentary multicellular organisms . \u00a0But scientists are confident that oxygenic photosynthesis evolved only this one time in Earth\u2019s history, only in cyanobacteria, and all plants and other beings on Earth that photosynthesize coopted the development.\nThe iron anchor\nCyanobacteria are credited with filling Earth\u2019s atmosphere with O 2,\nand they\u2019ve been around for 2.5 billion years or more.\nThat begs the question: What took so long? Basic nutrients that fed the bacteria weren\u2019t readily available, the scientist hypothesize. The phosphorus, which Planavsky and Reinhard specifically tracked, was in the ocean for billions of years, too, but it was tied up in the wrong places.\nFor eons, the mineral iron, which once saturated oceans, likely bonded with phosphorous, and sank it down to dark ocean depths, far away from those shallows -- also called continental margins -- where cyanobacteria would have needed it to thrive and make oxygen. Even today, iron is used to treat waters polluted with fertilizer to remove phosphorous by sinking it as deep sediment.\nThe researchers also used a geochemical model to show how a global system with high iron concentration and low phosphorus availability combined with low nitrogen availability in ocean shallows could perpetuate itself in a low-oxygen world.\n\u201cIt looks to have been such a stable planetary system,\u201d Reinhard said. \u201cBut it\u2019s obviously not the planet we live on now, so the question is, how did we transition from this low-oxygen state to where we are now?\u201d\nWhat ultimately caused that change is a question for future research.\nPhosphorus starting pistol\nBut something did change about 800 million years ago, and cyanobacteria and other minute organisms in continental margin ecosystems got more phosphorus, the backbone of DNA and RNA, and a main actor in cell metabolism. The bacteria became more active, reproduced more quickly, ate lots more phosphorus and made loads more O 2 .\n\u201cPhosphorus is not only essential for life,\u201d Planavsky said. \u201cWhat\u2019s implicit in all this is: It can control the amount of life on our planet.\u201d\nWhen the newly multiplied bacteria died, they fell to the floor of those ocean shallows, stacking up layer by layer to decay and enrich the mud with phosphorus. The mud eventually compressed to stone.\n\u201cAs the biomass increased in phosphorus content, the more of it landed in layers of sedimentary rock,\u201d Reinhard said. \u201cTo scientists, that shale is the pages of the sea floor\u2019s history book.\u201d\nScientists have thumbed through them for decades, compiling data. Planavsky and Reinhard analyzed some 15,000 rock records for their study.\n\u201cThe first compilation we had of this was only 600 samples,\u201d Planavsky said. Reinhard added, \u201cBut you could already see it then. The phosphorus jolt was as clear as day. And as the database grew in size, the phenomenon became more entrenched.\u201d\nThat first signal of phosphorus in Earth\u2019s coast shallows pops up in the shale record like a shot from a starting pistol in the race for abundant life.\nThe following people coauthored the study: Benjamin Gill from Virginia Tech, Kazumi Ozaki from the University of Tokyo, Leslie Robbins and Kurt Konhauser from the University of Alberta, Timothy Lyons from the University of California Riverside, Woodward Fischer from the California Institute of Technology, Chunjiang Wang from the University of Petroleum in Beijing, and Devon Cole from Yale University.
