Wilder Associate Professor\nAmeet Pinto , the project's\nprincipal investigator, said disinfection is used to kill microorganisms to make drinking water safe for consumption.\u00a0 Yet, disinfecting to kill microorganisms can also result in formation of harmful disinfection by-products.\n\u201cOur key project goal is to shine a light on when, where, and why pathogens and disinfection by-products occur and co-occur in drinking water systems across the country,\u201d Pinto said. \u201cThis will help water utilities better navigate the tradeoff of managing microbiological and chemical risks in drinking water and thus enhance the reliability of safe drinking water supply to their consumers.\u201d\nAccording to the EPA, opportunistic pathogens such as Legionella\npneumophila ,\nnontuberculous\nmycobacteria, and Pseudomonas\u00a0 aeruginosa\ncan grow in drinking water systems and pose potential risks to public health. The occurrence of these and other microbial pathogens is also associated with contaminated storage facilities and other problems in water distribution systems such as backflow and low-pressure incidents.\nIf left untreated, these contamination events can lead to outbreaks of gastrointestinal, respiratory, and other waterborne illnesses. The disinfectants used to control these pathogens can cause additional problems by reacting with natural organic matter, bromide, and other contaminants to form disinfectant by-products, which also have the potential to be harmful to human health.\nGeorgia Tech is one of four institutions selected by the EPA to receive nearly $8.5 million in grant funding, along with the University of Minnesota, Michigan State University, and the University of Texas.
