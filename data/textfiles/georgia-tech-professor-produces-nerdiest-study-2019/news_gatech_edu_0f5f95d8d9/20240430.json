Saleh uses his engineering perspective to decode political history\nFacebook\nTwitter\nEmail\nProf. Joseph H. Saleh\nJan 08, 2020\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nIf American politics sometimes\nseem\nlike a bloodsport, they do not,\nin fact , risk the lives of our office holders.\nNot so, in Ancient Rome.\nThis, according to Georgia Tech professor\nJoseph H. Saleh ,\nauthor of\n\"Statistical Reliability Analysis for a Most Dangerous Occupation: Roman Emperor,\"\npublished last month by Palgrave Communications, a division of the journal\nNature .\n\"Popular culture associates the lives of Roman emperors with luxury, cruelty,and debauchery, sometimes rightfully so,\" writes Saleh, a respected risk analysis expert who teaches in the Daniel Guggenheim School of Aerospace Engineering.\n\"One missing attribute in this list is, surprisingly, that this mighty office was most dangerous for its holder. Of the 69 rulers of the unified Roman Empire, from Augustus (d. 14 CE) to Theodosius (d. 395 CE), 62 percent suffered violent death.\"\nDubbed\u00a0 \"the Nerdiest Study of 2019\" by\nFast Company\nmagazine, Saleh's piece was reported on by dozens of mainstream publications around the globe. Praise from Saleh's colleagues in academia was likewise generous.\n\"This paper has the potential to lead to important interdisciplinary work on a central question in Roman history,\" wrote one Palgrave Communications reviewer.\n\"[This] has the potential to change how Roman historians think about this topic by showing that unique historical cases can be modeled as instances of a stochastic process,\" wrote another reviewer.\nThe fact that so many Roman emperors faced violent deaths is a matter of public record, Saleh notes. His analysis focuses more on the length of their individual tenures. Absent term limits, impeachments, and democratic elections, what factors influenced the length of their reigns? Would they be hastened or delayed by their leadership style or by a fault of the particular system of government?\nSaleh dug into those question by borrowing from the parlance of reliability engineering, which would look at a system's \"time-to-failure\" profile. Instead, he developed each emperor's \"time-to-violent-death\"\u00a0 profile to gain insight.\n\"We examined whether there is some structure of underlying randomness in the process [of regicide].\" he notes.\nAmong other things, Saleh found that two-thirds of all Roman emperors died violently in the first year of their rule. Of those who survived at least seven years, many were able to hold onto their thrones for another five years.\n\"A fundamental engine of the spectacle of regicide was not structural in nature, nor within the legions or the flawed system of government of the empire, but intrinsic to the actors themselves,\"\u00a0 he writes. \"The individuals should not be neglected in future work. It was the mutual interactions between the motivations and ambitions of individuals on the one hand, and the social, political, and military factors on the other hand that led to spectacle of regicide of Roman emperors. The whole was subject to historical contingencies and some level of randomness in the timing and alignment of factors.\"\nSaleh's scientific analysis of the process leaves room for a robust debate involving history, politics, and even human behavior. Ever the seeker, Saleh welcomes the discussion.\n\"I undertook this work mostly for the pleasure of writing, and the pleasure of exploring and sharing something on this topic,\" said Saleh, who holds a doctorate in aerospace engineering from MIT and a master's in history from Harvard. \"It was an incredibly enjoyable experience, and I hoped anyone who reads this would get a bit of this pleasure out of it. I did not expect nor considered there would anything utilitarian in this work.\"\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nStatistical reliability analysis for a most dangerous occupation: Roman emperor\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
