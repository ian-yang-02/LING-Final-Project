The company is committing $730,000 to support CEED\u2019s\nSummer Undergraduate Research Experience (SURE)\nduring the next two years.\nSURE is a 10-week summer program designed to attract qualified, underrepresented minority and women students into graduate school in the fields of engineering and science. It is one of the longest-running summer research\u00a0programs in the country, with attendees coming from universities around the country.\n\u201cOur SURE program has supported more than 500 students since it was established in 1992, with 75 percent ultimately attending graduate school,\u201d said\nFelicia Benton-Johnson , director of CEED and assistant dean in the College of Engineering. \u201cGeorgia Tech is grateful to Amazon for its commitment to growing the number of underrepresented minorities in STEM fields.\u201d\nBeginning this May, 30 students will be identified as Amazon SURE scholars, bringing the total number of SURE participants to approximately 50. Attendees will also visit an Amazon location (in-person or virtually). Amazon staff will host professional development seminars and lunch-and-learns during SURE.\nWith the commitment, Amazon becomes a CEED platinum sponsor.\n\u201cAmazon is excited to collaborate with the Georgia Tech SURE program \u2013 which has opened new doors of opportunity for hundreds of students over the past three decades,\u201d said Prem Natarajan, vice president of natural understanding, Alexa AI. \u201cThrough this collaboration, Amazon will support and help expand the impact of the program by providing additional opportunities to students to grow and flourish as future leaders.\u201d\nCEED has hosted SURE for more than 30 years. Each summer, junior and senior undergraduates are recruited to spend two and a half months at Georgia Tech. While conducting research within the Colleges of Engineering, Computing and Sciences, the students receive weekly professional development and graduate school preparation seminars. Each participant is also paired with a Georgia Tech grad student and faculty member for mentoring.\nSURE attendees are provided campus housing and a stipend to cover costs of living. The program is supported by funding from the National Science Foundation, Intel Corporation, and other federal and corporate sponsors.\nThe application period for the 2022 summer program is open until February 15 .\nAdditional Images\nContact\nJason Maderer\nCollege of Engineering\n404-276-1643\nEmail\nmaderer@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
