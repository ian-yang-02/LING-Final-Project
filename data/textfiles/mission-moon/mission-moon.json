Their briefcase-sized satellite was catching a ride on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket in late November, four months ahead of schedule.\nSuddenly the team of researchers and students found themselves ramping up preparations for a journey to the moon in search of frozen water at the lunar south pole.\nThose preparations are now complete. Launch week has arrived, with liftoff scheduled for the early morning hours of\u00a0Nov. 30.\nAbout an hour after launch, Georgia Tech's team will get to work. They'll begin communicating with Lunar Flashlight after it is\u00a0ejected into space. Over the course of the next few days, the aerospace engineering students will check systems, run through scheduled propulsion burns, and put the CubeSat on a path for the moon.\u00a0 Read the entire story , which runs through the series of critical steps the\u00a0students will make for their mission to the moon.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nJoshua Stewart\nCollege of Engineering jstewart@gatech.edu\nEmail\njstewart@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
