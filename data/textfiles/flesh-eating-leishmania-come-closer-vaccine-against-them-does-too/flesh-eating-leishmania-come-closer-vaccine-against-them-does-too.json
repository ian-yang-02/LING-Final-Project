Illustrated here are promastigotes (top) and amastigotes (bottom) with a typical boil caused by a leishmaniasis infection.

A new experimental vaccine, made with a proprietary biological particle developed at the Georgia Institute of Technology, has immunized laboratory mice that were genetically altered to mimic the human immune system.\nThe vaccine exploits a weakness in\nLeishmania \u2019s tricky chemical camouflage, which normally hides it from the victim\u2019s disease-fighting cells, to trigger\na forceful immune response against the parasite, according to a new study.\nSecond-deadliest parasite\nLeishmania\nare\nthe second-deadliest parasite s\nin the world, topped only by malaria, according to the World Health Organization. There are some 30 strains of\nLeishmania .\nThey are transmitted mainly through the bite of a\nphlebotomine sand fly , which feeds on blood, and global warming is expanding the insect\u2019s potential habitat northward from Latin America. The outbreak regions closest to the United States of\nleishmaniasis, the disease caused by the parasite , have come within roughly 300 miles of the border.\nAs with many diseases, many people who contract\nLeishmania,\nthe parasite, may develop leishmaniasis, the disease, with varying symptoms, or perhaps even show no outward signs of the disease. But when it breaks out, it can cause large skin boils, and some forms\u00a0severely eat away at the nose and lips, even removing parts of them.\nIf another form of the parasite gets into the bloodstream, it can damage the liver and spleen in a deadly form of the disease called visceral leishmaniasis, also known as black fever.\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t treat it, within 20 to 40 days visceral leishmaniasis very often kills the victim,\u201d said Alexandre Marques, a professor in the parasitology department of the Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais in Brazil, and one of the lead researchers on the new experimental vaccine. Conventional treatment, though mostly effective, can leave behind small numbers of the parasite, which can lead the patient to relapse or act as a carrier, in a similar manner as malaria.\nA vaccine could be better at halting or averting outbreaks.\nLong-awaited vaccine\nLeishmania , which are single-cell organisms about the size of large bacteria, have been a scourge in about 90 countries in South America, Africa, the Middle East, Asia and southern Europe. For decades, researchers have worked to find a vaccine against them and similar parasites without success.\n\u201cIn comparison to viruses and bacteria, these are much more complex organisms and more difficult to crack,\u201d said M. G. Finn, who also led work on the new vaccine. Finn is a\nprofessor in Georgia Tech\u2019s School of Biological Sciences\nand in\nthe School of Chemistry and Biochemistry, which he also chairs .\nThe new vaccine leverages intimate knowledge that Marques\u2019s team has gained living and working on the edge of leishmaniasis outbreak regions. \u201cAlex\u2019s (Marques\u2019s) students collect the sand flies, then they extract the parasites in the lab and do complex mass spectrometry and other tests to study their molecular makeup in impressive detail,\u201d Finn said.\nThe team has uncovered minute details on the outer surface of\nLeishmania\nthat make it vulnerable to a human immune reaction. The potential new vaccine, invented at Georgia Tech, employs a fake virus as bait to attract major immune system forces to these weaknesses to attack them.\nThe fake virus, or virus-like particle, is not infectious, and the body destroys it after use. Finn\u2019s lab has developed many variations of such particles in recent years, and other products containing it have already been through phase II human clinical trials.\nMarques and Finn\npublished the results of their vaccination development and testing on September 13, 2017, in the journal ACS Central Science.\nThe research was funded by the National Institutes of Health, Children\u2019s Healthcare of Atlanta, and Brazil\u2019s National Council for Scientific and Technological Development.\nLeishmaniasis vaccine Q & A\nHere are some questions and answers to help readers better understand how the vaccine would leverage\nLeishmania \u2019s chemical camouflage.\nWhat\u2019s so tricky about\nLeishmania \u2019s chemical camouflage?\nThe parasites cover themselves in carbohydrates, which look like food and also cover all other cells in the body. So, to the body, the\nLeishmania\ncells look inoffensive, and the immune system mostly leaves them alone.\nWhat\u2019s the chink in the camouflage?\nSome of those carbohydrates do actually trigger a mild human immune response. It\u2019s not strong enough to really battle leishmaniasis, but it gives Marques and Finn\u2019s vaccine a foot in the door.\nIt\u2019s lucky that humans, and some other primates, have this particular immune reaction, because other mammals don\u2019t, so this vaccine wouldn\u2019t work on them. Incidentally, that\u2019s why, to test the new vaccine, the laboratory mice have to be genetically altered to make their immune systems react to the carbohydrates the way ours does.\nHow does the fake virus work?\n\u201cWe use the virus-like particle to highlight a\nkey carbohydrate\non the surface of\nLeishmania\nclearly to the body. This coaxes its immune system into reacting strongly against it as a foreign structure,\u201d Finn said.\nThe immune system goes after the fake virus like guard dogs after an invader. The researchers attach the odd carbohydrate to the fake virus, and that makes the immune system recognize that carbohydrate as a serious threat. Immune cells then hunt it down, and, in the process, destroy the parasite that produces it.\nWhen could a vaccine be on the market?\nIt\u2019s too early to stoke hopes\u00a0because a lot has to happen before any drug or vaccine can hit the market. But the researchers have some interesting arguments for moving on to human testing.\n\u201cNormally, in medical testing, you would test next in rabbits or infected cats or dogs,\u201d Finn said. \u201cBut they don\u2019t have the right immune system. The only other possibilities are genetically altered pigs, or certain primates, or humans.\u201d\nAs mentioned, the fake virus is a biological nanoparticle that has been tested in humans before without showing toxicity. Also, the researchers want to add some more kinds of\nLeishmania\ncamouflage carbohydrates to the fake virus to give the vaccine even more punch.\nIsn\u2019t leishmaniasis limited to poverty regions with poor hygiene?\nAbsolutely not.\nIt can take hold anywhere people and animals live in high density and certain species of sand flies, and some other insects, can thrive. The insects like warmer weather, which is why climate change is causing the sand fly\u2019s habitat to spread north.\n\u201cPeople in developed countries in climates that were cooler will have to start caring about this, as global warming encourages this to spread to them,\u201d Marques said.\nAnother potentially deadly\ninsect-borne tropical disease called Chagas disease\nhas already made it to three southern U.S. states, and the same researchers are working on a vaccine against it, too.\nHighly cited chemist\nM. G. Finn is a highly cited award-winning chemist. The\nThompson Reuters news agency included Finn in its 2013 predictions of possible winners of that year\u2019s Nobel Prize in Chemistry . (That year\u2019s prize went to different well-deserving researchers and their achievements.)\nFinn is most widely known for his research on click chemistry. A famous study in partnership with\nNobel Prize winning chemist Karl Barry Sharpless , and Harmuth Kolb, \" Click Chemistry: Diverse Chemical Function from a Few Good Reactions ,\" has been cited more than 10,000 times,\naccording to Google Scholar .\nFinn also holds the James A.
