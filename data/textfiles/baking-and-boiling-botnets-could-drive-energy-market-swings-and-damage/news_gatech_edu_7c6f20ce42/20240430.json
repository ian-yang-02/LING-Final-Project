If done within the bounds of normal power demand variation, such an attack would be difficult to detect, the researchers said.\n\u201cIf an attacker can slightly affect electricity market prices in their favor, it would be like knowing today what\u2019s going to happen in tomorrow\u2019s stock market,\u201d said Tohid Shekari, a graduate research assistant in the\nSchool of Electrical and Computer Engineering\nat the Georgia Institute of Technology. \u201cIf the manipulation stays within a certain range, it would be stealthy and difficult to differentiate from a typical load forecasting error.\u201d\nBelieved to be the first proposed energy market manipulation cyberattack, the operation would depend on botnets composed of thousands of appliances that could be controlled centrally by attackers who had taken over their Internet of Things (IoT) controllers. Malicious actors have already demonstrated IoT botnet attacks such as Mirai, which used a network of compromised internet-connected cameras and routers to launch attacks on key internet infrastructure.\nThe attack, dubbed \u201cIoT Skimmer,\u201d would be made possible by the deregulation of energy markets, which has created a system to efficiently supply electrical power. To meet the demand for electrical energy, utility companies must predict future demand and purchase power from the day-ahead wholesale energy market at competitive prices. If the predictions turn out to be wrong, the utilities may have to pay more or less for the energy they need to meet the demands of their customers by participating in the real-time market, which has more volatile prices in general. Creating erroneous demand data to manipulate forecasts could be profitable to the suppliers selling energy to meet the unexpected demand, or the retailers or utilities buying cheaper energy from the real-time market.\nThe researchers weren\u2019t able to determine whether such an attack might have already taken place because IoT devices \u2013 beyond being insecure \u2013 also lack the kind of monitoring that would be necessary to detect such hijacking. But they used real data sets from two of the largest U.S. energy markets \u2013 New York and California \u2013 to evaluate the feasibility of their proposed attack.\n\u201cWe did a lot of simulation and mathematical analysis to show that this kind of transfer could occur,\u201d said\nRaheem Beyah , the Motorola Foundation Professor in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering who is also Georgia Tech\u2019s vice president for Interdisciplinary Research and co-founder of the company Fortiphyd Logic. \u201cWe also did a feasibility analysis of the supporting areas to show that this would be possible from various perspectives.\u201d\nThe researchers assume that such botnets already exist, and that attackers could simply rent their use on the dark web. More than 20 million smart thermostats already exist in the North American market, and they are connected to at least one high-wattage device \u2013 a heating and air-conditioning system that could be controlled by attackers on an intermittent basis.\n\u201cIf you consider all of the smart thermostats and internet-connected electric ovens, water heaters, and electric vehicle chargers that are already in use, there are plenty of devices to be compromised,\u201d Shekari said. \u201cHomeowners would likely never notice if the EV charger turns on when electricity demand is highest, or if the air conditioning cools a little more than they expected when they are not home.\u201d\nTo counter the potential attack, researchers suggest both detection and prevention steps. Through integrated monitoring of the normal power use of high-wattage IoT-connected devices, unexpected peaks or valleys in power consumption triggered by an attacker could be detected. And access to data on expected energy demand \u2013 which is now made available publicly \u2013 could be restricted to those who actually need it.\nThe primary factor that makes this attack possible is the detailed online data sharing of electricity market information, which is usually updated every five minutes.\n\u201cThis energy demand information is really a data privacy issue, and we need to think long and hard about the balance between transparency and security,\u201d Beyah said. \u201cThere\u2019s always a tension there, but limiting the amount of detail could make it more difficult for attackers who want to hide their manipulations to know what the normal variations are.\u201d\nThe potential attack highlights the need for considering cybersecurity threats in technology areas where they had perhaps never been possible before.\n\u201cThis is an interesting intersection between the IoT security world and energy markets,\u201d said Beyah. \u201cRight now, it seems that there is a large gap between the two worlds. Our point is that there are implications for combining IoT technology and high-wattage devices that can compromise markets in ways we would never have thought of before.\u201d\nThe presentation, \u201cIoT Skimmer: Energy Market Manipulation Through High-Wattage IoT Botnets,\u201d will be presented on Wednesday, Aug. 5, at 2:30 p.m. as part of the Black Hat USA 2020 conference.\nResearch News\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\n177 North Avenue\nAtlanta, Georgia\u00a0 30332-0181\u00a0 USA\nMedia Relations Contact : John Toon (404-894-6986) (jtoon@gatech.edu)\nWriter : John Toon\nAdditional Images\nContact\nJohn Toon\nResearch News\n(404) 894-6986\nEmail\njtoon@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
