Players will participate in card and video game competitions to win cash prizes and secure a spot in the upcoming world championship event in Honolulu, Hawaii.\nClub president Bennett McKinney also sees it as an opportunity to engage with Pok\u00e9mon enthusiasts from all over, with some events drawing up to 8,000 people across three divisions.\n\"It's been amazing to see this large community come together and to know that I'm going to this convention center, whether it's in Charlotte, Knoxville, or Orlando, and there's going to be thousands of people there who are all like me in some sense and all like Pok\u00e9mon just as much as I do,\" said McKinney, a third-year industrial engineering student.\nOrlando Karam, the club's training card game director and a third-year mechanical engineering student, has been playing Pok\u00e9mon since childhood, as have many Pok\u00e9Jackets members. McKenzie envisioned the club welcoming players of all skill levels and enabling them to thrive while exploring all that the Pok\u00e9mon media universe has to offer.\n\"We get new players all the time, and I love it,\" said McKenzie, a fourth-year chemistry major. \"I specifically started this club with the intention of making the barrier to entry as low as possible. If anyone comes in and they have no idea how to play, we have players who don't hesitate to jump in and offer to help.\"\nThe video game portion of the regional competitions is played on the Nintendo Switch, but the club practices using Showdown \u2014 a free online battle simulator \u2014 to ensure access to the game. Proxy decks are also\nencouraged\nto allow newcomers to learn the card game as they play before curating their own collection. New members can learn from Karam and McKinney, both of whom are certified Pok\u00e9mon professors.\nRegardless of expertise, the club's vice president, fourth-year architecture and music technology major Sahil Parekh, sees a welcoming space for everyone.\n\"Pok\u00e9mon has a way of getting you hooked on the franchise, and then you get to see how everybody's interests are different. Some people love the card game, or the video games, or Pok\u00e9mon Go, and there are different levels of competitiveness, but everybody you meet in the community loves Pok\u00e9mon,\" he said.\nThe club has become a fixture at local events hosted by comic book and gaming stores throughout the Atlanta area. On campus, members often play card games in West Village, and the club hosts video game tournaments that can span one weekend or even an entire semester.\nContact\nSteven Gagliano\n- Institute Communications\nEmail\nSteven.gagliano@gatech.edu\nAdditional information\nSince 1996, the Pok\u00e9mon franchise has evolved into a global phenomenon, spawning games, merchandise, movies, and television shows. Players of both the card and video games compete to become skilled Pok\u00e9mon Trainers. Card game players build their decks to strategically battle their opponents, while video game players train and battle their Pok\u00e9mon throughout their journey on their way to becoming champions.\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
