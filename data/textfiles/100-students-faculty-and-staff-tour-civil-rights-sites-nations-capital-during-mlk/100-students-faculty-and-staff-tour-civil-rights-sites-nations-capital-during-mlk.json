Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering, at the Washington Monument\nJan 30, 2017\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nDuring the weekend commemorating the life and inspiration of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., 76 students and 24 faculty and staff from Georgia Tech traveled to Washington, D.C., to tour several civil rights sites. This tour is part of the Institute\u2019s MLK Celebration, an ambitious slate of educational programs, arts and cultural performances, and service opportunities to encourage active participation from the campus and Atlanta community.\nStudents, faculty, and staff departed in charter buses on the night of January 12 to visit museums and memorials over the next two days, including the National Museum of African American History and Culture, the King Memorial, National Mall, National Museum of the American Indian, and the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.\nAssociate Dean of Students and Director of Student Diversity Programs Stephanie Ray reflected on why Georgia Tech\u2019s MLK Student Board organized the civil rights tour in D.C.: \u201cWe followed the life of Dr. King. After leading civil rights trips in Montgomery, Ala. in 2012 and Birmingham, Ala. in 2013, the next goal was to end our tour by visiting the King Memorial and National Museum of African American History and Culture in our nation\u2019s capital.\u201d\nHere is what student participants said about their experiences during the civil rights tour:\nWhy did you want to go on this trip?\n\u201cI wanted to experience the history and culture of Africans before being brought to America. I also wanted to learn more about the Native American culture beyond what is presented in history books.\u201d\n\u2013\nAlexander Pegues, undergraduate student in the George W. Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering\nWhat was your favorite part of this trip?\n\u201cThe National Museum of African American History and Culture, hands down. From the photos to the interactive learning, it was beautifully designed and presented. The experience was more than you could imagine.\u201d\n\u2013\nKhadijah Boles, undergraduate student in the Wallace H. Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering\nWhat have you learned from this experience that you could apply in your daily life?\n\u201cFor us, as a people, to progress, we need to come together as one. We also need to make education available to everyone, especially our youth. I plan to start programs for youth that I didn\u2019t have in school but was blessed to have family who taught me.\u201d\n\u2013\nKhadijah Boles, undergraduate student in the Wallace H. Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering\n\u201cI saw the triumph of the human spirit over oppression. I apply that triumph to my own daily small victories.\u201d\n\u2013\nTJ Funso, undergraduate student in the H. Milton Stewart School of Industrial & Systems Engineering\nSchool of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences Assistant Professor Jennifer Glass also shared her experiences on the civil rights tour at\nwww.storify.com/jenniglass/gt-civil-rights-tour-of-dc .\nThis year\u2019s tour was sponsored by the College of Engineering, College of Sciences, Department of Housing, Division of Student Life, Institute Diversity, LGBTQIA Resource Center, Office of Student Diversity Programs, and Parent\u2019s Fund for Student Life and Leadership.
