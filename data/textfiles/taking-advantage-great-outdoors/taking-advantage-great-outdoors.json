According to the Outdoor Industry Association, participation in running, cycling, hiking, bird watching, and camping increased markedly after the March 2020 shutdown.\nWith the recent uptick in Covid-19 cases, the great outdoors has once again been the safest place to exercise and socialize. And with cooler temperatures on the way, there are worse things than being out in nature.\nAccording to David Knobbe, director of\nOutdoor Recreation Georgia Tech\n(ORGT), a program of the Campus Recreation Center, \u201cIt is well known that connecting with nature is good for people\u2019s health and well-being. It lowers blood pressure, reduces stress, improves mood and focus, and helps us heal better.\u201d\nFortunately, several groups at Tech are helping the campus community take advantage of these benefits, including ORGT, Starter Bikes, and Trailblazers, to name a few:\nORGT\nORGT has been providing outdoor adventures for the Georgia Tech campus for more than 50 years. Typically, ORGT serves around 5,000 individuals annually, offering over 120 open-enrollment trip options in nine different adventure sports.\nEarlier in the pandemic, ORGT had to discontinue providing transportation to and from its outdoor adventure destinations, opting instead for \u201cmeet-up-style trips.\u201d That, unfortunately, \u201cleft a lot of people behind,\u201d Knobbe says. \u201cBut now, we are fully back in business, offering trips that include orientation, expertise, equipment, and transportation.\u201d\nPeople are \u201cchomping at the bit to get out and connect not just with the outdoors, but with one another,\u201d he said, and\nORGT-led trips\nscheduled for fall are filling up fast. But, he added, those who want to venture out on their own should know that ORGT has equipment for rent.\n\u201cWe rent backpacking gear, boats, sleeping bags \u2013 really everything one needs to put together their own adventure,\u201d Knobbe says.\nFor novices, he recommends starting simple. \u201cKnow what you\u2019re doing and be sure you have the basics,\u201d he said. \u201cORGT has a lot of information like that, plus coaching is available around where beginners might go within a few hours of campus.\u201d\nSTARTER BIKES\nJordan Lym, fourth-year industrial design student and president of\nStarter Bikes , wasn\u2019t sure what he expected at their opening day this semester, but it wasn\u2019t almost 150 people lined up to buy a bicycle.\n\u201cAt the beginning of the year, we usually have 50 at most, so this was pretty crazy,\u201d he recalls.\nStarter Bikes serves as an \u201cadoption shelter\u201d of sorts for abandoned bicycles from around campus. The bike is tagged and if the owner doesn\u2019t show up to claim it within 30 days, it is sold \u201cfor a quarter to half of what it would cost on the secondhand market,\u201d Lym says.\nThe catch is, if repairs are required \u2014 which is often the case \u2014 the new owner must provide the labor. To help, Starter Bikes sells replacement parts for cost, provides tools, and coaches buyers through the repair process.\nInventory is always changing, and \u201cthe bikes can range from really poor condition to it just needs a simple lube on the chain and you\u2019re done,\u201d Lym says.\nAdhering to Covid-19 protocols has been fairly painless, Lym says, because everyone can spread out on the bottom level of the CRC parking lot, where Starter Bikes is located.\nStarter Bikes sees itself as an integral part of the cycling culture at Tech, which has a Bicycle Master Plan and has been designated a Gold Level Bicycle Friendly University.\n\u201cIt\u2019s rewarding to see people excited about bikes and learning to do their own maintenance,\u201d Lym says. \u201cWe want to inspire people to ride, even after college, and the best way to do that is to give them confidence.\u201d\nTRAILBLAZERS\nFor\nTrailblazers , it\u2019s not enough to get out in nature \u2014 while they\u2019re at it, they work to preserve it, promote it, and make it more accessible to all.\nEmily Schroeder, a second-year business administration major and Trailblazers\u2019 outreach chair and alternative break coordinator, is busy these days planning the group\u2019s camping trip for fall break. She also leads tree tours around Tech\u2019s campus arboretum.\nLast year, the pandemic curtailed some of their activities and pushed their meetings onto BlueJeans, but \u201cif anything,\u201d Schroeder says, \u201can online format made the club more accessible.\u201d\nThis year, they\u2019re moving toward more in-person activities \u2014 doing things like pulling invasive plant species and working in community gardens \u2014 although they\u2019re limiting events to 20 participants for now, just to ensure that everyone can distance according to their comfort level and feel safe.\n\u201cStudents and staff should know that Trailblazers is an easy and fun way to get involved outdoors,\u201d Schroeder says. \u201cWe have numerous events that are beginner-friendly and super hands-on. If you love caring for the environment and giving back to the community, Trailblazers is the organization for you.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nContact\nWriter:\nMargaret Tate\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
