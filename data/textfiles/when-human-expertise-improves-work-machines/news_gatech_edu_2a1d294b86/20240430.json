In materials science, success with this effort could accelerate the design of next-generation advanced functional materials, where development now depends on old-fashioned trial-and-error.\nBy themselves, however, data analytics techniques borrowed from other research areas often fail to provide the insights needed to help materials scientists and engineers choose which of many variables to adjust \u2014 and can\u2019t account for dramatic changes such as the introduction of a new chemical compound into the process. In some complex materials such as ferroelectrics, as many as 10 different factors can affect the properties of the resulting product.\nIn a paper published this week in the journal\nNPJ Computational Materials , researchers explain how to give the machines an edge at solving the challenge by intelligently organizing the data to be analyzed based on human knowledge of what factors are likely to be important and related. Known as dimensional stacking, the technique shows that human experience still has a role to play in the age of machine intelligence.\nThe research was sponsored by the National Science Foundation and the Defense Threat Reduction Agency, as well as the Swiss National Science Foundation. Measurements were performed, in part, at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Oak Ridge, Tennessee.\n\u201cWhen your machine accepts strings of data, it really does matter how you are putting those strings together,\u201d said\nNazanin Bassiri-Gharb , the paper\u2019s corresponding author and a professor in the\nGeorge W. Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering\nat the Georgia Institute of Technology. \u201cWe must be mindful that the organization of data before it goes to the algorithm makes a difference. If you don\u2019t plug the information in correctly, you will get a result that isn\u2019t necessarily correlated with the reality of the physics and chemistry that govern the materials.\u201d\nBassiri-Gharb works on ferroelectrics, crystalline materials that exhibit spontaneous electrical polarizations switchable by an external electric field. Widely used for their piezoelectric properties \u2014 which allow electrical inputs to generate mechanical outputs, and mechanical motion to generate electrical voltages \u2014 their chemical formulas are usually complicated, including lead, manganese, niobium, oxygen, titanium, indium, bismuth and other elements.\nResearchers, who have been working for decades to improve the materials, would like to develop advanced ferroelectrics that don\u2019t include lead. But trial-and-error design techniques haven\u2019t led to major breakthroughs, and she is not alone in wanting a more direct approach \u2014 one that could also more rapidly lead to improvements in other functional materials used in microelectronics, batteries, optoelectronic systems and other critical research fields.\n\u201cFor materials science, things get really complicated, especially with the functional materials,\u201d said Bassiri-Gharb. \u201cAs materials scientists, it\u2019s very difficult to design the materials if we don\u2019t understand why a response is increased. We have learned that the functionalities are not compartmentalized. They are interrelated among many properties of the material.\u201d\nThe technique described in the paper involves a preprocessing step in which the large data sets are organized according to physical or chemical properties that make sense to material scientists.\n\u201cAs a scientist or engineer, you have an idea whether or not there are physical or chemical correlations,\u201d she explained. \u201cYou have to be cognizant of what kind of correlations could exist. The way you stack your data to be analyzed would have implications with respect to the physical or chemical correlations. If you do this correctly, you can get more information from any data analytics approach you might be using.\u201d\nTo test the techniques, Bassiri-Gharb and collaborators Lee Griffin, Iaroslav Gaponenko, and Shujun Zhang tested samples of relaxor-ferroelectric materials used in advanced ultrasonic imaging equipment. Griffin, a Georgia Tech graduate research assistant and the paper\u2019s co-first author, did the experimental measurements. Zhang, a researcher at the University of Wollongong in Australia, provided samples for the study. Bassiri-Gharb and Gaponenko, a research affiliate in her group, developed the approach.\nUsing a conductive tip on an atomic force microscope, they examined the electromechanical response from a series of chemically related samples, generating as many as 2,500 time- and voltage-dependent measurements on a grid of points established on each sample. The process generated hundreds of thousands of data points and provided a good test for the stacking approach, known technically as concatenation.\n\u201cInstead of just looking at the chemical composition that provides the highest response, we looked at a range of compositions and tried to figure out the commonality,\u201d she said. \u201cWe figured out that if we applied this data stacking with some thought process behind it, we could learn more about these interesting materials.\u201d\nAmong their findings: Though the material is a single crystal, the functional response showed highly disordered behavior, reminiscent of a fully disordered material like glass. \u201cThis glassy behavior really is unexpectedly persisting beyond a small percentage of the material compositions,\u201d said Bassiri-Gharb. \u201cIt is persisting across all of the compositions that we have looked at.\u201d\nShe hopes the technique will ultimately lead to information that will improve many materials and their functionalities. Knowing which chemicals need to be included could allow the materials scientists to move to the next phase \u2014 working with chemists to put the right atoms in the right places.\n\u201cThe big goal for any materials\u2019 functionality is to find the guidelines that will provide the properties we want,\u201d she said. \u201cWe want to find the straight path to the best compositions for the next generation of these materials.\u201d\nThis research was supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF) through award DMR-1255379, by the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) though grant HDTRA1-15-0035, by the Center for the Science and Technology of Advanced Materials and Interfaces (STAMI) at Georgia Tech, and Division II of the Swiss National Science Foundation under project 200021_178782.
