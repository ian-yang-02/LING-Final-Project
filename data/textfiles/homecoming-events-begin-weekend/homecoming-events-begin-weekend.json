These traditions are great opportunities to get involved in the culture of campus throughout the week, and it all starts this weekend.\nHomecoming Gala\nThe Homecoming Gala is Friday, Sept. 30, from 7 to 10 p.m. It is a free opportunity to dance the night away with friends. The dress code is formal, so get dressed up and ring in the Homecoming season. Ramblin\u2019 Royalty will be announced at the end of the event.\nSCPC Homecoming Competition\nThroughout the week, teams will participate in a wide array of events such as an egg toss, \u201ccanstruction,\u201d and block by block. There\u2019s an event for everyone, whether it\u2019s playing Mario Kart or racing through an obstacle course. Although teams have already been formed, spectators are always welcome.\nMini 500\nThe Mini 500 is one of Tech\u2019s oldest traditions and dates back to 1969. Racers compete to finish eight laps around Peters Parking Deck as fast as possible. Many organizations spend months working on their tricycles. It is the perfect opportunity to witness engineering prowess as well as the spirit of the student body. A tailgate starts Friday, Oct. 7, at 4:15 p.m., and students can hang out and enjoy free food while the teams prepare. The\u00a0race starts at 5:30 p.m.\nFreshman Cake Race\nThe Freshman Cake Race began in 1911 but has seen many changes. What began as a 5K open tryout for the track team has turned into a half- mile race up Freshman Hill. All participants who complete the course get a free cupcake. After the Yellow Jacket Marching Band plays in front of East Campus Housing, students head toward the start line Saturday, Oct. 8, at 6:30 a.m. The winners receive an entire cake and are congratulated by Ramblin\u2019 Royalty at the Homecoming game. Signups close Thursday, Sept. 29, at midnight.\nWreck Parade\nFollowing the Freshman Cake Race, the Wreck Parade begins Saturday, Oct. 8, at 8:30 a.m. This tradition showcases the genius of Georgia Tech engineers like nothing else, as huge contraptions are paraded down Fowler Street along with classic cars similar to the Ramblin\u2019 Wreck. Based off a race from Atlanta to Athens in 1929, this tradition persists to show the school\u2019s love for mechanical prowess.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nConnor White\nInstitute Communications\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
