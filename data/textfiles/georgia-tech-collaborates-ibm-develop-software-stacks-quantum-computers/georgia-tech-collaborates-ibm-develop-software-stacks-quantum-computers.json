Georgia Tech will have cloud access, via the Oak Ridge Hub, to the world\u2019s largest fleet of universal quantum computing systems for commercial use case exploration and fundamental research.\n\u201cAccess to IBM machines will allow Georgia Tech to build software infrastructure to make it easier to operate quantum machines, create specialized error mitigation techniques in software \u2013 thereby mitigating some of the hardware errors \u2013 and develop algorithms and applications for the emerging noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computing paradigm,\u201d said\nMoinuddin Qureshi , a professor in Georgia Tech\u2019s\nSchool of Electrical and Computer Engineering . \u201cAccess will also allow Georgia Tech researchers to better understand the error patterns in existing quantum computers, which can help with developing the architecture for future machines.\u201d\nAs part of the ORNL hub, Georgia Tech will join a community of Fortune 500 companies, startups, academic institutions and research labs working to advance quantum computing and explore practical applications. Georgia Tech will leverage IBM\u2019s quantum expertise and resources, Qiskit software and developer tools, and will have cloud-based access to IBM\u2019s Quantum Computation Center. IBM makes available through the cloud 15 of the most-advanced universal quantum computing systems available, including a 53-qubit system \u2013 the most qubits of a universal quantum computer commercially available in the industry.\nSince the IBM Q Network\u2019s launch in 2017 it has grown to more than 100 organizations, collaborating with IBM and one another to advance fundamental quantum computing research, and the development of practical applications for business and science.\nResearch is being conducted worldwide to develop a new type of computational device known as a quantum computer, based on the principles of quantum physics. Quantum computers could tackle specialized computational problems such as integer factorization, understanding materials properties or optimization challenges much faster than conventional digital computers. Quantum computers will use one of a number of possible approaches to create quantum bits \u2013 units known as qubits \u2013 to compute and store data, giving them unique advantages over computers based on silicon transistors.\nWhile the machines have great promise, there are difficult challenges in operating such machines and in writing software that will take advantage of their power, Qureshi said.\nThe agreement will give Georgia Tech access to IBM\u2019s premium systems, including the 53-qubit quantum computer. \u201cIn the regime between 50 and 60 qubits is where quantum machines can potentially do computations that are beyond the capabilities of existing conventional computers,\u201d Qureshi said.\nAbout the Georgia Institute of Technology\nThe Georgia Institute of Technology, also known as Georgia Tech, is one of the leading public research universities in the United States. Georgia Tech provides a technologically focused education to more than 36,000 undergraduate and graduate students in fields ranging from engineering, computing, and sciences, to business, design, and liberal arts. Research, economic development and other sponsored activities at Georgia Tech passed a significant milestone during the fiscal year that concluded on June 30, 2019, recording more than a billion dollars in new grants, contracts and other awards.\nAbout IBM Q\nIBM Q is an industry-first initiative to build commercial universal quantum systems for business and science applications.
