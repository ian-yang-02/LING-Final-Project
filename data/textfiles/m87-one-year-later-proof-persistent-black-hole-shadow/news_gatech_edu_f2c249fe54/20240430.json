This bright ring surrounds a deep central depression, \u201cthe shadow of the black hole,\u201d as predicted by general relativity. Excitingly, the brightness peak of the ring has shifted by about 30\u00ba compared to the images from 2017, which is consistent with our theoretical understanding of variability from turbulent material around black holes.\n\u201cA fundamental requirement of science is to be able to reproduce results,\u201d says\nKeiichi Asada , an associate research fellow at Academia Sinica Institute for Astronomy and Astrophysics in Taiwan. \u201cConfirmation of the ring in a completely new data set is a huge milestone for our collaboration and a strong indication that we\nare looking at a black hole shadow and the material orbiting around it.\u201d\nIn 2017, the EHT took the first image of a black hole. This object, M87*, is the beating heart of the giant elliptical galaxy Messier 87 and lives 55 million light years away from Earth. The image of the black hole revealed a bright circular ring, brighter in the southern part of the ring. Further analysis of the data also revealed the structure of M87* in polarized light, giving us greater insight into the geometry of the magnetic field and the nature of the plasma around the black hole.\nThe new era of black hole direct imaging, spearheaded by the extensive analysis of the 2017 observations of M87*, opened a new window that let researchers investigate black hole astrophysics and allow them to test the theory of general relativity at a fundamental level.\n\u201cOur theoretical models tell us that the state of the material around M87* should be uncorrelated between 2017 and 2018,\u201d EHT researchers\nexplain . \u201cThus, multiple observations of M87* will help us place independent constraints on the plasma and magnetic field structure around the black hole and help us disentangle the complicated astrophysics from the effects of general relativity.\u201d\nGreenland Telescope\nTo help accomplish new and exciting science, the EHT is under continuous development. The Greenland Telescope joined the EHT for the first time in 2018, just five months after its construction was completed far above the Arctic Circle. This new telescope significantly improved the image fidelity of the EHT array, improving the coverage, particularly in the North-South direction. The Large Millimeter Telescope also participated for the first time with its full 50 m surface, greatly improving its sensitivity. The EHT array was also upgraded to observe in four frequency bands around 230 GHz, compared to only two bands in 2017.\nRepeated observations with an improved array are essential to demonstrate the robustness of our findings and strengthen our confidence in our results.\u00a0 In addition to the groundbreaking science, the EHT also serves as a technology testbed for cutting-edge developments in high-frequency radio interferometry.\n\"Advancing scientific endeavors requires continuous enhancement in data quality and analysis techniques,\" says\nRohan Dahale , a Ph.D. candidate at the\nInstituto de Astrof\u00edsica de Andaluc\u00eda\n(IAA-CSIC) in Spain. \"The inclusion of the Greenland Telescope in our array filled critical gaps in our earth-sized telescope. The 2021, 2022, and the forthcoming 2024 observations witness improvements to the array, fueling our enthusiasm to push the frontiers of black hole astrophysics.\"\nRemarkably similar\nThe analysis of the 2018 data features eight independent imaging and modeling techniques, including methods used in the previous 2017 analysis of M87* and new ones developed from the collaboration\u2019s experience analyzing Sgr A*.\nThe EHT team explains that the image of M87* taken in 2018 is remarkably similar to what they saw in 2017. \u201cWe see a bright ring of the same size, with a dark central region and one side of the ring brighter than the other. The mass and distance of M87* will not appreciably increase throughout a human lifetime, so general relativity predicts that the ring diameter should stay the same from year to year. The stability of the measured diameter in the images from 2017 to 2018 robustly supports the conclusion that M87* is well described by general relativity.\u201d\nMass matters, brightness peak\n\u201cOne of the remarkable properties of a black hole is that its radius is strongly dependent on only one quantity: its mass,\u201d says\nNitika Yadlapalli Yurk , a former graduate student at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), now a postdoctoral fellow at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in California. \u201cSince M87* is not accreting material (which would increase its mass) at a rapid rate, general relativity tells us that its radius will remain fairly unchanged over human history. It\u2019s pretty exciting to see that our data confirm this prediction.\u201d\nWhile the size of the black hole shadow did not change between 2017 and 2018, the location of the brightest region around the ring did change significantly, the team adds. The bright region rotated about 30\u00ba counterclockwise to settle in the bottom right part of the ring at about the 5 o\u2019clock position.\nHistorical observations of M87* with a less sensitive array and fewer telescopes also indicated that the shadow structure changes yearly (Wielgus 2020, ApJ,\n901 ,\n67 ) but with less precision. While the 2018 EHT array still cannot observe the jet emerging from M87*, the black hole spin axis predicted from the location of the brightest region around the ring is more consistent with the jet axis seen at other wavelengths.\n\u201cThe biggest change, that the brightness peak shifted around the ring, is actually something we predicted when we published the first results in 2019,\u201d says\nBritt Jeter , a postdoctoral fellow at Academia Sinica Institute for Astronomy and Astrophysics in Taiwan. \u201cWhile general relativity says the ring size should stay pretty fixed, the emission from the turbulent, messy accretion disk around the black hole will cause the brightest part of the ring to wobble around a common center. The amount of wobble we see over time is something we can use to test our theories for the magnetic field and plasma environment around the black hole.\u201d\n2024 and beyond\n\u201cWhile all the EHT papers published so far have featured an analysis of our first observations in 2017,\u201d the research team adds, \u201cthis result represents the first efforts to explore the many additional years of data the EHT collaboration has collected.\u201d In addition to 2017 and 2018, the EHT conducted successful observations in 2021 and 2022 and is scheduled to observe in the first half of 2024. Each year, the EHT array has improved in some way, either through the addition of new telescopes, better hardware, or additional observing frequencies. \u201cWithin the collaboration, we are working very hard to analyze all this data and are excited to show you more results in the future.\u201d\n###\nDOI:\nhttps://doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361/202347932\nABOUT EHT\nThe EHT collaboration involves more than 300 researchers from Africa, Asia, Europe, and North and South America.
