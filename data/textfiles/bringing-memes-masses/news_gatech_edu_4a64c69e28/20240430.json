The inventors are two computer science majors:\u00a0Anushk Mittal and\u00a0Joshua Wang. \u00a0(Photo by\u00a0Allison Carter)\nMar 06, 2018\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nWhen Anushk Mittal was a freshman he turned to memes to relax after a stressful day of classes. He soon realized that in addition to being fun, memes offered a positive way for people to interact with one another.\nMittal, a second-year computer science major, later paired up with Joshua Wang, a third-year computer science major, and together they created an all-meme platform. The platform,\nMemeois , crawls the internet for memes and uses machine learning to curate a personalized feed. Think of Instagram, but for memes.\nThe invention is one of six competing for the\nInVenture Prize , Georgia Tech\u2019s annual invention competition. The winner will be announced March 14.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve created an accessible network where people can discover and experience the magic of memes and share it with everyone,\u201d said Mittal, who is from New Delhi, India. \u201cThere\u2019s so much negativity in the world and we\u2019re all under so much stress that it\u2019s nice to give people a way to step back, relax and realize how wonderful life is. Memes help us do that.\u201d\nWang said InVenture provides an opportunity for Memeois to attract more attention and resources.\nThey launched Memeois on iOS in September and it has already attracted more than 50,000 active users in 86 different countries. More than 4 million memes interactions have been conducted through the platform.\nThe platform is free and without advertisements. The plan is to earn money through business-to-business solutions, Mittal said, noting that memes lead to high user engagement.\nMemeois uses machine learning and will recommend memes. The platform also offers share and search features, which allow for meme-filled conversations, Mittal said.\n\u201cWe help people be creative and innovative with memes,\u201d said Wang, who is from Seoul, South Korea. \u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to help connect people\u2019s lives through modern technology. It\u2019s like what we learned in our introduction to programming classes -- technologies do impact the world and computers can help connect people.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nGeorgia Tech InVenture Prize\nContact\nLaura Diamond\nMedia Relations\u00a0 laura.diamond@gatech.edu\n404-660-2927\nEmail\nlaura.diamond@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
