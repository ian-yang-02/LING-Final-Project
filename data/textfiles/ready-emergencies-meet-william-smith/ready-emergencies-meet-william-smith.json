The answer was emergency management, which I didn\u2019t really know existed before doing some research.\u201d\nAfter earning a master\u2019s degree in public administration with a focus on disaster management from Georgia State University in 2005, Smith worked as the operations officer for the Atlanta-Fulton County Emergency Management Agency. In 2009 he began working in emergency management at Georgia Tech and became director in 2015. He describes his job as being a city manager for an emergency.\n\u201cI take all of the resources that I have on a daily basis, reorganize them, and repurpose them for an emergency so that we can get back to normal,\u201d he said. \u201cThe goal is always to get back to normal. We\u2019re also looking ahead and trying to learn from what we\u2019ve experienced so the next interruption won\u2019t be as significant.\u201d\nHis department plans for all kinds of emergency situations including inclement weather, road closures, and utility failures such as water main breaks and power outages. They also coordinate with the Georgia Tech Police Department and other departments to disseminate emergency information to the campus community through the Georgia Tech Emergency Notification System (GTENS).\n\u201cThe nice thing about Atlanta is there aren\u2019t a lot of natural hazards to deal with, so we have that luxury. But we can never sit idly. Typically, 90% of our time is spent planning for the next emergency,\u201d Smith said.\nThat planning and preparedness was put to the test a year ago when the coronavirus hit the U.S., adding an entirely new set of concerns to manage.\n\u201cWe started working on Covid-19 planning last January, and it has consumed my life since.\u00a0I cannot recall a day of work in the past year that wasn\u2019t focused on the pandemic,\u201d he said. \u201cI remember reading the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines and the language they used, saying that this pandemic will change the way we operate our daily lives. At that point it became very real.\u201d\nA silver lining, of sorts, is the many lessons learned during the last year. Smith points to how the campus shifted to teaching and working online. Before the pandemic the alternative was to just shut down completely during a snowstorm or other hazardous situation.\n\u201cWe have learned, as a campus, how to operate without being in person,\u201d Smith said. \u201cThere certainly are arguments to be made on the effectiveness of being in person versus working remotely. But we can still do work. We can learn. And we can still conduct research to a certain extent. We may not be able to do it as well as in person, but we learned from the experience because we were forced to do it.\u201d\nFor Smith, working during the pandemic has been an exercise in continuity. He believes the experience has forced people to consider resiliency as a factor when running an operation.\n\u201cThat has been the overwhelming best lesson learned from this\n\u2014\nseeing resiliency in action. It\u2019s a testament to the people across campus who made it happen. It\u2019s not me or my office. It\u2019s everyone having to learn quickly how to adapt and continue their operations.\u201d\nSmith praised the work of colleagues across campus who are fighting to slow the spread of the virus.\n\u201cGeorgia Tech has led throughout this pandemic, whether it be from our amazing surveillance testing efforts to our campaign, Jackets Protect Jackets.\u00a0I expect our community to lead once again with vaccinations,\u201d said Smith, who took the vaccine as soon as it was available. \u201cThe vaccine is safe, proven, and effective against Covid-19.\u00a0I certainly encourage anyone who is hesitant to ask others about their experience and ask experts about the vaccine.\u201d\nSmith has experienced a lot of emergencies over the years. The one constant is that no two days are the same, and that\u2019s his favorite part of the job.\n\u201cI joke that this year sometimes feels a little bit like Groundhog Day, but typically in my field you never know what you\u2019re going to get,\u201d Smith said. \u201cWater mains don\u2019t tell you ahead of time if they're going to break. Construction cranes don\u2019t tell you that they may fail and start leaning precariously. These things happen without any notice. And even the ones that do come with notice, such as weather events, are ever changing, so as much as we think we know what may happen we really don\u2019t. You\u2019re always a phone call or a text away from dropping everything and transitioning to something else.\u201d\nAway From the Office\nWhen he isn\u2019t in the middle of managing an emergency, Smith enjoys fishing near Apalachicola, Florida, where his grandfather bought a house on a sparsely populated beach in the 1950s.\n\u201cI spent most of my summers there. Indian Pass is my home away from home, and it\u2019s my happy place. If I\u2019m having a rough day I just picture myself there,\u201d said Smith, who was last there in October.\n\u201cI took a break in July, and for the first time in my working career I took two weeks off. I say that, but I was still on conference calls,\u201d said Smith, acknowledging that it\u2019s difficult for him to completely disconnect from work.\n\u201cMy phone doesn\u2019t really ever get shut off. The only time that I\u2019m disconnected is when I\u2019m way offshore and out of cell range,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s nice on the one hand when I\u2019m fishing. On the other hand, when I\u2019m coming back and getting within cell range, I can\u2019t help but look at my phone and see what the day may have brought.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nContact\nVictor Rogers\nInstitute Communications\nEmail\nvictor.rogers@comm.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
