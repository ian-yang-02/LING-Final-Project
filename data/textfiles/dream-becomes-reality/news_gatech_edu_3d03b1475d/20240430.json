Her parents also love architecture and took her with them to open houses to admire the designs. \u201cIt really created a passion for architecture in me, and I still enjoy going to open houses today,\u201d said Davari, who grew up in Sugar Hill, Georgia, near Lake Lanier. \u201cAt one point, a lot of the realtors in my area knew me because of my frequent visits.\u201d\nDavari\u2019s childhood interest turned into a professional goal, and now she is receiving a master\u2019s degree in architecture. She also earned a bachelor\u2019s in architecture from Georgia Tech in 2021.\nHighlights from her studies at Tech include a residential internship in Florida and a studio project in Savannah, Georgia, where the students worked on a 150-acre site and designed a building in detail.\nOutside of the classroom, she enjoys many creative endeavors, including photography, baking, fashion, and jewelry making. \u201cI love many types of design,\u201d she said. \u201cA good architect is creative, and I am always trying to work on and improve that skill \u2014 and have a lot of fun while doing it.\u201d\nAfter graduating, she will work full time at an architectural firm and also work on getting her architectural license.\nDavari will miss the people she has met at Tech. \u201cIt is such a diverse place with amazing students and professors. I learned as much from my peers as I did from my professors, and I will miss seeing everyone daily.\u201d\nHer advice to current students is to continue working hard but find time for other activities they enjoy. \u201cIt is OK to take breaks and do things that make you happy,\u201d she said. \u201cEven though I did my undergraduate at Georgia Tech and went straight into the master\u2019s program, time goes by quicker than you might think.\u201d\nDavari\u2019s parents and her boyfriend will join her for Commencement, and a large group of family and friends will celebrate with her after the ceremony, which takes place Friday, May 5, at 3 p.m. in Bobby Dodd Stadium.\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nSchool of Architecture\nContact\nVictor Rogers\nInstitute Communications\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
