The Perry, Georgia, native has a bachelor\u2019s degree in political science from the University of Georgia and a master\u2019s in public administration from Georgia State University. He was an assistant registrar at the University of Georgia before coming to Georgia Tech in 2007.\n\u201cOur office supports students from the applicant phase all the way to the alumni phase, when they are still requesting transcripts, new diplomas, degree verification, and anything we can do to help them,\u201d Gray said.\nA lot of the support for students is now automated to improve efficiency.\n\u201cStudents are extremely busy. The last thing that they want to do is trek across campus to Tech Tower to ask us a question,\u201d Gray said. \u201cOver the years, the Registrar\u2019s Office has worked with central OIT and with various vendors to beef up our online presence and create as many self-service options as possible. Students may go through their OSCAR portal or through another secondary website to complete tasks with limited bureaucracy.\u201d\nThe Registrar\u2019s Office has 38 full-time employees assigned to seven teams: curriculum; registration, records, and customer service; academic services; athletic and degree certification; technology; academic scheduling; and online programs. The chief responsibilities of the office are serving as the Institute\u2019s primary steward for academic records and providing registration and other services related to the student experience. The staff also collaborates with academic units, other central offices, and several academic committees including student regulations, Institute curriculum committees, and the academic senate.\nThe office is currently working on a couple of projects that will have a significant impact on campus. The first, in collaboration with OIT, is to make additional OSCAR self-service changes that will give an updated look to menu items such as personal information, permits and overload request process, and transfer credit. The plan is to implement them this semester and in Spring 2024.\nThe office is also partnering with various academic units and other central offices to plan for enrollment growth on campus. \u201cWe are looking at it from multiple angles, including registration, transfer credit, degree progression, classroom space, and general services,\u201d said Gray.\nAt Commencement, the Registrar\u2019s Office assists the president in handing diplomas to graduates. Seeing students walk across the stage is one of the most rewarding parts of Gray\u2019s job. \u201cIt's fun to see their excitement, the dancing that some of them do, and the shouting,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just an all-around happy time.\u201d\nAway From Work\nWhen he isn\u2019t working, Gray can be found attending college football games. He has season tickets to see his alma mater and two-time reigning national champions, UGA.\n\u201cI will cheer for Tech as long as they\u2019re not playing Georgia,\u201d he said with a smile. \u201cI\u2019m a huge Georgia fan, but I just love all college football. I like the history and tradition that goes along with game day. It\u2019s awesome to see the small college towns come alive on a Saturday in the fall.\u201d\nHe also spends much of his leisure time perfecting his golf swing. \u201cI am a huge golfer. It\u2019s my passion,\u201d Gray said. \u201cMy handicap is about a 9, which is pretty good. But I\u2019d never say that I would like to be a professional golfer because I know I don\u2019t have that ability \u2014 but I would love to be a caddy for a professional golfer. I love it that much.\u201d\nGray, who started playing at 13, enjoys the strategy and the tinkering behind the game. \u201cI can\u2019t learn enough about it. So, you will find me on the range, hitting golf balls, or on the putting green trying to figure out how I can sink more putts and lower my scores. That\u2019s my No. 1 hobby.\u201d\nHis tinkering extends to working on projects around the house, like repairing an old lawn mower that wouldn\u2019t start. \u201cI watched a couple of YouTube videos, went through the process, and realized it was a carburetor issue. I took the lawnmower apart, took the carburetor apart, fixed the float that wasn\u2019t working correctly, and put everything back together. I pulled the starter cord and it worked. I know it may sound simple, but I love a challenge. So, it was a big victory for me.\u201d\nAdditional Media\nContact\nVictor Rogers\nInstitute Communications\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
