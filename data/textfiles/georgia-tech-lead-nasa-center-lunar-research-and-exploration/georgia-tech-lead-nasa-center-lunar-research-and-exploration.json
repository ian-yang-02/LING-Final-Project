The Center for Lunar Environment and Volatile Exploration Research (CLEVER) will be led by\nThomas Orlando , professor in the\nSchool of Chemistry and Biochemistry .\nCLEVER is the successor to Orlando\u2019s pioneering\nREVEALS\n(Radiation Effects on Volatiles and Exploration of Asteroids and Lunar Surfaces) center, and both are part of NASA\u2019s Solar System Exploration Research Virtual Institute (SSERVI) program.\nREVEALS and CLEVER look ahead to the return of humans to the moon for sustained periods \u2014 a key part of NASA\u2019s plan for space exploration in the coming decade. Volatiles such as water, molecular oxygen, methane, and hydrogen are crucial to supporting human activity on the moon. Dust is also important since the space-weathered particles can pose health effects to astronauts and hazards to the technology and hardware.\nThe interdisciplinary group of researchers supported by CLEVER will study how the solar wind and micrometeorites produce volatiles, research how ice and dust behave in the lunar environment, develop new materials to deal with potential dust buildup, and invent new analysis tools to support the upcoming crewed missions of the\nArtemis program .\n\u201c The resources and knowledge that CLEVER will produce will be useful for the sustainable presence of humans on the moon,\u201d Orlando says. \u201c We have the correct mix of fundamental science and exploration \u2014 real, fundamental, ground-truth measurements; very good theory/modeling; and engineering \u2014 an easy mix with Georgia Tech and outside partners.\u201d\nOrlando adds that CLEVER adopts a unique perspective on the challenges of understanding how to operate on Earth\u2019s moon. \u201cThe atomic and molecular view of processes with angstrom distances and femtosecond time scales can help unravel what is happening on planetary spatial scales and geological time frames,\u201d he says. \u201cWe can also translate our knowledge into materials, devices, and technology pretty quickly, and this is necessary if we want to help the Artemis astronauts.\u201d\nCLEVER includes investigators from Georgia Tech,\nUniversity of Georgia, the Florida Space Institute, University of Hawaii, Auburn University, Space Sciences Institute, the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, NASA Ames, NASA Kennedy Space Center, and partners in Italy and Germany. In addition to pursuing a blend of fundamental science and mission support, CLEVER\nwill also emphasize the research and career development of students and young investigators, another important goal of the SSERVI system.\nWriter: M.G.
