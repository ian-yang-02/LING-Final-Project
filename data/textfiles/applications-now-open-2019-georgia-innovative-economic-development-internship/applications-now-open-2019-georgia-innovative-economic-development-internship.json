(For details and requirements, apply here:\u00a0 stip.gatech.edu/apply/ ).\nThe highly competitive, 10-week, paid internship is designed to allow graduate students to further develop and pursue research in an innovative economic development project. At the end of the internship period, interns, who will receive a $6,000 stipend, will have an opportunity to present their project findings to\u00a0economic development and innovation groups.\nApplications will be accepted through Feb. 28, 2019 and the internship is open to any graduate student who has\u00a0completed the first year of a two-year master\u2019s program or enrolled in a doctoral program at a public university in the University System of Georgia.\nThose accepted into the program will be notified by the end of March 2019.\nSTIP is a globally recognized program that conducts research-based policy analyses and reports of innovation policy, science, and technology for organizations and governments domestically and internationally.\n\u201cStudents can delve deeply into their research and apply that analysis and study to real-world challenges,\u201d said Jan Youtie, STIP program director.\n\u201cThis is an excellent opportunity for enterprising students who want to explore how their own ideas can have an impact on any number of subject areas ranging from strategic or emerging technologies and economic modeling, to research commercialization and sustainability.\u201d\nFormer interns, such as Mirit Friedman, a graduate student pursuing a\u00a0master\u2019s degree in city and regional planning at Georgia Tech\u2019s School of City & Regional Planning, say the experience is a rewarding one.\nHer\u00a0research explored ways the Atlanta Community Food Bank could activate its vast partnership network in new ways to better\u00a0support its clients\u2019 economic mobility.\n\u201cI was able to explore my research interests under the guidance of economic development experts and restricting the research to the summer period forced me to focus on an initial research question I could test and explore in the short period,\u201d Friedman said, adding the program\u2019s pace and structure was invaluable.\n\u201cWe had to develop our research substantially each week and being held to that pace of research development helped prepare me for the demanding deadlines the workforce expects,\u201d she said. \u201cAdditionally, having my research be pushed in directions I hadn't anticipated required me to respond to and explore new ideas that ultimately helped me\u00a0hone in on a more explicit research topic.\u201d\nSupraja Sudharsan, a doctoral candidate studying comparative urban governance in Tech\u2019s Sam Nunn School of International Affairs, echoed Friedman\u2019s sentiments.\n\u201cI evaluated the smart city projects that have been piloted, underway or completed in three cities in Atlanta, Austin, and Pittsburgh,\u201d she said. \u201cBy comparatively studying their plans, initiatives, associated partnerships, and the organizational process involved in their development and implementation, the study served to look beyond the hype of smart cities to understand how cities develop and implement smart city projects.\n\u201cThe program provided exposure to organizational processes within city government organizations and the challenge of effecting change, which is an area of interest in my doctoral research.\u201d\nAbout the Science, Technology, and Innovation Policy program\nThe Science, Technology, and Innovation Policy program at Georgia Tech is an internationallyrecognized offering of the Georgia Institute of Technology that offers in-depth and critical research-based analyses of innovation policy, science, and technology to organizations and governments around the world.
