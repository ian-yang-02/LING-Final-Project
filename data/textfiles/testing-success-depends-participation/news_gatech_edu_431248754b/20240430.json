Broad testing is essential, and everyone is encouraged to actively participate on a weekly basis.\nTesting is done on a walk-up basis, is free of charge, and takes just a few minutes. Before each visit to one of the\ntesting sites\non campus , participants should login to\nmytest.gatech.edu\nwith their Georgia Tech account, complete the survey, and generate a tracking barcode for the test.\nAt the testing site, participants will apply hand sanitizer and show their tracking barcode to the attendant.\nAfter choosing a workstation, participants will place a saliva sample into a small plastic cup, then draw a sample into a pipette. The samples will then be transferred to a vial containing a viral inactivation buffer, packaged, and deposited into a bin before leaving the testing site. Samples are processed in a campus lab, and processing is usually completed within 48 hours.\nOn your way out, grab a cookie and a sticker as a treat for participating, and to show others that you got tested.\nParticipants\nwith a positive test\nwill be informed about what to do next, including isolation, support resources, and medical care. Because of federal and state requirements, all participants will be asked to provide limited personal information\u00a0at the time of testing.\nIn addition to getting tested regularly, members of the campus community are encouraged to continue physical distancing, wearing masks, regular handwashing, and adhering to all\ncampus health and safety guidelines . These are the best ways to slow the spread of the virus \u2014 and should be followed before and even after getting vaccinated.\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nSurveillance Testing Locations and Hours\nCampus Safety Guidelines\nIsolation and Quarantine Information\nCovid-19 Vaccine Information\nContact\nVictor Rogers\nInstitute Communications\nEmail\nvictor.rogers@comm.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
