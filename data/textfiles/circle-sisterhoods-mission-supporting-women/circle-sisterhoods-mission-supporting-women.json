The group had planned to send Tech students to Guatemala for the build, but travel advisories made it impossible. Instead, the money raised for travel was used to fund an Enroll Program Grant for the Cant\u00f3n La Soldedad community.\n\u201cThis grant will ensure the community has resources to maintain school enrollment and attendance by providing families with micro-loans and food insecurity resources,\u201d Andani said.\nThis is the second school that Georgia Tech students have supported. In 2018, a group of 18 Tech students\ntraveled to Senegal\nto construct a school. CPC, which is composed of nine sororities on campus, uses its\nCircle of Sisterhood\nphilanthropic arm to support these educational efforts.\nNow, CPC turns its attention to its third annual Circle of Sisterhood Holiday Marketplace. The event features women entrepreneurs as vendors and is set up in time for holiday shopping. The group is currently accepting applications for vendors for this year\u2019s event;\nsubmissions close Friday, Oct. 20 . All proceeds from the event benefit the Circle of Sisterhood Foundation and future projects that provide educational opportunities for women.\n\u201cI look forward to this event every year,\u201d said Andani, who is organizing it this year. \u201c I\nam thrilled for all the awareness it will generate for Circle of Sisterhood and our women entrepreneurs. Our work shows that, regardless of race, ethnicity, or any other factors, we are one sisterhood and together we can uplift and empower women and girls all around the world.\u201d\nThis year\u2019s Holiday Marketplace is set to take place Sunday, Dec. 3, from noon to 4 p.m. at Tech Green, and is free to attend.\nWhile it\u2019s just one afternoon, to Andani, the event is emblematic of the community Tech students have built for each other.\n\u201cThroughout my time at Georgia Tech, the work I have been able to do with the Collegiate Panhellenic Council and Circle of Sisterhood has been empowering for me as a woman and a Tech student,\u201d she said. \u201cComing in, I didn\u2019t really know where I would fit in or how I\u2019d be able to express my passion of advocating for women and education. Knowing that there are women in our community who not only support and empower one another but also those around the world is so comforting and has made my journey here so much more meaningful. I hope everyone can find a community like this and participate in initiatives that help make a difference in the lives of others.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nLearn More About the School Build\nCollegiate Panhellenic Council\nCircle of Sisterhood\nContact\nKristen Bailey\nInstitute Communications\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
