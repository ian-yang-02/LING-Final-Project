But its high cost has spurred research efforts to find ways to use smaller amounts of it while maintaining the same catalytic activity.\n\u201cThere\u2019s always going to be an initial cost for producing a fuel cell with platinum catalysts, and it\u2019s important to keep that cost as low as possible,\u201d said Faisal Alamgir, an associate professor in Georgia Tech\u2019s School of Materials Science and Engineering. \u201cBut the real cost of a fuel cell system is calculated by how long that system lasts, and this is a question of durability.\n\u201cRecently there\u2019s been a push to use catalytic systems without platinum, but the problem is that there hasn\u2019t been a system proposed so far that simultaneously matches the catalytic activity and the durability of platinum,\u201d Alamgir said.\nThe Georgia Tech researchers tried a different strategy. In the study, which was published on September 18 in the journal\u00a0 Advanced Functional Materials\nand supported by the National Science Foundation, they describe creating several systems that used atomically-thin films of platinum supported by a layer of graphene \u2013 effectively maximizing the total surface area of the platinum available for catalytic reactions and using a much smaller amount of the precious metal.\nMost platinum-based catalytic systems use nanoparticles of the metal chemically bonded to a support surface, where surface atoms of the particles do most of the catalytic work, and the catalytic potential of the atoms beneath the surface is never utilized as fully as the surface atoms, if at all.\nAdditionally, the researchers showed that the new platinum films that are at least two atoms thick outperformed nanoparticle platinum in the dissociation energy, which is a measure of the energy cost of dislodging a surface platinum atom. That measurement suggests those films could make potentially longer-lasting catalytic systems.\nTo prepare the atomically-thin films, the researchers used a process called electrochemical atomic layer deposition to grow platinum monolayers on a layer of graphene, creating samples that had one, two or three atomic layers of atoms. The researchers then tested the samples for dissociation energy and compared the results to the energy of a single atom of platinum on graphene as well as the energy from a common configurations of platinum nanoparticles used in catalysts.\n\u201cThe fundamental question at the heart of this work was whether it was possible that a combination of metallic and covalent bonding can render the platinum atoms in a platinum-graphene combination more stable than their counterparts in bulk platinum used commonly in catalysts that are supported by metallic bonding,\u201d said Seung Soon Jang, an associate professor in the School of Materials Science and Engineering.\nThe researchers found that the bond between neighboring platinum atoms in the film essentially combines forces with the bond between the film and the graphene layer to provide reinforcement across the system. That was especially true in the platinum film that was two atoms thick.\n\u201cTypically metallic films below a certain thickness are not stable because the bonds between them are not directional, and they tend to roll over each other and conglomerate to form a particle,\u201d Alamgir said. \u201cBut that\u2019s not true with graphene, which is stable in a two-dimensional form, even one atom thick, because it has very strong covalent directional bonds between its neighboring atoms. So this new catalytic system could leverage the directional bonding of the graphene to support an atomically-thin film of platinum.\u201d\nFuture research will involve further testing of how the films behave in a catalytic environment. The researchers found in earlier research on graphene-platinum films that the material behaves similarly in catalytic reactions regardless of which side \u2013 graphene or platinum \u2013 is the exposed active surface.\n\u201cIn this configuration, the graphene is not acting as a separate entity from the platinum,\u201d Alamgir said. \u201cThey\u2019re working together as one. So we believe that if you\u2019re exposing the graphene side, you get the same catalytic activity and you could further protect the platinum, potentially further enhancing durability.\u201d\nThis research was supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF) under grant Nos. 1103827 and 106913.
