For microorganisms in the oceans \u2013 including those that capture half of the carbon taken out of the atmosphere every day \u2013 viruses are a major threat. But a paper published January 25 in the journal\nNature Microbiology\nshows that there\u2019s much less certainty about the size of these viral populations than scientists had long believed. Collecting and re-examining more than 5,600 estimates of ocean microbial cell and virus populations recorded over the past 25 years, researchers have found that viral populations vary dramatically from location to location, and at differing depths in the sea. The study highlights another source of uncertainty governing climate models and other biogeochemical measures. \u201cWhat was surprising was that there was not a constant relationship, as people had assumed, between the number of microbial cells and the number of viruses,\u201d said\nJoshua Weitz , an associate professor in the\nSchool of Biology\nat the Georgia Institute of Technology and one of the paper\u2019s two senior co-authors. \u201cBecause viruses are parasites, it was assumed that their number would vary linearly with the number of microbes. We found that the ratio does not remain constant, but decreases systematically as the number of microbes increases.\u201d The research, which involved authors from 14 different institutions, was initiated as part of a working group from the National Institute for Mathematical and Biological Synthesis (NIMBioS), which is supported by the National Science Foundation. The research was completed with additional support from the Burroughs Wellcome Fund and the Simons Foundation. The research was co-led by Steven Wilhelm, a professor of microbiology at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. In the datasets examined by the researchers, the ratio of viruses to microbes varied from approximately 1 to 1 and 150 to 1 in surface waters, and from 5 to 1 and 75 to 1 in the deeper ocean. For years, scientists had utilized a baseline ratio of 10 to 1 \u2013 ten times more viruses than microbes \u2013 which may not adequately represent conditions in many marine ecosystems. \u201cA marine environment with 100-fold more viruses than microbes may have very different rates of microbial recycling than an environment with far fewer viruses,\u201d said Weitz. \u201cOur study begins to challenge the notion of a uniform ecosystem role for viruses.\u201d A key target for viruses are cyanobacteria \u2013 marine microorganisms that obtain their energy through photosynthesis in a process that takes carbon out of the atmosphere. What happens to the carbon these tiny organisms remove may be determined by whether they are eaten by larger grazing creatures \u2013 or die from viral infections. When these cyanobacteria die from infections, their carbon is likely to remain in the top of the water column, where it can nourish other microorganisms. If they are eaten by larger creatures, their carbon is likely to sink into the deeper ocean as the grazers die or excrete the carbon in in their feces. \u201cViruses have a role in shunting some of the carbon away from the deep ocean and keeping it in the surface ocean,\u201d said Wilhelm. \u201cQuantifying the strength of the viral shunt remains a vital issue.\u201d Influenza and measles come to mind when most people think of viruses, but the bulk of world\u2019s viruses actually infect microorganisms. Estimates suggest that a single liter of seawater typically contain more than ten billion viruses. To better understand this population, the researchers conducted a meta-analysis of the microbial and virus abundance data that had been collected over multiple decades, including datasets collected by many of the co-authors whose laboratories are based in the United States, Canada and Europe. The data had been obtained using a variety of techniques, including epifluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. By combining data collected by 11 different research groups, the researchers created a big picture from many smaller ones. The statistical relationships between viruses and microbial cells, analyzed by first-author Charles Wigington from Georgia Tech and second-author Derek Sonderegger from Northern Arizona University, show the range of variation. The available data provides information about the abundance of viral particles, not their diversity. Viruses are selective in the microbes they target, meaning the true rates of infection require a renewed focus on virus-microbe infection networks. \u201cFuture research should focus on examining the relationship between ocean microorganisms and viruses at the scale of relevant interactions,\u201d said Weitz, \u201cMore ocean surveys are needed to fill in the many blanks for this critical part of the carbon cycle. Indeed, virus infections of microbes could change the flux of carbon and nutrients on a global scale.\u201d This work was supported by National Science Foundation (NSF) grants OCE-1233760 and OCE-1061352, a Career Award at the Scientific Interface from the Burroughs Wellcome Fund and a Simons Foundation SCOPE grant.
