Jeff Mao and Tyler Ma, both second-year computer science students, have developed a web-based platform that could help millions of online sellers save time and money.\nTeam SellRaze\u2019s idea won a $20,000 check and earned Mao and Ma a coveted spot in Tech\u2019s\nStartup Launch\nprogram, which will give them access to\ncoaching from experienced entrepreneurs, access to venture capital possibilities, and a path to fast-track their idea into a viable startup.\nDuring the presentation, the pair demonstrated the process of taking a single product listing on Amazon and adding it to eBay, which took 11 minutes and multiple steps. With SellRaze, Mao and Ma say sellers can accomplish the same task in seconds and a couple of clicks.\n\u201cList once, sell everywhere,\u201d Mao explained.\nOne InVenture Prize judge, the board director of Intercontinental Hotels Group and Intercontinental Exchange, asked the team how they planned to make money.\nMao said they would offer a \u201cfremium\u201d model, giving users some free listings and the option to pay for increasing tiers of multiple listings. He also explained that their web platform offered a wealth of data about which products sell the best and the times and locations they are in highest demand \u2014 data that sellers and retailers would pay for.\nAfter winning InVenture, the team now plans to expand their platform to a wider variety of online retailing sites like Depop, GOAT, Mercari, and Poshmark. \u201cWalmart has been scaling their online presence. We also want to add them,\u201d Ma said.\nSellRaze will also receive a free U.S. patent filing from Georgia Tech\u2019s Office of Technology Licensing. Well worth the hard work they have put into developing the platform, Mao and Ma say half the code was written between 2 and 7 a.m.\nSecond place and $10,000 went to Team SpoilerALERT, three biomedical engineering students who invented an antibody test for insulin degradation allowing diabetic patients to evaluate the effectiveness of the drugs they take daily.\n\u201cWe believe all people with diabetes deserve to trust their medication,\u201d said Grady Lee, team member and a former Georgia Tech football player.\nThe $5,000 People\u2019s Choice Award, selected by the television viewing audience, went to Julia Pina and her Novela Lamp, which allows children to tell stories using wooden cutouts of shapes, characters, and scenes.\nPina, an industrial design major, has already been in talks with toy retailers. She says her lamp promotes imaginative play and communication skills through creative expression and helps children and families reduce screen time.\nAfter taking first place in the 15th edition of the InVenture Prize, Team SellRaze hoisted the trophy and thanked the fans in the Ferst Center. \u201cIt\u2019s a major milestone in our journey as entrepreneurs.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nGeorgia Tech InVenture Prize\n2023 InVenture Prize Finalists\nContact\nBlair Meeks\nInstitute Communications\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
