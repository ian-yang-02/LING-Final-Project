Both are Georgia Tech scientists doing research related to astrobiology \u2014 life in the cosmos \u2014 but until last year they hardly talked to each other as researchers with common interests.\n\u201cWe are all so busy,\u201d says\u00a0 Grover , a professor in the School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, a scientific collaborator at the\u00a0 NSF/NASA Center for Chemical Evolution (CCE) , and a member of the\u00a0 Center for Space Technology and Research (C-STAR) .\nNow, Grover,\u00a0 Glass , and others at Tech are members of a growing community that\u2019s coalescing astrobiology activities across campus. In a public debut of sorts, six members of\u00a0 Georgia Tech Astrobiology , as the community calls itself, participated in\u00a0 the 2017 Dragon Con , the premier pop-culture convention on science fiction and fantasy. They wowed the audience, not by fiction or fantasy or over-the-top costumes, but by progress in answering fundamental questions \u2014 How did life begin? Where else could life exist? All happening right next door to the meeting venue, at Georgia Tech.\nThe growing visibility of researchers interested in astrobiology is helping Georgia Tech emerge as a powerhouse in the field. At minimum, says\u00a0 Kenneth Knoespel , a historian of science and professor in the Ivan Allen College of Liberal Arts, \u201cit affirms the importance of this community at Georgia Tech and the importance of astrobiology as a new configuration of disciplines that brings together the natural and human sciences.\u201d\nTEEMING WITH TALENT\n\u201cGeorgia Tech is clearly recognized as a hub for astrobiology and maybe the one that\u2019s growing the most quickly,\u201d says\u00a0 Edward Goolish , the deputy director of the\u00a0 NASA Astrobiology Institute \u00a0(NAI), one of the six elements of the NASA Astrobiology Program. People at Georgia Tech, Goolish adds, \u201chave been generous with their time and have contributed in important ways when NASA has reached out to the science community for input.\u201d\nThe community includes physicists, chemists, biologists, Earth and planetary scientists, and engineers, as well as historians of science and writers. The scientists are figuring out how life emerged and evolved to the biosphere we know, inventing instruments to detect life outside Earth, and searching for other habitable places in the universe. The science historians and writers are witnessing science in the making and perhaps gathering fodder for the next volume of science fiction.\nBroadly defined, astrobiology is the study of life in the cosmos. Its central questions are \u201cWhat is the origin of life?\u201d and \u201cDoes life exist beyond Earth?\u201d Humans have asked these questions since\u00a0 time immemorial . That they are still around attests to the difficulty of discovering and assembling the pieces of a formidable puzzle: the emergence of a biosphere on a planet.\nHow formidable? According to\u00a0 Eric Smith , a theoretician in the\u00a0 NASA Astrobiology Institute\u2019s team at Georgia Tech \u00a0(NAI-GT), understanding the nature of the transition from a planet without a biosphere to one with a biosphere should be central to origins-of-life inquiries. However, he says, \u201ca lot of the language to enable that understanding doesn\u2019t exist yet.\u201d\nTHREE PILLARS\nAt Georgia Tech, research teams are working across the breadth of questions central to astrobiology. Their activities are exemplified by three specialized research groups: CCE, NAI-GT, and C-STAR.\nCCE is building a community in origin-of-life research, said its director,\u00a0 Nicholas V. Hud ,\u00a0 at a symposium organized by Georgia Tech Astrobiology last month . In finding answers, CCE takes two approaches, Hud explained. \u201cBottom up,\u201d it starts with geology and chemistry and understanding the\u00a0 formation \u00a0of the first polymers of life, which is a major focus of Hud\u2019s. \u201cTop down,\u201d it starts with biology, genetics, and looking back in time at persistent, conserved molecular motifs, as exemplified by\u00a0 the work of Loren Williams on ribosomes .\nLike digging a tunnel underground from opposite ends and meeting somewhere in between, the two approaches are converging on the coevolution of the biopolymers of life. Chemistry and biology are telling us the same thing, say Hud and Williams, both professors in the School of Chemistry and Biochemistry (SoCB) and members of the Parker H. Petit Institute for Bioengineering and Bioscience (IBB).\nAt NAI-GT, \u201cwe\u00a0 start \u00a0at the level of the cell,\u201d says\u00a0 Frank Rosenzweig , the School of Biological Sciences (SoBS) professor who leads the NASA group. \u201cOnce you have all this biochemistry wrapped in a cell, what happens then? How do they become associated as multicellular organisms? How do they engage in biochemistries that change the environment? We need to understand the interaction between the evolution of life and the evolution of its abiotic surrounding to have a chance of recognizing life elsewhere.\n\u201cAlthough life on Earth manifests in different forms, all are governed by laws of growth, inheritance, and variability,\u201d says Rosenzweig, also a member of IBB. NAI-GT aims to \u201cilluminate and interpret these laws via laboratory-based evolution experiments with microbial populations.\u201d An example is the\u00a0 exploration of the origin of multicellularity by experimentally evolving yeast , as described in the September symposium by\u00a0 Will Ratcliff , an\u00a0 assistant professor \u00a0in SoBS.\nFor C-STAR-affiliated faculty, habitability is one key question. What events and conditions in the abiotic sphere yield environments that support life? The NASA-supported work of\u00a0 Jennifer Glass \u00a0and\u00a0 Chris Reinhard , in the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences (EAS), exemplify the search for answers in this realm.\nWhat signals should we monitor in search of life elsewhere in the universe? What tools do we need to probe for signs of life from the comfort of Earth? What hazards should we prepare for if humans were to go to other worlds?\nIn EAS, C-STAR members and planetary scientists\u00a0 Carol Paty ,\u00a0 Britney Schmidt , and\u00a0 James Wray \u00a0are co-investigators of NASA-funded projects to answer these questions. So is C-STAR member\u00a0 Paul Steffes , in the School of Electrical and\u00a0 Computer Engineering , as well as C-STAR Director\u00a0 Thomas Orlando \u00a0and C-STAR member\u00a0 Amanda Stockton , in SoCB.\nWHAT\u2019S NEXT\nWith the talent on campus, Georgia Tech is becoming well known in the field of astrobiology. At the\u00a0 2017 Astrobiology Scientific Conference , in Mesa, Ariz., last April, the Georgia Tech \u201cposse\u201d numbered about 30 faculty and students. Last summer, attendees of\u00a0 AbGradCon (Astrobiology Graduate Conference) 2017 \u00a0selected Georgia Tech to host the\u00a0 2018 event . This popular meeting for students is funded primarily by the\u00a0 NASA Astrobiology Institute .\nThe astrobiology community at Georgia Tech is \u201chealthy,\u201d Smith says. \u201cThe people in strategic positions have good priorities in the sophistication and intellectual integrity they are trying to support.\u201d\nThe community \u2014 now 85 strong and growing \u2014 is raring to make its presence felt. It has an ambitious schedule for the 2017 - 18 school year, spearheaded by the September symposium.\nLed by Grover as principal investigator, and with contributions from Glass, Knoespel, Paty, Reinhard, Rosenzweig, Schmidt, Williams, and others \u2014\u00a0 Rebecca Burnett , Ivan Allen College of Liberal Arts;\u00a0 Glenn Lightsey , School of Aerospace Engineering and C-STAR; and\u00a0 Christopher Parsons , CCE \u2014 their proposal for seven projects received funding from the Georgia Tech\u00a0 Strategic Plan Advisory Group (SPAG) \u00a0and the Colleges of Engineering, Liberal Arts, and Sciences.\nThe projects aim to showcase the quality and variety of astrobiology projects at Tech, highlight the social impact of these projects, and strengthen the sense of community among faculty and students. The goals will be achieved through formal gatherings, educational innovations, and public outreach.\n\u201cAs I see it, the point of research universities is to tackle the really important, really deep, and really challenging questions \u2014 the ones at the edge of, or even beyond, our reach; the ones that present not just the possibility but the likelihood of failure,\u201d said College of Sciences Dean and\u00a0 Sutherland Chair \u00a0Paul M. Goldbart at the September symposium. \u201cIt\u2019s our duty as administrators to do everything we can to support this kind of truly adventurous research.\u201d\nWhat the astrobiology community is doing not only is exciting, Goldbart said. But also, \u201cit could hardly fit better with the dreams of the College of Sciences and of Georgia Tech.\u201d\nGeorgia Tech Researchers Working Toward the Goals of NASA\u2019s Astrobiology Program Planetary Science and Technology through Analog Research (P-STAR)\nJennifer Glass, School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences\nBritney Schmidt, School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences\nAmanda Stockton, School of Chemistry and Biochemistry Planetary Instrument Concepts for the Advancement of Solar System Observations (PICASSO)\nAmanda Stockton Exobiology: Early Evolution of Life and the Biosphere\nFrank Rosenzweig, School of Biological Sciences Exobiology: Evolution of Advanced Life\nWilliam Ratcliff, School of Biological Sciences Exobiology: Prebiotic Evolution\nLoren Williams, School of Chemistry and Biochemistry Exobiology: Methane and Iron Metabolisms in Ancient Oceans\nJennifer Glass School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences Faculty Affiliated with NASA Astrobiology Institute (NAI)\nJennifer Glass, Chris Reinhard, and Yuanzhi Tang, with University of California, Riverside, team\nJames Wray, with SETI Institute team\nNAI Team at Georgia Tech School of Biological Sciences\nPhillip Gerrish\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 William Ratcliff\nKennda Lynch \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Frank Rosenzweig\nNASA Postdoctoral Program Fellows\nBradley Burcar with Nicholas Hud\nPeter Conlin with William Ratcliff\nMoran Frenkel-Pinter with Loren Williams\nKazumi Ozaki with Chris Reinhard\nNicholas Speller with Amanda Stockton 2018 AbGradCon Organizers\nMarcus Bray\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justin Lawrence\nBradley Burcar\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Adriana Lozoya\nAnthony Burnetti\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Kennda Lynch\nHeather Chilton \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Santiago Mestre Fos\nChase Chivers\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Marshall Seaton\nDedra Eichstedt\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Micah Schaible\nZachary Duca\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Elizabeth Spiers\nJennifer Farrar\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Scot Sutton\nNicholas Kovacs \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nadia Szeinbaum\nGeorge Tan, Conference Chair\u00a0 Note: This list is not meant to be comprehensive; it represents information that was available as of October 2017.\nPHOTO CAPTIONS\nGeorgia Tech at AbSciCon 2017.\u00a0 This photo shows only some of the Georgia Tech researchers who attended.
