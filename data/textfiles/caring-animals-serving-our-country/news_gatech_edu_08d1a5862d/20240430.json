Making the event more personal and unusual, Purvis\u2019s coworker, Ken Zielmanski, director of quality assurance for GCMI\u2019s T3 Labs and a retired Army lieutenant colonel, performed the re-enlistment ceremony.\nPurvis has worked at GCMI off and on since 2006.\u00a0GCMI accelerates the development,\u00a0testing, training, and commercialization of innovative medical products to improve quality-based outcomes and delivery of healthcare for patients.\n\u201cMy re-enlistment with Ken was so special because it was not only a retired officer who swore me in, he is a friend and mentor,\u201d Purvis said, explaining she first enlisted in the Army Reserve in 2007.\u00a0This re-enlistment will take her into retirement.\nZielmanski was delighted to be asked to perform the ceremony. \u201cShe could go into any enlistment office and get that done,\u201d he said. \u201cI felt honored and privileged that she asked me.\u201d\nPurvis\u2019s work for the Army is similar in scope to her duties at GCMI. \u201cMy MOS \u2014 military occupational specialty \u2014 in the Army is a 68T or animal care specialist,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s the equivalent of a veterinary technician on the civilian side.\u00a0The main mission as a 68T in the Army is caring for the military working dogs.\u201d\nHer specialty is a rare one as the Army is the only branch of the military that has veterinarians and veterinary technicians. Purvis will also work with ceremonial animals, including horses, and participate in missions overseas to help manage animal herds.\n\u201cI know how she performs here as a vet tech,\u201d Zielmanski said, \u201cand she\u2019s a very, very good vet tech. I think very highly of her. The only way you make the service good is to have good people in it. And she\u2019s one of the best people that we have. I know she\u2019s a benefit to the service.\u201d\nHer success both in the Army Reserve and at GCMI, is a testament to her character, said Sherry N. Farrugia, GCMI CEO.\n\u201cTrisha is held in high regard by her teammates, and embodies the Army\u2019s values in everything she does,\u201d Farrugia said. \u201cShe always fulfills her obligations, has respect for others, and\u00a0does everything with honor, integrity, and courage.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nContact\nKaren Kirkpatrick\nkaren.kirkpatrick@innovate.gatech.edu\n770.364.0579\nEmail\nkaren.kirkpatrick@innovate.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
