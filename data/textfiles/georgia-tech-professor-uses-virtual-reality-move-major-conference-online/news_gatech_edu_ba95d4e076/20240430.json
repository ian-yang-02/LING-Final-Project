The event brings together people from around the world to examine the latest research and advancements in the area of virtual reality (VR).\nAttendees\u00a0watched presentations and invited talks and participated in poster and demonstration sessions. It\u2019s a typical academic conference in every way except for one significant change this year: it will take place entirely online, with social events hosted completely in virtual environments.\nBlair MacIntyre , a professor in Georgia Tech\u2019s\nSchool of Interactive Computing\nand IEEE VR conference co-chair, proposed transitioning to an all-virtual event to support social distancing recommendations related to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\u201cWe were planning on a small experiment with online attendees to investigate the use of VR to make conferences more accessible and sustainable. Suddenly we needed to ramp up to accommodate everyone across all traditional conference activities,\u201d MacIntyre said.\nThe entire five-day event convened in Mozilla Hubs, an online platform for remote virtual experiences. IEEE VR marks the first time that a major academic conference of this scale will move online and depend solely on a virtual environment platform, including the social networking sessions that are an essential part of conferences.\nThe virtual experience merges video conferencing, video streaming, and online chat platforms with a custom version of Hubs. The platform operates in most web browsers, and conference attendees can join whether or not they have a VR device. As with an in-person conference, participants will watch and discuss talks, take part in parallel sessions, and network one-on-one while interacting through avatars.\nThe conference is\u00a0taking\u00a0place in Eastern Standard Time. While organizers acknowledge that it will be difficult for people in other time zones to attend, they say there are other benefits of a virtual conference such as better work-life balance.\n\u201cOne of the hardest things for people to do in this sort of format is focus on the content,\u201d said Kyle Johnsen, IEEE VR co-chair and associate professor of engineering in the College of Engineering, University of Georgia. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to a virtual conference, you need to treat it like you\u2019re at an in-person conference, at least during the business day. One of the huge advantages is that you still get to tuck your kids in at night, which is awesome, and we don\u2019t want to lose that, but you do need to maintain the same level of time commitment. That\u2019s the value of conferences.\u201d\nSocial Change Through Technology\nMacIntyre began exploring the use of Hubs in 2019 to address climate change and the carbon impact of long-haul flights to academic conferences. He points out that the carbon impact of a recent round-trip he took to a conference in Berlin, Germany, was higher than that of his own four-person household for an entire month.\nHe also views virtual experiences as a way of democratizing academic conferences, which are often limited to attendees from well-funded colleges, universities, and companies, while shutting out those who can\u2019t afford to spend thousands of dollars on travel or leave their jobs or families for a week or more.\n\u201cIf we can take something like IEEE VR, which is normally around 1,000 people, and turn it into an event where 10,000 people can attend, we\u2019ll have a much more diverse and inclusive event.\u201d\nNow, with recent global challenges of the coronavirus, technology is once again at the forefront of shaping our society \u2013 changes that we\u2019re seeing, and living, in real-time. Whether it\u2019s attending a virtual reality conference, working remotely, or taking a class online, \u201ctechnology has the opportunity to help people connect,\u201d MacIntyre said.\nOne recent example \u2013 the City of Atlanta has created an emergency fund to assist those impacted by COVID-19, $1 million of which will go toward purchasing technology to support the city\u2019s telework deployment.\nWhile our current crisis has forced an evolution in how we\u2019re interacting through technology, he wonders about a permanent change in the future. \u201cHow many companies will shift to online? How many people will demand the opportunity? It will be interesting to see how we all feel after coming out of this forced remote experiment.\u201d\nAny long-term technology transformation would mean an entire cultural shift, he said. \u201cThe technologies are there and can support remote work and education in different ways, but it only works if there\u2019s a commitment.\u201d\nResearch News\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\n177 North Avenue\nAtlanta, Georgia\u00a0 30332-0181\u00a0 USA\nMedia Relations Contacts : John Toon (404-894-6986) (jtoon@gatech.edu) or Ben Brumfield (404-272-2780) (ben.brumfield@comm.gatech.edu).\nWriter : Alyson Powell Key\nAdditional Images\nContact\nJohn Toon\nResearch News\n(404) 894-6986\nEmail\njtoon@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
