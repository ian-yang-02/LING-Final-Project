With more than 20,000 employees, Pearson is the world\u2019s leading learning company, serving customers in nearly 200 countries with digital content, assessments, and data in the areas of English language learning, higher education, virtual learning, workforce skills, and assessments and qualifications.\u00a0She has been at Pearson since 2014, most recently serving as chief compliance officer and a member of Pearson\u2019s legal leadership team, where her work focused on anti-bribery and corruption, trade sanctions, investigations, and a transformation of the global compliance function. Before serving as their chief compliance officer, she served as vice president of Global Compliance as well as vice president, senior counsel for North America, among other roles.\n\u201cDanette Joslyn-Gaul brings to Tech an incredible wealth of experience and knowledge, and I am excited to welcome her as our next general counsel and vice president for Ethics, Compliance and Legal Affairs,\u201d said President \u00c1ngel Cabrera. \u201cHer impressive background includes service in both the private and public sectors, including to the state of Georgia. This will position her well in the role, and I look forward to working with her as a member of my leadership team.\u201d\nAs general counsel and vice president for Ethics, Compliance and Legal Affairs, Joslyn-Gaul will serve as a member of President Cabrera\u2019s cabinet and oversee the Office of the General Counsel by providing leadership, oversight, and direction on all legal and ethics matters for Georgia Tech, managing an office of 45 employees, and managing issues related to risk, compliance, legal affairs, employment, intellectual property, and litigation, as well as related community and government relations issues, as they arise.\nJoslyn-Gaul\u2019s career spans nearly three decades, including service to two Georgia governors. Notably, she was one of the youngest attorneys to ever serve as executive counsel to Georgia Gov. Zell Miller. As part of the Miller administration, she worked closely with the General Assembly to codify the HOPE Scholarship, among other initiatives, and helped with the implementation of the governor's plan to diversify the judiciary in the state of Georgia.\nShe then served as director of State Affairs at Emory University, where her leadership efforts saw increased funding for Grady Hospital, passage of research confidentiality legislation, and the launch of a strategic plan for the Georgia Cancer Coalition. She would later serve as the first general counsel and head of government relations for the Georgia Technology Authority. She then joined Wimberly, Lawson, Steckel, Schneider & Stine, P.C., a management-side labor and employment firm and became partner. Her tenure there included cases before federal and state courts, hearings, trials, mediations, arbitrations, and arguments before the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. She holds a bachelor\u2019s degree in International Studies and Spanish from Rhodes College and a Juris Doctor from Emory University School of Law.\n\u201cI am so honored and excited for the opportunity to come to Georgia Tech at such an important time for the Institute, the City of Atlanta, and the State of Georgia,\u201d said Joslyn-Gaul. \u201cI very much look forward to working with the President, his Cabinet, the Ethics, Compliance and Legal Affairs teams, and the Institute to implement its bold strategic plan in a sustainable way.\u201d\nShe is a nationally and internationally recognized expert and leader. She was the recipient of\nLawyer Monthly Magazine\u2019s\n\u201cWomen in Law Awards-Global Compliance\u201d in 2020 and was a finalist for the Women in Compliance Awards\u2019 \u201cChief Compliance Officer, Large Company\u201d in 2019 and 2020. Additionally, she was awarded the Top Compliance Counsel\u2019s \u201cFirst Chair Award\u201d in 2019 and was a finalist for Women in Compliance Awards\u2019 \u201cIn-House Compliance Team of the Year\u201d in 2018. She was also the recipient of several corporate honors connected to her leadership at Pearson, including leadership development programs, and she was named \u201cBusiness Partner of the Year\u201d by Pearson Canada in 2016.\nJoslyn-Gaul and her husband, Jon, also a lawyer, have been married for 27 years. They have three children, including a Georgia Tech graduate with a B.S. in Computer Science and another recent graduate from the University of Georgia with a double major in International Relations and German. Their youngest is a rising second-year at the University of Virginia.\nHer selection follows a national search chaired by Frank Neville, senior vice president for Strategic Initiatives and Chief of Staff. Kathleen Gosden has served as interim general counsel and vice president for Ethics and Compliance since February.\n\u201cI offer my thanks to Kathleen for her excellent and invaluable leadership as interim during this transition period,\u201d said Cabrera. \u201cI am grateful, too, to the members of the search committee for a job well done.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nContact\nSusie Ivy\nInstitute Communications\nEmail\nsusie.ivy@comm.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
