But did you know the facility also offers physical therapy and chiropractic services to all Tech students, employees, and their families?\n\u201cI've had many on-campus patients begin treatment and say, \u2018I sure wish I had known about this five years ago,\u2019\u201d said Randy Rhino, chiropractor for Georgia Tech Athletics. Rhino often partners with Charlie Ridgeway, a physical therapist on staff at the center.\nBecause many employees have been working from home more often during the pandemic, Rhino has seen an increase in patients experiencing more aches and pains in their backs, shoulders, and necks. Employees without an ergonomically correct workstation at home often resort to sitting in a regular chair at the kitchen table. This can result in forward head tilt syndrome.\n\u201cThe muscles in your neck and shoulders are having to compensate to hold up your head,\u201d Rhino explained. \u201cStudents and employees come in with a stiff neck or tightness in the mid-back from sitting awkwardly and staring at a computer.\u201d\nA former Georgia Tech football player, Rhino is physically active and warns about the dangers of sitting for long periods. He gets up from his chair at least once an hour. And he believes there is merit to the saying that sitting is the new smoking.\n\u201cI use that phrase all the time in my talks,\u201d he said. \u201cThe medical profession is finding that prolonged sitting leads to a lot of health issues other than just neck pain. This includes digestive issues and even coronary issues.\u201d\nRhino suggests implementing an exercise program to increase flexibility, maintain mobility, and strengthen the spine.\n\u201cWe need to treat our spine the way we treat our teeth,\u201d he said. \u201cYou brush your teeth every day. You don\u2019t just wait until your appointment and let the hygienist clean your teeth. It should be the same with your spine. You need to do daily stretches and exercises to strengthen your spine.\u201d\nThe chiropractic and physical therapy practices at the Homer Rice Center are Blue Cross Blue Shield preferred providers. A referral is required for physical therapy, and most major insurance providers are accepted. No referral is needed for chiropractic services. Patients may pay out of pocket if they choose.
