Chilmonczyk\nChilmonczyk is the CEO/Co-founder of Andson Biotech and a current cleanroom user\nFacebook\nTwitter\nEmail\nMay 25, 2022\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nMason A. Chilmonczyk is the CEO and Co-founder of Andson Biotech, a startup that develops new sensors to discover the next groundbreaking cell and gene therapies. In the following Q&A, Chilmonczyk briefly discusses his work in the IEN cleanroom and gives advice to current and future users.\nHow long have you been using the IEN cleanroom?\nI began using the IEN cleanroom eight years ago when I started my Ph.D. program at Georgia Tech and I am still using it today.\nWhat tools have/do you use when you are in the cleanroom?\nHitachi 4700 FE SEM\nSCS G3P8 Spinners\nTystar Mini\nVision RIE\nUnaxis RIE\nPlasmaTherm RIE\nPlasmaTherm ICP\nSTS ICP\nObducat Nanoimprinter\nADT Dicing Saw\nWhat is/has been your favorite project you have worked on in the IEN cleanroom?\nMy Ph.D. project, \u201cThe Dynamic Sampling Platform for Real-time Bioreactor Monitoring,\u201d has been the most satisfying project I have worked on in the IEN cleanroom. I collaborated with my advisor, Mechanical Engineering Professor\nAndrei Fedorov , and we utilized the\nNanoscribe\nto make micro-3d printed parts. This allowed me to take interesting SEM images using the Field Emissions Scanning Electron Microscopes. My Ph.D. project was probably the most satisfying to \"complete,\" but I am still working on it to this day.\nAt the core of my work was a microfluidic mass exchanger that I built in the IEN cleanrooms at Georgia Tech. As a result of this project, Professor Fedorov and I co-founded the startup\nAndson Biotech . The company is growing, and we recently licensed the technology to enable better biopharmaceutical workflows.\nWhat advice would you give to other researchers thinking about using a tool in the IEN cleanroom?\nI would say to only use the cleanroom for your research if you have a burning desire to learn about MEMS/microfabrication or you have to do so for your project. There are very rarely \"quick\" projects inside cleanrooms. In general, I think if you have the opportunity to learn about anything new you should take that chance.\nWhat is your favorite thing about the IEN cleanroom?\nMy favorite thing about the IEN cleanroom is the people I've met. Some of my best and longest-term friends have been made in these cleanrooms. I really miss working in the cleanroom as often as I used to, because I don't get to interact with all my best friends. Unfortunately, many of my original friends [from the cleanroom] have moved on to other things. While I miss seeing them, I love to see them succeed!\nLearn more about Mason\u2019s project, company, and technology -\nNew Startup Makes Developing Gene Therapies Faster and Easier\nAdditional Images\nContact\nLaurie Haigh\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
