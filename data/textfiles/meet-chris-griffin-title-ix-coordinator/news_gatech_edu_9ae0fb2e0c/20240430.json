(Photo by Allison Carter)\nApr 28, 2022\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nChristina \u201cChris\u201d Griffin is director of Equity and Compliance Programs and Title IX Coordinator in the Equity and Compliance Programs Office, which is part of Institute Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion.\nShe came to Georgia Tech last June from Kennesaw State University, where she was a Title IX civil rights investigator.\n\u201cA friend worked at Tech and told me about the job opening,\u201d Griffin said. \u201cI loved Kennesaw and had no intention of leaving, but the job seemed like a great fit for me because I would focus on Title IX matters and sex discrimination matters exclusively. And that\u2019s what I wanted to do.\u201d\nAs the Title IX Coordinator for Georgia Tech, Griffin is the designated Institute official with responsibility for coordinating the institute\u2019s compliance with Title IX and other federal and state laws and regulations relating to sex-based discrimination. Title IX became law in 1972.\n\u201cTitle IX says that no person shall, on the basis of sex, be discriminated against, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving federal financial assistance,\u201d she explained. Title IX applies to students, faculty, and staff.\nGriffin gave examples of the types of things prohibited by Title IX.\n\u201cTitle IX prohibits sex discrimination, which has been defined to include sexual assault and sexual harassment, as well as sex-based discrimination in a school\u2019s courses, programs, and activities, including its athletic programs. It also prohibits discrimination based on pregnancy,\u201d she said.\n\u201cTitle IX is celebrating its 50th anniversary this year. Thanks to Title IX, there is greater acceptance of women in all roles of society. It\u2019s all about opportunity and not limiting opportunity based on sex. Title IX has influenced American life and made it better for everybody,\u201d she said.\nGriffin holds a Juris Doctor degree from the University of Virginia and a Master\u2019s in conflict resolution from Kennesaw State University. She has worked as a government and private practice attorney. She also is a certified civil rights investigator, mediator, and conflict resolution professional.\nHer current projects include a collaborative\u00a0effort with several campus partners to implement a new NCAA policy that requires schools to vet all incoming and transfer student athletes for Title IX or sexual misconduct disciplinary records.\n\u201cAnother project that I\u2019m involved in is a campus wide, multi-department effort to assess and strengthen Georgia Tech\u2019s capacity to address and end sexual violence,\u201d she said. The project is a part of the National Association of Student Personnel Administrators\u2019 Culture of Respect initiative.\n\u201cWithout question, the most rewarding part of my job is helping students by making sure they have the support and resources they need to get them through what is often the most stressful time of their lives,\u201d she said.\nAway From Work\nGriffin is one of seven children born to a Croatian mother and an American serviceman father who met on a military base in Italy, where her mother worked as a telephone operator.\n\u201cMy three older siblings were born in Italy, and I was the first to be born in the United States,\u201d she said.\nWhen she isn\u2019t working, Griffin likes to have fun.\n\u201cI enjoy spending time with my family first. I also enjoy spending time with friends, reading, hiking, doing yoga, and listening to podcasts.\u201d\nGriffin\u2019s husband David has been her biggest supporter. They have been married for 34 years and have three adult children \u2014 Michael, Andrew, and Claire.\nGriffin\u2019s taste in books varies, but she leans toward autobiographies. \u201cI just finished Victor Frankl\u2019s\u00a0 Man\u2019s Search for Meaning,\u00a0 which is the story of his experience in a Nazi concentration camp. I read it many years ago and I just read it again,\u201d she said. \u201cI also have an audiobook waiting for me \u2014 Maya Angelou\u2019s\u00a0 I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings \u00a0\u2014 which has been on my reading list forever.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nRead More Staff Stories\nContact\nVictor Rogers\nInstitute Communications\nEmail\nvictor.rogers@comm.gatech.edu\nAdditional information\nThis year marks the 50th anniversary of Title IX, the most used name for the federal civil rights law in the United States that was passed on June 23, 1972.
