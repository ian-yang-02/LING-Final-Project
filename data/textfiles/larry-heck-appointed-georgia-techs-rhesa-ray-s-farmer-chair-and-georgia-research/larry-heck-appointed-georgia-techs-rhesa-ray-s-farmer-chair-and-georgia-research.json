Farmer Chair and a Georgia Research Alliance Eminent Scholar, join the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering.\nJul 14, 2021\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nLarry Heck will join the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) on August 15 as a Professor, Rhesa \u201cRay\u201d S. Farmer Chair and a Georgia Research Alliance Eminent Scholar. Having earned M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from Georgia Tech, Heck returns to his\nalma mater\nafter nearly 30 years in industry, most recently serving as the President and CEO of Viv Labs and Senior Vice President of Samsung Electronics.\nSince 2013, Heck has served on the ECE advisory board and currently chairs the board. When he arrives at Georgia Tech this summer, he will collaborate with researchers across myriad disciplines, including the Georgia Tech Research Institute.\n\u201cGeorgia Tech is delighted to have Larry Heck return to campus in a role that will impact various fields in an entirely new way,\u201d said Raheem Beyah, dean of Georgia Tech\u2019s College of Engineering and Southern Company Chair. \u201cHis graduate and doctoral study here became the foundation of a storied career in artificial intelligence, speech and language processing, online algorithms and other areas. He will now advance those fields by expanding his exploration and by preparing the next generation of leaders.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve been fortunate to have seen the evolution of Georgia Tech\u2019s School of Electrical and Computer Engineering over the years and am thrilled to be joining the school in this new capacity,\u201d Heck said. \u201cECE and the College of Engineering have profound strengths in academics and research. I look forward to building on ECE\u2019s success in a fast-changing field of engineering, as well as participating in the larger innovation and startup ecosystem in Atlanta and Georgia.\u201d\nHeck\u2019s influence on shaping speech and language technologies is widely felt, particularly with AI virtual assistants. He founded the Cortana\u2122 virtual assistant at Microsoft, led Samsung\u2019s virtual assistant Bixby\u2122 in North America, served as a technical advisor to Yap Inc. (acquired by Amazon to initiate the Alexa\u2122 virtual assistant), \u00a0and founded Google\u2019s Deep Dialogue group, a research effort behind the Google Assistant\u2122.\n\u201cRecruiting engineers and scientists of Larry\u2019s caliber to Georgia is how we continue to elevate our state\u2019s profile as a leading center of university research and entrepreneurship,\u201d said GRA President Susan Shows. \u201cLarry has been a true trailblazer in deep learning technology for speech processing and in several other areas. He will be an outstanding addition to the Academy of GRA Eminent Scholars, who are major drivers of research funding to Georgia\u2019s universities.\u201d\nIn 1992, Heck began his career at the Stanford Research Institute (SRI) in acoustics research and later in speech with the Speech Technology and Research (STAR) Laboratory. He founded the SRI Speaker Recognition Group in the STAR Lab, where he created speaker verification/voice biometric technology that he eventually transferred and developed into the award-winning Nuance Verifier\u2122 product. While at SRI, Heck worked with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and MIT Lincoln Labs to establish the NIST Speaker Recognition Evaluations (SRE), an international competition to encourage fundamental research and foster collaboration among speaker recognition researchers. The NIST SRE has been held every year over the past 25 years and has had a profound influence on the field.\nHeck joined Nuance Communications in 1998, eventually serving as its Vice President for R&D where he led the research, advanced development, and deployment of its engines for speech recognition, voice-biometrics, spoken natural language processing, and text-to-speech. In 1999, he led one of the world\u2019s earliest deployments of a major industrial application of deep learning with the Home Shopping Network. The Nuance speech recognition engine Nuance Recognizer\u2122 was recognized with numerous awards, including being named as the industry\u2019s most accurate speech recognition engine for telephony in 2004. In that same year, he was named among the \u201cTop 10 Leaders in Speech Industry\u201d at SpeechTek \u201904.\nIn 2005, Heck moved to Yahoo!, where he served as its Vice President for Search and Advertising Sciences. His highly multidisciplinary team was responsible for the scientific development, analysis, and deployment of the Yahoo! web search, search monetization, content match advertising, and display advertising products. He was the co-founder of Yahoo! Labs and was the co-creator and program chair for the first Yahoo! Tech Pulse Conference, a company-wide internal technical conference.\nHeck joined Microsoft in 2009, eventually becoming its Chief Scientist of Speech Products and Distinguished Engineer where he founded the Cortana\u2122 AI virtual assistant. He joined Google Research in 2014 to continue his work on AI virtual assistant technology. Since 2017, he has been with Samsung Electronics where he created 3 world-class AI research centers (Silicon Valley, Toronto and Montreal), served as the President and CEO of Viv Labs, and led the company\u2019s North America product teams around the AI virtual assistant Bixby.\nCurrently, Heck remains active on Advisory boards for several conversational AI startups, including Symbl.ai, XdMind and Otter.ai.\nAdding to his impressive list of industry leadership positions, Heck has over 125 journal and conference publications and over 50 patents in the areas of AI and speech recognition. Heck is an IEEE Fellow \u201cfor leadership in application of machine learning to spoken and text language processing.\u201d In 2017, he received the Academy of Distinguished Engineering Alumni Award from Georgia Tech\u2019s College of Engineering and the Texas Tech University Whitacre College of Engineering Distinguished Engineer Award.\nHeck received his master of science degree in electrical engineering and Ph.D. from Georgia Tech in 1989 and 1991, respectively, and his bachelor of science in electrical engineering from Texas Tech University.\nThe Georgia Institute of Technology, or Georgia Tech, is a top 10 public research university developing leaders who advance technology and improve the human condition.\nThe Institute offers business, computing, design, engineering, liberal arts, and sciences degrees. Its nearly 40,000 students representing 50 states and 149 countries, study at the main campus in Atlanta, at campuses in France and China, and through distance and online learning.\nAs a leading technological university, Georgia Tech is an engine of economic development for Georgia, the Southeast, and the nation, conducting more than $1 billion in research annually for government, industry, and society.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nJacqueline Nemeth\nSchool of Electrical and Computer Engineering\nEmail\njackie.nemeth@ece.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
