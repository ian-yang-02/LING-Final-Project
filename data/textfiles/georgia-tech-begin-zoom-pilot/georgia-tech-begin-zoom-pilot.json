The pilot will take place from late October to December.\nWith existing agreements for BlueJeans and WebEx* set to expire in 2022, a review committee was formed to explore new video collaboration platforms that meet the academic and operational needs of students, faculty, and staff. The review committee, comprised of members from each division and college along with students and technology representatives, identified requirements and evaluated possible solutions on their ability to:\nEnable secure, reliable, and flexible course delivery and student learning.\nSupport virtual classrooms and meetings of multiple sizes.\nFacilitate effective\u00a0collaboration\u00a0and communication across the Institute.\n\u201cThe video collaboration review committee has been thorough in defining requirements of a video collaboration service, in thinking through a migration from BlueJeans, and in considering how best to roll out a replacement for it,\u201d said Michael Smith, senior lecturer of information systems in the Scheller College of Business. \u201cMost faculty, staff, and students have learned how to incorporate a video collaboration service into their work and\u00a0that\u2019s a big hill that we don\u2019t have to climb again. In addition, Zoom has capabilities similar to those of BlueJeans and is widely used in education \u2014 making it a strong contender as a videoconference platform for Georgia Tech.\u201d\nZoom will integrate with Canvas and Kaltura to enable course delivery for hybrid and online learners. The pilot will inform the review committee\u2019s ultimate decision to implement Zoom as an enterprise videoconferencing solution at Georgia Tech.\n\u201cWe have more than 120 requirements against which we will evaluate Zoom\u2019s performance during a portion of the fall semester,\u201d said Yakut Gazi, associate dean of Georgia Tech Professional Education. \u201cWe performed our due diligence in terms of cybersecurity and procurement processes prior to the trial so that if the trial results in a positive outcome, we can quickly move forward with an enterprise license and full implementation.\u201d\nGazi added that the extensive due diligence process guided the committee\u2019s decision to begin the pilot mid-semester.\n\u201cWe will make sure to engage a variety of courses and activities to ensure a robust evaluation of Zoom in our environment,\u201d Gazi said. \u201cGeorgia Tech learned a lot about what works and what doesn\u2019t in the digital learning environments, especially during the transition to remote and hybrid work stemming from the Covid-19 pandemic. The committee members brought a lot of their experience to the table and were really engaged in this process. I thank them all for their thoughtful contributions.\u201d\nThe Office of Information Technology will work with students, faculty, and staff over the fall to prepare for the transition from BlueJeans and WebEx. Additional communications will share resources for securely migrating stored lecture and meeting recordings and a schedule of information sessions planned to share updates and answer questions.\nTo learn more about the video collaboration review project, visit\noit.gatech.edu/videocollaboration .\n*The WebEx transition does not affect GTRI.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nMalynda Dorsey\nDirector, IT Marketing & Communications\nOffice of Information Technology\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
