Between crafting the right schedule and making sure selected courses satisfy program requirements, the process takes time and effort. Prior registration periods at Georgia Tech also presented a different set of challenges, as students grew frustrated with an outdated online registration system. This year, students can anticipate an improved experience following Georgia Tech\u2019s recent upgrade to the Banner 9 student registration system.\nThe upgrade provides students with access to an enhanced self-service system and provides students with new scheduling features and a modernized user interface for desktops and mobile devices.\n\u201cThe number one thing students have asked me is, \u2018When are we getting a new registration system?\u2019\u201d said Megan Dass, Student Government Association (SGA) joint vice president of IT and computer science major.\nDass said that students commonly identified issues with registration during their assigned time ticket slots as well as the system\u2019s outdated interface as primary sources of concern.\nIn 2021, representatives from SGA met with members of the Office of Information Technology (OIT), the Registrar\u2019s Office, and the Bursar\u2019s Office to address concerns. The teams subsequently established a committee to explore upgrades to the self-service registration system and prioritize improving students' registration experience.\n\u201cImproving the student experience continues to be our top priority, so we wanted to make sure students recognized that we heard them, and we were working to address their needs,\u201d said Daren Hubbard, vice president for IT and chief information officer. \u201cPartnering with SGA, the Registrar\u2019s Office, and other key stakeholders, we worked to gather feedback and find the best solutions to improve our students\u2019 experience. With the new enhancements to the system and the positive feedback we\u2019ve received from students in our test groups, I believe we are moving in the right direction.\u201d\nAdditional goals for the system upgrade include maintaining custom functionality critical to current business processes and adherence to compliance standards.\n\u201cWe are very grateful for the input from students and the partnership with OIT and others,\u201d said Reta Pikowsky, associate vice provost and registrar. \u201cOur office has been keenly interested in bringing new functionality to the registration system to improve the experience for students. We are also very grateful for the academic advisors on campus who work with us daily to discuss and address issues related to registration. This is truly a collective effort. As with other ventures into new technologies or new functionalities, we will learn as we go and make every possible effort to ensure success.\u201d\nKey features of the upgraded system:\nPlan Ahead Tool: Pre-plan schedules, view conflicts, and save registration plans.\nVisual Schedule: View courses in a weekly calendar format to assist with planning.\nStreamlined Lecture, Lab, and Recitation Registration: Students can view linked course components, identify open sections, and register for corresponding sections.\nThe self-service registration project team, developers, and the Registrar\u2019s Office collaborated with SGA to gather student feedback and complete testing for the upgraded system. The student representatives from this group participated in the testing phase and provided feedback on user experience and input on how to increase student engagement during the launch of the new system.\nRegistration for the summer term will begin on March 14 for students in OMS programs and on March 28 for the rest of the campus. Students will receive a reminder message prior to their registration time slot to review the available training resources for the self-service registration system.\nTech students are invited to attend a Banner registration system informational session on Tuesday, March 15, from 5:30 to 6:30 p.m. We will provide a live demo of the system and a Q&A session.\nClick here to view event details.\nOnline registration system news and training resources are available at\ninfo.oscar.gatech.edu .

The walkthrough of the system will highlight the system's new features, including the updated user interface, Plan Ahead tool, visual schedule, and streamlined lecture, lab, and recitation registration.\nAfter the live demo, students will have the opportunity to ask questions about the system upgrades and learn how to use the new features. The Q&A session is not intended to answer questions on student records or individual registration issues, but to provide a forum for higher-level questions on the features discussed.\nDate & Time: Tuesday, March 15, 5:30 \u2013 6:30 p.m.\nWebinar Link:\nhttps://gatech.zoom.us/j/97247824559\nOnline registration system news and training resources are available at\ninfo.oscar.gatech.edu .
