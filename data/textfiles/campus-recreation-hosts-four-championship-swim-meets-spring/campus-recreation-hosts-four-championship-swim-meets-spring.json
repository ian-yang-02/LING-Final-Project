Participant drop-off will take place\u00a0on Tech Parkway at the back entrance of the CRC, while spectators will enter through the main doors on Ferst Drive. The campus community should exercise extra caution when driving through this area and expect delays as Tech Parkway will be periodically closed for athlete arrival.\nDuring these meets, the McAuley Aquatic Center will be closed to patrons Feb. 3-5 (GHSA meet), Feb. 14-19 (ACC Championship meet), March 14-19 (NCAA Women\u2019s meet), and March 21-26 (NCAA Men\u2019s meet). The Crawford Leisure Pool will remain open with adjusted hours, which will be posted at\u00a0 crc.gatech.edu/aquatics .\nEach swim meet is expected to run from 7:30 a.m. until 7 p.m. Wednesday through Friday, and 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. on Saturday. To accommodate the influx of swimmers and fans, Parking and Transportation Services will use the W10-CRC deck and the W2-Student Center decks for swim meet guests.\nAffected permit customers will receive emails with specific parking instructions for this event. For those who don\u2019t need to park or drive in these areas, walking or taking campus transit is encouraged. The Georgia Tech Police Department will set up checkpoints and direct traffic to ease congestion.\nCompleted in 1995 to host the 1996 Summer Olympics swimming and diving competitions, the McAuley Aquatic Center in the CRC is considered one of the fastest pools in the world. The CRC hosts several swim meets throughout the year, keeping the Olympic spirit alive.\nFor CRC aquatics special events and closures, visit\u00a0 crc.gatech.edu/aquatics .
