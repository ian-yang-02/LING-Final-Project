Carson Meredith, a professor in Georgia Tech\u2019s School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering. \u201cBeing able to withstand those kinds of changes in humidity is still a challenge for synthetic adhesives.\u201d\nIn a study published March 26 in the journal\nNature Communications\nand sponsored by the Air Force Office of Scientific Research, the researchers described how those two natural liquids work together to protect the bee\u2019s bounty as it travels back to its hive.\nThe first component of the glue is the bee\u2019s own salivary secretions, which coat the pollen grains and allow them to stick together. The bees produce those sugary secretions, the main ingredient in honey, from nectar they drink from the flowers.\nThe second ingredient is a plant-based oil that coats the pollen grains called pollenkitt, which helps stabilize the adhesive properties of the nectar and protect it from the impact of too much or too little humidity.\n\u201cIt works similarly to a layer of cooking oil covering a pool of syrup,\u201d Meredith said. \u201cThe oil separates the syrup from the air and slows down drying considerably.\u201d\nThe researchers tested the adhesive properties of the bee\u2019s glue by separating the oil-based component from the sugar-based component and evaluating how sticky the nectar remained under various humidity conditions. As expected, as humidity increased and the nectar absorbed more water, its adhesive properties diminished. The same effect was true when humidity decreased and the nectar dried out. Meanwhile, under similar conditions, nectar coated with the pollenkitt oil remained sticky despite changes in humidity.\n\u201cWe believe you could take the essential concepts of this material and develop a novel adhesive with a water-barrier external oil layer that could better resist humidity changes in the same way,\u201d Meredith said.\u00a0 \u201cOr potentially this concept would apply to controlling the working time of an adhesive, such as its ability to flow and time to dry or cure.\u201d\nThe research team, which included Victor Breedveld, an associate professor in the School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, also examined dynamics of the bee adhesive.\n\u201cWe wanted to know, if the pollen can stay so firmly attached to the bee\u2019s hind legs, how do the bees manage to remove it when they return to the hive,\u201d Meredith said.\nThe answer may lie in the adhesive\u2019s a rate-sensitive response. In other words, the faster the force attempting to remove it, the more it would resist.\n\u201cThis is a property of capillary adhesion, which we believe could be harnessed and tailored for specific applications, such as controlling motion in microscopic or nanoscale devices, in fields ranging from construction to medicine,\u201d Meredith said.\nThis work was supported by the Air Force Office of Scientific Research under grant No. FA9550-10-1-0555.
