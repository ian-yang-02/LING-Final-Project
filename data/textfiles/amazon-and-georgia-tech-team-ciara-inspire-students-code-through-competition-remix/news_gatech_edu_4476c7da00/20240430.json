Alongside\u00a0Georgia Tech\u00a0and their learn-to-code-through music platform, EarSketch, participating high school students have the opportunity to win prizes by composing an original remix featuring original music stems from Grammy Award winning singer/songwriter\u00a0 Ciara \u00a0and her song, \u201cSET\u201d from her latest album\u00a0 Beauty Marks . The competition is intended to uniquely activate young people to try computer science and coding. All high school students across the country are encouraged to\u00a0 enter \u00a0the competition now through\u00a0January 20 th . Teaching guides are available for teachers to bring the competition to their classroom, or as part of their introductory computer science curriculum.\nStudents will use computer science and coding to build their remix using musical samples from Ciara\u2019s song \u201cSET,\u201d as well as other sounds from the EarSketch library. Students will learn looping (repeating) to extend the length of their song, use strings to create new beats, create custom functions representing different song sections, and learn to upload their own sounds to the EarSketch library.\n\u201cWe are excited to support the innovative and unique work\u00a0Georgia Tech\u00a0and EarSketch are pioneering to give students across the country more access to computer science, coding, and music,\u201d said\u00a0Jeff Wilke, CEO Worldwide Consumer,\u00a0Amazon. \u201cThis competition will give thousands of students from underserved and underrepresented communities the opportunity to try something new and fun. It will build their confidence and, most importantly, encourage them to think creatively.\u201d\nStudents and teachers can learn more about the competition details at\u00a0 www.amazonfutureengineer.com/earsketch \u00a0- all high school students are encouraged to participate, either in class or on their own. The top three student winners will each receive an all-expenses-paid trip to Amazon\u2019s headquarters in\u00a0Seattle, Washington\u00a0to be an \u201cAmazon Future Engineer\u201d for the day. Additional winners will receive a PreSonus Audiobox 96 Studio and Amazon.com Gift Cards. The competition opens today and will close on\u00a0Monday, January 20\u00a0at\u00a011:59PM EST.\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics\u00a0projects that by 2020 there will be 1.4 million computer-science-related jobs available and only 400,000 computer science graduates with the skills to apply for those jobs. Computer science is the fastest-growing profession within the Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) field, but only 8% of STEM graduates earn a computer science degree, with a small percentage from underserved backgrounds. In multiple research studies, students using the EarSketch platform significantly increased their positive attitudes towards computing and their intentions to persist in computing, with particularly significant impacts on students from groups historically underrepresented in the field. Female students expressed even greater gains in computing confidence, motivation, and identity as compared to their male counterparts.\n\u201cMusic and coding are both highly prevalent today, but coding is less apparent\u2014EarSketch provides an amazing way to experience these creative disciplines simultaneously,\u201d said Dr.\u00a0Roxanne Moore, Senior Research Engineer at\u00a0Georgia Tech\u00a0and project lead for the remix competition.\n\u201cWe know that creativity is the key to success in both music and computer science,\u201d said Professor\u00a0Jason Freeman, Chair of the\u00a0School of Music\u00a0at\u00a0Georgia Tech\u00a0and co-creator of the EarSketch platform. \u201cWe\u2019re thrilled to partner with\u00a0Amazon\u00a0to support more students as they unlock their creative potential through EarSketch.\u201d\nTo date, more than 375,000 students in all 50 states and over 100 countries have used EarSketch. Programs like EarSketch serve Georgia Tech\u2019s mission to meet the demand for STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) professionals by opening the eyes of more students to these engaging and important subjects.\nLaunched in\u00a0November 2018, Amazon Future Engineer is a four-part childhood-to-career program intended to inspire, educate, and prepare children and young adults from underrepresented and underserved communities to pursue careers in the fast-growing field of computer science. Each year,\u00a0 Amazon Future Engineer \u00a0aims to inspire millions of kids to explore computer science; provides over 100,000 young people in over 2,000 high schools access to Intro or AP Computer Science courses; awards 100 students with four-year\u00a0$10,000\u00a0scholarships, as well as offers guaranteed and paid\u00a0Amazon\u00a0internships to gain work experience. Amazon Future Engineer is part of Amazon\u2019s\u00a0$50 million\u00a0investment in computer science/STEM education. In addition, Amazon Future Engineer has donated more than\u00a0$10 million\u00a0to organizations that promote computer science/STEM education across the country.\nAMAZON CONTACT:\nAmazon.com, Inc.\nMedia Hotline Amazon-pr@amazon.com www.amazon.com/pr\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nData Viz: Explore and listen to Ciara's Billboard hits\nContact\nJoshua Preston\nResearch Communications Manager GVU Center and College of Computing\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
