But summer has arrived, and with it comes the question of what to read. We asked several readers for recommendations, and the books range from a guide that encourages women to find their voice to the story of Georgia native and \u201c(Sittin\u2019 On) The Dock of the Bay\u201d singer and co-writer Otis Redding.\nThe Vanishing Half: A Novel\nBy Brit Bennett, Riverhead Books (2020)\n\u201cThis brilliant novel tells the story of twin sisters\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Desiree and Stella\u00a0\u2014\u00a0coming of age in the mid-20th century, in Mallard,\u00a0Louisiana, a town so small it\u2019s not a speck on the map.\u00a0In 1848, Alphonse Decuir establishes Mallard for former slaves like him: too light-skinned to fit in with other freed slaves, and with no chance of being accepted into a white community. This is the town the sisters are raised in, in midst of the Jim Crow South, during a time when racial discrimination is meant to keep order. But what happens when you don\u2019t fit neatly into one group or the other? As the story progresses, one sister remains tied to Mallard, while the other discreetly passes for white. For years their lives orbit in different worlds, until the day their stories once again converge. Bennett\u2019s storytelling is magnetic, tender, thought-provoking, and timely.\u201d\n\u2014Melissa Heffner, program manager, Georgia Tech\u2019s VentureLab\nFierce, Free, and Full of Fire: The Guide to Being Glorious You\nBy Jen Hatmaker, Nelson Books (2020)\n\u201cJen Hatmaker is a Christian author, and in\nFierce, Free, and Full of Fire , she leads women toward the discovery of who they are truly meant to be and encourages them to embrace their findings without fear or shame.\u00a0She addresses every woman (regardless of religious belief) who feels that she lives and works in a community that does not hear her voice, that overlooks her ideas, and ignores her needs and wants. She urges women not to hide behind what is expected of them, but to be brave and let the truthfulness in their heart guide them toward freedom. Jen\u2019s writing style is crisp and colorful, and the stories she shares take us through a roller coaster of emotions. Reading or listening to Jen Hatmaker is like hanging out with your BFF on a Friday night, feet propped up on the porch railing, drinking an ice cold beer.\u201d\n\u2014Florence Stoia, project manager and executive assistant, Vice Provost for International Initiatives\nThe 7 \u00bd Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle\nBy Stuart Turton, Sourcebooks Landmark (2018)\n\u201cEvelyn Hardcastle will die.\u00a0She will die every day, again and again, until Aiden Bishop can identify her killer and break the cycle.\u00a0Unfortunately, Aiden doesn\u2019t know that.\u00a0He doesn\u2019t even know who he is when he awakes each day.\u00a0And each day he awakes, he is someone else.\nThis book is a mystery wrapped in a puzzle. It is not for someone with a short attention span or firmly grounded in reality.\u00a0It twists and turns.\u00a0The reader must jump from viewpoint to viewpoint, never quite understanding what is going on, just like Aiden. A fun, mind-blowing book that is a challenging but deeply satisfying read.\u201d\n\u2014Donna Vandersall, database administrator, Enterprise Innovation Institute\nIn the Heat of the Summer: The New York Riots of 1964 and the War on Crime\nBy Michael W. Flamm, Penn Press (2016)\n\u201cThose who don\u2019t learn from history are doomed to repeat it. This book extensively details the 1964 Harlem Riot after the death of a black teenager, James Powell. Using an array of sources the book gives a street-level view of the riot and also chronicles the local and federal responses. These responses led to an uneasy peace but also created additional systems susceptible to systemic racism and oppression through the War on Crime. It is a reminder that the questions and events we are struggling with today are not new but also provide us an opportunity to not make the same mistakes again.\u201d\n\u2014Shawn Dommer, assistant director, Undergraduate Program Student Services, Scheller College of Business\nEnterprise Innovation Institute Project Manager Paul Todd recommended two books:\nDreams to Remember: Otis Redding, Stax Records, and the Transformation of Southern Soul\nBy Mark Ribowsky, Liveright (2015)\n\u201cMacon native Otis Redding is an icon of American music whose influence is still felt half a century after his tragic death. I knew his music well and have lived in Macon for 20 years, but never imagined that he was only 26 when he died. That was one of many revelations in\nDreams to Remember , a thoroughly researched account of his journey from singing gospel in his father\u2019s church, to the \u2018Chitlin Circuit\u2019 of segregated clubs, to stardom at the Monterey Pop Festival in 1967. It\u2019s the story of a larger than life performer and the music business he conquered.\u201d\nCarrying the Fire: An Astronaut\u2019s Journeys\nBy Michael Collins, Cooper Square Press (revised edition 2001; first published 1974)\n\u201cOne of the many documentaries and articles commemorating the 50 th\nanniversary of\nApollo 11\nlast year led me to this account by the Command Module pilot \u2014 the guy who didn\u2019t land on the moon. It\u2019s considered the gold standard of astronaut books, written by the man himself rather than a ghostwriter, and filled with funny stories and technical details alike. In a sobering example, Collins was trained to operate all the systems necessary for the return trip \u2014 in case Armstrong and Aldrin never made it back from the lunar surface.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nContact\nVictor Rogers\nInstitute Communications\nEmail\nvictor.rogers@comm.gatech.edu\nAdditional information\nNote:\nSome of these books are available electronically from Georgia Tech via\nOverdrive .
