Russell Chandler III Chair and Professor Pascal Van Hentenryck and his team look at transportation through a different lens\nFacebook\nTwitter\nEmail\nNov 02, 2021\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nA. Russell Chandler III Chair and Professor\nPascal Van Hentenryck\nis collaborating with\nRyder System, Inc.\non the\nindustry\u2019s first data-driven study of the potential impact of autonomous trucking .\nVan Hentenryck and his team have spent years developing an\nOn-Demand Multimodal Transit System (ODMTS)\nto address the first- and last-mile problems in public transportation and provide equitable, efficient, and low-cost public transportation options. The multimodal approach uses small on-demand vehicles to take riders to and from their locations to high-frequency bus and rail hubs. Increasing the use of public transit will not only decrease reliance on personal vehicles and reduce traffic congestion and greenhouse gas emissions; it will also increase accessibility to jobs, healthcare, education, and fresh food.\nHowever, when executives from Ryder, a leading logistics and transportation company with more than 235,000 vehicles and 8,600 professional truck drivers, reached out to Van Hentenryck about a collaboration, the research team began to look at the model through a different lens.\n\u201cWe have been focusing on people mobility and had not looked at other types of transportation,\u201d said Van Hentenryck. \u201cSo when Ryder came to us, we were very interested to see if the techniques that we were using for people could apply more generally to freight. In this project specifically, we are looking at how adding autonomous vehicles could unlock additional value.\u201d\nVan Hentenryck, who also serves as associate chair for innovation and entrepreneurship and leads the\nSocially Aware Mobility (SAM) Lab\nin the H. Milton Stewart School of Industrial and Systems Engineering (ISyE), and his team met with Ryder to better understand the company\u2019s goals and to determine if this multimodal approach could be applied to another system. Working with a company like Ryder gave the team access to large amounts of data and to logistics experts who understand the industry\u2019s current and future challenges.\n\u201cThere is a lot of back-and-forth between researchers and company representatives in a project like this,\u201d explained Van Hentenryck. \u201cSometimes the solutions we come up with in the lab will not work in the field, and so you have this iterative process in transforming the research idea into something that is applicable in the field.\u201d\nRyder operates a network of dedicated fleets for its customers, and even with high levels of performance, inflexible transportation lanes and schedules often lead to inefficiencies.\n\u201cWe learned that sometimes these trucks are traveling many miles completely empty, which is not cost effective,\u201d Van Hentenryck said. \u201cWe started looking at how we can avoid these \u2018empty miles.\u2019\u201d\nTo meet customer needs, Ryder must execute a large number of freight movements across the country. The team realized that by breaking each trip into three sections \u2014 origin-to-hub, hub-to-hub, and hub-to-destination \u2014 it could organize a network using both regular and autonomous trucks. The first and last segments would rely on smaller human-operated vehicles, since these will typically occur in more densely populated locations. Connections between hubs would rely solely on autonomous trucks (those without a human driver), generally in sparsely populated, controlled environments like highways and exit ramps.\n\u201cSafety is especially important to our researchers and to Ryder, and we take it very seriously,\u201d said Van Hentenryck. \u201cKeeping the autonomous trucks on the longer-haul middle leg, and human drivers in the first and final legs, schedules autonomy on lengthy, often overnight trips, and places drivers in dense environments where there are many other variables at play like left-hand turns, stop signs, pedestrians, etc.\u201d\nThe autonomous hub-to-hub aspect allows Van Hentenryck\u2019s model to be optimized in a whole new way because it doesn\u2019t depend on having drivers available \u2014 autonomous trucks are extremely flexible. This can deliver significant projected savings for Ryder if the model is implemented.\n\u201cThe whole team was stunned by the projected savings from this project,\u201d said Van Hentenryck. \u201cI have worked on many different transportation problems during my career, and 1% improvement is magical. In this case, improvement goes from 29% to 40%, depending on the price of autonomous trucks and the cost of operating them. Also, the flexibility to move these autonomous trucks around gave us the ability to optimize the business model in ways people didn\u2019t even consider before.\u201d\nThe agility of the new model also provides better reactions to supply chain disruptions, because it can adapt more quickly to a new situation.\n\u201cAutonomous driving technology is poised to be incredibly disruptive to our industry in safety, service, and cost. As such, it was clear to us that this was not something we could wait to figure out or be handed a playbook. This collaboration with Georgia Tech was an advancement in our commitment to becoming a leader in fostering innovation and bringing it to our customers,\u201d said Michael Plasencia, group director of new product strategy at Ryder.\n\u201cWe are designing a much more resilient supply chain logistics system, and that is because we are thinking differently,\u201d Van Hentenryck added. \u201cThis technology provides more resilience, more flexibility, and is more affordable.\n\u201cThis project is only a first step. The whole field of transportation, logistics, and supply chains is being transformed by technology, automation, and the changes in attitudes and expectations that emerged during Covid-19. We are looking forward to working with Ryder on many of these.\u201d\nView Ryder\u2019s press release\nThe Impact of Autonomous Trucking: A Case Study if Ryder's Dedicated Transportation Network\nAdditional Images\nContact\nLaurie Haigh\nCommunications Manager\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
