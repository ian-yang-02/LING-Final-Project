These benefits translate to lower cost of production and thus the cost of medicine.\u201d\nTraditionally, the pharmaceutical industry has relied on batch manufacturing for medicine production. With continuous manufacturing, costs associated with starting up and shutting down production are reduced due to the continuous nature of the manufacturing approach. Other potential advantages includes faster ramp-up production during times of shortages and more consistent product quality.\nDuring the project, researchers at Georgia Tech will develop a process to continuously synthesize, crystalize and isolate both cephalexin and amoxicillin, which are examples of two major types of beta-lactam antibiotics.\n\u201cOur design is intended to enable beta-lactam active pharmaceutical ingredient production in dedicated, compact, less capital-intensive plants, which in turn is envisioned to lead to better access to medicines for patients and ultimately to less expensive drugs,\u201d Bommarius said.\nThe new FDA-backed project is among several initiatives at Georgia Tech involving research into ways of bringing down the cost of producing medications. Other projects included a federally-backed initiative to advance medications made from cells, such as vaccines and autoimmune drugs, as well as therapies using living cells to treat a range of conditions.\nA separate initiative is aimed at advancing technologies for manufacturing therapeutic cells. Researchers at Georgia Tech were also recently awarded a three-year, $1.8 million grant from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to develop a scalable manufacturing system for cord-tissue derived cells.\nRead More:\u00a0 Want to Beat Antibiotic-Resistant Superbugs?
