But getting these powerful therapeutic agents from plants can take a long time and cost plenty of money, because it often takes a lot of plants to make a small amount of drug product.\nYet advances in metabolic engineering of microbes could lead to cheaper, faster production of drugs already approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). That\u2019s the conclusion of a\nstudy\npublished recently in\nNature Chemical Biology\nby Amy Ehrenworth, a Ph.D. student, and\nPamela Peralta-Yahya , an assistant professor and Ehrenworth\u2019s advisor in the School of Chemistry and Biochemistry.\nMetabolic pathways are at the heart of the solution, Peralta-Yahya says. These pathways are like production lines comprising the enzymes required to assemble specific products, such as therapeutic alkaloids. Thanks to advances in metabolic engineering and synthetic biology, plant metabolic pathways can be installed in microbes, enabling microbes to make the plant products.\nMany drugs that are based on plant natural products are produced by semi-synthesis. That usually involves taking compounds from the plant and chemically transforming them to get the desired drug products at the end of the production line.\nSome of those chemical steps can be arduous. In the case of modified alkaloids,\nEhrenworth and Peralta-Yahya showed in 2015\nthat microbes can be modified to produce them more easily. For the new work, Ehrenworth surveyed drug databases to find alkaloid-drug candidates eligible for production efficiencies through engineered microbes.\nWhen it comes to lowering the cost of drug production, \u201cour insight was that we shouldn\u2019t necessarily be using engineered microbes to make the exact plant natural product,\u201d Peralta-Yahya says. \u201cInstead we should use engineered microbes to make something that is closer to an FDA-approved drug.\u201d\n\u201cYou can grow vats of microbes overnight, so it\u2019s a much quicker process,\u201d Ehrenworth says. \u201cYou\u2019re also not killing trees.\u201d\nEhrenworth is referring to the\nChinese happy tree , the source of the alkaloid drug camptothecin. Two cancer drugs, topotecan and irinotecan, are derivatives of camptothecin, and their production starts from the natural alkaloid.\n\u201cBoth of those derivatives are modified at the same location on the molecule,\u201d Ehrenworth says. Engineering microbes to make the last common intermediate before the final drug compounds would reduce the chemical steps required.\nTo search for drugs that would benefit from this kind of metabolic engineering, Ehrenworth searched databases of more than 2,000 FDA-approved pharmaceuticals available from\nDrugbank.ca , the FDA, and other sources. She and Peralta-Yahya determined that seven FDA-approved modified-alkaloid drugs would be the most beneficial targets for metabolic engineering: solifenacin, galantamine, cisatracurium, levorphanol, butorphanol, irinotecan, and topotecan.\n\u201cI was surprised by how many modified alkaloids could be engineered using current technology,\u201d Peralta-Yahya says. \u201cI thought maybe we would find one or two. But there were many, and you can literally start working on them tomorrow.\u201d\nChemists and biologists don\u2019t need to wait for new technologies or processes to be discovered or built, Peralta-Yahya adds. \u201cIt\u2019s all there.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nContact\nRenay San Miguel\nCommunications Officer/Science Writer\nCollege of Sciences\n404-894-5209\nEmail\nrenay.san@cos.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
