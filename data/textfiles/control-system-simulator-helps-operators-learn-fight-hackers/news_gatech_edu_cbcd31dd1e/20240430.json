The simulator will also help students and researchers understand better the security issues of industrial control systems.\nFacilities such as electric power networks, manufacturing operations and water purification plants are among the potential targets for malicious actors because they use programmable logic controllers (PLCs) to open and close valves, redirect electricity flows and manage large pieces of machinery. Efforts are underway to secure these facilities, and helping operators become more skilled at detecting potential attacks is a key part of improving security.\n\u201cThe goal is to give operators, researchers and students experience with attacking systems, detecting attacks and also seeing the consequences of manipulating the physical processes in these systems,\u201d said\nRaheem Beyah , the Motorola Foundation Professor in the\nSchool of Electrical and Computer Engineering\nat the Georgia Institute of Technology. \u201cThis system allows operators to learn what kinds of things will happen. Our goal is to make sure the good guys get this experience so they can respond appropriately.\u201d\nDetails of the simulator were presented August 8 at Black Hat USA 2018, and August 13 at the 2018 USENIX Workshop on Advances in Security Education. The simulator was developed in part by Atlanta security startup company Fortiphyd Logic, and supported by the Georgia Research Alliance.\nThe simulated chemical processing plant, known as the Graphical Realism Framework for Industrial Control Simulations (GRFICS), allows users to play the roles of both attackers and defenders \u2013 with separate views provided. The attackers might take control of valves in the plant to build up pressure in a reaction vessel to cause an explosion. The defenders have to watch for signs of attack and make sure security systems remain operational.\nOf great concern is the \u201cman-in-the-middle\u201d attack in which a bad actor breaks into the facility\u2019s control system \u2013 and also takes control of the sensors and instruments that provide feedback to the operators. By gaining control of sensors and valve position indicators, the attacker could send false readings that would reassure the operators \u2013 while the damage proceeded.\n\u201cThe pressure and reactant levels could be made to seem normal to the operators, while the pressure is building toward a dangerous point,\u201d Beyah said. Though the readings may appear normal, however, a knowledgeable operator might still detect clues that the system has been attacked. \u201cThe more the operators know the process, the harder it will be to fool them,\u201d he said.\nThe GRFICS system was built using an existing chemical processing plant simulator, as well as a 3D video gaming engine running on Linux virtual machines. At its heart is the software that runs PLCs, which can be changed out to represent different types of controllers appropriate to a range of facilities. The human-machine interface can also be altered as needed to show a realistic operator control panel monitoring reaction parameters and valve controller positions.\n\u201cThis is a complete virtual network, so you can set up your own entry detection rules and play on the defensive side to see whether or not your defenses are detecting the attacks,\u201d said David Formby, a Georgia Tech postdoctoral researcher who has launched Fortiphyd Logic with Beyah to develop industrial control security products. \u201cWe provide access to simulated physical systems that allow students and operators to repeatedly study different parameters and scenarios.\u201d\nGRFICS is currently available as an open source, free download for use by classes or individuals. It runs on a laptop, but because of heavy use of graphics, requires considerable processing power and memory. An online version is planned, and future versions will simulate the electric power grid, water and wastewater treatment facilities, manufacturing facilities and other users of PLCs.\nFormby hopes GRFICS will expand the number of people who have experience with the security of industrial control systems.\n\u201cWe want to open this space up to more people,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult now to find people who have the right experience. We haven\u2019t seen many attacks on these systems yet, but that\u2019s not because they are secure. The barrier for people who want to work in the cyber-physical security space is high right now, and we want to lower that.\u201d\nBeyah and Formby have been working for several years to increase awareness of the vulnerabilities inherent in industrial control systems. While the community still has more to do, Beyah is encouraged.\n\u201cSeveral years ago, we talked to a lot of process control engineers as part of the NSF\u2019s I-Corps program,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was clear that for many of these folks then, security was not a major concern. But we\u2019ve seen changes, and lots of people are now taking system security seriously.\u201d\nResearch News\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\n177 North Avenue\nAtlanta, Georgia\u00a0 30332-0181\u00a0 USA\nMedia Relations Assistance : John Toon (404-894-6986) (jtoon@gatech.edu)\nWriter : John Toon\nAdditional Images\nContact\nJohn Toon\nResearch News\n(404) 894-6986\nEmail\njtoon@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
