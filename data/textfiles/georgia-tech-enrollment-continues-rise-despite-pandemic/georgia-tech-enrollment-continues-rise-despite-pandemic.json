Graduate students accounted for most of the increase, with the bulk of those new students enrolled in online master\u2019s degree programs.\nTech\u2019s total graduate enrollment is 23,210, a 14% increase over last year. Of those, 15,664 students are enrolled in online master\u2019s programs: 10,580 in computer science; 4,252 in analytics; and 832 in cybersecurity.\n\"Georgia Tech's online master's programs in computer science, analytics, and cybersecurity offer our students affordable and accessible options for earning degrees that otherwise might not have been available to them,\" said Bonnie Ferri, vice provost of Graduate Education and Faculty Development. \"These programs continue to grow because they offer high-quality degrees that help students achieve their goals \u2014 even in the midst of a pandemic.\u201d\nUndergraduate enrollment also climbed slightly to 16,562 students. The Fall 2020 class includes 10,322 undergraduate students from Georgia, which is more than 60% of the undergraduate population. Tech continued to see overall increases in Hispanic or Latino (10.7%), Black (8.4%), and female students (10%). In fact, the first-year class included a record number of Black students \u2014 10% more than 2019.\nThis year, Georgia Tech also enrolled an Institute record 1,150 new transfer students, 200 more than last year\u2019s fall class. Transfer students hailed from 213 different colleges, including 39 Georgia colleges and 43 community colleges. Through newly created transfer pathway programs ( admission.gatech.edu/transfer/transfer-pathway-programs ), Tech continues to enroll significantly more first-generation students and students from underrepresented backgrounds.\nTech\u2019s fall semester enrollment increase comes at a time when college enrollment across the nation is declining, amid uncertainty during a major health pandemic.\n\u201cDespite the numerous challenges Covid-19 has presented, Tech remains incredibly healthy from an enrollment standpoint,\u201d said Rick Clark, director of Undergraduate Admission. \u201cThis speaks to the strength of our distinct brand, the long-term value of a Georgia Tech degree, and the immeasurable resilience of our students. At a precarious time for some colleges and universities, Tech continues to thrive in its role as a critical public good for our city, state, and nation.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nContact\nDenise Ward\nInstitute Communications\nEmail\ndenise.ward@comm.gatech.edu\nAdditional information\nFall 2020 Enrollment at Georgia Tech:\nTotal \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 39,772\nFirst-year students\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2,108\nSecond-year students\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 3,455\nThird-year students \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 3,933\nFourth-year students (and above)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 6,247\nGraduate students\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 23,210\nDual-enrollment students\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 673\nNon-degree-seeking undergrads \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 146\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
