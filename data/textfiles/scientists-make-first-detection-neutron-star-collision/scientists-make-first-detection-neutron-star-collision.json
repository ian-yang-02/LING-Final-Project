A baby\u2019s first steps.\nLaura Cadonati\u2019s first chirp came on\nSeptember 14, 2015 . It lasted just a fraction of second, passing through Earth 1.5 billion years after a violent collision of two massive black holes. The signal confirmed the existence of gravitational waves, ripples in space-time, which the world had been hoping to detect since Albert Einstein predicted them a century ago.\nOn August 17 of this year, Cadonati and her LIGO colleagues heard another chirp \u2014 much different from the original. This chirp didn\u2019t come and go in the blink of an eye. It stretched for 100 seconds.\n\u201cGroundbreaking,\u201d said Cadonati, a professor in the\nCollege of Sciences . \u201cIt\u2019s just as special as the first one, if not more.\u201d\nThat\u2019s because the gravitational wave that produced this chirp arrived with something else, something that couldn\u2019t have been produced by colliding black holes. It arrived with light.\n130-Million-Year-Old Clues\nFor the first time, scientists have detected a gravitational wave produced by the collision of two neutron stars. The wave was born 130 million years ago when the stars spun around each other, creating warps in space and time. When the stars crashed together, they produced a burst of electromagnetic radiation \u2014 gamma radiation, to be precise.\nThose gravitational waves and gamma rays raced through the cosmos at the speed of light, arriving at Earth at 8:41 a.m. on August 17.\nThe waves were first detected by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) and Italy\u2019s Virgo observatory. NASA\u2019s orbiting Fermi satellite saw the gamma ray flash two seconds later, and the European Science Agency also confirmed it. In the days and weeks afterward, other forms of electromagnetic radiation \u2014 including X-ray, ultraviolet, optical, infrared and radio waves \u2014 were detected by nearly 70 ground- and space-based observatories around the world.\nThe observations are allowing scientists to view a neutron star collision, and learn what happens next, for the first time.\n\u201cThe 2015 detection was about discovery. This time it\u2019s about understanding,\u201d said Cadonati, who also serves as deputy spokesperson of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration (LSC), an international team of more than 1,200 researchers. \u201cWe\u2019re decoding the mysteries of the universe using our senses. We\u2019re listening to the information within gravitational waves and combining it with what we\u2019re seeing within electromagnetic radiation.\u201d\nA Golden Collision\nNeutron stars form when massive stars explode in supernovas and collapse upon themselves. The August 17 neutron stars were about 12 miles in diameter \u2014 about the size of Atlanta \u2014 with an estimated mass within the range of 1.1 to 1.6 times that of our sun. Neutron stars are so incredibly dense that a teaspoon of their material would weigh a billion tons.\nThe gravitational waves they produced are gone forever, arriving and leaving the LIGO and Virgo detectors in less than two minutes. But the fragments of the collision remain in view for electromagnetic researchers, who have pointed their telescopes and instruments at the faraway galaxy.\nTheorists have predicted that what follows the initial fireball is a \u201ckilonova\u201d \u2014 a phenomenon by which the material that is left over from the collision is blown out of the immediate region and far out into space and triggers a chain of nuclear reactions. The new light-based observations show that heavy elements, such as lead, gold and platinum, are created in these collisions and subsequently distributed throughout the universe. This solves a decades-long mystery of where about half of all elements heavier than iron are produced.\nMore findings are expected as scientists continue to monitor the smashup\u2019s remnants in the weeks and months to come.\n\u201cThis detection has genuinely opened the doors to a new way of doing astrophysics,\u201d said Cadonati. \u201cI expect it will be remembered as one of the most studied astrophysical events in history.\u201d\nThe Tech Contribution\nCadonati announced the findings during a press conference on October 16 in Washington, D.C., as part of a panel of LIGO, Virgo and electromagnetic researchers. She\u2019s one of 17 Georgia Tech faculty members, postdoctoral researchers and students within the LSC. Each is also a member of the Georgia Tech\nCenter for Relativistic Astrophysics\nwithin the\nSchool of Physics .\n\u201cTo me, it\u2019s easily the most interesting physical discovery in recent times,\u201d said graduate student Christopher Evans. \u201cThis not only gives us a chance to study neutron stars in a manner that we have never before, but also allows us to look at these exotic objects from multiple perspectives at once in order to form a more complete picture.\u201d\nEvans created a visualization of the collision and the gravitational waves it produced. The animation was included in the worldwide announcement at the Press Club.\nPostdoctoral researcher Karelle Siellez joined the Georgia Tech LIGO team in 2015. For this discovery, she collaborated with NASA\u2019s Fermi satellite team as it searched the skies for gamma rays. She developed algorithms that helped ensure that no bursts, as faint as they might be, would be overlooked during the search for gravitational waves. Siellez will now work on the development of new algorithms for the joint search of gravitational waves and faint gamma ray bursts when the LIGO instruments come back online in 2018.\n\u201cToday we are in a river,\u201d she said. \u201cTomorrow\u00a0we will swim in an ocean of data where\u00a0neutron star mergers\u00a0guide us to a better understanding of our universe, observing cataclysmic events we once could only dream of.\u201d\nAnother Georgia Tech postdoctoral researcher, James Clark, was at a workshop in Montana on August 17. He was leading a discussion on the possibilities and prospects for analysis of postmerger signals from binary neutron star mergers. As soon as he received news of the detection, he initiated analyses to probe the later, high-frequency stages of the merger using the techniques he spent years developing.\nClark said the days after August 17 were the most exciting of his career.\n\u201cI\u2019ve dedicated so much of my career to the detection of neutron stars,\u201d said Clark, who has been in LIGO for 10 years. \u201cWhen I sit back and think about what was observed and the future potential for new science from this event, the hairs on my arms raise. I\u2019m overwhelmed with a similar sense of excitement and wonder that I experience when motorcycling through the Scottish mountains in my homeland. It has been amazing.\u201d\nThe Georgia Tech LSC Team Faculty Laura Cadonati, Professor and LSC Deputy Spokesperson Pablo Laguna, Professor and Chair of the School of Physics Deirdre Shoemaker, Professor and Director of the Center for Relativistic Astrophysics Postdoctoral Researchers Juan Calderon Bustillo James Clark Karan Jani Karelle Siellez\nGraduate Students Erika Cowan Chris Evans Deborah Ferguson Sudarshan Ghonge Bhavesh Khamesra\nUndergraduate Students\nClayton Burrus Taylor Carter Aiqi Cheng Kate Napier Will Wills\nLIGO is funded by the \u00a0NSF , and operated by\u00a0 Caltech \u00a0and\u00a0 MIT , which conceived of LIGO and led the Initial and Advanced LIGO projects.\u00a0Financial support for the Advanced LIGO project was led by the NSF with Germany ( Max Planck Society ), the U.K. ( Science and Technology Facilities Council ) and Australia ( Australian Research Council ) making significant commitments and contributions to the project.\u00a0More than 1,200 scientists \u00a0 and some 100\u00a0 institutions \u00a0 from around the world participate in the effort through the\u00a0 LIGO Scientific Collaboration , which includes the GEO Collaboration and the Australian collaboration OzGrav.
