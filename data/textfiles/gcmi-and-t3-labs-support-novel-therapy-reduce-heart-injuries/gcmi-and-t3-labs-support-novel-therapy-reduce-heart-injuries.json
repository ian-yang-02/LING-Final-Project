But a new treatment could prevent these damaging effects.\nPartnering with the\nGlobal Center for Medical Innovation (GCMI)\nTranslational Testing and Training Laboratories, Inc. (T3), Lindon H. Young, the director of the Endocrinology and Introduction to Human Disease and Therapeutics courses in the Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine program at the Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine, is developing this therapy.\n\u201cThese treatments could be used to help reduce damage to the heart from ROS during procedures such as percutaneous coronary intervention after heart attack,\u201d he said. \u201cThis treatment is aimed at improving the heart function and hospitalizations/morbidity post myocardial infarction.\u201d\nYoung is testing his treatment on pigs with induced ischemia, or loss of blood flow, for an hour via balloon catheter followed by three-plus hours of reperfusion, or when blood returns to oxygen-deprived tissue. Treatment starts at the onset of reperfusion via an intra-arterial administration through the left anterior descending artery of the left coronary artery. During the procedure, the researchers will take blood samples and measurements such as EKG readings and blood pressure to monitor the animal\u2019s response. Researchers then observe the heart tissue and effects of treatment.\nThis methodology came directly from Young\u2019s partnership with T3.\n\u201cThe surgeons told us they are most likely to deliver this therapy straight to the artery,\u201d he said. \u201cAdopting a protocol that more closely mirrors the actual clinical application in humans, was a high value recommendation.\u201d\nThe study is already producing promising results and could lead to more funding.\n\u201cThe T3 Labs team gave us great advice outside of our area of expertise on the procedure even if it meant protocol deviation, on the fly, because of their high level of confidence in clinical relevance,\u201d Young said.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nTess Malone, Research Writer/Editor\nEmail\ntess.malone@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
