Social Lab at Georgia Tech. \u201cFor example, those campaigns that follow the concept of reciprocity \u2013 that is, offer a gift in return for a pledge \u2013 and the perceptions of social participation and authority, generated the greatest amount of funding.\u201d\u00a0 While offering donors a gift may improve a campaign\u2019s success, the study found the language project creators used to express the reward made the difference. For example, the phrases \u201calso receive two,\u201d \u201chas pledged\u201d and \u201cproject will be\u201d strongly foretell that a project will reach funding status, while phrases such as \u201cdressed up,\u201d \u201cnot been able\u201d and \u201ctrusting\u201d are attached to unfunded projects.\u00a0 The researchers examined the success of Pebble, which is the most successful Kickstarter campaign to date with more than $10 million in pledges, and compared it to Ninja Baseball, a well-publicized PC game that only earned a third of its $10,000 goal.\u00a0 \u201cThe discrepancy in funding success between projects like Pebble and Ninja Baseball prompted us to consider why some projects meet funding goals and others do not,\u201d Mitra said. \u201cWe found that the driving factors in crowdfunding ranged from social participation to encouragement to gifts \u2013 all of which are distinguished by the language used in the project description.\u201d\u00a0 For their research, Gilbert and Mitra assembled a list of all Kickstarter projects launched as of June 2, 2012, and had reached their last date of fund collection. Of the more than 45,000 projects, 51.53 percent were successfully funded while 48.47 percent were not.\u00a0 After controlling for variables such as funding goals, video, social media connections, categories and pledge levels, the researchers focused on more than 20,000 phrases before compiling a dictionary of more than 100 phrases with predictive powers of success or failure.\u00a0 The research suggested that the language used by creators to pitch their project plays a major role in driving the project\u2019s success, accounting for 58.56 percent of the variance around success. The language generally fit into the following categories:\u00a0 Reciprocity\nor the tendency to return a favor after receiving one as evidenced by phrases such as \u201calso receive two,\u201d \u201cpledged will\u201d and \u201cgood karma and .\u201d \u00a0 Scarcity\nor attachment to something rare as shown with \u201coption is\u201d and \u201cgiven the chance.\u201d\u00a0 Social Proof , which suggests that people depend on others for social cues on how to act as shown by the phrase \u201chas pledged.\u201d\u00a0 Social Identity\nor the feeling of belonging to a specific social group. Phrases such as \u201cto build this\u201d and \u201caccessible to the\u201d fit this category.\u00a0 Liking , which reflects the fact that people comply with people or products that appeal to them.\u00a0 Authority , where people resort to expert opinions for making efficient and quick decisions as shown by phrases such as \u201cwe can afford\u201d and \u201cproject will be.\u201d\u00a0 The team\u2019s findings are summarized in the paper \u201cThe Language that Gets People to Give: Phrases that Predict Success on Kickstarter.\u201d The\npaper\nwill be formally presented at the\n17 th\nACM Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing (CSCW 2014)\nto be held in Baltimore, Md., from Feb. 15 to 19.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nPhillip Taylor College of Computing at Georgia Tech ptaylor@cc.gatech.edu 404.894.7253\nEmail\nptaylor@cc.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
