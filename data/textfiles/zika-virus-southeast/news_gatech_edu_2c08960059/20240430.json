It is believed that most of these infections were contracted outside the United States. While the Zika virus is transmitted primarily through the bite of an infected mosquito, it can also be transmitted through sexual contact with a person who is infected with the Zika virus.\nThe Florida Department of Health has identified an area in south Florida where Zika is being spread by mosquitoes. The Aedes species mosquito that transmits Zika is found throughout the Southeast.\nSymptoms of the infection are generally mild and include fever, rash, joint pain, and conjunctivitis (red eyes). These symptoms generally last from several days to a week. It is uncommon for individuals who are infected with the disease to require hospitalization.\nThe most significant complication of Zika infection is seen in infants born from infected mothers. Zika infection can cause serious birth defects and possibly death of the unborn fetus. In the US, there is no recommendation at this time for routine screening during pregnancy.\nSince currently there is no vaccine or medicine to treat the Zika virus, the best way to prevent Zika is to protect yourself from mosquito bites. Mosquitoes breed in standing water, so even small areas of stagnant water need to be drained. Even an overturned bottle cap filled with rainwater can be a breeding place. In addition to eliminating stagnant water, it is essential that anyone spending time outdoors use an effective mosquito repellant containing ingredients such as\nDEET or Picaridin\nPlease refer to the\nCDC website\nfor the most up to date information.\n*\nTop Five Things Everyone Needs to Know About Zika\n*\nCDC\u2019s Response to Zika: What we Know and What We Don\u2019t Know\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nStamps Health Services\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention: Zika Virus\nFacilities Management: Mosquito Controlling on Campus\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
