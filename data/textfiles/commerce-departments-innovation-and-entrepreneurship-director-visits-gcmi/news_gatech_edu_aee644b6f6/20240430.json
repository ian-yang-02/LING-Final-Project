GCMI, which launched in 2012, is the Southeast\u2019s first comprehensive medical device innovation center. An affiliate of Georgia Tech, GCMI\u2019s core mission is to accelerate the development and commercialization of next-generation medical devices and technology. The Commerce Department\u2019s Economic Development Administration arm awarded a $1 million i6 Challenge grant to GCMI in 2010 toward its launch. \u201cI want to come see what it is the federal government is investing in and how it\u2019s impacting people,\u201d said Julie Lenzer Kirk, director of the Commerce Department\u2019s Office of Innovation and Entrepreneurship. \u201cBeing one of our original i6 winners, GCMI also offers some insight as we continue to evolve the program.\u201d While touring the facility with Georgia Tech President G.P. \u201cBud\u201d Peterson and GCMI Executive Director Tiffany Wilson Karp, Kirk saw its design, engineering, and prototyping capabilities as well as its cleanroom space. She also learned about GCMI\u2019s relationships with Children\u2019s Healthcare of Atlanta and West Tennessee Healthcare, as well as a number of medical device-related organizations. \u201cWe have been working to bring together the rich medical device ecosystem in the Southeast around our prototyping expertise and infrastructure to help medtech startups accelerate commercialization,\u201d Karp said. \u201cOur mission is to help these early-stage companies bring those solutions to market and make a difference in the quality of patients\u2019 lives.\u201d GCMI\u2019s focus on that core mission and doing so from an entrepreneurial viewpoint is impressive, Kirk said, adding that she will be looking at its best practices and lessons learned in formulating criteria for future i6 Challenges. \u201cIt\u2019s just been really great to see the impact that they\u2019re having at the university, in the technology community, and ultimately right to the patient \u2014 and that\u2019s why we do what we do,\u201d Kirk said following the Jan. 15 tour. \u201cIt is a place for entrepreneurs and innovation, and that\u2019s part of the message: that it takes an entrepreneurial mindset to get this kind of thing done.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nGlobal Center for Medical Innovation (GCMI)\nContact\nP\u00e9ralte C.
