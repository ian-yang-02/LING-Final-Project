The announcement comes after an almost yearlong effort to evaluate and introduce a new videoconferencing solution for academic course delivery and collaboration.\nWith the Institute\u2019s existing agreement with BlueJeans set to expire at the end of the spring semester \u2014 and the sunset of the WebEx platform in December 2021* \u2014 the\nVideo Collaboration Review\n(VCR) team formed in early 2021 to explore new video collaboration platforms that meet the academic and operational needs of students, faculty, and staff. The committee, comprised of members from each division and College, along with students and technology representatives, identified requirements and evaluated possible solutions on their ability to:\nEnable secure, reliable, and flexible course delivery and student learning.\nSupport virtual classrooms and meetings of multiple sizes.\nFacilitate effective\u202fcollaboration\u202fand communication across the Institute.\n\u201cIt was critically important to us that we start our selection process with an examination of our needs from a collaboration, teaching, and learning perspective,\u201d said Daren Hubbard, Georgia Tech vice president of Information Technology\u00a0and chief information officer. \u201cThe committee spent a great deal of time articulating these criteria so that we could, as objectively as possible, evaluate a number of options and eventually recommend a solution for Georgia Tech.\u201d\n\u201cNot only did Zoom, to a large extent, meet our committee\u2019s criteria, but it is also one of the most widely used video collaboration tools,\u201d said Yakut Gazi, Ph.D., associate dean for Learning Systems at Georgia Tech Professional Education. \u201cMany of our students, faculty, and staff have participated in Zoom meetings during and even before the pandemic, which we anticipate will facilitate adoption at Georgia Tech.\u201d\nThe VCR team had planned to launch a two-month pilot of Zoom at Georgia Tech last October.\n\u201cDue to unforeseen circumstances, we regrettably had to delay, then ultimately cancel our planned October pilot,\u201d Gazi said. \u201cThanks to collaborative work between the Office of Information Technology (OIT), Procurement and Business Services, and the Office of the General Counsel, we were able to come to an agreement with Zoom in December, setting us up for our soft launch in February with our campus partners.\u201d\nCanvas has been integrated with Zoom and will enable convenient access for faculty and students in blended and online learning courses. During the first phase of the Zoom soft launch, the platform will only be available to Georgia Tech users who host meetings from inside the U.S. Zoom recordings will be automatically migrated to the user\u2019s\nKaltura MediaSpace\naccount.\n\u201cOver the course of the next few months, our teams will work to tighten the integration of Zoom with the classroom technology systems, as well as with the Kaltura MediaSpace video storage and delivery system, to further enhance the interoperability of our academic technology ecosystem,\u201d Gazi said. \u201cWe will also be working with Tech entities and Zoom to expand the platform\u2019s usage to all Georgia Tech learners, independent of their global location.\u201d\nGazi also applauded the extensive due diligence process that guided the committee\u2019s decision to bring the platform to Georgia Tech.\n\u201cI am thankful for the resilience and persistence of the committee members who guided this process for many months. I am excited to introduce this much needed platform to our community and welcome input as we continue to improve our technology tools and services.\u201d\nOIT\u00a0will work with the Georgia Tech community through the spring to prepare for the transition from BlueJeans. Upcoming communications will share resources for securely migrating stored lecture and meeting recordings and additional information.\nThe campus community is invited to join an upcoming \u2018Ask Me Anything\u2019 informational Zoom session:\nMonday, Feb. 14, 3:30 \u2013 4:15 p.m.\nTuesday, Feb. 15, 2 \u2013 2:45 p.m.\nGeorgia Tech users can log into Zoom at\ngatech.zoom.us .\nMore Zoom information and resources will be made available to the Georgia Tech community in the coming months.\n*The Georgia Tech Research Institute will continue to use its version of WebEx ( gtri.webex.com ).\nAdditional Images\nEmail\noit@gatech.edu\nAdditional information\nA few notes about accessing Zoom at Georgia Tech:\nStudents, faculty, and staff can access Zoom at\ngatech.zoom.us.\nSign in with your Georgia Tech login ID and password.\nDuring this first phase, Zoom meetings must be hosted from inside the U.S. (Meeting participants can join from anywhere in the world.)\nZoom will integrate with Canvas to enable course delivery.
