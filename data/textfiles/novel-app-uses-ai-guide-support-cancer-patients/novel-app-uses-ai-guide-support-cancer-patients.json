So the information available on the app \u2013 which runs on a tablet computer \u2013 regularly changes based on each patient\u2019s progress. Are you scheduled for surgery? MyPath will tell you what you need to know the day before.\n\u201cPatients have told us, \u2018It just seemed to magically know what I needed,\u2019\u201d said\nElizabeth Mynatt , principal investigator for the work and Distinguished Professor in the\nSchool of Interactive Computing\nat Georgia Tech.\nMynatt, who is also Executive Director of the\nInstitute for People and Technology , believes that MyPath is the first healthcare app capable of personalization (through its application of AI) for holistic cancer care. In addition to incorporating a patient\u2019s medical data, the app also addresses a variety of other relevant issues such as social and emotional needs.\nShe presented the work February 15 at the 2019 meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. The research has been sponsored by the National Cancer Institute.\nNational Recognition\nIn January MyPath was recognized by iSchools, a consortium of some 100 institutions worldwide (including Georgia Tech) dedicated to advancing the information field. Maia Jacobs, who recently received her Ph.D. from Georgia Tech for her work on MyPath, was named winner of the 2019 iSchools Doctoral Dissertation Award.\nAccording to iSchools, \u201cthe Award Committee felt [that Jacobs\u2019 work] was timely and important, and lauded its impact in how patients manage their health.\u201d Jacobs, now a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard, is currently exploring how to expand MyPath to other diseases.\nThe work was also honored in 2016 when it was featured in a report to President Barack Obama by the President\u2019s Cancer Panel. The report, Improving Cancer-Related Outcomes with Connected Health, aimed to \u201chelp patients manage their health information and participate in their own care,\u201d according to a Georgia Tech story at the time.\nThe Beginning\nSix years ago Mynatt\u2019s team began working with the Harbin Clinic in Rome, Georgia. \u201cThey have a tremendous program in holistic cancer care where they recognize that their patients, who are from a large rural area, face a variety of challenges to be able to successfully navigate the cancer journey,\u201d Mynatt said.\nBut the Harbin doctors and cancer navigators \u2013 people who help patients through the cancer journey \u2013 wanted a better way to stay connected to patients on a regular basis. The navigators, in particular, found that they tended to interact with patients a great deal at diagnosis, but less frequently over time. And that meant that although there are many recommendations for, say, lowering anxiety, they weren\u2019t necessarily being communicated.\nSaid Mynatt, \u201cWe wondered how technology could amplify what these great people are doing.\u201d\nHow it Works\nMyPath begins with a mobile library of resources compiled from the American Cancer Society and other reputable organizations. Then, it is personalized with each patient\u2019s diagnosis and treatment plan, including the dates for specific procedures. Patients also complete regular surveys that help inform the system \u2013 and caregivers \u2013 of their changing needs and symptoms.\nThe result is a system that provides each patient with resources and suggestions specific to their personal situation. Because MyPath knows, for example, that you have stage 2 breast cancer and will be undergoing a lumpectomy on a specific date, when you click on the category \u201cPreparing for Surgery\u201d it will suggest relevant articles to prepare you for what\u2019s ahead. Have you reported nausea in the system\u2019s survey? MyPath will bring your attention to resources that can help combat the side effect. The system also provides quick access to contact information for specific caregivers.\nOther apps \u2013 and the Internet \u2013 aren\u2019t personalized. That means slogging through a great deal of often technical information that\u2019s not relevant to your situation. In contrast, \u201cEvery day MyPath puts the right resources at your fingertips to help you through your cancer journey,\u201d Mynatt said.\nMore than Medical\nSome of MyPath\u2019s most popular features have nothing to do directly with cancer. Buttons for \u201cEmotional Support\u201d and \u201cDay to Day Matters\u201d are regularly consulted by patients. \u201cWhen we asked them about how they used the tablet for healthcare, many patients would talk to us about playing Angry Birds, which they would download to distract them during chemo sessions,\u201d Mynatt said.\nMyPath is the second generation of the app. Patient feedback from its predecessor, My Journey Compass, led to changes including the personalization. Development continues. For example, Mynatt\u2019s team is hoping to expand the app for use by cancer survivors, who often face additional challenges like hormone replacement therapy. The team is also working on a version that individual patients could download, which would make the app available to many more users.\nThis work is sponsored by the National Cancer Institute, part of the National Institutes of Health, under award RO1 CA195653.
