Lasers, here in pink, can manipulate the exiting atoms for desired effects.\u00a0Credit: Georgia Tech / Ella Maru studios work for hire\nApr 23, 2019\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nTo a non-physicist, an \u201catomic beam collimator\u201d may sound like a phaser firing mystical particles. That might not be the worst metaphor to introduce a technology that\nresearchers have now miniaturized , making it more likely to someday land in handheld devices.\nToday, atomic beam collimators are mostly found in physics labs, where they shoot out atoms in a beam that produces exotic quantum phenomena and which has properties that may be useful in precision technologies. By shrinking collimators from the size of a small appliance to fit on a fingertip, researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology want to make the technology available to engineers advancing devices like atomic clocks or\u00a0 accelerometers , a component found in smartphones.\n\u201cA typical device you might make out of this is a next-generation gyroscope for a precision navigation system that is independent of GPS and can be used when you\u2019re out of satellite range in a remote region or traveling in space,\u201d said Chandra Raman,\u00a0 an associate professor in Georgia Tech\u2019s School of Physics \u00a0and a co-principal investigator on the study.\nThe research was funded by the Office of Navy Research. The researchers\npublished their results in the journal\u00a0 Nature Communications \u00a0on April 23, 2019.\nHere\u2019s what a collimator is, some of the quantum potential in atomic beams, and how the miniature collimator format could help atomic beams shape new generations of technology.\nPocket atomic shotgun\n\u201cCollimated atomic beams have been around for decades,\u201d Raman said, \u201cBut currently, collimators must be large in order to be precise.\u201d\nThe atomic beam starts in a box full of atoms, often\u00a0 rubidium , heated to a vapor so that the atoms zing about chaotically. A tube taps into the box, and random atoms with the right trajectory shoot into the tube like pellets entering the barrel of a shotgun.\nLike pellets leaving a shotgun, the atoms exit the end of the tube shooting reasonably straight but also with a random spray of atomic shot flying at skewed angles. In an atomic beam, that spray produces signal noise, and the improved collimator-on-a-chip eliminates most of it for a more precise, nearly perfectly parallel beam of atoms.\nThe beam is much more focused and pure than beams coming from existing collimators. The researchers would also like their collimator to enable experimental physicists to more conveniently create complex quantum states.\n[Thinking about grad school?\u00a0 Here's how to apply to Georgia Tech. ]\nUnwavering inertia machine\nBut more immediately, the collimator sets up Newtonian mechanics that could be adapted for practical use.\nThe improved beams are streams of unwavering\u00a0 inertia \u00a0because, unlike a laser beam, which is made of massless photons, atoms have mass and thus momentum and inertia. This makes their beams potentially ideal reference points in beam-driven\u00a0 gyroscopes \u00a0that help track motion and changes in location.\nCurrent gyroscopes in GPS-free navigation devices are precise in the short run but not the long run, which means recalibrating or replacing them ever so often, and that makes them less convenient, say, on the moon or on Mars.\n\u201cConventional chip-scale instruments based on\u00a0 MEMS (microelectromechanical systems) technology \u00a0suffer from drift over time from various stresses,\u201d said co-principal investigator Farrokh Ayazi, who is Ken Byers\u00a0 Professor in Georgia Tech\u2019s School of Electrical and\u00a0Computer Engineering . \u201cTo eliminate that drift, you need an absolutely stable mechanism. This atomic beam creates that kind of reference on a chip.\u201d\nQuantum entanglement beam\nHeat-excited atoms in a beam can also be converted into\u00a0 Rydberg atoms, which provide a cornucopia of quantum properties .\nWhen an atom is energized enough, its outermost orbiting electron bumps out so far that the atom balloons in size. Orbiting so far out with so much energy, that outermost electron behaves like the lone electron of a hydrogen atom, and the Rydberg atom acts as if it had only a single proton.\n\u201cYou can engineer certain kinds of multi-atom quantum entanglement by using Rydberg states because the atoms interact with each other much more strongly than two atoms in the ground state,\u201d Raman said.\n\u201cRydberg atoms could also advance future sensor technologies because they\u2019re sensitive to fluxes in force or in electronic fields smaller than an electron in scale,\u201d Ayazi said. \u201cThey could also be used in quantum information processing.\u201d\nLithographed silicon\u00a0grooves\nThe researchers devised a surprisingly convenient way to make the new collimator, which could encourage manufacturers to adopt it: They cut long, extremely narrow channels through a silicon wafer running parallel to its flat surface. The channels were like shotgun barrels lined up side-by-side to shoot out an array of atomic beams.\nSilicon is an exceptionally slick material for the atoms to fly through and also is used in many existing microelectronic and computing technologies. That opens up the possibility for combining these technologies on a chip with the new miniature collimator. Lithography, which is used to etch existing chip technology, was used to precisely cut the collimator's channels.\nThe researchers\u2019 biggest innovation greatly reduced the shotgun-like spray, i.e. the signal noise. They sliced two gaps in the channels, forming an aligned cascade of three sets of parallel arrays of barrels.\nAtoms flying at skewed angles jump out of the channels at the gaps and those flying reasonably parallel in the first array of channels continue on to the next one, then the process repeats going from the second into the third array of channels. This gives the new collimator\u2019s atomic beams their exceptional straightness.\nAlso read:\nWhat spooky quantum particles have in common with curveballs\nThese authors contributed to the study: Chao Li, Xiao Chai, Bochao Wei, Jeremy Yang, and Anosh Daruwalla, all from Georgia Tech.
