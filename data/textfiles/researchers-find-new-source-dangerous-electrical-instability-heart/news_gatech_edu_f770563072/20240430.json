(Credit: FDA)\nMay 03, 2017\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nSudden cardiac death resulting from fibrillation \u2013 erratic heartbeat due to electrical instability \u2013 is one of the leading causes of death in the United States. Now, researchers have discovered a fundamentally new source of that electrical instability, a development that could potentially lead to new methods for predicting and preventing life-threatening cardiac fibrillation.\nA steady heartbeat is maintained by electrical signals that originate deep within the heart and travel through the muscular organ in regular waves that stimulate the coordinated contraction of muscle fibers. But when those waves are interrupted by blockages in electrical conduction \u2013 such as scar tissue from a heart attack \u2013 the signals can be disrupted, creating chaotic spiral-shaped electrical waves that interfere with one another. The resulting electrical turbulence causes the heart to beat ineffectively, quickly leading to death.\nScientists have known that instabilities at the cellular level, especially variation in the duration of each electrical signal \u2013 known as an action potential \u2013 are of primary importance in creating chaotic fibrillation. By analyzing electrical signals in the hearts of an animal model, researchers from the Georgia Institute of Technology and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration have found an additional factor \u2013 the varying amplitude of the action potential \u2013 that may also cause dangerous electrical turbulence within the heart.\nThe research, supported by the National Science Foundation, was reported April 20 in the journal\nPhysical Review Letters .\n\u201cMathematically, we can now understand some of these life-threatening instabilities and how they develop in the heart,\u201d said\nFlavio Fenton , a professor in Georgia Tech\u2019s\nSchool of Physics.\n\u201cWe have proposed a new mechanism that explains when fibrillation will occur, and we have a theory that can predict, depending on physiological parameters, when this will happen.\u201d\nThe voltage signal that governs the electrically-driven heartbeat is mapped by doctors from the body surface using electrocardiogram technology, which is characterized by five main segments (P-QRS-T), each representing different activations in the heart. T waves occur at the end of each heartbeat, and indicate the back portion of each wave. Researchers have known that abnormalities in the T wave can signal an increased risk of a potentially life-threatening heart rhythm.\nFenton and his collaborators studied the cellular action potential amplitude, which is controlled by sodium ion channels that are part of the heart\u2019s natural regulatory system. Sodium ions flowing into the cells boost the concentration of cations \u2013 which carry a positive charge \u2013 leading to a phenomena known as depolarization, in which the action potential of the cell rises above its resting level. The sodium channels then close at the peak of the action potential.\nWhile variations in the duration of the action potential indicate problems with the heart\u2019s electrical system, the researchers have now associated dynamic variations in the amplitude of the action potential with conduction block and the onset of fibrillation.\n\u201cWe have shown for the first time that a fundamentally different instability related to amplitude may underlie or additionally affect the risk of cardiac instabilities leading to fibrillation,\u201d said Richard Gray, one of the study\u2019s co-authors and a biomedical engineer in the Office of Science and Engineering Laboratories in the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.\nThe mathematical analysis provides a simple explanation.\n\u201cYou can have one wave with a long amplitude followed by one wave with a short amplitude, and if the short one becomes too short, the next wave will not be able to propagate,\u201d said Diana Chen, a Georgia Tech graduate student and first author of the study. \u201cThe waves going through the heart have to move together to maintain an effective heartbeat. If one of them breaks, the first wave can collide with the next wave, initiating the spiral waves.\u201d\nIf similar results are found in human hearts, this new understanding of how electrical turbulence forms could allow doctors to better predict who would be at risk of fibrillation. The information might also lead to the development of new drugs for preventing or treating the condition.\n\u201cOne next scientific step would be to investigate pharmaceuticals that would reduce or eliminate the cellular amplitude instability,\u201d said Gray. \u201cAt the present time, most pharmaceutical approaches are focused on the action potential duration.\u201d\nThe critical role of electrical waves in governing the heart\u2019s activity allows physics \u2013 and mathematics \u2013 to be used for understanding what is happening in this most critical organ, Fenton said.\n\u201cWe have derived a mathematical explanation for how this happens, why it is dangerous and how it initiates an arrhythmia,\u201d he explained. \u201cWe now have a mechanism that provides a better understanding of how these electrical disturbances originate. It\u2019s only when you have these changes in wave amplitude that the signals cannot propagate properly.\u201d\nChen studied at the FDA\u2019s Center for Devices and Radiological Health through the NSF/FDA Scholar-in- Residence Program. Operated in collaboration with the National Science Foundation\u2019s Directorate for Engineering\u2019s Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental, and Transport Systems, the program enables investigators in science, engineering and mathematics to develop research collaborations within the intramural research environment at the FDA.\nIn addition to those already mentioned, the paper included work from Ilija Uzelac, a postdoctoral fellow, and Conner Herndon, a graduate research assistant.
