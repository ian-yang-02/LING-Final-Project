That is the goal for the Phase 1 report from the Commission on Research Next (CRN), an initiative brought together by Georgia Tech\u2019s executive vice president for Research, Chaouki T. Abdallah.\nThe CRN \u2013 led by Tim Lieuwen, Regents Professor, David S. Lewis Jr. Chair in the Daniel Guggenheim School of Aerospace Engineering, and executive director of the Strategic Energy Institute; and Wen Masters, deputy director, Information and Cyber Sciences in the Georgia Tech Research Institute (GTRI) \u2013 tapped the knowledge and expertise of Georgia Tech faculty, staff, and students to analyze what the research landscape will look like ahead, for Georgia Tech and for other research-intensive universities.\nThe report\u2019s authors will provide an overview of their findings at a town hall meeting on Wednesday, March 17, at 1 p.m. at\nprimetime.bluejeans.com/a2m/live-event/czadczdq . The Phase 1 report will be available online after the presentation at\nresearchnext.gatech.edu .\nThe report includes six chapters:\nFraming the Research Landscape (Chapter 1) sets the stage by asking one question: If we were to develop the university research enterprise from scratch, what would it look like? This question arises from the growing complexity and interconnectedness of modern research universities.\nThe World Beyond (Chapter 2) analyzes the external global factors that are beyond the control of any individual research university, but which affect how these universities function. Specifically, it addresses how evolving conditions could shape the topics, methods, funding, partnerships, and other resources important to conducting research.\nResearch That Matters (Chapter 3) identifies grand challenges, emerging topics, and requisite methods that will be addressed at major research universities. By tackling these areas, leading research universities will enhance society by fostering discovery through curiosity-driven research.\nWorking With Others (Chapter 4) focuses on university partnerships, analyzing the connection between research, education, and the value flow between them. In particular, it addresses the question of how research universities can cultivate a portfolio of purposeful strategic relationships, amplifying impact across individual, institutional, city, state, regional, national, and global dimensions.\nThe World Within (Chapter 5) examines the explicit and implicit functions and structures employed by the university research ecosystem to carry out its mission.\nChapter 6\u2019s Closing Remarks bring together the findings and set the stage for the second phase of the initiative \u2013 developing a plan for how the Georgia Tech research enterprise will respond to the challenges identified.\nA second team of faculty, staff, and students is now working on Phase 2 of the effort, which will be to develop a strategy for how Georgia Tech\u2019s research enterprise will \u2013 in alignment with the Institute\u2019s new strategic plan \u2013 move forward into the decades ahead. There are 82 members of committees working on the six goal teams for Phase 2.\nTo join the town hall, go to:\nprimetime.bluejeans.com/a2m/live-event/czadczdq .\nAdditional Images\nContact\nJohn Toon\nInstitute Communications\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
