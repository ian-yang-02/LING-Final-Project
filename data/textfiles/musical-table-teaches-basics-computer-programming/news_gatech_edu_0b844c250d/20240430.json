As part of a $3 million grant from the National Science Foundation, researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology and Northwestern University have built a musical, interactive tabletop exhibit that teaches the basics of computer coding.\nIt\u2019s called TuneTable . Students move coasters along the table\u2019s projection surface to make a musical piece using elements of computer programming.\u00a0 Then they tap the surface to play a series of beats, beeps and samples. The table will be installed at the Museum of Design Atlanta in early 2017 and Chicago\u2019s Museum of Science and Industry in the summer.\nThe project addresses a national need to make major strides in computer programming literacy for K-12 students.\n\u201cIt\u2019s also about changing the attitude about computation and exposing it to people that might not have sought it out otherwise,\u201d said project lead Brian Magerko, an associate professor in Georgia Tech\u2019s Ivan Allen College of Liberal Arts. \u201cHopefully some of them will think it is a cool, new way to express themselves.\u201d\nThe table includes basic computing programming elements that people would use when learning programming formally for the first time, such as iteration and go-to statements.\nTuneTable\u2019s interactive surface uses computer vision to detect printed markers \u2014 officially they\u2019re called fiducials \u2014\u00a0 on the coasters. Each coaster is assigned a sound or programming command, such as a splitter or repeater. People link them together to form a chain of electronic and hip hop sounds.\n\u201cManipulating notes, chords and rests requires a lot of music theory knowledge,\u201d said Magerko, who also leads Georgia Tech\u2019s\nAdaptive Digital Media lab . \u201cInstead, we\u2019re opting to manipulate music samples with code. And certain genres, such as electronic and hip hop, map very well computationally.\u201d\nMagerko said they\u2019re also very appealing to underserved populations, such as women, African-Americans and Latinos. He and Georgia Tech College of Design Professor Jason Freeman learned that after designing a software program called\nEarSketch\nthat teaches Python and Javascript at nearly 200 high schools across the country. EarSketch students use digital audio workstations and the programming languages to manipulate loops and compose music. TuneTable reimagines this experience within a museum exhibit.\n\u201cThe table allows us bring the basics of computer programming out of the classroom and into more informal settings such as museums,\u201d said Freeman, a co-principal investigator on the NSF grant. \u201cKids can be playful and social, just by walking up and giving it a try.\u201d\nOnce the exhibit arrives in museums, people will be able to create their own music and email it to themselves. They can continue tinkering with the code when they get home using EarSketch or a tablet version of the software, which is being designed by Northwestern\u2019s Mike Horn.\n\u201cWe see the tablet app as a crucial connection point between what kids experience at the museum with TuneTable and what they learn in school with EarSketch,\u201d said Horn. \u201cWe want it to give kids space and time to build up foundational computational literacy skills before the deep dive into learning Python or JavaScript.\u201d\nThe project is supported in part by NSF grant AISL-1612644 .
