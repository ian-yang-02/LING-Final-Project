When it\u2019s a micron-scale brush called a \u201cpolyelectrolyte brush,\u201d that collapse could put a promising experimental drug or lubricant out of commission.\nBut now\na new study reveals, in fine detail , things that make these special bristles collapse -- and also recover. The research increases understanding of these chemical brushes that have many potential uses.\nWhat are polyelectrolyte brushes?\nPolyelectrolyte brushes look a bit like soft bushes, such as shoeshine brushes, but they are on the scale of large molecules and the \u201cbristles\u201d are made of\npolymer chains . Polyelectrolyte brushes have a backing, or substrate, and the polymer chains tethered to the backing like soft bristles have chemical properties that make the brush potentially interesting for many practical uses.\nBut polymers are stringy and tend to get tangled or clumped, and keeping them straightened out, like soft bristles, is vital to the function of these micron brushes. Researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology, the University of Chicago, and the Argonne National Laboratory devised experiments that caused polyelectrolyte brush bristles to collapse and then recover from the collapse.\nThey imaged the processes in detail with highly sensitive\natomic force microscopy , and they constructed simulations that closely matched their observations. Principal investigator Blair Brettmann from Georgia Tech and the study\u2019s first authors Jing Yu and Nicholas Jackson from the University of Chicago\npublished their results on December 8, 2017, in the journal\nScience Advances .\nTheir research was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy, the National Science Foundation, and the Argonne National Laboratory.\nFrom faux DNA to lubricants\nThe potential future payoff for the researchers\u2019 work spans industrial materials to medicine.\nFor example, polyelectrolyte brushes make for surfaces that have their own built-in lubrication. \u201cIf you attach the brushes to opposing surfaces, and the bristles rub against each other, then they have really low friction and excellent lubrication properties,\u201d said Blair Brettmann, who led the study and recently joined Georgia Tech from the University of Chicago.\nPolyelectrolyte brushes could also one day find medical applications. Their bristles have been shown to simulate DNA and encode simple proteins. Other brushes could be engineered to repel bacteria from surfaces. Some polyelectrolyte brushes already exist in the body on the surface of some cells.\nPolyelectrolyte brushes can do so many different things because they can be engineered in so many variations.\n\u201cWhen you build the brushes, you have a lot of control,\u201d said Brettmann, who is an\nassistant professor in Georgia Tech\u2019s School of Materials Science and Engineering . \u201cYou can control on the nanoscale how far apart the polymer chains (the bristles) are spaced on the substrate and how long they are.\u201d\nThey\u2019re intricate and sensitive\nFor all their great potential, polyelectrolyte brushes are also complex and sensitive, and a lot of research is needed to understand how to optimize them.\nThe polymer chains have positive and negative ionic, or electrolytic, charges alternating along their lengths, thus the name \u201cpolyelectrolyte.\u201d Chemists can string the polymers together using various chemical building blocks, or monomers, and design nuanced charge patterns up and down the chain.\nThere\u2019s more complexity: Backing and bristles are not all that make up polyelectrolyte brushes. They\u2019re bathed in solutions containing gentle electrolytes, which create a balanced ionic pull from all sides that props the bristles up instead of letting them collapse or entangle.\n\u201cOften these mixtures have a bunch of other stuff in them, so the complexity of this makes it really hard to understand fundamentally,\u201d Brettmann said, \u201cand thus hard to be able to predict behavior in real applications.\u201d\nInvading impurities\nWhen other chemicals enter into these well-balanced systems that make up polyelectrolyte brushes, they can make the bristles collapse. For example, the addition of very powerful electrolytes can act like a flock of wrecking balls.\nIn their experiment, Brettmann and her colleagues used a powerful ionic compound built around yttrium, a rare earth metal with a strong charge. (The ion was trivalent, or had a valence of 3.) The ionic forces from just a low dose of the yttrium electrolyte made the polymer bristles curl up like clumps of sticky spaghetti.\nThen the researchers increased the concentration of the gentler ions, which restored support, propping the bristles back up. Atomic force microscope imaging revealed highly regular patterns of collapse and re-extension.\nThese patterns were reflected well in the simulations; the reliability of the effects of the ions on collapse and recovery even more so. The ability to build such an accurate simulation reflects the strong consistency of the chemistry, which is good news for potential future research and practical applications.\nUseless becomes useful\nFor all the dysfunction that bristle collapses can cause, the ability to collapse them on purpose can be useful. \u201cIf you could collapse and reactivate the bristles systematically, you could adjust the degree of lubrication, for example, or turn lubrication on and off,\u201d Brettmann said.\nThe brushes also could regulate chemical reactions involving micro- and nanoparticles by extending and collapsing the bristles.\n\u201cCoatings and films are often made by carefully combining engineered particles, and you can use these brushes to keep these particles suspended and separate until you\u2019re ready to let them meet, bond, and form the product,\u201d Brettmann said.\nWhen the polyelectrolyte brush\u2019s bristles are extended, they act as a barrier to hold the particles apart. Collapse the bristles out of the way on purpose, and the particles can come together.\nIt\u2019s a nasty world\nThe experiments were performed with very clean, robust, and uniform compounds unlike the jumble of chemicals that can exist in natural or even industrial systems.\n\u201cThe bristles we used were polystyrene sulfonate, which is a very strong polyelectrolyte, not sensitive to pH or much else,\u201d Brettmann said. \u201cBiopolymers like polysaccharides, for example, are a lot more sensitive.\u201d\nLike many experiments, this one was a departure from real-world conditions. But by creating a foundation for understanding how these systems work, Brettmann wants eventually to be able to move on to sensitive scenarios to realize more of polyelectrolyte brushes\u2019 practical potential.\nAlso READ: Paper-based supercapacitor\nThe study was co-authored by Xin Xu, Marina Ruths, Juan de Pablo and Matthew Tirrell.
