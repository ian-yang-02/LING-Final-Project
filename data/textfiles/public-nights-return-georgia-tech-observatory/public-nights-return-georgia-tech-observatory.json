The next event is Thursday, March 10, from 7 to 9 p.m. on the grounds between the Howey and Mason Buildings. Several telescopes will be set up for viewing, or you may bring your own telescope.\nJim Sowell, principal academic professional and director of the Georgia Tech Observatory, is excited that public nights have returned after a break during the pandemic. \u201cI describe my role these days as a tour guide, and I greatly enjoy hearing the squeals and gasps as people see craters on the moon, or the rings of Saturn, or moons orbiting Jupiter,\u201d he said. \u201cA clear evening with some celestial objects visible is as much a delight for me as it is for the visitors.\u201d\nSowell and members of the Georgia Tech Astronomy Club will be available to answer questions. The viewing targets for March 10 are the moon and Orion Nebula. Successful viewing depends on clear weather, so visitors should check for updates on the\nastronomy website . The event is free but remember to pay for parking if you use a visitor lot.\nTwo more public nights will be held this spring, on April 7 from 8:30 to 10:30 p.m. and on May 5 from 9 to 11 p.m.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nVictor Rogers\nInstitute Communications\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
