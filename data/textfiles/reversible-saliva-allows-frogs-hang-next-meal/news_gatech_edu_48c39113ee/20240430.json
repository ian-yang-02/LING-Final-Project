How does it hang onto its meal as the food rockets back into its mouth?\nA new Georgia Institute of Technology study says the tongue\u2019s stickiness is caused by a unique reversible saliva in combination with a super soft tongue. A frog\u2019s saliva is thick and sticky during prey capture, then turns thin and watery as prey is removed inside the mouth. The tongue, which was found to be as soft as brain tissue and 10 times softer than a human\u2019s tongue, stretches and stores energy much like a spring. This combination of spit and softness is so effective that it provides the tongue 50 times greater work of adhesion than synthetic polymer materials such as sticky-hand toys.\nThe Georgia Tech researchers filmed frogs eating crickets in super-slow motion to better understand the physics of the tongue. They also collected saliva samples and poked the tissue to measure softness.\n\u201c The tongue acts like a bungee cord once it latches onto its prey ,\u201d said Alexis Noel, a Georgia Tech mechanical engineering Ph.D. student who led the study. \u201cIt deforms itself as it pulls back toward the mouth, continually storing the intense applied forces in its stretchy tissue and dissipating them in its internal damping.\u201d\nThis tissue damping, Noel said, is much like a car\u2019s shock absorbers. The tongue\u2019s softness also allows it to change shape during contact and immediately afterward while retracting.\nThe other vital component of the capturing process is the frog\u2019s versatile saliva.\n\u201cThere are actually three phases,\u201d Noel said. \u201cWhen the tongue first hits the insect, the saliva is almost like water and fills all the bug\u2019s crevices. Then, when the tongue snaps back, the saliva changes and becomes more viscous \u2014 thicker than honey, actually \u2014 gripping the insect for the ride back. \u00a0The saliva turns watery again when the insect is sheared off inside the mouth.\u201d\nUnlike water and honey, frog saliva can change its viscosity with shear rate, much like paint. Paint spreads easily when applied, but stays firmly on the wall once the brush is removed.\n\u201cFor frogs, saliva seeps easily when it hits the insect, then thickens up during retraction,\u201d she said.\nThis spit switch can\u2019t be seen in the\nslow-mo videos . To identify the shear rate when viscosity drops, Noel collected saliva from 18 frogs and placed samples in a rheometer, a highly sensitive device for measuring properties of fluids.\nDavid Hu, a professor in the George W. Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering, is Noel\u2019s advisor who has also studied how\nmosquitos fly in the rain , how dogs shake off water\nand\nwhy eyelashes need to be an ideal length . He says the frog study could help engineers design reversible adhesives at high speed.\n\u201cMost adhesives that have been created are stiff, especially tape,\u201d said Hu, who is also a faculty member in the School of Biological Sciences. \u201cFrog tongues can attach and reattach with soft, special properties that are extremely stickier than typical materials. Perhaps this technology could be used for new Band-Aids. Or it could be used to create new materials in soft manufacturing.\u201d\nThe Georgia Tech team worked with Mark Mandica, the leading herpetologist at the\nAmphibian Foundation\nin Atlanta. The foundation brings together top researchers in the field of amphibian biology, conservation, and applied science to address the causes of global amphibian declines. Current research estimates that 38 percent of the world\u2019s amphibian populations are in decline or already extinct.\nThe study, \u201c Frogs use a viscoelastic tongue and non-Newtonian saliva to catch prey ,\u201d is published in the Journal of the Royal Society Interface.\nMore video and images are available for media.\nThe project is partially supported by National Science Foundation (NSF) Graduate Research Fellowship (DGE-1148903) and NSF career award PHY-1255127.
