Comprised of over 1,100 transfer students and nearly 3,800 first-year students, this group brings Tech\u2019s total number of undergraduates to a new record high of over 19,000.\n\u201cExpanding access is one of the primary focus areas of Georgia Tech\u2019s strategic plan because the education, network, and experiences we provide are invaluable,\u201d said Rick Clark, assistant vice provost and executive director of Undergraduate Admission. \u201cDuring President Cabrera\u2019s tenure, we have consistently sought to grow our first-year class, our undergraduate population, as well as the range of backgrounds and interests represented among our student body. As a result, our first-year group of nearly 3,800 is 23% bigger than it was five years ago.\u201d\nThese students hail from 113 counties across Georgia, with 13% coming from rural areas of the state. Fifteen percent of the class are first-generation college students, with neither parent having graduated from college.\n\u201cOur primary obligation is to serve the state of Georgia through community partnerships, outreach programs, and research.\u201d said Clark. \u201cIn Undergraduate Admission and Enrollment Management, we prioritize Georgians, which is why our admit rate for students from Georgia is more than three times greater than it is for nonresidents. This year, nearly 12,000 Georgia undergraduates will study at Tech \u2014 over 2,000 more than when President Cabrera arrived on campus in 2019.\u201d\nThis year also broke records for transfer students, who make up over a quarter of new undergraduates. Seventy percent of transfer students came in through a\ntransfer pathway program,\na unique offering to assist those students interested in transferring. Transfer students come from 250 colleges across 38 states, representing 38 community colleges and 35 colleges in the state of Georgia.\n\u201cI\u2019m incredibly proud of the fact that Tech, unlike most elite schools in the nation, has committed to ensuring that students can transfer here through a variety of pathway programs,\u201d said Clark.\nThe first-year class of 2027 and new transfer students join an already vibrant student body centered on Tech\u2019s commitment to community, service, innovation, and \u201cimproving the human condition.\u201d Undergraduate Admission now turns its focus to recruiting the class of 2028.\n\u201cI believe, for a variety of reasons, the year ahead will be one of the most important in Tech\u2019s history,\u201d said Clark. \u201cUltimately, we will need our entire campus community, including students, staff, faculty, alumni, and donors, to help us meet our goals and fulfill our ambitious and important mission.\u201d\nSome 145 of the students new to Tech can be seen on the Georgia Tech Office of Undergraduate Admission ( @gtadmission ) Instagram, where they shared their hometown and major ahead of arriving on campus.\nFinal, official numbers for the incoming class can be found\nhere .\nAdditional Images\nEmail\nabudd7@gatech.edu\nAdditional information\nOfficial 2023 Incoming Class Profile Statistics\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
