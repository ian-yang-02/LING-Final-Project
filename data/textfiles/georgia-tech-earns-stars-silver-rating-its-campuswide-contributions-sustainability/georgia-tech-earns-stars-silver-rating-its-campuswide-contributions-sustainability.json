STARS stands for Sustainability Tracking, Assessment, and Rating System and is awarded based upon measured success in five key areas of sustainability in higher education \u2013 Academics, Engagement, Operations, Planning and Administration, and Innovation and Leadership. The rating system helps benchmark achievements and identify opportunities where faculty, administrators, staff, and students can be effective change agents.\n\u201cThe STARS report represents the cumulative work of sustainability performance and leadership across Georgia Tech\u2019s academics, research, engagement, and business operations,\u201d said Anne Rogers, project lead and associate director of Campus Sustainability. \u201cOur silver rating is an important milestone as we continue to demonstrate strategic leadership in sustainability and alignment with the Institute\u2019s strategic plan.\u201d\nSustainability is a common theme throughout the strategic plan, which demonstrates a shared commitment to being thoughtful stewards of our resources \u2013 social, environmental, and economic. It is one of many ways Georgia Tech will\nlead by example\nin how we deliver on our educational and research mission. STARS will help inform and guide decisions on where to invest resources to achieve our sustainability goals.\nGeorgia Tech\u2019s recent silver rating is the result of a 22-month effort, led by the Office of Campus Sustainability in partnership with Serve-Learn-Sustain, Facilities Analytics and Communications, and Institute Research Planning, to compile more than 1,300 unique information or data inputs about our sustainability-related actions. More than 150 people were engaged across 100 departments, demonstrating how sustainability is truly interwoven throughout Georgia Tech's operations, research, and educational functions.\nSummary of results from the STARS report:\nAcademics\nThe Academics category includes both curriculum and research offerings. Georgia Tech scored with 89% of academic departments offering courses in sustainability and 73% of departments conducting research related to sustainability.\nEngagement\nEngagement includes both campus and public outreach. Georgia Tech has a robust student programming portfolio of sustainability groups and numerous activities centered around gardening, farming, urban agriculture, and wilderness programs. These exist alongside opportunities for students to learn life skills through sustainable employment practices, workshops, conferences, speaker series, and cultural arts events. Staff professional development and training also contributes, with such efforts as the Sustainable Facilities Forum produced each year by Facilities employees. The forum highlights innovative projects and practices Georgia Tech uses to maintain its built environment.\nOperations\nMeasuring sustainability within Operations involves energy usage, food and dining, procurement, commuting modes, fleet, waste, and water. Data in these categories is easily trackable and used regularly by the Institute to make operational decisions. Report data includes the following:\n12% reduction in total source energy consumption per unit of floor area from a baseline from fiscal year 2010.\n41.44% of total annual food and beverage expenditures are on plant-based foods.\n62.43% of expenditures are on cleaning and janitorial products that are third-party certified.\n29.75% of materials are diverted from the landfill by recycling, composting, donating, or reselling.\n25% of campus fleet vehicles are electric.\nPlanning and Administration\nSustainability within Planning and Administration includes the categories of diversity/affordability, investment/finance, and work/well-being. Georgia Tech\u2019s graduation rate for low-income students is 84%. Work/Well-being ratings range from employees receiving a living wage to educational resources related to healthy eating, stress relief, and mental health.\nInnovation and Leadership\nThe Innovation and Leadership categories in which Georgia Tech scores high include sustainability standards such as:\nBicycle-friendly campus status.\nAvailability of a campus food bank.\nGreen cleaning practices.\nGrounds certification.\n\u201cThe Institute\u2019s strategic plan clearly outlines that Georgia Tech be a leader in sustainability. STARS is one framework to measure and track continuous improvement, and to motivate us to achieve more,\u201d Rogers added.\nThe STARS silver rating will help define the future actions and resources needed to achieve even higher ratings in the years to come. The goal is to revisit this rating system every two years.
