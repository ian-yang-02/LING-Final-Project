As an engineer he knows how to solve them.\nHanley, a materials and science engineering major, invented a new aiming device for competitive archery. The lightweight scope with integrated light, called StarLight, is the latest product developed by his company,\nUltraView .\nThe device is also among the six finalists for the 2018\nInVenture Prize , Georgia Tech\u2019s annual invention competition. The winner will be selected March 14.\nHanley transferred to Tech in 2017 from the University of Vermont. The 20-year-old has been involved with archery for 11 years and competing for the past seven. He\u2019s a four-time national champion and at one time was the top-ranked archer under 21 in the United States.\n\u201cAs a shooter there are other problems I\u2019d like to solve within the sport,\u201d said Hanley, who is from Cambridge, Vt. \u201cIt\u2019s exciting that people are responding to it.\u201d\nHe said StarLight fixes several deficiencies. While current scopes are bulky, his design is made from fiber composite material which provides a smaller and lighter design.\nLots of archers shoot in the woods where it\u2019s dark or at least heavily shaded. They would need to attach a light to scopes and the wires could obstruct views. But StarLight\u2019s sight doesn\u2019t have any obstructions in the aiming window. It also has an integrated ultra violet LED to illuminate a florescent dot on the glass magnifying lens.\nHanley is accepting pre-orders for the product and expects to deliver them this summer.\nThe company began by producing customizable 3D-printed grips for bows. He now sells the grips to customers in 20 different countries.\nHe runs the company from his dorm room and his payroll comprises two part-time employees. He ships orders from the post office in the campus student center.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard being a full-time student and running a company,\u201d Hanley said. \u201cBut I love doing it and this is the industry I want to be in.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nGeorgia Tech InVenture Prize\nContact\nLaura Diamond\nMedia Relations\u00a0 laura.diamond@gatech.edu\n404-660-2927\nEmail\nlaura.diamond@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
