Georgia Tech / Alex Draper\nJan 08, 2018\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nPsssst, mud crabs, time to hide because blue crabs are coming to eat you! That\u2019s the warning the prey get from the predators\u2019 urine when it spikes with high concentrations of two chemicals, which\u00a0 researchers have identified in a new study .\nBeyond decoding crab-eat-crab alarm triggers, pinpointing these compounds for the first time opens new doors to understanding how chemicals invisibly regulate marine wildlife. Insights from the study by researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology could someday contribute to better management of crab and oyster fisheries, and help specify which pollutants upset them.\nIn coastal marshes, these urinary alarm chemicals, trigonelline and homarine, help to regulate the ecological balance of who eats how many of whom -- and not just crabs.\nBlue crabs, which are about hand-sized and are tough and strong, eat\u00a0mud crabs, which are about the size of a silver dollar\u00a0and thin-shelled. Mud crabs, on the other hand, eat a lot of oysters, but when blue crabs are going after mud crabs, the mud crabs hide and freeze, so far fewer oysters get eaten than usual.\nHumans are part of the food chain, too, eating oysters as well as blue crabs that boil up a bright orange. The blue refers to the color of markings on their appendages before they\u2019re cooked. Thus, the blue crab urinary chemicals influence seafood availability for people, as well.\nPredator pee-pee secrets\nThe fact that blue crab urine scares mud crabs was already known. Mud crabs duck and cover when exposed to samples taken in the field and in the lab, even if the mud crabs can\u2019t see the blue crabs yet. Digestive products, or metabolites, in blue crab urine trigger the mud crabs\u2019 reaction, which also makes them stop foraging for food themselves.\n\u201cMud crabs react most strongly when blue crabs have already eaten other mud crabs,\u201d said Julia Kubanek, who co-led the study with fellow Georgia Tech professor Marc Weissburg. \u201cA change in the chemical balance in blue crab urine tells mud crabs that blue crabs just ate their cousins,\u201d Kubanek said.\nFiguring out the two specific chemicals, trigonelline and homarine, that set off the alarm system, out of myriad candidate molecules, is new and has been a challenging research achievement.\n\u201cMy guess is that there are many hundreds of chemicals in the animal\u2019s urine,\u201d said Kubanek, who is a\u00a0 professor in Georgia Tech\u2019s School of Biological Sciences, in its School of Chemistry and Biochemistry , and who is also\u00a0 Associate Dean for Research in Georgia Tech\u2019s College of Sciences .\nThe researchers applied technology and methodology from\u00a0 metabolomics , a relatively new field used principally in medical research to identify small biomolecules produced in metabolism that might serve as early warning signs of disease. Kubanek, Weissburg, and first author Remington Poulin published their\u00a0 results the week of January 8, 2017, in the journal Proceedings of the National Academies of Science .\nThe research was funded by the National Science Foundation.\nPee dle in a haystack\nTrigonelline has been studied, albeit loosely, in some diseases, and is known as\u00a0 one of the ingredients in coffee beans \u00a0that, upon roasting, breaks down into other compounds that give coffee its aroma. Homarine is very similar to trigonelline, and, though apparently less studied, it\u2019s also common.\n\u201cThese chemicals are found in many places,\u201d Kubanek said. But picking them out of all those chemicals in blue crab urine for the first time was like finding two needles in a haystack.\nOften, in the past, researchers trying to narrow down such chemicals have started out by separating them out in arduous laboratory procedures then testing them one at a time to see if any of them worked. There was a good chance of turning up nothing.\nThe Georgia Tech researchers went after all the chemicals at one time, the whole haystack, using\u00a0 mass spectrometry \u00a0and\u00a0 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy .\n\u201cWe screened the entire chemical composition of each sample at once,\u201d Kubanek said. \u201cWe analyzed lots and lots of samples to fish out chemical candidates.\u201d\nCrabs are \u2018walking noses\u2019\nThe researchers discovered spikes in about a dozen metabolites after blue crabs ate mud crabs. They tested out those pee chemicals that spiked on the mud crabs, and trigonelline and homarine distinctly made them crouch.\n\u201cTrigonelline scares the mud crabs a little bit more,\u201d Kubanek said.\nMore specifically, high concentrations of either of the two did the trick. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that there was a dose-dependent response,\u201d said Weissburg, who is a\u00a0 professor in Georgia Tech\u2019s School of Biological Sciences . \u201cMud crabs have evolved to hone in on that elevated dose.\u201d\n\u201cMost crustaceans are walking noses,\u201d Weissburg said. \u201cThey detect chemicals with sensors\u00a0on their claws, antennae and even the walking legs. The compounds we isolated are pretty simple, which suggests they might be easily detectable in a variety of places on a crab. This redundancy is good because it increases the likelihood that the mud crabs get the message and not get eaten.\u201d\nEcological and fishery effects\nEvolution preserved the mud crabs with the duck-and-cover reaction to the two chemicals, which also influenced the ecological balance, in part by pushing blue crabs to look for more of their food elsewhere. But it influenced other animal populations as well.\n\u201cThese chemicals are staggeringly important,\u201d Weissburg said. \u201cThe scent from a blue crab potentially affects a large number of mud crabs, all of which stop eating oysters, and that helps preserve the oyster populations.\u201d\nAll of that also impacts food sources for marine birds and mammals: Just by the effects of two chemicals, and there are so many more chemical signals around. \u201cIt\u2019s hard for us to appreciate the richness of this chemical landscape,\u201d Weissburg said.\nAs scientists learn more, influencing these systems could become useful to ecologists and the fishing industry.\n\u201cWe might even be able to use these chemicals to control oyster consumption by predators to help preserve these habitats, which are critical, or to help oyster farmers. That\u2019s becoming important in Georgia fisheries,\u201d Weissburg said.\nPollutants in pesticides and herbicides are known to interfere with estuaries\u2019 ecologies. \u201cIt will be a lot easier to test how strong this is by knowing specific ecological chemicals,\u201d Weissburg said.\nFear-o-mone small molecules\nBy the way, trigonelline and homarine are not pheromones.\n\u201cPheromones are signaling molecules that have a function within the same species, like to attract mates,\u201d Kubanek said. \u201cAnd blue crabs and mud crabs are not the same species.\u201d\n\u201cIn this case, the mud crabs have evolved to chemically eavesdrop on the blue crabs\u2019 pee. You might call trigonelline and homarine fear-inducing cues.\u201d\nIdentifying such metabolites, also called small molecules, and their effects is the latest chapter in constructing the catalog of life molecules. \u201cEveryone knows about the human genome project, identifying genomes; then came transcriptomes (molecules that transcribe genes),\u201d Kubanek said. \u201cNow we\u2019re pretty far along with proteomics (identifying proteins), but we\u2019re just now figuring out metabolomes.\u201d\nThe paper was co-authored by Serge Lavoie, Katherine Siegel, and David Gaul.
