Appropriately, a scissor-wielding robot (named Snips) cut the ribbon. Later, a researcher from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign skyped into the room to run a live remote experiment.\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to begin a new era in robotics,\u201d said Magnus Egerstedt, the Julian T. Hightower Chair in Systems and Controls and a professor in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering.\nEgerstedt, who oversees the lab, was joined by President G.P. \u201cBud\u201d Peterson, other cabinet members and more than a dozen congressional staffers who were on campus to learn more about Georgia Tech research and initiatives.\nThe Robotarium is a $2.5 million facility funded by the National Science Foundation and Office of Naval Research. It allows researchers around the world to upload their own code, then have Georgia Tech\u2019s rolling and flying swarm robots perform the experiment. Afterwards the researcher is sent data and video.\nEgerstedt, executive director of Georgia Tech's Institute for Robotics and Intelligent Machines, dreamed up the lab about two years ago. It\u2019s expensive to build and maintain robots, let alone an entire robotics facility. He wanted more people to have access.\n\u201cIt irritated me, and it still does, that robotics research is largely a resource competition and not a \u2018who has the best ideas\u2019 competition,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Robotarium is solving that. If you have a good idea, you should have a platform to try it.\u201d\nHundreds of students visited the lab after the ribbon-cutting ceremony for an open house. The Robotarium team conducted several experiments, including flying quadcopters able to change formation without crashing into each other.\nResearchers can upload their programs and run experiments for free by visiting\nwww.robotarium.org .
