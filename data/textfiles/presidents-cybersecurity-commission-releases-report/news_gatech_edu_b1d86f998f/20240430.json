Annie Ant\u00f3n, professor and chair of the Georgia Tech School of Interactive Computing, served on the Commission on Enhancing National Cybersecurity. She said the report includes opportunities for new research and advances in engineering.\nThe commission\nissued its consensus report\naddressing six imperatives and offering action items that can be implemented by President-elect Donald Trump and his team.\nAnt\u00f3n highlighted recommended steps that would be of special interest to Georgia Tech students, faculty and researchers.\nThe commission declared that cybersecurity should be a basic requirement for the accreditation of any programs in engineering and computing disciplines.\n\u201cMore than 1.5 million cybersecurity professionals are needed globally by 2020,\u201d Ant\u00f3n said.\nShe also emphasized the recommendation that all IoT (Internet of Things) devices should be secure by default. These devices include everything from refrigerators to fitness trackers to the drill of an oil rig.\n\u201cThis is a game changer because it takes the burden off the end users and places it on the engineers and manufacturers who design and create IoT products,\u201d she said.\nAnother action item calls on the federal government to make the development of\u00a0usable, affordable and inherently secure resilient systems its top priority for cybersecurity research and development.\nAnt\u00f3n also stressed a recommendation for the federal government to support cybersecurity-focused research in traditionally underfunded areas such as policy, law and the social impacts of privacy and security technologies, as well as issues specific to small and medium-sized businesses.\n\u201cThis highlights the need for more interdisciplinary classes and research,\u201d she said. \u201cIt became clear to the commission that the human factors of cybersecurity are not well understood and require focused research nationally.\u201d\nGeorgia Tech is already working in the area through programs such as the Institute\u2019s\u00a0Privacy Technology, Policy and Law course, Ant\u00f3n said.\nThe commission was created in February by presidential executive order as part of the Cybersecurity National Action Plan. The group, which has been working since April, was tasked with making detailed recommendations on ways to strengthen cybersecurity in public and private sectors.\nThe 12-person nonpartisan commission included cybersecurity experts from government, academia and industry.\n\u201cThe quality of thoughtful deliberation and debate among the commissioners was inspiring throughout this past year,\u201d Ant\u00f3n said. \u201cDebates were not held along party lines, but instead were constructive and focused solely on determining what was best for our nation and for securing the digital economy.\u201d\nAnt\u00f3n, an expert on software compliance with federal privacy and security regulations, has served on a number of privacy and security advisory boards, including for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the National Institute of Standards and Technologies.\nSee a full list of commission members\nhere .\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nReport from the Commission on Enhancing National Cybersecurity\nAnnie Ant\u00f3n\nCommission on Enhancing National Cybersecurity\nContact\nLaura Diamond\nMedia Relations\n404-894-6016\n@LauraRDiamond\nEmail\nlaura.diamond@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
