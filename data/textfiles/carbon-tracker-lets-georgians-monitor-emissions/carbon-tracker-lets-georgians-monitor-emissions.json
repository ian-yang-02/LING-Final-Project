Users can specify whether the emissions come from transportation, agriculture, commercial, forestry, residential, or industrial sources and counter with how much carbon is absorbed by trees and soils.\n\u201cThe purpose of the tracker is to bring technology to bear on climate solutions,\u201d said\nWilliam Drummond , an associate professor in the\nSchool of City & Regional Planning\nand the lead behind the tracker. \u201cThis is the first time there has been effort to downscale emissions to the local level in a dynamic way we can update every month.\u201d\nThe initiative is part of a trifold effort in\nDrawdown Georgia , a Ray C. Anderson Foundation\u2013funded project across state universities to decrease reliance on carbon inspired by the national program Project Drawdown. As the first stage, the tracker enables Georgians to understand how the state contributes to emissions. Next, the\nScheller College of Business\nwill develop a business compact study to assess the economic impact of less carbon, and then the\nSchool of Public Policy\nwill lead solutions activation. The tracker ties everything together by letting researchers measure how effective all the efforts are combined.\nUltimately, the researchers hope to inspire everyday Georgians to get involved in combatting climate change. With the public\u2019s familiarity with Covid-19 case trackers, Drummond believes the tracker is accessible to most users, from regular citizens unsure how to help the environment to high school science students.\n\u201cThis tracker is designed to be a catalyst for a climate movement across the state of Georgia, so it's important that we include ordinary citizens, advocacy groups, and businesses as partners in working toward climate solutions in Georgia,\u201d Drummond said.\nThe researchers expect the carbon tracker will grow beyond Georgia. The tool is written in the common coding language R, so other states can replicate it. They also hope to track many other climate elements in the next few years.\n\u201cWe'll progress as the technologies and markets evolve, and will soon turn to where the solutions are \u2014 not just where are the emissions are,\u201d said\nMarilyn Brown , a Regents' and Brook Byers Professor of Sustainable Systems in the School of Public Policy. \u201cWe\u2019re going to tie it all together, and it's all going to be facilitated by this geospatial tracking.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nContact\nTess Malone, Research Writer/Editor\nEmail\ntess.malone@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
