Here are a few tips for students about getting involved and participating in the Winter Org Fair:\nTry something new. College is all about new experiences. With hundreds of organizations on campus, you can step out of your comfort zone and join something you may not have previously tried.\nDon\u2019t overwhelm yourself. Don\u2019t try to join every single organization you come across. Find the ones that you are genuinely passionate about and go from there.\nIt\u2019s never too late to get involved. You don\u2019t have to be in your first year or first semester to get involved. If you didn\u2019t get as involved your first couple years at Tech, jump in now.\nIt doesn\u2019t have to be hard. Be adventurous \u2014 go to the Org Fair,\u202fgo to open club meetings, and use the resources that Tech provides. If you need support finding a place to start, you can always reach out to the\nCenter for Student Engagement\nfor advice.\nContact\nSara Warner\nStudent Engagement & Well-Being\nsara.warner@studentlife.gatech.edu\nEmail\nQuinn.foster@studentlife.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
