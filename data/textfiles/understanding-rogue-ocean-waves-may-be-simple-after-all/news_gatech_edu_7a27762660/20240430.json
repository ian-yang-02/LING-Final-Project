An improved understanding of how rogue waves originate could lead to improved techniques for identifying ocean areas likely to spawn them, allowing shipping companies to avoid dangerous seas. Furthermore, new insights into the unsolved problem of wave breaking and into the wave manifestation of light are to be gained, according to the researchers.\nBased on an analysis of the two famous real world Andrea and Draupner rogue waves observed at different oil platforms in the North Sea over the course of a decade, and the recently observed Killard rogue wave at a site for marine renewable energy off the coast of Ireland, the research was reported this week in the journal\nScientific Reports . The work was done by researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology, University College Dublin, and the Institut FEMTO-ST CNRS-Universit\u00e9 de Franche-Comt\u00e9.\n\u201cWe saw similar wave behaviors at all three rogue wave sites,\u201d said\nFrancesco Fedele , a professor in the Georgia Tech\nSchool of Civil and Environmental Engineering . \u201cWe found that the main mechanism responsible for generating these waves is the constructive interference of elementary waves due to directional dispersive focusing enhanced by second-order bound nonlinearities.\u201d\nRogue waves have been observed in oceans around the world. They typically last only 20 seconds or so before disappearing, and are different from tsunami waves that can travel great distances after being created by underwater earthquakes or landslides.\nEarlier research had suggested a phenomenon known as \u201cmodulational instability\u201d to explain the rogue waves. That theory had been demonstrated in laboratories, but didn\u2019t adequately explain the complex three-dimensional waves that were being measured in the open ocean without boundaries to constrain them. As a result, energy is not \u2018trapped\u2019 as in a long unidirectional channel. Instead, it is free to flow and spread directionally diminishing any exchange mechanisms between neighboring waves, Fedele said.\nThough ocean waves have a predominant direction, in the open ocean, waveforms from other directions can arrive. In rare conditions, those waves arrive in an organized way or almost in phase, leading to an unusual case of constructive interference that can double the height of the resulting wave.\nBut this doubled height still cannot explain the size of the rogue waves observed in the North Sea \u2013 and elsewhere. That difference can be accounted for by the nonlinear nature of the waves, which are not sinusoidal \u2013 but instead have rounded troughs, along with sharp peaks that result from the water being pushed upward against the pull of gravity.\n\u201cYou have to account for the nonlinearity of the ocean, which is manifested in the lack of symmetry between the crests and the troughs,\u201d said Fedele, who also has an appointment in Georgia Tech\u2019s School of Electrical and Computer Engineering. \u201cThese nonlinear effects can produce an enhancement of 15 to 20 percent in wave height, which adds onto the effects of constructive interference.\u201d\nUsing advanced mathematical techniques, the researchers modeled how waves could combine in very unusual circumstances to produce the Draupner and Andrea rogue waves measured at two different oil platforms in the North Sea in 1995 and 2007 and the Killard rogue wave observed in 2014 off the coast of Ireland. Their model\u2019s predictions match the waves measured.\n\u201cWe describe the complex energy flow of a wave field by what we call its directional spectra,\u201d said Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Dias, a professor at University College Dublin. \u201cWhat we have shown is that by combining knowledge of this spectra and using mathematics that accounts for second-order nonlinearities, we can reproduce the measured rogue waves almost exactly.\u201d\nWhile ocean waves can differ from other waveforms, the research team gained important insights from the optical community and the study of how light waves interact.\n\u201cThese are fascinating results,\u201d said John Dudley, a professor at the Institut FEMTO-ST CNRS-Universit\u00e9 de Franche-Comt\u00e9. \u201cThere are many different effects that can cause wave amplification, but it is essential as a scientist to keep an open mind and to keep looking for new possible explanations. It is not for us to tell Nature how to work \u2013 we must follow where it leads us, even if it means changing our ideas.\u201d\nThe research has been the basis for a new rogue wave model that could be used to identify ocean areas where nonlinear effects could give rise to the waves and to provide new insights into the unsolved problem of wave breaking. That could give shipping companies and others as much as an hour\u2019s warning to avoid those areas.\nIn the end, Fedele said, the formation of the rogue wave is simply chance: the rare combination of waves in what turns out to be a bad place for ships or oil platforms. \u201cIt\u2019s just a bad day at the ocean,\u201d he added.\nIn future work, Fedele hopes to apply the model to optical waves.\n\u201cWhat we would like to do next is show that there are wave groups in the ocean and in optics that behave in the same way,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is an underlying physical entity which is the wave group. We see a wave packet, a travelling group of waves that grows in amplitude to reach a maximum before it decays.\u201d\nIn addition to those already mentioned, the research team included graduate student Joseph Brennan and postdoctoral researcher Sonia Ponce de Leon.\nCITATION : Francesco Fedele, et al., \u201cReal world ocean rogue waves explained without the modulational instability,\u201d (Scientific Reports, 2016).\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1038/srep27715\nResearch News Georgia Institute of Technology 177 North Avenue Atlanta, Georgia 30332-0181 USA\nMedia Relation Contacts : John Toon (404-894-6986) ( jtoon@gatech.edu ) or Ben Brumfield (404-385-1933) ( ben.brumfield@comm.gatech.edu ).\nWriter : John Toon\nAdditional Images\nContact\nJohn Toon\nResearch News\njtoon@gatech.edu\n(404) 894-6986\nEmail\njtoon@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
