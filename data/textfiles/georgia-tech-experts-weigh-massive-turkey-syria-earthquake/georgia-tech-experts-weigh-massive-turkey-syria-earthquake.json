Georgia Tech experts have been watching the situation.\nFeb 14, 2023\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nThe president of Turkey has called it the \u201cdisaster of the century.\u201d The death toll is believed to have topped more than 30,000 \u00a0after a 7.8-magnitude earthquake devastated south-central Turkey and northwestern Syria. The disaster zone is home to more than 13 million people in Turkey and an unknown number in a region of Syria torn by civil war. It\u2019s an area that stretches beyond the distance from Atlanta to Kentucky.\nThe sheer scale of the disaster has left many questions and concerns as crews continue sorting through piles of rubble. Georgia Tech experts have been watching the situation.\nKarl Lang, a geologist in Georgia Tech\u2019s School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences, understands the seismic activity of this region of the world well.\n\u201cThis area is referred to as the East Anatolian Fault Zone, and this fault zone accommodates northward collision of the Arabian plate into the Anatolian and Eurasian plates,\u201d he said.\nLang says when the Arabian plate moves northward, it pushes the Anatolian plate westward along the fault zone. He says you can envision it almost like pushing a pumpkin seed from between your fingers.\nWhat Lang says is particularly remarkable about this earthquake \u2014 and likely what caused so much damage \u2014 is the long rupture length and the relatively shallow depth of the rupture. The earthquake rattled along a fault line close to many populated cities, and, because that rattling was so close to the surface, massive amounts of seismic energy were transmitted without much reduction in strength.\nGeorgia Tech\u2019s Andy Newman is a geophysicist who monitors data from across the world for near real-time earthquake activity, measuring the radiated energy.\nNewman says the main 7.8-magnitude quake was followed by an aftershock almost as strong as the original tremor, tracking at 7.5-magnitude.\n\u201cThis is likely because the smaller aftershock occurred along a nearby fault that was triggered by the main event,\u201d Newman said.\nNewman describes that second nearby fault as much less mature and says such faults tend to be more \u201csticky,\u201d meaning they are more likely to generate more friction, more energy, and more damage in an earthquake.\nGeorgia Tech\u2019s Zhigang Peng also knows this part of the world very well. While completing his Ph.D. in geological sciences, Peng studied two earthquakes in Turkey separated by a few months and less than 65 miles: an August 1999 7.4-magnitude quake in Izmit and a November 1999 tremor in D\u00fczce with a magnitude of 7.1.\nPeng says, unfortunately, the window for concern is not yet closed.\n\u201cFor rescue efforts, one needs to watch out for large aftershocks, especially in regions further to the northeast section that have not been broken yet,\u201d he said.\nPeng is in contact with colleagues in Turkey, and they may deploy additional seismic sensors to track ongoing aftershock activities.\nMany types of buildings and structures have collapsed in the wake of the disaster, for a variety of different reasons. \u00a0As rescue and recovery crews survey the damage, some have raised questions about whether or not engineering codes \u2013intended for safety in a highly active seismic region\u2013 have been strictly enforced. In the week following the quake, Turkish officials launched investigations and arrested contractors tied to the more than 12,000 reported buildings that have crumbled.\nGeorgia Tech\u2019s Professor and Chair of the School of City and Regional Planning Gulsah Akar, who has a background in civil engineering, says that unplanned development coupled with population density and nonadherence to building codes have significantly contributed to these unfortunate outcomes. Akar was born and raised in Turkey.\n\u201cWe are now realizing as a country that we have not done much for disaster preparation \u2014 even after all the large-scale earthquakes we have experienced over the last few decades,\u201d Akar said.\nEce Erdogmus is professor and chair of the School of Building Construction at Georgia Tech, and, like Akar, has close personal and professional ties to Turkey.\nErdogmus explained why seeing this as a single earthquake event is inaccurate. She describes the situation as a \u201ccollection of multiple design-exceedance level events.\u201d\nTypically, aftershocks are smaller in magnitude, but the size of the subsequent tremors puts damaged infrastructure at even greater risk.\n\u201cA structure that has already been damaged and lost integrity \u00a0\u00a0has no time to find new equilibrium and is much more vulnerable in the second event. This is often colloquially referred to as the \u2018softening\u2019 of the building,\u201d said Erdogmus.\nErdogmus and Akar are partnering with colleagues in Turkey who are already gathering data from the disaster zone.\n\u201cOne answer most of us are hoping to find out is, controlling for the pattern and the distance from the epicenter, what percentage of the collapsed buildings are the ones that did not adhere to the building code earthquake regulations,\u201d said Akar.\nAnd based on that data, how can this type of disaster be prevented in the future? Together, Erdogmus and Akar will work to help develop a monitoring and rebuilding plan for the region.\nAlso responding is Georgia Tech\u2019s Elizabeth and Bill Higginbotham Professor of Civil Engineering David Frost, who works with the U.S. National Science Foundation to coordinate the response of geo-engineers to major disasters worldwide, through a group called the\nGeotechnical Extreme Events Reconnaissance , or GEER, Association.\nGEER gathers important data from damaged areas that is considered \u201cperishable,\u201d so that the more specific and timely details they gather, the more likely they\u2019ll be able to understand what occurred during the events and can develop many of the empirical procedures used in geoengineering practices to protect buildings and communities.\nFrost worked over the weekend to help deploy the first scout team in Turkey. He expects three or four more teams to gather data over the next month.\nThese Georgia Tech earthquake experts continue to monitor the situation in hopes of better understanding what happened to cause the size and scale of this tragedy, and what data they may be able to help provide to assist in the recovery and rebuilding efforts.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nSteven Norris\nDirector, Media Relations & Social Media\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nEmail\nsnorris@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
