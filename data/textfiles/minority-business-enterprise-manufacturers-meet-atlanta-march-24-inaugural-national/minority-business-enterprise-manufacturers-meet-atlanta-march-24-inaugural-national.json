Castillo, national director of the Minority Business Development Agency (MBDA) at the U.S. Commerce Department, is one of the featured keynote speakers at the\u00a0National MBE Manufacturers Summit 2016 on March 24 at Georgia Tech's Global Learning Center.\nMar 09, 2016\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nAmerica\u2019s manufacturing sector is undergoing rapid change and innovation, incorporating hi-tech advancements across all sectors of the industry. What do these changes mean for minority-owned manufacturers? How are they meeting the demands and partnering with other manufacturers and customers to incorporate innovation into their operations? Those factors and others comprise the central focus of the inaugural National MBE Manufacturers Summit 2016 scheduled for March 24 in Atlanta. The U.S. Department of Commerce Minority Business Development Agency (MBDA) and its MBDA Business Center Network are hosting the Summit, which is sponsored in part by BMW, the Georgia Manufacturing Extension Partnership, Grady Health System, Ingersoll Rand, and Novant Health. It will take place at the Georgia Institute of Technology\u2019s Global Learning Center. \u201cWe are focused on ensuring that attendees maximize their day by meeting one-on-one with corporations and original equipment manufacturers seeking to do business with MBE manufacturers,\u201d said Donna Ennis, MBDA Business Center-Atlanta\u2019s director. \u201cWe\u2019re bringing all of these parties together in this first-of-its-kind national forum to get those conversations started in a real, substantive way.\u201d The MBE manufacturing community is often overlooked by the broader manufacturing community and, in general, does not access the myriad national and local resources and expertise available to them, Ennis said. The Summit\u2019s breakout sessions are designed to address that. Among the key discussion topics and event highlights: Business-to-business matchmaking and one-on-one fast pitching to multinational and major corporations. A \u201cPoster Walk\u201d showcase of companies that will feature projects in the areas of innovation, productivity, and sustainability. Manufacturing trends in health care and cybersecurity. Access to technology transfer opportunities and information. Opportunities in the global marketplace. Procurement and supplier diversity trends. \u201cThis is an excellent opportunity for our MBE Manufacturers to collectively dialogue and share information that will support their success now and in the future,\u201d said Alejandra Y. Castillo, MBDA\u2019s national director and one of the Summit\u2019s featured speakers. \u201cWe hope everyone will join us in Atlanta.\u201d Other featured speakers at the Summit include: G.P. \u201cBud\u201d Peterson , Georgia Tech president. Derreck Kayongo , co-founder of the Global Soap Project and CEO of the Center for Civil and Human Rights.
