And while Georgia Tech offers numerous resources \u2014\ndrop-in tutoring ,\nlearning assistants ,\npeer-led study groups\n\u2014 that provide extra support, they aren\u2019t always accessible to everyone.\nThe Open Course Project aims to address that gap with self-guided, interactive support for math and statistics courses at Georgia Tech \u2014 and beyond.\n\u201cThe Open Course Project was started in order to be an extra resource for students,\u201d says\nStephanie Reikes , a lecturer in the\nSchool of Mathematics\nand one of the project\u2019s leaders. \u201cMany students are entering college with gaps in their knowledge due to online learning during the Covid-19 pandemic. I wanted to create a course for students to self-enroll and be able to work at their own pace with the material.\u201d\nSupport from Howard Hughes Medical Institute\nThe project was born out of the Inclusive Excellence Faculty Fellowship, established in May 2023 by the College\u2019s\nCenter for Promoting Inclusion and Equity in the Sciences\n(C-PIES). The annual fellowship,\nsupported by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute , funds one project proposed by Georgia Tech faculty that promotes inclusive teaching.\nReikes was named a\n2023-2024 C-PIES Inclusive Excellence Faculty Fellow\nalongside colleagues\nGreg Mayer , academic professional in the School of Mathematics; and\nBekki George , former academic professional in the School of Psychology\nfor the trio's collaborative proposal for the Open Course Project.\nHi Shin Shim , a graduate student in Psychology,\nhas since joined the team to develop the statistics course.\n\u201cThe original idea was to promote inclusive teaching in a unique way,\u201d says\nLea Marzo , program director for C-PIES. \u201cWe chose this group because their project really homes in on helping students from disadvantaged communities that maybe don\u2019t have basic foundations in these courses.\u201d\nWith its self-paced material available completely online, Marzo says the courses allow students of any background \u2014 and with any schedule \u2014 to \u201cget those foundations.\u201d\nOpening up the classroom\nDevelopment of the Open Course Project began in the summer of 2023, with the first courses launching in the fall. During that time, Reikes, Mayer, and Shim established databases with recorded videos, supplemental notes, and practice problems for\ncollege algebra ,\nmultivariable calculus , and\nstatistics .\n\u201cStudents come to Georgia Tech and find that they need a refresher or that they\u2019re struggling with these courses but can\u2019t necessarily go to tutoring \u2014 maybe they\u2019re remote, maybe they work full time, or maybe they\u2019re just not comfortable with in-person tutoring,\u201d Marzo explains. \u201cThis gives students another avenue to access this information.\u201d\nThe online courses are completely self-guided, allowing students to build foundations in these areas from anywhere at their own pace. Enrollment in these courses also provides automatically graded assessments with hundreds of exercises that offer instant feedback to students.\nMore than 500 Georgia Tech students have enrolled in the courses since the project's launch. To make the materials even more accessible, the team also opened the courses to the general public at no cost.\nPublicly available courses currently include\ncollege algebra\nand\nmultivariable calculus , with a statistics course projected to come online sometime this summer.\nBecause of this, Marzo points out, \u201cany school can use it \u2014 and you're essentially getting top level education for free.\u201d\nAdditional Media\nRelated links\nSciences Lands Howard Hughes Medical Institute Inclusive Excellence Grant\nCollege Selects Inclusive Excellence Faculty Fellows\nMath Lab Solves the Tutoring Support Equation\nContact\nWriter: \u00a0Audra Davidson\nCommunications Officer II\nCollege of Sciences\nContact:\u00a0 Jess Hunt-Ralston\nDirector of Communications\nCollege of Sciences\nEmail\njess.hunt@cos.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
