The IISP aligns the expertise of 200 researchers and nine labs across\nfour colleges\nand the\nGeorgia Tech Research Institute\n(GTRI) to form a single gateway to all cybersecurity efforts. Its purpose is to connect academia, industry and government to seamlessly develop vital solutions for national security, economic continuity and individual safety. It is led by Co-Directors\nBo Rotoloni , a principal research engineer at GTRI, and\nWenke Lee , a professor in the\nCollege of Computing\nand one of the world\u2019s most prolific cybersecurity researchers. Associate directors include experts in law, business management, computing and defense. \u201cCybersecurity is no longer just a computer science problem for programmers; this is an issue that now touches every area of society,\u201d says Lee, whose research involves protecting industrial control systems, hardening defense equipment and secure Internet browsing. \u201cIt involves new policy considerations, better initial product design and more training for the professionals involved. We are doubling down to discover, connect and solve modern cybersecurity threats.\u201d Georgia Tech Executive Vice President for Research Stephen Cross says this effort is essential at a time when consumers readily trade private personal data for convenience and the public has become more dependent on cyber-physical systems. \u201cGeorgia Tech has the academic foundational research and educational programs, the technology transfer and applied research that make a real impact with industry and government, and the ability to understand and study the broader, societal impact,\u201d Cross says. \u201cCybersecurity work takes place in these three spheres, and the Institute for Information Security & Privacy has been built at the intersection of all three.\u201d Initial research will focus on six areas: privacy policy, consumer-facing privacy, attribution, risk, trust and cyber-physical systems. \u201cUnder the IISP, we expect to double our current cybersecurity research activity to move more research out to the marketplace, to develop new continuing education programs for professionals and to broaden the cybersecurity curriculum so it is taught across more degree fields at Georgia Tech,\u201d says Rotoloni. \u201cWe want to be a catalyst for an information security industry in Georgia that is already attracting national attention and embolden it through joint research projects with companies of all sizes and critical government agencies.\u201d For more about the Institute for Information Security & Privacy, see\nhttp://iisp.gatech.edu\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nVisit the stitute for Information Security & Privacy Website\nContact\nTara La Bouff Communications Manager 404.769.5408\nEmail\ntlabouff@cc.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
