She is double-dipping \u2014 earning two degrees \u2014 for the second time.\nIn Fall 2019 , Sanders earned a master\u2019s in operations research in the College of Engineering and a master\u2019s in geographic information science and technology in the College of Design. This semester she is earning an MBA from the Scheller College of Business and a Ph.D. from the H. Milton Stewart School of Industrial and Systems Engineering.\n\u201cAlthough I am a fifth-generation Ph.D. graduate, I am the first woman in my family to get a Ph.D.,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cMy mother was a refugee from Cambodia and became the first woman in her family to graduate from college in the United States.\u201d\nThat is why she is passionate about empowering women in STEM.\n\u201cWomen are often discouraged from staying in STEM, and I hope to change that,\u201d said Sanders, who was active in the Society of Women Engineers (SWE). \u201cWhile serving SWE at Georgia Tech I was able to help rebuild a graduate SWE group that has now won awards at the national level.\u201d\nFor Sanders, completing two graduate degrees during the pandemic offered some opportunities that she would not have had otherwise. In 2020 she got to do an in-person summer internship at Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville, Alabama, doing supplier risk analysis for the industrial base of the Army.\n\u201cAs hard as Covid-19 has been, I believe it has brought me closer to my Ph.D. and MBA classmates and jumpstarted my career,\u201d she said.\nWhile at Redstone she saw a posting for a faculty position at West Point. She applied and got the job.\n\u201cI was hired as an instructor and researcher in the Operations Research Center (ORCEN) within the Department of Systems Engineering in October, and I started teaching in January. After completing my Ph.D., I will move into an assistant professor role within the department,\u201d she said.\nSanders grew up in Port Jefferson, New York. She came to Tech in 2016, after earning a bachelor\u2019s degree in math from MIT. She said she will miss the people she met at Tech.\n\u201cMy classmates-turned-friends have been the most important part of my time at Georgia Tech,\u201d she said. \u201cNo one gets a degree alone. My classmates have made me a better person and scholar. Georgia Tech keeps you humble, and the support network I have had at Tech has been unparalleled.\u201d\nSanders, selected to be the\nstudent speaker for the Ph.D. Commencement ceremony , will use her speech to acknowledge the people who helped her throughout her journey. After the ceremony she will celebrate with her family and friends.\n\u201cMy Ph.D. friends and I are taking a day trip to the countryside to commemorate the occasion. I\u2019m also excited to celebrate with my MBA classmates, unlike my other graduate degrees, we are all graduating at the same time and it's nice to be able to share the moment,\" she said. \"I\u2019m looking forward to seeing all the other graduates, from every discipline, come together for one event at Bobby Dodd.\u201d\nSanders\u2019 has several relatives who are Tech graduates: her brother Eli, ECON 2019; her father, Daniel P. Sanders, M.S.AM 1991, M.S. OR 1992, Ph.D. ACO 1993; her grandfather, Hugh A. Sanders, AM 1965, M.S. AM 1969; her great uncle, John J. Owen III, B.S. AE 1969, M.S. AE 1973, M.S. OR 1973, M.S. IE 1992, Ph.D. IE 1993; her great uncle, Hal R. Sanders, EE 1952; and another great uncle, Wylie H. Sanders, EE 1958. She also has several distant relatives who are Tech graduates.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nVictor Rogers\nInstitute Communications\nEmail\nvictor.rogers@comm.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
