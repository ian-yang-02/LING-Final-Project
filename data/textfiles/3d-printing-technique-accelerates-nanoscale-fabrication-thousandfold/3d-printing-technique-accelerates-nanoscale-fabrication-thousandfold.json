The technique could lead to manufacturing-scale production of bioscaffolds, flexible electronics, electrochemical interfaces, micro-optics, mechanical and optical metamaterials, and other functional micro- and nanostructures.\nThe work, reported Oct. 3 in the journal\nScience , was done by researchers from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) and The Chinese University of Hong Kong.\nSourabh Saha , the paper\u2019s lead and corresponding author, is now an assistant professor in the\nGeorge W. Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering\nat the Georgia Institute of Technology.\nExisting nanoscale additive manufacturing techniques use a single spot of high-intensity light \u2014 typically around 700 to 800 nanometers in diameter \u2014 to convert photopolymer materials from liquids to solids. Because the point must scan through the entire structure being fabricated, the existing TPL technique can require many hours to produce complex 3D structures, which limits its ability to be scaled up for practical applications.\n\u201cInstead of using a single point of light, we project a million points simultaneously,\u201d said Saha. \u201cThis scales up the process dramatically because instead of working with a single point that has to be scanned to create the structure, we can use an entire plane of projected light. Instead of focusing a single point, we have an entire focused plane that can be patterned into arbitrary structures.\u201d\nTo create a million points, the researchers use a digital mask similar to those used in projectors to create images and videos. In this case, the mask controls a femtosecond laser to create the desired light pattern in the precursor liquid polymer material. The high-intensity light causes a polymerization reaction that turns the liquid to solid, where desired, to create 3D structures.\nEach layer of the fabricated structure is formed by a 35-femtosecond burst of high-intensity light. The projector and mask are then used to create layer after layer until the entire structure is produced. The liquid polymer is then removed, leaving behind the solid. The FP-TPL technique allows the researchers to produce in eight minutes a structure that would take several hours to produce using earlier processes.\n\u201cThe parallel two-photon system that has been developed is a breakthrough in nanoscale printing that will enable the remarkable performance in materials and structures at this size scale to be realized in usable components,\u201d said LLNL\u2019s Center for Engineered Materials and Manufacturing Director Chris Spadaccini.\nUnlike consumer 3D printing that uses particles sprayed onto a surface, the new technique goes deep into the liquid precursor, allowing the fabrication of structures that could not be produced with surface fabrication alone. For instance, the technique can produce what Saha calls an \u201cimpossible bridge\u201d with 90-degree overhangs and with more than a 1,000:1 aspect ratio of length to feature size. \u201cWe can project the light to any depth that we want in the material, so we can make suspended 3D structures,\u201d he said.\nThe researchers have printed suspended structures a millimeter long between bases that are smaller than 100 microns by 100 microns. The structure doesn\u2019t collapse while being fabricated because the liquid and solid are about the same density \u2014 and the production happens so quickly that the liquid doesn\u2019t have time to be disturbed.\nBeyond bridges, the researchers made a variety of structures chosen to demonstrate the technique, including micro-pillars, cuboids, log-piles, wires and spirals. The researchers used conventional polymer precursors, but Saha believes the technique would also work for metals and ceramics that can be generated from precursor polymers.\n\u201cThe real application for this would be in industrial-scale production of small devices that may be integrated into larger products, such as components in smartphones,\u201d he said. \u201cThe next step is to demonstrate that we can print with other materials to expand the material palette.\u201d\nResearch groups have been working for years to accelerate the two-photon lithography process used to produce nanoscale 3D structures. The success of this group came from adopting a different way of focusing the light, using its time-domain properties, which allowed production of very thin light sheets capable of high resolution \u2014 and tiny features.\nUse of the femtosecond laser allowed the research team to maintain enough light intensity to trigger the two-photon process polymerization while keeping the point sizes thin. In the FP-TPL technique, the femtosecond pulses are stretched and compressed as they pass through the optical system to implement temporal focusing. The process, which can generate 3D features smaller than the diffraction-limited, focused light spot, requires that two photons hit the liquid precursor molecules simultaneously.\n\u201cTraditionally, there are tradeoffs between speed and resolution,\u201d Saha said. \u201cIf you want a faster process, you would lose resolution. We have broken this engineering tradeoff, allowing us to print a thousand times faster with the smallest of features.\u201d\nAt Georgia Tech, Saha intends to continue advancing the work with new materials and further scale-up of the process.\n\u201cSo far, we have shown that we can do pretty well on speed and resolution,\u201d he said. \u201cThe next questions will be how well we can predict the features and how well we can control the quality over large scales. That will require more work to understand the process itself.\u201d\nCITATION : Sourabh K. Saha, Dien Wang, Vu H. Nguyen, Yina Chang, James S.
