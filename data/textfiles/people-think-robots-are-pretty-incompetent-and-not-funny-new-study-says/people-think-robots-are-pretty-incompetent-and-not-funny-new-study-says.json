Credit: Georgia Tech / Rob Felt\nMay 19, 2020\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nDang robots are crummy at so many jobs, and they tell lousy jokes to boot. In two new studies, these were common biases human participants held toward\u00a0robots.\nThe studies were originally intended to test for gender bias, that is, if people thought a robot believed to be female may be less competent at some jobs than a robot believed to be male and vice versa. The studies' titles even included the words \"gender,\" \"stereotypes,\" and \"preference,\" but researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology discovered no significant sexism against the machines.\n\u201cThis did surprise us. There was only a very slight difference in a couple of jobs but not significant. There was, for example, a small preference for a male robot over a female robot as a package deliverer,\u201d said Ayanna Howard, the principal investigator in both studies. Howard is a\u00a0 professor in and the chair of Georgia Tech\u2019s School of Interactive Computing .\nAlthough robots are not sentient, as people increasingly interface with them, we begin to humanize the machines. Howard studies what goes right as we integrate robots into society and what goes wrong, and much of both has to do with how the humans feel around robots.\nI hate robots\n\u201cSurveillance robots are not socially engaging, but when we see them, we still may act like we would when we see a police officer, maybe not jaywalking and being very conscientious of our behavior,\u201d said Howard, who is also\u00a0 Linda J. and Mark C. Smith Chair and Professor in Bioengineering in Georgia Tech\u2019s School of Electrical and Computer Engineering .\n\u201cThen there are emotionally engaging robots designed to tap into our feelings and work with our behavior. If you look at these examples, they lead us to treat these robots as if they were fellow intelligent beings.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a good thing robots don\u2019t have feelings because what study participants lacked in gender bias they more than made up for in judgments against the humanoid robots' competence. That predisposition was so strong that Howard wondered if it may have overridden any potential gender biases against robots \u2013 after all, social science studies have shown that gender biases are still prevalent with respect to human jobs, even if implicit.\nIn questionnaires, humanoid robots introduced themselves via video to randomly recruited online survey respondents, who ranged in age from their twenties to their seventies and were mostly college-educated. The humans ranked robots\u2019 career competencies compared to human abilities, only trusting the machines to competently perform a handful of simple jobs.\nPass the scalpel\n\u201cThe results baffled us because the things that people thought robots were less able to do were things that they do well. One was the profession of surgeon. There are\u00a0 Da Vinci robots that are pervasive in surgical suites , but respondents didn\u2019t think robots were competent enough,\u201d Howard said. \u201cSecurity guard \u2013 people didn\u2019t think robots were competent at that, and there are companies that specialize in great robot security.\u201d\nCumulatively, the 200 participants across the two studies thought robots would also fail as nannies, therapists, nurses, firefighters, and totally bomb as comedians. But they felt confident bots would make fantastic package deliverers and receptionists, pretty good servers, and solid tour guides.\nThe researchers could not say where the competence biases originate. Howard could only speculate that some of the bad rap may have come from media stories of robots doing things like falling into swimming pools or injuring people.\nIt\u2019s a boy\nDespite the lack of gender bias, participants readily assigned genders to the humanoid robots. For example, people accepted gender prompts by robots introducing themselves in videos.\nIf a robot said, \u201cHi, my name is James,\u201d in a male-sounding voice, people mostly identified the robot as male. If it said, \u201cHi, my name is Mary,\u201d in a female voice, people mostly said it was female.\nSome robots greeted people by saying \u201cHi\u201d in a neutral sounding voice, and still, most participants assigned the robot a gender. The most common choice was male followed by neutral then by female. For Howard, this was an important takeaway from the study for robot developers.\n\u201cDevelopers should not force gender on robots. People are going to gender according to their own experiences. Give the user that right. Don\u2019t reinforce gender stereotypes,\u201d Howard said.\nSocial is good\nSome in the\u00a0field advocate for not building robots in humanoid form at all in order to discourage any kind of\u00a0humanization, but the Georgia Tech team takes a less stringent approach.\n\"There is no single one-size-fits-all answer on whether it is appropriate to design robots to look like human beings.\u00a0 It depends on a variety of ethical considerations and other factors, including whether people might trust a robot too much\u00a0if it has a human-like appearance,\" said Jason Borenstein, a co-principal investigator on one of the papers and an ethics\u00a0 researcher in Georgia Tech's School of Public Policy .\n\u201cRobots can be good for social interaction. They could be very helpful in elder care facilities to keep people company. They might also make better nannies than letting the TV babysit the kids,\u201d said Howard, who also defended robots\u2019 comedic talent, provided they are programmed for that.\n\u201cIf you ever go to an amusement park, there are animatronics that tell really good jokes.\u201d\nRead the studies\nThe two studies were submitted to conferences that were canceled due to COVID-19.\nWhy Should We Gender?
