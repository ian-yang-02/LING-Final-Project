Today, Ocean Visions announced the formation of a consortium: four regional hubs that will foster, review, and evaluate research and development in pursuit of healthy oceans.\n\u201cOcean Visions provides much-needed optimism for the future of our oceans,\u201d said Emanuele Di Lorenzo, professor in Tech\u2019s School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences and director of the\nOcean Science and Engineering\nprogram. \u201cIt establishes a playground for innovative solutions by bringing together the leading minds in ocean conservation who are dedicated to sharing experiences as well as brainstorming and supporting better solutions.\u201d\nIn addition to Tech, founding partners include the Smithsonian Institution, Stanford University, the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California San Diego, Skidaway Institute of Oceanography, the University of Georgia, Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute, the Georgia Aquarium, Monterey Bay Aquarium, and the Birch Aquarium at Scripps.\nSummit participants will hear from\nresearchers, conservationists, and entrepreneurs\non ocean-based science and engineering successes in the areas of resilience, adaptation, mitigation, and sustainability. Business leaders will learn more about proposed solutions, ranging from advanced concepts to those that are market ready.\nGeorgia Tech President Emeritus G. Wayne Clough will open the summit and introduce the consortium.\n\u201cAddressing the challenges facing our oceans will take an ambitious effort that brings together the best talent in our nation,\u201d said Clough, who served as secretary of the Smithsonian Institution from 2008-14. \u201cOcean Visions is unique because it is led by trusted institutions and top scientists and researchers in ocean conservation working together to formulate a call to action to foster, support, and advance innovative and viable solutions that can make a difference.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nOcean Visions\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
