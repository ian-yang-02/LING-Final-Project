Lillard, Ph.D., MSM\u2019s associate dean for research and director of the Office of Translational Technologies. \u201cThis initiative leverages the research rigor and innovations developing at Morehouse School of Medicine\u00a0with Georgia Tech\u2019s proven\u00a0ATDC model of helping technology entrepreneurs create viable,\u00a0scalable companies.\u201d\nThe collaboration with MSM, the eighth for ATDC through its\u00a0 ATDC @ program, continues the incubator\u2019s mission of working with technology startups across Georgia. The catalyst for this initiative was an\u00a0i6 Challenge grant the U.S. Department of Commerce\u00a0 awarded to Georgia Tech \u00a0in 2015.\nThat $500,000 grant, secured by Tech's\u00a0 Innovation Ecosystems \u00a0group, supported wide-ranging innovation and entrepreneurship initiatives across the state. In Atlanta, it called for the Institute to collaborate with Georgia State and Clark Atlanta universities, Morehouse College, the Morehouse School of Medicine, and Spelman College to develop entrepreneurship programs that supported their unique visions.\nThe\u00a0 ATDC @ MSM\u00a0 will provide the medical school with a full suite of services and educational programming to support entrepreneurship in the HealthTech arena among faculty, staff, and students on the MSM campus. The core goal is to help entrepreneurs gain insight into successful HealthTech commercialization, through the program, which includes curriculum, connections, and coaching.\nATDC was founded in 1980 to help technology entrepreneurs learn, launch, scale, and succeed in the creation of successful businesses in the state. Since its founding, ATDC has developed a global reputation for fostering technological entrepreneurship, with Forbes naming ATDC to its list of \u201cIncubators Changing the World\u201d in\u00a02010\u00a0and\u00a02013, alongside Y Combinator and the Palo Alto Research Center.\nKirk Barnes, ATDC\u2019s HealthTech catalyst, said the effort is a great example of how two world-class institutions can collaborate to create a medically-oriented innovation ecosystem. It also brings focus to the needs of minority and rural populations that are traditionally underserved from a medical standpoint, just as state leaders in Georgia are looking at the issue more closely.\n\u201cThis is a great collaborative undertaking that takes\u00a0our \"Startup Success, Engineered\" model\u00a0into\u00a0the\u00a0clinical\u00a0setting and gives particular focus on black entrepreneurs who are\u00a0an underrepresented\u00a0community in tech,\u201d Barnes said.\n\u201cThis will\u00a0help expand the pace and flow of innovation and\u00a0commercialization of research coming out of the Morehouse School of Medicine as well as give them access to the broader resources at Georgia Tech and the ATDC model will formalize and expedite how that happens.\u201d\nAbout the Advanced Technology Development Center\nThe Advanced Technology Development Center (ATDC), a program of the Georgia Institute of Technology, is the state of Georgia\u2019s technology startup incubator.
