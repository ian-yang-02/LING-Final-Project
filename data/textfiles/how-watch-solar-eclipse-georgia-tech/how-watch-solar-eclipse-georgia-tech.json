The eclipse should darken skies, drop air temperatures, and make birds think it\u2019s bedtime.\nThe sunlight from a partial eclipse is bright enough to injure unprotected eyes, says\nJames Sowell , senior academic professional in the School of Physics, and director of the\nGeorgia Tech Observatory .\n\u201cEven a sliver of sunlight, that three percent, could damage your eyes if you persist in looking at it directly,\u201d he says.\nThe temptation to report to social media or record the event with mobile devices will be strong. We urge you instead to take in the experience. Those who have watched total eclipses say they are spectacular for how they make you\nfeel .\n\u201cIt humbles you,\u201d says\nDavid Baron , science journalist and author of \u201c American Eclipse ,\u201d about the total solar eclipse of July 29, 1878.\u00a0Baron has witnessed five of these phenomena. \u201cThey are awe-inspiring and humbling, and they make you realize we are just a tiny part of something enormous.\u201d\nHere are three simple rules to safely and fully experience the 2017 solar sensation in an age of mobile devices:\nAnytime you look up, wear special eclipse glasses.\nWhether you\u2019re observing the sun at 1 p.m., 2:37 p.m., or 4:01 p.m., use glasses with ultradark lenses specified for direct observation of the sun. Eclipse glasses will be\ndistributed around campus\nbeginning at noon on Aug. 21.\nKeep the smartphone in your pocket.\nIt\u2019s possible to take a photo of the eclipsing sun, but we don\u2019t recommend it. You risk glimpsing the sun and injuring your eyes while lining up the shot.\nIt\u2019s a rare event, so be in the moment.\nIt\u2019s not just the breathtaking spectacle of the sun slowly blocked by the moon. It\u2019s also what\u2019s happening around you. With good weather conditions, the bright planet Venus may appear. Birds may stop chirping. Spaces between tree leaves can act as pinhole cameras; you may end up with a dappling of crescent, eclipsed suns at your feet.\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nGeorgia Tech Eclipse Events\nWhere to Get Eclipse Glasses on Campus\nSolar Eclipse Glasses: Where to Buy the Best, High-Quality Eyewear\nContact\nRenay San Miguel\nCommunications Officer/Science Writer\nCollege of Sciences\n404-894-5209\nEmail\nrenay.san@cos.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
