Yet due to funding inequities, research infrastructure isn\u2019t as robust at Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs), making building a diverse workforce pipeline and inclusive research collaborations challenging. With its\nResearch Collaboration Initiative\n(RCI), the Georgia Institute of Technology is\nbuilding\nMSI partnerships and recently hosted its first research collaboration forum (RCF) specifically to develop these relationships with Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs).\nNearly 170 attendees from government, industry, national labs, and other universities gathered on the Georgia Tech campus Nov. 7 \u2013 8. The research forum featured keynotes, panels, and breakout sessions divided by research area to develop the partnerships necessary for meaningful collaboration.\nDietra Trent \u2014 executive director of White House Initiatives on Advancing Educational Equity, Excellence, and Economic Opportunity through HBCUs \u2014 gave the morning keynote.\n\u201cResearch shaped by diverse experience and cultures will reduce the risk of bias and create significant opportunities for all our universities,\u201d she said. \u201cThis collaboration represents one of the best ways to build a scholarly community. It\u2019s the partnership our HBCUs need \u2014 not a handout but a hand up.\u201d\nDay one of the RCF featured keynotes talks from Senior Advisor Terrence Mosely of the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy and Thyaga Nandagopal, director of the Division of Innovation and Technology Ecosystems in Tech, Innovation, and Partnerships.\nThe second day featured a keynote from Victoria Coleman, who currently serves as the chief scientist of the U.S. Air Force and was past director of the Defense Research Projects Agency. Coleman was instrumental in creating the first HBCU-led University Affiliated Research Center in Tactical Autonomy.\nKeynotes from Kylie Patterson, director of opportunity and inclusion from CHIPS.gov, and Annette Owens-Scarsboro, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) institution program manager for HBCUs and MSIs, rounded out the second day.\nPanels about funding priorities for the Department of Energy, the National Science Foundation, the Department of Commerce, NIH, and the Department of Defense offered attendees compelling federal research opportunities. In breakout sessions, attendees gathered to ideate and team build within their respective research disciplines, which included everything from climate resiliency to artificial intelligence.\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking at these breakout sessions as an opportunity to develop long-term, sustainable collaborations and partnerships between our respective institutions,\u201d said\nGeorge White ,\nsenior director for strategic partnerships in the Office of the Vice President for Interdisciplinary Research and principal research engineer at Georgia Tech.\n\u201cWe believe this is an enduring model that can grow well beyond Georgia Tech. The ability to seed research projects and capacity building makes this a very unique opportunity.\u201d\nThroughout the forum, there were multiple opportunities to network and build more casual partnerships.\n\u201c The goal is to exchange ideas, meet one another, and identify areas of collaborative synergy ,\u201d said\nTaiesha Smith , senior program manager of HBCU/MSI Research Partnerships at Georgia Tech.\nInclusivity Imperative to Research Next\nThe RC is just one of the projects of\nResearch Next . E xecutive Vice President for Research\nChaouki T. Abdallah\nlaunched the research enterprise\u2019s planning initiative in 2020, and creating inclusive research collaborations is its third phase.\n\u201cWe believe that in order to develop lasting solutions for the problems facing humanity, we need as many perspectives as possible,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need more original ideas, the kind of ideas born from having diverse communities to not just make the solutions but to ask the right questions.\u201d\nThe event was one of Georgia Tech\u2019s many efforts in this area. The team created a software tool,\u00a0 CollabNext , where researchers can find partners at HBCUs with similar disciplines and interests. They also\ndeveloped a memorandum of understanding for a semiconductor research initiative with HBCU/MSIs. Even the Georgia Tech Research Institute is involved, developing the\nDefense-University Affiliated Research Traineeship\nto give HBCU students opportunities in the Department of Defense.\n\u201cThis event will energize and identify opportunities from companies and the federal government to make sure HBCU and MCIS can compete for the funding,\u201d Abdallah said, \u201cbecause they have built the infrastructure to conduct this research.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nContact\nTess Malone, Senior Research Writer/Editor\ntess.malone@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
