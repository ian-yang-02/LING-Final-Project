That\u2019s essentially the situation facing today\u2019s warfighters, who must wait for long procurement cycles to bring them the latest technology.\nThe U.S. Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR), Naval Air Warfare Center - Aircraft Division (NAWCAD) and the\nGeorgia Tech Research Institute\n(GTRI) are working to address that challenge through a new effort \u2013 dubbed\nIMPAX\n(Innovation and Modernization Patuxent River) \u2013 that aims to accelerate the transfer of new technology to meet U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps needs. IMPAX staff members are empowered to work outside the standard acquisition process to find, develop, and prototype new technology more quickly.\nIMPAX was launched in 2017 as an initiative of Rear Admiral Mark Darrah, program executive officer for Unmanned Aviation and Strike Weapons at NAVAIR, by working closely with the Technology Transfer Office at NAWCAD. The first initiative with the Navy is to identify technology that will help integrate unmanned aerial vehicles into air control systems by providing miniaturized identification friend or foe (IFF) systems. IFF systems are already used in piloted aircraft, but the much smaller unmanned aircraft lack the space or power for conventional systems.\n\u201cTraditionally the Department of Defense (DoD) has been limited in the means and speed at which it could bring new technologies to the warfighter,\u201d said Rob \u201cRadar\u201d Winston, a GTRI principal research engineer who directs the IMPAX program near Pax River Naval Air Station in Maryland. \u201cOur adversaries aren\u2019t constrained by cumbersome procurement rules and regulations. Through this effort, we want to ensure that our nation\u2019s warfighters get the best technology in the shortest time.\u201d\nIMPAX is empowered to seek out technology from sources the government doesn\u2019t usually work with. These can include small- and medium-sized businesses, companies that don\u2019t traditionally work with the military or bid on billion-dollar DoD procurements. Winston and his team work on the Navy\u2019s behalf, matching warfighter needs with technology that may already exist \u2013 or that can be developed to meet the needs.\nThe relationship between GTRI and NAVAIR\u2019s Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD) is known as a partnership intermediary agreement (PIA). Such agreements allow non-federal government intermediaries to coordinate and solicit non-traditional science and technology sources and to bring forth ideas from parties not usually able to contribute directly to military solutions.\n\u201cThis is the first PIA specifically designed for the Navy to spin technology into naval aviation,\u201d Winston explained. \u201cWe are looking for technology in industry, academia, and other government agencies that can be brought into the DoD very rapidly. If somebody is already working on something that the Navy needs, we can bring them together quickly. We are not just working for the government, but as a team member on the government\u2019s behalf as a trusted partner.\u201d\nIn one aspect, IMPAX team members will serve as technology scouts, scouring many sources of information to locate technologies of interest. They\u2019ll be readily approachable, and won\u2019t require extensive paperwork from companies and others wanting to pitch their technology for potential military applications. The overall activities will be directed by a joint GTRI/NAWCAD/NAVAIR team.\n\u201cIf an individual or company has a great idea but they have never worked with the government before, that barrier to entry is very tall now,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t know who to talk with, how to get involved in a program, or even how to get through the front gate of a military facility. We are going to be able to talk with these people to assess what they can contribute to the warfighter and do it all outside the gate and without the customary barriers.\u201d\nDoD agencies have their own research laboratories to help develop new technology, of course, but Winston\u2019s group will tap other sources of innovation. For technology that\u2019s promising but not quite ready for DoD use, IMPAX will fund brief research and development (R&D) initiatives \u2013 as short as three or four months \u2013 to determine whether a technology is worth pursuing. Pathways from there could include the traditional agency R&D laboratories.\n\u201cThe purpose is to run these programs very quickly, and also to fail things fast with a minimum of investment in resources or time if they aren\u2019t working out,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can start a technology development program at any time, and it can be any technology of interest to the fleet.\u201d\nEach technology development program will be monitored by a subject matter expert and a director from GTRI. They will keep a close eye on program progress, help faltering ones, shut down ones that aren\u2019t making progress or add team members and expertise to promising ones.\nThe IMPAX team will also be able to assemble packages of different technologies to meet specific needs, efforts known as mash-ups.\n\u201cTraditional programs do little to encourage the collision of ideas between different organizations, people, and technologies,\u201d Winston said. \u201cWe\u2019re here to help companies and organization work together to address the need with minimal barriers to innovation.\u201d\nThe IMPAX initiative won\u2019t change how major weapons systems are acquired, but could affect how those systems are updated over time to retain their effectiveness as new technologies rapidly enter the marketplace.\n\u201cIMPAX is going to enable technology that will keep these big platforms operationally relevant over a longer period of time,\u201d Winston explained.\nThe IFF capability for unmanned systems is just one example of an ongoing IMPAX project. Another initiative is looking at the use of augmented reality to support maintenance and training programs. By combining 3-D computer-aided design files with mixed reality glasses, the technology could help maintainers identify a problem, locate components hidden within an aircraft, and train new personnel more quickly.\n\u201cTechnology already exists for these projects, but it would take a long time to actually get them to the fleet using traditional acquisition timelines,\u201d said Winston. \u201cWe can help develop the capability, get it to the Navy who can then get it out to the warfighter quickly. We\u2019ll run as fast as we can with a project and give our warfighters the edge by getting the latest technology to them \u2013 today.\u201d\nResearch News\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\n177 North Avenue\nAtlanta, Georgia\u00a0 30332-0181\u00a0 USA\nMedia Relations Contact : John Toon (404-894-6986) (jtoon@gatech.edu).\nWriter : John Toon\nAdditional Images\nContact\nJohn Toon\nResearch News\n(404) 894-6986\nEmail\njtoon@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
