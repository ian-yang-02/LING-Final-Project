(Photo by Allison Carter)\nNov 30, 2023\nAfter being held at Bobby Dodd Stadium since Fall of 2020, Georgia Tech\u2019s Commencement ceremony is moving back to McCamish Pavilion.\nOne result of steadily increasing enrollment is higher attendance at Commencement, leading to longer ceremonies in which all attending graduates are individually acknowledged. To avoid excessive event times, Tech will host four Commencement ceremonies this fall.\n\u201cDividing the graduating class into four smaller ceremonies allows the event to fit inside McCamish Pavilion,\u201d said Serena Wallace, director of Institute Events. \u201cPrevious Commencements also experienced unfavorable weather conditions. Having the ceremony indoors makes the weather less of a factor.\u201d\nThe Ph.D. ceremony will be held Friday morning, Dec. 15. The Friday afternoon ceremony and the two Saturday ceremonies will be a mix of master\u2019s and bachelor\u2019s graduates. To ensure that each of the four ceremonies is approximately the same length, master's and bachelor's candidates are being paired together.\nView the full schedule of ceremonies .\nBachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s graduates who RSVPed to the ceremony will receive five guest tickets each. No guest tickets are required for the Ph.D. ceremony. No tickets are required to attend the President\u2019s Graduation Celebration, taking place Friday, Dec. 15, or the livestream watch party in O\u2019Keefe Gym during each of the ceremonies. All ceremonies will be livestreamed on the Georgia Tech YouTube page.\nThe Institute\u2019s\nbag policy\nhas not changed.
