It\u2019s been a great way to combine language and math, which are two completely different things, into something very meaningful,\u201d Stephen said.\nThe first-year students grew up in Marietta, Georgia, and say that Georgia Tech was always their dream school \u2014 even though both of their parents went to UGA,\nwhich makes for a bit of lighthearted controversy in the family.\nChristopher and Stephen both came to Tech as math majors but quickly gravitated toward computer science, finding in that discipline an appealing way to use math to solve tangible problems.\nThe computer science majors first became interested in Russian in high school. Both brothers were learning the violin, and their instructor was Russian. \u201cHe would always say little phrases in Russian, and one day our dad jokes and says, \u2018Hey, why don\u2019t you study Russian so you can be taught in Russian by your teacher?\u2019\u201d Christopher recalled.\nWhat began as a joke inspired the brothers to enroll in Russian language courses in their first year of high school. They are now thinking about adding a Russian major to their resumes.\nThe Linders\u2019 love of the Russian language has only deepened, and with the war in Ukraine, they felt compelled to help. \u201cWe felt a responsibility to help in some way because of our ability to communicate in Russian,\u201d Stephen said.\nSharing their concerns with their Russian language teacher, they discovered\u00a0 that math tutors are needed in Ukraine. Their teacher introduced them to Tutoring Without Borders, an independent platform connecting Ukrainian citizens with potential tutors.\nSince June 2022, Christopher has been tutoring a young woman whose family was forced to move to Hungary. Stephen tutors two siblings who have been displaced to England. Regardless of where students are located, the brothers find time to assist them with their math \u2014 and even with their English.\nChristopher and Stephen both note the challenges of teaching something technical in a different language, in addition to the emotional toll it can take working with students whose lives have been uprooted. Both continue to be passionate about helping and have no plans to stop anytime soon.\n\u201cI think just knowing that we can be there to provide some stability is very rewarding. And for me, personally, just getting to learn about my students and learn about their lives is something not many people are able to experience,\u201d Christopher said.\nAdditional Media\nContact\nEvan Atkinson,\nSocial Media Manager\nEmail\neatkinson6@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
