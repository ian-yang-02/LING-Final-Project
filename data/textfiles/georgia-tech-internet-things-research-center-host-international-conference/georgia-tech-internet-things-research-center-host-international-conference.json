Secondarily, the conference aims to highlight the business opportunities that exist at the intersection of IoT and sustainability.\nIoT connects a wide range of devices with smart capabilities and is increasingly seen as a core component of corporate and societal digital transformation. Sustainability or sustainable development \u2013 that which meets \u201cthe needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs,\u201d according to the oft-quoted United Nations\nBrundtland Report\n\u2014 is now viewed by businesses as\nmission critical .\nAt IoT Week in June 2017 in Geneva, Switzerland, the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) \u2013 the United Nations specialized agency for information and communication technologies \u2013\u00a0 and other IoT stakeholders in their \u201cInternet of Things\nDeclaration\nto Achieve the Sustainable Development Goals\u201d underlined that the IoT can \u201cdirectly contribute to achieving the targets in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Accordingly, the emerging IoT paradigm has the potential to create an efficient, effective, and secure ecosystem taking advantage of connected devices for managing the major global challenges faced by this and future generations.\u201d\nThe conference will feature business and academic leaders widely recognized for their expertise. Bilel Jamoussi, chief of the Study Groups Department, ITU Standardization Bureau, will open the conference. He will be followed by Robert Schmid, chief IoT technologist at Deloitte, who will deliver the conference keynote.\nThe program is built around two general roundtable discussions and five shorter sessions on specific topics.\nThe first roundtable will address why it makes business sense for companies to focus on sustainability through the deployment of IoT technologies. The second roundtable will focus on educational and training needs in light of the related business objectives.\nThe five sessions will tackle a range of specific issues such as regulation and policy perspectives; home and commercial buildings; manufacturing; supply chain and logistics; and consumer products.\nThe conference includes a luncheon, breaks, and a reception. There is no charge thanks to the generous support of various corporate organizations including lead sponsors Deloitte, The Coca-Cola Company, and Comcast.\nAdditional details and registration information can be found here: \u00a0 https://cdait.gatech.edu/internet-things-sustainability-smart-business\nWhile aimed at a business audience concerned with sustainable development, the conference will also be of interest to participants in any and all links of the Internet of Things value chain as well as representatives from academia, government, industry, and media curious about the impact of disruptive technologies on the world of today and tomorrow.\nAbout CDAIT\nThe Center for the Development and Application of Internet of Things Technologies (CDAIT, pronounced \u201csedate\u201d) is a global, nonprofit, partner-funded center located in Atlanta that fosters interdisciplinary research and education while driving general awareness about the Internet of Things (IoT). CDAIT bridges sponsors with Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech) faculty and researchers, as well as industry members with similar interests.
