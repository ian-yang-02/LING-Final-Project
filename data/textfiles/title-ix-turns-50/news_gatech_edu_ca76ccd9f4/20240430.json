The clause, part of the education legislation passed in 1972, made a monumental impact on the quest for equality and continues to do so half a century later.\n\u201cWhen I was growing up, I didn\u2019t have the opportunity to play organized sports. It was for the boys,\u201d said Nell Fortner, Georgia Tech women\u2019s basketball head coach. \u201cNow, little girls start playing soccer at age 4 or 5. They get to play T-ball. They get to do everything just like the boys. That was not the world I grew up in, and it\u2019s really cool to see.\u201d\nAlthough Title IX was implemented too late to affect Fortner\u2019s early years, it has played a big role in her adulthood.\n\u201cI hate to even think about having to spend my whole life without Title IX because it gave me my career,\u201d she said. \u201cIt gave me tremendous opportunities, from coaching the 2000 Olympics team to traveling the world playing sports against the best women\u2019s teams. Without Title IX, I would have had none of those opportunities.\u201d\nMuch of the attention on Title IX focuses on opportunities for women to participate in athletics. But the law also prohibits sex discrimination, which has been defined to include sexual assault and sexual harassment, as well as sex-based discrimination in a school\u2019s courses, programs, and activities. The law also prohibits discrimination based on pregnancy.\n\u201cThe federal government identified that women were dropping out or were being told to leave because they were pregnant,\u201d said Alexis Martinez, Georgia Tech\u2019s executive director of Equity and Compliance Programs. \u201cTitle IX put in protections in the education space that made it illegal to remove a woman from their job or from school because she was pregnant. In higher education we work with pregnant students to help them finish their studies.\u201d\nTitle IX also increased conversations and actions involving parity for women who were earning degrees and applying for faculty positions.\n\u201cWomen wanted placement in the same kinds of job opportunities as men,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cInstead of being offered lecture or adjunct positions, they wanted full professor positions, and they deserved them because they were doing the same work. And then with the same titles, you want the same pay. So, all of that is also covered under Title IX.\u201d\nThere are also provisions for access to scholarships and financial aid, as well as housing to ensure there is no discrimination based on sex.\n\u201cAt Georgia Tech, there was a particular focus on STEM fields. The federal government recognized that women were not going into science, engineering, and math. So, they included a particular focus in the legislation to make sure that women were given access to those fields,\u201d Martinez said.\nOver the last 50 years, progress has been made toward equity, but there is still more to be done, according to Joeleen Akin, senior associate athletic director for student-athlete development and senior woman administrator for the Georgia Tech Athletic Association.\n\u201cIt\u2019s always going to be a work in progress,\u201d said Akin, who, as senior woman administrator, holds the highest female position on the Athletic Association staff. She oversees volleyball, women\u2019s basketball, men\u2019s and women\u2019s swimming and diving, softball, and men\u2019s golf, as well as other departments such as sports medicine, student-athlete development, and player development.\n\u201cMost of the time I\u2019m in the room when decisions are made,\u201d she said. \u201cTodd Stansbury, director of Athletics, is inclusive, welcoming, and empowering. He really values the role of the senior woman administrator and makes sure that I\u2019m involved in decision making, which is very important.\u201d\nWhen it comes to what\u2019s next for Title IX, Akin is keeping an eye on the NCAA\u2019s name, image, and likeness (NIL) policy, which will allow college athletes to monetize their success on the field through brand partnerships.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of uncertainty regarding how NIL will affect Title IX. How will it affect women, and how are we going to continue to provide equitable opportunities to women as well? What is it going to look like two years from now?\u201d she asks.\nStudent-athletes are also top of mind for Aileen Morales, Georgia Tech head softball coach, who grew up with Title IX as the norm.\n\u201cGender should never limit your opportunities,\u201d she said. \u201cTitle IX is good for everyone because it provides similar opportunities regardless of gender. We\u2019re very appreciative of the women who paved the way before us, pushing for legislation, and then continuing to fight for opportunities for women in sports and in education.\u201d\nMorales said a benefit of Title IX that is sometimes overlooked is how it helps student-athletes after graduation.\n\u201cBeing part of a team teaches student-athletes how to work with others and how to deal with adversity. When they go out into the world, the experience will help them to lead people and navigate challenges.\u201d\nNote: The Library, the Athletic Association, and the Equity and Compliance Programs office are designing a graphic panel exhibit to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Title IX, which will open in early August and run through December.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nVictor Rogers\nInstitute Communications\nEmail\nvictor.rogers@comm.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
