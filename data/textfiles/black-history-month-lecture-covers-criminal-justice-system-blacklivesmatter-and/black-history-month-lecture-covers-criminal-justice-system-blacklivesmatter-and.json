The impact of #BlackLivesMatter was felt again last fall, when higher education institutions received public demands from students about addressing culture and climate on college campuses and renewing dialogue on the ways society is falling short in its pledge of \u201cliberty and justice for all.\u201d During Georgia Tech\u2019s third annual Black History Month Lecture on February 11, presented by Institute Diversity and the African-American Student Union (AASU), Benjamin Crump, partner of Parks & Crump Law Firm, delivered a keynote speech on \u201cThe Criminal Justice System, #BlackLivesMatter, and College Student Activism Today.\u201d Crump is known for his cases with civil rights implications. \u201cDiversity is a community value \u2014 a value that Georgia Tech has prioritized in its Strategic Plan. We were honored that Benjamin Crump spoke at this year\u2019s Black History Month Lecture \u2014 as we are finding social justice through social media movements in the 21 st\ncentury,\u201d said Archie Ervin, vice president of Institute Diversity. During Crump\u2019s keynote address, one question was asked repeatedly: \u201cGeorgia Tech, where do you stand?\u201d He remarked, \u201cGeorgia Tech is one of the finest institutions in the world. How can you use your influence \u2014 your technical and entrepreneurial knowledge \u2014 to take a stand? We need to take a position because it is the right thing to do.\u201d Crump represented Trayvon Martin\u2019s family at the start of the #BlackLivesMatter social movement as the case was catapulted into the national spotlight. Even though Crump never had the chance to meet Trayvon, he recalled the sound of hopelessness from Trayvon\u2019s father, Tracy Martin, after his son was shot. \u201cMy son was walking home from the 7-Eleven when the Neighborhood Watch volunteer shot and killed him, and they\u2019re not going to arrest him. Travyon was unarmed, holding a bag of Skittles and an iced tea,\u201d recounted Crump from Martin. Under Florida\u2019s Stand Your Ground statute, police were prohibited from arresting Zimmerman, so according to Crump, \u201cPeople found justice through social media. The major media outlets could not ignore the case because #BlackLivesMatter was omnipresent on social media.\u201d \"We need laws that tell people your life matters,\" concluded Crump. \u201cBy standing up for the Trayvon Martins and Michael Browns of the world, it makes America a great beacon of hope for the rest of the world to marvel. We all have a role to play. Figure out what role you play to make lives better for all our children.\u201d Raianna Brown, president of AASU, echoed Crump\u2019s sentiments, commenting on students\u2019 role. \u201cWe enjoyed hearing how the criminal justice system contributed to the recent #BlackLivesMatter and college student activism movements,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is important to learn how we, as students, can help make the criminal justice system more equitable.\u201d To learn more about the Black History Month Lecture, visit\nwww.diversity.gatech.edu .\nAdditional Images\nContact\nAnnette Filliat Communications Manager Institute Diversity annette.filliat@gatech.edu\nEmail\nannette.filliat@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
