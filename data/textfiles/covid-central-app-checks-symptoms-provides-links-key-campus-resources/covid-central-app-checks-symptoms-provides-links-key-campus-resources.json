The web-based app, known as\nCOVID Central , can be accessed from computers, tablets, and smartphones.\nCOVID Central collects no personally identifiable information from users, and can be used for the symptom check that members of the Georgia Tech community are expected to make before leaving for work or classes each day. The app was built by researchers from the\nGeorgia Tech Research Institute\n(GTRI) and is available at\ncovid-central.gatech.edu/app/welcome .\n\u201cThe symptom checker is the heart of the app, and it helps users understand what to do if they report having the CDC-established signs of infection or have been exposed to someone with the virus,\u201d said Jon Duke, director of Georgia Tech\u2019s\nCenter for Health Analytics and Informatics . \u201cNo personal information is being collected, but the aggregated data should be useful to help campus health authorities identify trends in the types of symptoms on campus.\u201d\nThe app\u2019s symptom checker asks users to indicate if they are suffering from any of the nine disease indicators that are shown on Georgia Tech\u2019s coronavirus health site. If the user reports any of the common Covid-19 symptoms, the app can ask about their severity \u2013 such as trouble breathing or bluish lips. It also asks if the user has been exposed to a person diagnosed with Covid-19.\nBased on answers to the questions, the app recommends a course of action. Those with severe symptoms are advised to call 911 for immediate medical assistance. Those with mild symptoms are advised to stay at home and monitor their condition. People who have been exposed to the virus but aren\u2019t experiencing symptoms are asked to self-isolate for 14 days.\nThose who have no symptoms or exposure risks are advised to protect themselves by social distancing, washing their hands, wearing a mask, and getting tested regularly.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve made the symptom tracker as simple and quick to use as possible,\u201d said Trey Schneider, a GTRI research engineer who produced the app. \u201cIt provides a guide to users based on their current symptoms and exposures. The goal is for members of the community to use it every day.\u201d\nIn addition to the symptom tracker, COVID Central provides links to such resources as the NOVID exposure notification app, the campus coronavirus status web page, prevention advice, information on testing, the Campus Recreation Center, housing, and dining services for those on campus.\n\u201cWe wanted to aggregate links to these useful resources and make them easily available to anyone with the app,\u201d Schneider said.\nThe third part of the app provides information on Covid-19 cases reported to\nStamps Health Services\nto help them assess the status of the pandemic. \u201cIt gives members of the community a pulse on positive cases reported on campus,\u201d he said. \u201cThis should help remind students of the need to get tested regularly.\u201d\nCOVID Central is a web-based app that runs in any web browser. It was designed with a single column of information to be useful on a smartphone screen, through Safari or Chrome \u2013 browsers installed on iOS and Android phones. Because it is web-based, there\u2019s no need to obtain it from a manufacturer\u2019s app store.\nBeing web-based makes COVID Central easier to update with new resources or improved programming without having to push out an app update. \u201cEvery time someone visits the site, the latest information is pulled down from the server,\u201d Schneider said.\nResearch News\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\n177 North Avenue\nAtlanta, Georgia\u00a0 30332-0181\u00a0 USA\nMedia Relations Assistance : John Toon (404-894-6986) (jtoon@gatech.edu).\nWriter : John Toon\nAdditional Images\nContact\nJohn Toon\nResearch News\n(404) 894-6986\nEmail\njtoon@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
