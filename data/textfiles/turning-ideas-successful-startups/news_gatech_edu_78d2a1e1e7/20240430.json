It is just one way the Institute is preparing the nation\u2019s next entrepreneurs.\nThis is the third cohort of teams to go through the 12-week Startup Summer program. If the past is any indication, many of the teams will continue to succeed long after the program ends.\nThree program graduates \u2013 FIXD, Gimme Vending and TEQ Charging \u2013 were among 10 emerging companies selected to participate in The Bridge:Atlanta, a startup commercialization program established by Coca-Cola to foster connections and create mentorships between entrepreneurs and established corporations.\nOthers Startup Summer graduates joined Georgia Tech\u2019s\nAdvanced Technology Development Center , a statewide technology incubator.\nHere\u2019s a look at five past Startup Summer teams:\nKeeping Cars \u2018FIXD\u2019\nDrivers tense up when the check engine light come on. They wonder if the car is OK to drive or if it will be expensive to fix.\nFIXD\nhelps drivers quickly understand what\u2019s wrong with their cars.\nThe FIXD sensor is plugged into a car\u2019s diagnostics port, located just underneath the steering wheel. It relays problems to an app via Bluetooth. It provides a simple definition of what is wrong, explains the severity of the issue and warns of the consequences of driving without repairs. The device will also keep track of the vehicle\u2019s diagnostics and let owners know when their car is due for maintenance.\nThe company was part of the inaugural Startup Summer class in 2014. Since then they\u2019ve completed a successful Kickstarter campaign and are selling\u00a0the FIXD sensor through their website and on\u00a0Amazon.\nThe startup isn\u2019t just targeting individual drivers. John Gattuso, the company\u2019s CEO and a graduate of\u00a0the George W. Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering, said\u00a0the device also benefits dealership service departments and auto repair shops.\nFor example,\u00a0FIXD enables dealership service departments to monitor customers' vehicles through a dashboard.\u00a0The dealership's dashboard allows for the service departments to communicate with customers via the FIXD app on their smartphones.\nRepair shops can give it to their customers so they can can easily schedule repairs and maintenance.\nFIXD is currently working with\u00a0Kuhn Volkswagen of Marietta, Georgia, and RPM Automotive, a repair shop in Jacksonville, Florida, with 10 stores.\n\u201cStartup Summer helped us lay an amazing foundation for FIXD and gave us the confidence to pursue our startup full-time,\u201d said Gattuso, who graduated with a degree in mechanical engineering. \u201cEven though we have graduated from Tech, we still rely\u00a0heavily\u00a0on the mentors and advisors that we met during our time in Startup Summer.\"\nRevolutionizing Vending Machines\nCory Hewett knew from experience the problems vending machine companies face.\nBy the time he graduated high school, Hewett had owned and managed more than 25 gumball and vending machines.\nIt was during his time at Georgia Tech that Hewett co-founded a solution to allow vending machine operators to track what is happening in the field in real-time.\nGimme Vending\ndeveloped a hardware and software solution that allows companies to replace their handhelds and easily monitor the status of their cash and inventory.\nThe devices work with the existing vending management software. The Gimme Key is installed into each vending machine\u2019s DEX board and left there. It installs in seconds, with no tools or pairing. Data is communicated wirelessly from the key to the Gimme Drive app via Bluetooth. The data instantaneously uploads from the app to the Gimme Vending cloud and can be immediately accessible to executives. This provides operators faster service and fewer returns, and streamlines inventory.\nHewett, who studied electrical engineering, was also part of the first group of teams to go through Startup Summer.\nSince then the startup has won $50,000 at the Technology Association of Georgia's Business Launch Competition and received $450,000 in seed funding.\nIn April the company won the Automatic Merchandiser 2016 Readers' Choice New Product of the Year Award.\nAlso in April, the company received its first invention patent -- for its method of wirelessly communicating data from vending machines even when there is no network connection.\n\u201cGimme has made a significant impact on the vending industry in a short period of time, and is staged to further disrupt the industry in a positive way,\u201d Hewett said. \u201cWe provide our customers with the data they need to operate more efficiently and profitably.\u201d\nLet Them Eat Bugs\nAs students at Georgia Tech, cousins Sean Warner and Patrick Pittaluga transformed the laundry room inside their apartment into a nursery for 700 larvae of black soldier flies.\nIt marked the beginning of\nGrubbly Farms , a startup company that breeds and sells the larvae as a sustainable source of protein for chicken, pigs and farmed seafood.\nThe country produces more than 30 million tons of food waste that is dumped into landfills and releases greenhouse gases that damage the environment. But Grubbly Farms is collecting the organic waste and feeding it to the black soldier fly larvae.\nAs the larvae eat, they excrete a nutrient-rich fertilizer that benefits gardeners and farmers. The larvae are later used as feed for fish and poultry farms.\nWarner and Pittaluga knew that famers in Europe and Africa use black soldier fly larvae as a protein in livestock feed and wondered if famers in the U.S. would be willing to do the same. So as part of last year\u2019s Startup Summer they travelled around the state and country to talk with chicken and fish famers to better understand the needs of the market and potential customers.\n\u201cWe had the idea but CREATE-X gave us the skills and ability to launch our startup,\u201d said Pittaluga, who graduate with a degree in business.\nWarner graduated with a degree in building construction.\nShortly after Startup Summer ended they attended the 2015 Kairos Global Summit, which highlighted 50 innovative startups from around the world.\nLast year the company partnered with Kennesaw State University to conduct research and development in a greenhouse on the university\u2019s farm.\nThey recently moved into a 5,500-square-foot facility in Doraville and are getting ready to hire their first employee.\nGrow Your Own Food\nRuwan Subasinghe grew tired of his produce and herbs going bad before he could eat it all. He wanted fresh food but didn\u2019t have the time or space for a garden.\nInstead he co-invented a machine to let people grow their own fresh produce right in their kitchens.\nTogether with Alex Weiss they launched\nReplantable , the startup behind the Nanofarm, a tiny modular farm that fits on a kitchen countertop. It grows vegetables, herbs and salad greens.\nThe Nanofarm cabinet includes a water tray, LED grow lights and a plant pad. The plant pads are soil-free, pre-seeded paper and fabric pads that contain the plant nutrients. The pads go on top of a water-filled growing tray, where they wick up water during the growing cycle. A built-in ventilation system pumps carbon dioxide to the plants and vents oxygen into the home.\nUnlike other products to come out of Startup Summer this one doesn\u2019t require an app or depend on a smartphone or computer to work.\nThe Nanofarm\u2019s frame is built from powder-coated steel and natural wood. The door is\nmade of tinted glass and the door handle and hinge are made of marine-grade aluminum. It has three dials: one selects the length of the growing period, another starts the unit and a final light is lit when it\u2019s time to harvest.\nSubasinghe described the device as \u201cset it and forget it.\u201d\n\u201cThere is no seeding or watering or adding nutrients and you don\u2019t have to adjust the light,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter you hit start it will do all the work and let you know when it\u2019s time to harvest.\u201d\nA group of beta testers spent about seven months using the device. The startup is planning to officially launch the Nanofarm this week on Kickstarter.\nHow to Charge EVs\nWhile in different classes at Georgia Tech, Dorrier Coleman, Josh Lieberman and Isaac Wittenstein experimented with electric vehicles and their growing market.\nThey quickly identified a main source of frustration for drivers and owners of these vehicles: seeing one car plugged in to a charger all day while other drivers wait their turn.\nThe three pooled their knowledge and created a power management system for electric vehicle chargers.\nTEQ Charging\naims to make charging easy and hassle free by allowing multiple drivers to plug their cars into a charging queue.\nThe company\u2019s name is short for The Electric Queue and pays tribute to Georgia Tech.\nA software system queues the power from one car to the next throughout the day. Although every car may be plugged into the charger, the company\u2019s patent-pending algorithms place each connected car in a queue. Each charger turns on and off in the most efficient order to maximize the number of cars that can be charged during a specific period of time.\nMeanwhile the TEQ app helps vehicle owners find open chargers.\nThey went through Startup Summer last year and began live testing the system in June at the Newberger Andes Offices offices, located on Roswell Road and I-285.\nResults from beta testing will allow the company to further develop the technology. Wittenstein said they plan to talk with users to get their thoughts on the charging system and learn what improvements and changes they\u2019d like to see.\n\u201cGeorgia Tech gave us the opportunity to be where we are right now,\u201d said Lieberman, the CEO of TEQ. \u201cWithout all the support and programs, we would not have been able to define and develop our business.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nCREATE-X\nContact\nLaura Diamond\nMedia Relations\n404-894-6016\n@LauraRDiamond\nEmail\nlaura.diamond@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
