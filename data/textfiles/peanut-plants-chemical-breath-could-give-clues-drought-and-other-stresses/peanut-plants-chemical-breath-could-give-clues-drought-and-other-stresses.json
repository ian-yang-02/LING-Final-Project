Growers typically rely on indirect monitoring methods such as soil moisture testing to assess the health of plants in their fields. But directly testing stress response could be faster more accurate and offer a wider range of diagnoses. Now scientists are working on gas-collection devices that growers could deploy in fields or on plants.\n\u201cWe want to learn the best ways to detect and measure gases that could correlate to various plant conditions such as drought,\u201d said Wayne Daley, associate division chief and principal research engineer with the\nAgricultural Technology Research Program\nat the\nGeorgia Tech Research Institute\n(GTRI).\nAbout 1.67 million acres of peanuts were harvested in the U.S. in 2017, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture \u2014 160,000 in Florida and 850,000 in Georgia. Peanuts are a $2.2 billion crop in Georgia, accounting for 23 percent of the state\u2019s row and forage crop income, according to the Georgia Peanut Commission.\nDaley and his co-investigators are collaborating with Diane Rowland, Barry Tillman and Alina Zare, all affiliated faculty of the University of Florida\u2019s Center for Stress Resilient Agriculture, to identify and design collection methods for VOCs in an outdoor field site, an environmental chamber and a greenhouse in Florida. The GTRI team includes chemists Judy Song and Dan Sabo and data scientists Olga Kemenova and Milad Navaei.\n\u201cThis type of advanced technology is what is critically needed for our growers to remain economically viable,\u201d said Rowland, professor of physiology at the University of Florida. \u201cResource use efficiency in farming, including rapidly responding to counteract stress events such as drought, is the key not only to environmental stewardship, but also for remaining profitable under rising input costs.\u201d\nStill, detecting relevant gases in the field remains a giant challenge.\n\u201cPeanut plants release VOCs at very low concentrations that are difficult to measure,\u201d said Daley. \u201cWe want to learn which VOCs are significant and tell us about stresses that are of interest to growers.\u201d In a previous study, Daley and other GTRI scientists learned that VOC signatures are different among peanut plants at various degrees of drought intensity.\nDuring the 2017 growing season, GTRI researchers placed glass rods coated with gas-absorbent material near peanut plants. The rods were taken to the lab and excited to release the absorbed gases, which were identified and measured. But a field site is a complex environment with many confounding factors.\nNow the researchers are evaluating this gas-measurement technique to study peanut plants grown in controlled lab conditions.\nDuring the 2017 growing season, researchers from University of Florida collected the field data from peanut plants using polydimethylsiloxane-coated stir bars (Twisters). The collected gases were sent to GTRI for identification and analysis using a thermal desorption unit.\nNow the researchers are evaluating this gas-measurement technique to study peanut plants grown in controlled lab conditions.\nA peanut plant\u2019s seasonal growth stages affect the amounts and types of VOCs it releases. Even the time of day affects these emissions.\n\u201cWe are building an environmental chamber in which we can mimic the humidity, lighting, and nutrients of a natural field on a Florida day from the morning to evening with appropriate humidity,\u201d said Daley. \u201cThis is the first step to test and evaluate the gas measurement technique in controlled conditions. Once we know more about its performance and how to apply it, then we\u2019ll take it to the University of Florida to be studied with plants in a greenhouse.\u201d\nThe team is developing a baseline of peanut VOC \u201cfamilies\u201d that could be identified in the environmental chamber. Each peanut stressor also could be associated with a distinct family of VOCs. For instance, researchers could simulate a drought in the chamber to study the associated VOCs. But there may be background families of VOCs that compete with or confuse a drought gas test.\n\u201cWe need to understand how the peanut plant responds to both health and stress conditions to be able to fully utilize VOCs for drought detection\u201d said Sabo, a GTRI research scientist.\n\u201cWe are investigating how interference gases compete for space on the absorbent material,\u201d said Song, a GTRI senior research engineer. \u201cThe experiment in the environmental chamber will be able to help us gain an understanding of how these interference gases and stressed-based VOCs interact and interfere with one another. With this knowledge we will be able to make accurate and meaningful measurements.\u201d\nOnce researchers understand the ambient complexity of an outdoor peanut field, they could develop and refine a specialized gas test for peanut drought stress indicators, which could help farmers improve irrigation scheduling or prevent aflatoxins, which are potential carcinogens.\n\u201cYou could probably develop and instrument the field with reliable compact sensors that allow for quick and convenient VOC collection and assessment,\u201d said Daley. \u201cOr we could envision robots manually taking samples.\u201d\nThis project is funded by Southern Peanut Research Initiative Project (#D7984.2.0.0.0) and USDA-National Institute of Food and Agriculture Grant (#D8585.0.0.0.0)\nResearch News\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\n177 North Avenue\nAtlanta, Georgia\u00a0 30332-0181\u00a0 USA\nMedia Relations Contact : John Toon (404-894-6986) (jtoon@gatech.edu).\nWriter : John Tibbetts\nAdditional Images\nContact\nJohn Toon\nResearch News\n(404) 894-6986\nEmail\njtoon@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
