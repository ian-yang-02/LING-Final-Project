The center, led by the University of Arkansas System Division of Agriculture, will join researchers from five institutions in three states in efforts to adapt robotic automation to chicken meat processing.\nDouglas Britton, manager of the Agricultural Technology Research Program at the Georgia Tech Research Institute (GTRI), said his team was very excited to work on this project with experts at the four other institutions.\n\u201cThe ultimate goal is to drive transformational innovation into the poultry and meat processing industry through automation, robotics, AI, and VR technologies,\u201d Britton said. \u201cBuilding on years of work in the GTRI Agricultural Technology Research Program, we are pleased to see that the USDA-NIFA has chosen this team to continue these efforts.\u201d\nGeorgia Tech is a major partner in the project, and was awarded $2 million to focus on automating the processing lines that turn chickens into meat, said Jeyam Subbiah, professor and head of the food science department for the Division of Agriculture and the Dale Bumpers College of Agricultural, Food and Life Sciences at the University of Arkansas, and director of the project. The grant is for four years.\nThe Arkansas Agricultural Experiment Station, the research arm of the Division of Agriculture, will receive $2.2 million from the grant primarily to focus on food safety automation for poultry processing plants.\nThe remaining grant money will be divided between Julia McQuillan, Willa Cather professor of sociology at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, and Brou Kuoakou, associate dean for research at Fort Valley State University in Georgia.\nJeff Buhr, a USDA Agricultural Research Service scientist, will contribute his expertise in broiler physiology to guide robotic deboning of meat, Subbiah said.\nGeorgia is the nation\u2019s top broiler producer. Arkansas is number 3, according to 2021 figures from USDA.\nMeeting the challenge\nThe recent impetus to automate chicken processing began with the Covid-19 pandemic, Subbiah said. The illness spread quickly among workers on the processing line. Since the worst of the pandemic, the poultry industry, like many others, has been having trouble hiring enough workers.\n\u201cPoultry processing lines began 70 to 80 years ago,\u201d Subbiah said. \u201cSince then, there have been only incremental changes in technology. Today, there\u2019s a need for transformative change.\u201d\nHumans can feel when a knife hits a bone. In contrast, existing automation in poultry processing, like deboners, wastes a lot of meat.\n\u201cHuman deboners leave about 13 percent of meat on the bones,\u201d Subbiah said. \u201cAutomated deboners leave 16 to 17 percent. On an industrial scale, that\u2019s a significant loss in value. We will use artificial intelligence and virtual reality to improve precision and reduce wastage.\u201d\nAutomation can relieve labor shortages, Subbiah said. It also allows plants to locate in rural areas with a smaller labor force but nearer poultry houses and with lower property costs.\nInitially, people working remotely may help advance robotic processing. Subbiah envisions workers logging on from home with virtual-reality goggles and haptics gloves to control robots located miles away.\nWhile working remotely, the labor force will teach artificial intelligence how to cut up chickens of varying sizes and shapes.\n\u201cAutomated machines right now are programmed to debone or cut up chickens based on an average size and shape. But no chicken is that size or shape,\u201d Subbiah said. \u201cRobot-wielded knives cut meat poorly. The machines have to learn how to adjust to the reality of random sizes and shapes.\u201d\nGeorgia Tech\u2019s participating scientists are all part of GTRI:\nDouglas Britton, manager of the Agricultural Technology Research Program\nColin Trevor Usher, senior research scientist and branch head of robotics systems and technology, Agricultural Technology Research Program\nAi-Ping Hu, principal research engineer, Agricultural Technology Research Program\nKonrad Ahlin, research engineer, Intelligent Sustainable Technologies Division\nMichael Park, research engineer, Intelligent Sustainable Technologies Division\nBenjamin Joffe, research scientist, Intelligent Sustainable Technologies Division\nShreyes Melkote, the Morris M.
