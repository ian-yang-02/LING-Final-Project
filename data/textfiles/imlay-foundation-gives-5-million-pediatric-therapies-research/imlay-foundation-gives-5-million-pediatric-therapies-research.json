The single largest grant made by The Imlay Foundation in its 25-year history, this commitment establishes The Imlay Innovation Fund at Children\u2019s to advance collaboration between Georgia Tech and Children\u2019s pediatric innovation and discovery efforts.\nThe research partnership with Georgia Tech is called the Children\u2019s Healthcare of Atlanta Pediatric Technology Center. The collaborative research fostered through this partnership brings together clinicians from Children\u2019s, academic scientists from Emory University and engineers from Georgia Tech to solve important problems in pediatrics and develop technological solutions for improving the health of children. With the formation of the Children\u2019s Pediatric Technology Center, Children\u2019s and Georgia Tech are providing extraordinary opportunities for interdisciplinary collaboration in pediatrics, creating breakthrough discoveries that often can only be found at the intersection of multiple disciplines.\n\u201cIt is through generous philanthropy that we are able to foster these alliances that help enhance the lives of children,\u201d said Donna Hyland, President and CEO, Children\u2019s. \u201cMary Ellen and her late husband, John, have demonstrated their love and appreciation of Children\u2019s and Georgia Tech in a myriad of ways over the years through their volunteerism, board leadership and philanthropy. This grant furthers their deep commitment to Children\u2019s and Georgia Tech.\u201d\nThe grant will help fund two collaborative programs, including Quick Wins, a novel program that allows Children\u2019s clinicians and clinical administrative leaders to bring problems that impact care delivery to the attention of scientists and engineers at Georgia Tech to help develop technology-based solutions to improve pediatric health care. The funds will also support a program to help bridge the gap following proof to concept, giving investigators the ability to collect data, complete further proof-of-concept studies or produce prototypes for testing in order to advance a solution to the next stage of development.\n\u201cThe grant decision was met with unanimous and enthusiastic approval from The Imlay Foundation Board,\u201d said Mary Ellen Imlay, a longtime Children\u2019s Foundation Trustee. \u201cWe could not think of a more meaningful way to honor John and further his legacy at both Children\u2019s and his alma mater, Georgia Tech.\u201d\n\u201cThis generous grant serves as a powerful affirmation of the great partnership between Children\u2019s Healthcare of Atlanta and Georgia Tech,\u201d said Georgia Tech President G. P. \u201cBud\u201d Peterson.\u00a0 \u201cWe continue to collaborate with Children\u2019s in numerous areas and are excited about the potential impact on pediatric medicine.\u201d\nAbout Children\u2019s Healthcare of Atlanta\nChildren\u2019s Healthcare of Atlanta has been 100 percent dedicated to kids for more than 100 years.
