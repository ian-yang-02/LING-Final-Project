It attaches to either an 18- or 36-inch diameter balloon. \\\nMay 15, 2017\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nGeorgia Institute of Technology researchers have created a team of free-flying robots that obeys the two rules of the air: don\u2019t collide or undercut each other. They\u2019ve also built autonomous blimps that recognize hand gestures and detect faces.\nBoth projects will be presented at the\n2017 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)\nMay 29 \u2013 June 3 in Singapore.\nIn the first, five swarm quadcopters zip back and forth in formation, then change their behaviors based on user commands. The trick is to maneuver without smacking into each other or flying underneath another machine. If a robot cuts into the airstream of a higher flying quadcopter, the lower machine must quickly recover from the turbulent air or risk falling out of the sky.\n\u201cGround robots have had built-in safety \u2018bubbles\u2019 around them for a long time to avoid crashing,\u201d said Magnus Egerstedt, the Georgia Tech\nSchool of Electrical and Computer Engineering\nprofessor who oversees the project. \u201cOur quadcopters must also include a cylindrical \u2018do not touch\u2019 area to avoid messing up the airflow for each other. They\u2019re basically wearing virtual top hats.\u201d\nAs long as the Georgia Tech machines avoid flying in the two-foot space below their neighbor, they can swarm freely without a problem. That typically means they dart around each other rather than going low.\nPh.D. student Li Wang figured out the size of the \u201ctop hat\u201d one afternoon by hovering one copter in the air and sending others back and forth underneath it. Any closer than 0.6 of a meter (or five times the diameter from one rotor to another) and the machines were blasted to the ground. Then he created algorithms to allow them to change formation midflight.\n\u201cWe figured out the smallest amount of modifications a quadcopter must make to its planned path to achieve the new formation,\u201d said Wang. \u201cMathematically, that\u2019s what a programmer wants \u2014 the smallest deviations from an original flight plan.\u201d\nThe project is part of Egerstedt and Wang\u2019s\noverall research , which focuses on easily controlling and interacting with large teams of robots.\n\u201cOur skies will become more congested with autonomous machines, whether they\u2019re used for deliveries, agriculture or search and rescue,\u201d said Egerstedt, who directs Georgia Tech\u2019s Institute for Robotics and Intelligent Machines. \u201cIt\u2019s not possible for one person to control dozens or hundreds of robots at a time. That\u2019s why we need machines to figure it out themselves.\u201d\nThe researchers overseeing the second project, the blimps, 3D-printed a gondola frame that carries sensors and a mini camera. It attaches to either an 18- or 36-inch diameter balloon. The smaller blimp can carry a five-gram payload; the larger one supports 20 grams.\nThe autonomous blimps detect faces and hands, allowing people to direct the flyers with movements. All the while, the machine gathers information about its human operator, identifying everything from hesitant glares to eager smiles. The goal is to better understand how people interact with flying robots.\n\u201cRoboticists and psychologists have learned many things about how humans relate to robots on the ground, but we haven\u2019t created techniques to study how we react to flying machines,\u201d said Fumin Zhang, the Georgia Tech associate professor leading the blimp project. \u201cFlying a regular drone close to people presents a host of issues. But people are much more likely to approach and interact with a slow-moving blimp that looks like a toy.\u201d\nThe blimps\u2019 circular shape makes them harder to steer with manual controllers, but allows them to turn and quickly change direction. This is unlike the more popular zeppelin-shaped blimps commonly used by other researchers.\nZhang has filed a request with Guinness World Records for the smallest autonomous blimp. He sees a future where blimps can play a role in people\u2019s lives, but only if roboticists can determine what people want and how they\u2019ll react to a flying companion.\n\u201cImagine a blimp greeting you at the front of the hardware store, ready to offer assistance,\u201d Zhang said. \u201cPeople are good at reading people\u2019s faces and sensing if they need help or not. Robots could do the same. And if you needed help, the blimp could ask, then lead you to the correct aisle, flying above the crowds and out of the way.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nAdditional Videos of Blimps\nGround Robots Learn to Collaborate, Not Crash\nSchool of Electrical and Computer Engineering\nContact\nJason Maderer\nNational Media Relations\nmaderer@gatech.edu\n404-660-2926\nEmail\nmaderer@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
