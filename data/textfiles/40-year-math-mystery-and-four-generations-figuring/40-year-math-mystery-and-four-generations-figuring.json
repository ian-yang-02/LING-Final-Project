Georgia Tech mathematicians have solved a 40-year Graph Theory mystery.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nEmail\nGeorgia Tech mathematicians Xingxing Yu, Yan Wang and Dawei He have offered a proof of the Kelmans-Seymour Conjecture nearly 40 years after Princeton Mathematician Paul Seymour made it in 1977.\nMay 25, 2016\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nThis may sound like a familiar kind of riddle: How many brilliant mathematicians does it take to come up with and prove the Kelmans-Seymour Conjecture? But the answer is no joke, because arriving at it took mental toil that spanned four decades until this year, when mathematicians at the Georgia Institute of Technology\nfinally announced a proof\nof that conjecture in Graph Theory. Their research was funded by the National Science Foundation. Graph Theory is a field of mathematics that\u2019s instrumental in complex tangles. It helps you make more connecting flights, helps get your GPS unstuck in traffic, and helps manage your Facebook posts. Back to the question. How many? Six (at least). One made the conjecture. One tried for years to prove it and failed but passed on his insights. One advanced the mathematical basis for 10 more years. One helped that person solve part of the proof. And two more finally helped him complete the rest of the proof. Elapsed time: 39 years. So, what is the Kelmans-Seymour Conjecture, anyway? Its name comes from Paul Seymour from Princeton University, who came up with the notion in 1977. Then another mathematician named Alexander Kelmans, arrived at the same conjecture in 1979. And though the Georgia Tech proof fills some 120 pages of math reasoning, the conjecture itself is only one short sentence: If a graph G is 5-connected and non-planar, then G has a TK 5 . The devil called \u2018TK 5 \u2019 You could call a TK 5\nthe devil in the details. TK 5 s are larger relatives of K 5 , a very simple formation that looks like a 5-point star fenced in by a pentagon. It resembles an occult or Anarchy symbol, and that\u2019s fitting. A TK 5\nin a \u201cgraph\u201d is guaranteed to thwart any nice, neat \u201cplanar\u201d status. Graph Theory. Planar. Non-planar. TK 5 . Let\u2019s go to the real world to understand them better. \u201cGraph Theory is used, for example, in designing microprocessors and the logic behind computer programs,\u201d said Georgia Tech mathematician Xingxing Yu, who has shepherded the Kelmans-Seymour Conjecture\u2019s proof to completion. \u201cIt\u2019s helpful in detailed networks to get quick solutions that are reasonable and require low computational complexity.\u201d To picture a graph, draw some cities as points on a whiteboard and lines representing interstate highways connecting them. But the resulting drawings are not geometrical figures like squares and trapezoids. Instead, the lines, called \u201cedges,\u201d are like wires connecting points called \u201cvertices.\u201d For a planar graph, there is always some way to draw it so that the lines from point to point do not cross. In the real world, a microprocessor is sending electrons from point to point down myriad conductive paths. Get them crossed, and the processor shorts out. In such intricate scenarios, optimizing connections is key. Graphs and graph algorithms play a role in modeling them. \u201cYou want to get as close to planar as you can in these situations,\u201d Yu said. In Graph Theory, wherever K 5\nor its sprawling relatives TK 5 s show up, you can forget planar. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to know where one may be hiding in a very large graph. The human connections The human connections that led to the proof of the Kelmans-Seymour Conjecture are equally interesting, if less complicated. Seymour had a collaborator,\nRobin Thomas, a Regent\u2019s Professor at Georgia Tech\nwho heads a\nprogram that includes a concentration on Graph Theory . His team has a track record of cracking decades-old math problems. One was even more than a century old. \u201cI tried moderately hard to prove the Kelmans-Seymour conjecture in the 1990s, but failed,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cYu is a rare mathematician, and this shows it. I\u2019m delighted that he pushed the proof to completion.\u201d Yu, once Thomas\u2019 postdoc and now a professor at the School of Mathematics, picked up on the conjecture many years later. \u201cAround 2000, I was working on related concepts and around 2007, I became convinced that I was ready to work on that conjecture,\u201d Yu said. He planned to involve graduate students but waited a year. \u201cI needed to have a clearer plan of how to proceed. Otherwise, it would have been too risky,\u201d Yu said. Then he brought in graduate student Jie Ma in 2008, and together they proved the conjecture part of the way. Two years later, Yu brought graduate students Yan Wang and Dawei He into the picture. \u201cWang worked very hard and efficiently full time on the problem,\u201d Yu said. The team delivered the rest of the proof quicker than anticipated and\ncurrently have two\nsubmitted papers\nand two more in the works. In addition to the six mathematicians who made and proved the conjecture, others tried but didn\u2019t complete the proof but left behind useful cues. Nearly four decades after Seymour had his idea, the fight for its proof is still not over. Other researchers are now called to tear at it for about two years like an invading mob. Not until they\u2019ve thoroughly failed to destroy it, will the proof officially stand. Seymour\u2019s first reaction to news of the proof reflected that reality. \u201cCongratulations! (If it\u2019s true\u2026),\u201d he wrote. Graduate student Wang is not terribly worried. \u201cWe spent lots and lots of our time trying to wreck it ourselves and couldn\u2019t, so I hope things will be fine,\u201d he said. If so, the conjecture will get a new name: Kelmans-Seymour Conjecture Proved by He, Wang and Yu. And it will trigger a mathematical chain reaction, automatically confirming a past conjecture, Dirac\u2019s Conjecture Proved by Mader, and also putting within reach proof of another conjecture, Hajos\u2019 Conjecture. For Princeton mathematician Seymour, it\u2019s nice to see an intuition he held so strongly is now likely to enter into the realm of proven mathematics. \u201cSometimes you conjecture some pretty thing, and it's just wrong, and the truth is just a mess,\u201d he wrote in an email message. \u201cBut sometimes, the pretty thing is also the truth; that that does happen sometimes is basically what keeps math going I suppose. There\u2019s a profound thought.\u201d The National Science Foundation funded this research under grants DMS-1265564 and AST-1247545. \u00a0Any opinions, findings, and conclusions or recommendations expressed in this material are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the views of the National Science Foundation.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nResearch News Georgia Institute of Technology Media Relations Contacts: \u00a0Ben Brumfield, ben.brumfield@comm.gatech.edu , 404-660-1408 Writer:\nBen Brumfield\nEmail\nben.brumfield@comm.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
