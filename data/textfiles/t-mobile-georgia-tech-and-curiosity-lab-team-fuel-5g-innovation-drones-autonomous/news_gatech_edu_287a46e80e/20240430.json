The facility features a 25,000 square foot Innovation Center and 3-mile autonomous vehicle test track. T-Mobile has deployed its Extended Range 5G and Ultra Capacity 5G network across the park enabling developers to build solutions in a real-world environment. Here developers will build and test new 5G use cases such as autonomous vehicles, robotics, industrial drone applications, mixed reality training and entertainment, remote medical care, personal health and fitness wearables, and more.\n\u201cWhat a match-up! America\u2019s leading 5G network, the brilliant minds of Georgia Tech and the most advanced living lab in the country \u2014 now that\u2019s a powerhouse combination,\u201d said John Saw, EVP of Advanced & Emerging Technologies at T-Mobile. \u201cWe cannot wait to see the innovation that occurs as entrepreneurs and developers build the next big thing in 5G backed by these world-class resources.\u201d\nThe new incubator, managed in collaboration with Georgia Tech\u2019s Advanced Technology Development Center (ATDC), is an expansion of the T-Mobile Accelerator\u00a0and part of the Un-carrier\u2019s efforts to fuel 5G innovation. T-Mobile supports numerous initiatives to help startups and entrepreneurs develop, test and bring to market groundbreaking new 5G products and services. T-Mobile Accelerator is an award-winning program founded in 2014 that originated in the smart city corridor of Kansas City.\nCompanies participating in the 5G Connected Future program will work directly with technology and business leaders at T-Mobile Accelerator, Georgia Tech, and Curiosity Lab as they build, test and bring to market new products and services that\u00a0unleash\u00a0the potential\u00a0of T-Mobile 5G. ATDC is a globally recognized technology incubator. The 5G Connected Future vertical is the fourth of its kind at ATDC and follows other targeted programs in health, retail and financial technologies.\n\u201cIn addition to the normal startup concerns, entrepreneurs in the 5G space face a unique set of challenges such as regulatory issues at the state and local levels, network security, and integration testing,\u201d said ATDC Director John Avery.\nATDC brings a unique framework that combines its startup curriculum, coaching, connections, and community, as well as direct access to Georgia Tech resources, research expertise, and student talent, to help entrepreneurs learn, launch, scale, and succeed. In this effort, ATDC will offer programing, recruit and evaluate startups, and hire staff to manage the vertical in Peachtree Corners.\n\u201cThis collaboration is a great opportunity for ATDC and Georgia Tech, the city of Peachtree Corners and Curiosity Lab, and T-Mobile, a Fortune 50 company, to create a unique collection to work with these companies, refine their ideas into scalable companies, and bring these solutions to market more quickly,\u201d Avery said.\nSuch a partnership underscores \u201cGeorgia Tech\u2019s commitment to enabling tomorrow\u2019s technology leaders, which remains as strong as when ATDC was founded 41 years ago,\u201d said Chaouki T. Abdallah, Georgia Tech\u2019s executive vice president for research. \u201cInnovation cannot take place in a vacuum, which is why entrepreneurs and startups require the knowledge and resources provided through partnerships such as ours.\u201d\n\u201cThe City of Peachtree Corners and Curiosity Lab continue to affirm our commitment to technology innovation through programs, partnerships and engagements with industry leaders such as T-Mobile and Georgia Tech,\u201d said Betsy Plattenburg, executive director of Curiosity Lab. \u201cThese two organizations were instrumental in the launch of Curiosity Lab and our continued collaboration will create opportunities for the next-generation of intelligent mobility and smart city entrepreneurs.\u201d\nT-Mobile 5G, A Platform for Innovation\nT-Mobile is America\u2019s 5G leader, with the fastest and largest nationwide 5G network.
