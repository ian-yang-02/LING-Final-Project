The project team, community collaborators, and local residents convened for an expo highlighting the programs accomplishments with presentations and hands-on demonstrations. They also gathered input to guide planning for the second year of the project.\n\u201cThe is the first project of its kind in the region, and we are excited about how far it\u2019s come and the genuine interest and input from the local community,\u201d said Kim Cobb, Director of Global Change Program and Professor in the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences.\nThe Smart Sea Level Sensors project is a collaboration\u00a0between Chatham Emergency Management officials, City of Savannah officials and Georgia Tech scientists and engineers who are working together to install a dense network of internet-enabled sea level sensors across Chatham County.\n\u201cThe publicly available data gathered from these sensors will inform our long-term resilience and\ninfrastructure planning,\u201d said the City of Savannah\u2019s Sustainability Director, Nick Deffley. \u201cIt provides a great opportunity to really engage with some of our most vulnerable neighborhoods, working collaboratively with them to improve their ability to respond, absorb and bounce back from extreme storm and flood events.\u201d\nAt this time, the project team has installed 30 sensors, with hopes to install additional detectors across the coastal Georgia region in the near future. The real-time coastal flooding data will help guide emergency planning and response efforts.\n\u201cChatham County has an intricate network of waterways which greatly affects the timing and impact of flood conditions,\u201d said Randall Mathews, CEMA Senior Emergency Management Coordinator. \u201cThis project affords decision makers the opportunity to monitor the movement of water throughout our community in real-time, as well as provide a greater understanding of flooding impact.\u00a0 Tools created by this project can be used to guide emergency response efforts during a severe weather emergency such as a Hurricane.\u201d\nThe project has been a group effort since it began last summer. From engaging H.V. Jenkins School of Engineering students on the assembly work involved with the smart sea level sensors to partnering with Oglethorpe Charter Middle School for pilot testing of a 6th grade earth science curriculum, the project team has fostered substantial community involvement.\n\u201cGeorgia Tech has played a lead role in developing the technology for the project, which has been really exciting,\u201d said Georgia Tech Senior Research Scientist, Dr. Russ Clark. \u201cIt\u2019s truly been great to work on a project that has such obvious, immediate value to our community and the place we call home.\u201d\nThe Smart Sea Level Sensors Project is one of four projects under the Georgia Smart Communities Challenge. The strategies developed by the selected communities are meant to serve as models that could be implemented elsewhere to advance smart technology and improve community well-being across Georgia.\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nFour Communities Selected for Inaugural Georgia Smart Communities Challenge\nGeorgia Smart Communities Challenge\nContact\nlance.wallace@comm.gatech.edu\nEmail\nlance.wallace@comm.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
