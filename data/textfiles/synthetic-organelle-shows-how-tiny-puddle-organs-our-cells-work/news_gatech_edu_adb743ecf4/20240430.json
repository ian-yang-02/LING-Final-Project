That's what some of our cells' organelles are, and this synthetic organelle, engineered in the lab, shows how they can work.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nEmail\nIn a vile three watery solutions phase separate into three layers. In membraneless\u00a0organelles, chemical reactions occur at the\u00a0interfaces of such layers, processing a reactant step-by-step and moving the reaction product from one layer to the next.

And researchers had made a synthetic organelle, which they used in a\nnew study\nto explore some odd cellular biochemistry.\nThe researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology made the chemical medley in the lab to closely mimic\u00a0membraneless\u00a0organelles, mini-organs in cells that are not contained in a membrane but exist as pools of watery solutions, or puddles. And their model demonstrated how, with just a few ingredients, the organelles could carry out fine-tuned biological processes.\nThe researchers\npublished the results of their study in the journal\nACS Applied Materials & Interfaces\nfor the September 26, 2018 issue. The research was funded by the National Institutes of Health\u2019s National Institute of General Medical Science and by the National Science Foundation.\nA quick look at membraneless organelles should aid in understanding the research\u2019s significance.\nWhat are membraneless organelles?\nOrganelles that are pools of watery solutions and not objects with membranes are a fairly recent discovery. A prime example is the\nnucleolus . It resides inside of the cell\u2019s nucleus, which is an organelle that does have a membrane.\nIn the past, researchers thought the nucleolus disappeared during cell division and reappeared later. In the meantime, researchers have realized that the nucleolus has no membrane and that during cell division it gets diffused the way water bubbles do in vinaigrette dressing that has been shaken up.\n\u201cAfter cell division, the nucleolus comes back together as a single compartment of fluid,\u201d said\nShuichi Takayama, the study\u2019s principal investigator and a professor in the Wallace E. Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering at Georgia Tech and Emory University .\nMembraneless organelles can be made up of a few different aqueous solutions, each with different solutes like proteins or sugar or RNA or salt. Differences in the\nthermodynamics\nof the solutions, that is, how their molecules bounce around, keep them from merging into a single solution.\nInstead, they\nphase separate\nthe way oil and water do, even after intermingling. But there\u2019s no oil in this case.\n\u201cThey\u2019re all waters,\u201d Takayama said. \u201cThey just don\u2019t mix with each other because they have different solutes.\u201d\nWhat lifelike processes did the synthetic experiment demonstrate?\nDuring intermingling, important things happen. The nucleolus, for example, is vital to DNA transcription. But the synthetic set-up, a collection of watery solutions made by the study\u2019s first author, Taisuke Kojima, carried out a simpler series of reactions that demonstrated how\u00a0membraneless organelles could process sugar.\n\u201cWe had three phases of solutions that each held different reactants,\u201d Kojima said. \u201cIt was like a ball with three layers: an outer solution, an intermediate solution, and a core solution. Glucose was in the outer layer; an enzyme,\u00a0 glucose oxidase , was in the second layer, and\u00a0 horseradish peroxidase \u00a0was in the core along with a colorimetric substrate that gave us a visible signal when the last reaction we were looking for occurred.\u201d\nThe glucose in the outer layer interfaced with the glucose oxidase in the second layer, which catalyzed the glucose to hydrogen peroxide. It landed in the second layer and interfaced with the horseradish peroxidase in the core layer, which catalyzed the hydrogen peroxide\u00a0along with the compound that turns colors, which changed the color of the core layer.\n\u201cThis type of cascading reaction is what one would expect to see membraneless organelles perform,\u201d Takayama said.\nThe cascade even transported each reaction product from one compartment to the next, something very typical in biological processes, like organs digesting food or an organelle processing molecules.\nWhat can a surprise discovery teach us?\nPart of the reaction took the researchers by surprise, and it resulted in a novel discovery.\n\u201cWhen researchers think about membraneless organelles, we often think that the reactions inside them are more efficient when their enzymes and\nsubstrates\nare in the same compartment,\u201d Takayama said. \u201cBut in our experiments, that actually slowed the reaction down. We said, \u2018Whoa, what\u2019s going on here?\u2019\u201d\n\u201cWhen the substrate is in the same place where the product of the reaction also builds up, the enzyme sometimes gets confused, and that can impede the reaction,\u201d said\u00a0Kojima, who is a postdoctoral researcher in Takayama\u2019s lab. \u201cI was pretty surprised to see it.\u201d\nKojima put the enzymes and substrate into separate solutions, which interfaced but did not merge to a single solution, and the reaction in his synthetic organelle worked efficiently. This showed how unexpected subtleties may be fine-tuning organelle chemistry.\n\u201cIt was a Goldilocks regime, not too much contact between substrate and enzyme, not too little, just right,\u201d Takayama said.\n\u201cSometimes, in a cell, a substrate is not abundant and may need to be concentrated in its own little compartment and then brought into contact with the enzyme,\u201d Takayama said. \u201cBy contrast, some substrates can be very abundant in the nucleus, and it might be important to partition them off from enzymes to get just enough contact for the right kind of reaction.\u201d\nLike this article?\u00a0 Get our email newsletter here.\nAlso read:\nBuzzing Cancer Drugs into Malignancies in the Brain\nThe research was funded by the National Institutes of Health\u2019s National Institute of General Medical Science (grant R01 GM12351) and by the National Science Foundation (grant CBET 0939511).
