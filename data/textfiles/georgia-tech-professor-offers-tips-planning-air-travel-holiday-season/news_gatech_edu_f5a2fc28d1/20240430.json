Most significantly, airlines are now focused on realigning their workforce. During the pandemic, many airlines laid off flight crews, and ramping back up to meet increasing demand is not a quick or simple process. This process includes meeting\u00a0regulatory requirements in place to get pilots ready to operate aircraft and get back on flight schedules. Garrow urges travelers to plan their trips early, noting that \u201cairlines are working hard to meet demand.\u201d\nAirlines continue to see the impacts of Covid-19.\nCovid-19 has greatly affected the way consumers plan for travel. \u201cBefore the pandemic, scheduling was slightly more predictable, with most people booking flights four to six weeks in advance,\u201d\u00a0Garrow explained.\u00a0\u201cTravelers are now booking flights much closer to their departure date to account for travel restrictions and monitoring Covid-19 trends.\u201d This gives airlines less time to plan and\u00a0react to unexpected demand patterns. Demand uncertainty makes it difficult for carriers to align their supply chain and can lead to an increase in flight cancellations.\nTips for travelers this season: expect higher fares and plan your flights early.\nLabor shortages and staffing issues can also affect travel this season \u2014 particularly the day-of experiences. Many airports have closed their long-term parking lots, car rentals are much more limited and expensive, and TSA wait times will likely be longer during this holiday season. It is important that consumers plan ahead and arrive at the airport early.\nProfessor Laurie Garrow is co-director of the Center for Urban and Regional Air Mobility at Georgia Tech.\u00a0She is an expert in aviation, travel behavior, data analytics, and discrete choice modeling.\u00a0In Fall 2020, she was elected to a second term as president of the Airline Group of the International Federation of Operational Research Societies.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nAyana Isles\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nMedia Relations\u00a0Representative\u00a0 aisles3@gatech.edu\nEmail\naisles3@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
