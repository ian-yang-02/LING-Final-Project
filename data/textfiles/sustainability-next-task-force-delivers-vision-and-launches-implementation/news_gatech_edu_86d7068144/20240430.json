Following the completion of Georgia Tech\u2019s strategic plan, the Institute\u2019s executive leadership team formed the Sustainability Next Task Force and charged it with proposing an implementation roadmap for sustainability at Georgia Tech over the next 10 years that emphasizes coordination across the research, education, operations, and economic development activities of the Institute.\nFor more than 30 years, Georgia Tech has promoted sustainability initiatives ranging from teaching sustainability principles in the classroom, to building one-of-a-kind campus facilities to meet environmental and energy standards, to conducting groundbreaking research. What\u2019s different about the Sustainability Next Plan is that it presents a newly unified vision for coalescing, implementing, and measuring cross-cutting sustainability initiatives at Tech. It will also serve to advance key strategic goals of the\nstrategic plan , including amplify impact, connect globally, and lead by example.\n\u201cThe plan leverages our diverse and unique strengths to address the most challenging problems of our time,\u201d said Georgia Tech President \u00c1ngel Cabrera. \u201cIt draws a campuswide consensus around well-defined steps that, in addition to moving our campus operations further toward sustainability, will equip students with the skills to recognize and solve sustainability challenges in their careers, and support research that will establish Georgia Tech as a global leader in the development of innovative solutions for a sustainable future.\u201d\nKey Priorities of the Institute Sustainability Plan\nThe \u00a0Sustainability Next Plan features six key priorities that touch nearly every aspect of the Institute, each with specific objectives and strategies for implementation.\nInstitute Operations\nEducation for Sustainable Development\nLeading Sustainability Research\nCulture and Organization\nClimate Solutions\nLiving Learning Campus\nThe projects launching in the 2022 \u2013 23 academic year include:\nClimate action plan\nLiving learning campus initiative\nInterdisciplinary graduate degree scoping and instructional design\nSeed funding programs for cross-disciplinary climate research and teaching with the U.N.

Their shared governance will be strengthened through an Institute sustainability governance project steered by Strategic Consulting.\nAbout Sustainability Next\nThe\nSustainability Next Plan\nis\u00a0a mission-critical deliverable\u00a0of the\nSustainability Next Task Force . For more than six months, the task force conducted an exhaustive review of sustainability data gathered from campus programs, units, and partners.\u00a0The task force also hosted several town halls for students, faculty, and staff and met one-on-one with leaders representing nearly all facets of campus operations\u00a0to synthesize recommendations that make up the objectives and strategies of the plan.\u00a0Overall, the process involved engaging with\u00a0more than 200 key stakeholders and coordinating across all 20 Georgia Tech strategic plan\u00a0 implementation teams , with a particular emphasis on Research Next; Institute Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion; Anchor Institution; Comprehensive Campus Plan; and International Education.\n\u201cThe most exciting thing about this plan is that it is so cross-cutting,\u201d said Anne Rogers, associate director of the Office of Campus Sustainability and co-chair of the Sustainability Next Task Force. \u201cSustainability is inherently collaborative, and we can only achieve our goals when we have buy-in from across campus stakeholders and departments. We\u2019ve had sustainability plans in the past, but never one that matches the scale or scope of this one. We\u2019re excited about what we can accomplish with this new commitment.\u201d\nClick here\nto explore the Sustainability Next Plan, including its objectives and strategies \u2014 and visit the site frequently as the plan progresses.
