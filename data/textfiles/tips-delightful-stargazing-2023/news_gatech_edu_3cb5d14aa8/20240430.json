Several telescopes will be set up for viewing, or you may bring your own telescope. (Please note that the first Public Night, originally scheduled for Thursday, Feb. 2, from 7 to 9 p.m. on the grounds between the Howey and Mason Buildings, has been canceled due to weather.)\nJim Sowell, principal academic professional and director of the\nGeorgia Tech Observatory , acts as a tour guide for public nights. \u201cA clear evening with some celestial objects visible is as much a delight for me as it is for the visitors,\u201d he said.\nSowell and members of the Georgia Tech Astronomy Club will be available to answer questions. The viewing target for Feb. 2 is a comet that is barely visible with the naked eye, so viewers at Georgia Tech will have to use a telescope. The Public Night is from 7 to 9 p.m., with best viewing of the comet between 9 p.m. and midnight. However, forecasters are calling for heavy rain, so the odds of having the program are extremely low. Visitors to the Georgia Tech Observatory should check for updates on the\nastronomy website .\nOther celestial events to consider in 2023 range from a meteor shower to the \u201cring of fire\u201d solar eclipse.\nWhen to view the planets:\nVenus can be seen in the evening sky beginning in February and then it \u201crules the sky\u201d into July.\nJupiter and Venus will be approximately 0.5 degrees apart on March 1 and 2, appearing close to colliding even though the two are millions of miles apart. March 2 is another Public Night at the Georgia Tech Observatory, so a large crowd is expected.\nJupiter remains visible until mid-March, then returns to the evening sky in autumn.\nMercury will be best seen after sunset during the first half of April.\nMars remains visible until July. It is currently bright but slowly fades during this time.\nSaturn is near the Sun\u2019s direction and returns to the evening sky in late summer.\nThe Perseid Meteor Shower always occurs on Aug. 11. Stargazers need to be away from bright lights to experience this, but no telescope is needed.\nA blue moon\n\u2014\nthe second full moon in a calendar month\n\u2014\noccurs in August.\nA Ring of Fire solar eclipse, when the moon covers the sun\u2019s disk, will occur mid-day on Oct. 14.\n\u201cFrom Georgia Tech we will see a partial solar eclipse where more than 50% of the sun\u2019s disk will be blocked out at the peak,\u201d Sowell said. \u201cYou will need to use eye-safe glasses, like those used for the 2017 eclipse, or use eye-safe telescopes, such as the several we have at the Observatory.\u201d\nUnfortunately, there is no lunar eclipse visible from Atlanta for 2023. \u201cEurope and Asia are getting two nice eclipses this year, so if you want to see them you will have to travel,\u201d Sowell said.\nPublic Nights at the Georgia Tech Observatory are free, but remember to pay for parking if you use a visitor lot.\nAdditional Public Nights will be held this spring on March 2, from 7 to 9 p.m.; March 30, from 8:00 to 10:00 p.m.; and on April 27, from 9 to 11 p.m.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nVictor Rogers\nInstitute Communications\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
