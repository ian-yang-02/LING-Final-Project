Instead of controlling the robot with a tablet or from a distant computer monitor, the human worker can safely stand at the robot\u2019s side to inspect precision, quickly make adjustments to its work, or move out of the way as the robot and human take turns assembling an object. Knowing exactly where and what task a robot will do next can help workers avoid injury. Watch Video Demonstration \u201cThe goal of this research was to get information out of the virtual space inside the computer and into the real physical space that we inhabit,\u201d Ben Amor adds. \u201cAs a result of that, we can increase safety and lead to an intuitive interaction between humans and robots.\u201d The discovery was developed over a four-month period by Ben Amor and\nRasmus Andersen , a visiting Ph.D. student from Aalborg University in Denmark. The team realized that, by combining existing research available at Georgia Tech\u2019s Institute for Robotics & Intelligent Machines (IRIM) with new algorithms, plus personal experience with auto manufacturers, they could make \u201cintention projection\u201d possible. They first perfected algorithms that would allow a robot to detect and track 3D objects, beginning with previous research from Georgia Tech and Aalborg University that was further developed. They next developed a second set of entirely new algorithms that can display information onto a 3D object in a geometrically correct way. Tying these two pieces together allows a robot to perceive an object, then identify where on that object to project information and act, then continuously project that information as the object moves, rotates or adapts. Andersen led the coding. IRIM has contributed previous research to BMW, Daimler AG, and Peugeot. The recent discovery was inspired by what Ben Amor had observed during earlier work with Peugeot in Paris\u00a0and from Andersen's previous work on interaction with mobile robots.\u00a0The group next plans\u00a0to formally publish their research.\u00a0 About the Georgia Tech College of Computing The Georgia Tech College of Computing is a national leader in the creation of real-world computing breakthroughs that drive social and scientific progress. With its graduate program ranked 9th nationally by\nU.S. News and World Report , the College\u2019s unconventional approach to education is expanding the horizons of traditional computer science students through interdisciplinary collaboration and a focus on human-centered solutions.
