Nix, senior project manager at the\u00a0Georgia Manufacturing Extension Partnership (GaMEP), is leading the food manufacturing initiative.\nAug 28, 2017\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nGeorgia is a one of the nation\u2019s leading agriculture states, with the industry contributing about $74.9 billion to the state economy each year.\nA related sector \u2014 food processing \u2014 is a strong and growing component of the Georgia economy, and accounts for $11 billion to $12 billion each year of the state\u2019s gross domestic product. Food processing also employs 69,000 across the state, with 10,000 of those jobs being created since 2010, according to Georgia Power\u2019s 2016 Food Processing Industry Report.\nIt\u2019s that strength in food processing, which comprises the largest segment of Georgia\u2019s manufacturing sector, that led to the Georgia Manufacturing Extension Partnership\u2019s (GaMEP) new initiative focused on those manufacturers\u2019 unique needs.\nGaMEP, a federally funded economic development program at the Georgia Institute of Technology\u2019s Enterprise Innovation Institute, works with manufacturers across Georgia to help them remain viable and economically competitive.\n\u201cFood processing comprises many different products and sizes of manufacturers and it is important to assure their viability and growth,\u201d said GaMEP Director Karen Fite. \u201cThis effort is in recognition of where the growth is occurring in the manufacturing sector and we want to make sure we\u2019re applying our resources and expertise, as well as cutting edge research coming out of Georgia Tech, that can help our manufacturers.\u201d\nDamon C. Nix, GaMEP\u2019s senior project manager, is leading the food manufacturing programming, which includes coaching, analysis, and consulting in:\nFood Safety\nCompliance with the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s (FDA) new Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) requirements.\nManagement system implementation and audit team support.\nEnergy Management\nEnergy assessments to identify cost reduction and performance improvement opportunities.\nCompanies with fewer than 500 employees at a plant site may qualify for a free energy assessment through Georgia Tech\u2019s Industrial Assessment Center program.\nEnvironmental Services\nEnvironmental compliance services and management system (ISO 14001) support.\nEnvironmental Protection Agency P2 grant-funded projects that support pollution prevention through reduced greenhouse gas emissions, water usage, and hazardous materials generation.\nWorker Safety and Health\nImplement lean/process improvement approaches to safety problem solving.\nPartner with the Georgia Tech Research Institute\u2019s Food Processing Technology Division to support Occupational Safety and Health Administration rules compliance, applied research, and technology solutions.\nWorkforce Development\nOperational Leader and Frontline Supervisor Training.\n\u201cGeorgia\u2019s food processing GDP ranks it sixth in the country and we rank sixth in employment,\u201d Nix said, noting the state has roughly 680 food processing manufacturers, including the 127 that either relocated to Georgia or built new facilities here since 2010.\n\u201cThe GaMEP has created significant results serving manufacturers overall,\u201d Nix said. \u201cWe want to continue that momentum in food processing. Georgia\u2019s manufacturing industry remains competitive and continues to grow because the food processing industry is expanding. We want food processors to know that the GaMEP is a resource to support their continued growth.\u201d\nAbout the Georgia Manufacturing Extension Partnership (GaMEP):\nThe Georgia Manufacturing Extension Partnership (GaMEP) is an economic development program of the Enterprise Innovation Institute at the Georgia Institute of Technology.
