He was born and grew up in Accra, Ghana, where he studied electrical construction at Royal Technical College. He worked in the printing industry for 16 years, making notebooks and ledgers, before coming to Georgia Tech in 2007.\n\u201cMy cousin introduced me to Georgia Tech when I came from Ghana, looking for a new life in America,\u201d Osekre said. He joined his mother, three brothers, and three sisters who had already relocated to Atlanta.\nIn 2020, the coronavirus brought the implementation of new safety precautions for Osekre\u2019s work as a custodian on campus.\n\u201cMy job, specifically, includes cleaning carpets, shining floors, deep cleaning the restrooms, and cleaning and misting public areas to keep people safe. I always want to keep people safe. We always put on masks and gloves,\u201d he said.\nDuring his years at Tech, Osekre has worked in a number of buildings and made friends all over campus. He met Susanna Printz, director of Research and Prospect Management in the Office of Development, when he worked in the Wardlaw Center.\n\u201cSeth has a wonderful smile, a hearty laugh, and a great personality,\u201d said Printz. \u201cI looked forward to saying hello when he made his afternoon rounds. He and I are soccer fans, so we would compare notes on the teams and players. He\u2019s such an interesting person.\u201d\nOsekre\u2019s favorite part of working at Georgia Tech is the people.\n\u201cI like the atmosphere,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are good people here at Georgia Tech. If you need something, people will help you and direct you to resources.\u201d\nOsekre is Muslim, a table tennis enthusiast, and he played amateur soccer with the Accra Hearts of Oak. He watches American soccer, but he has not attended an Atlanta United game. He also likes watching the news to stay on top of current events, and he\u2019s a big fan of action films and Bollywood movies.\n\u201cArnold Schwarzenegger is my favorite. And I like Samuel L. Jackson and Morgan Freeman,\u201d he said.\nHe likes the dancing in Bollywood. When asked if he can dance like they do in the movies, Osekre laughed and said, \u201cI can dance, but it\u2019s different from that.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nRead More Staff Stories\nContact\nVictor Rogers\nInstitute Communications\nEmail\nvictor.rogers@comm.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
