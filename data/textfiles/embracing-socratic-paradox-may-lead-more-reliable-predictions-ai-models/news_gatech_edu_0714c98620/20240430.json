Quantifying uncertainty will allow a model to say, \u2018I don't know,\u2019 when facing unknown or unexpected situations,\u201d said\u00a0 B. \u00a0 Aditya \u00a0 Prakash , CSE associate professor and co-principal investigator for the project.\nBecause it doesn\u2019t recognize what it doesn\u2019t know, a current model may guess at answers and move forward as if it has guessed correctly. This is particularly problematic with time-series data \u2013 like public health monitoring and forecasting \u2013\u00a0where guesses and wrong answers can lead to lower levels of confidence in predictions generated by current-generation models.\nPrakash (left) and\u00a0 Chao \u00a0 Zhang\u00a0 (right), CSE assistant professor and lead PI, are working with co-PI\u00a0 Shuochao \u00a0 Yao \u00a0from George Mason University to address these limitations. Along with quantifying the amount of uncertainty, the team is working to better understand the types and sources of predictive uncertainty.\n\u201cWe need principled models which are flexible enough to model uncertainties from multiple sources in the datasets and also produce accurate predictions,\u201d Zhang said. \u201cQualifying uncertainty will allow us to dynamically select a subset of models that are more reliable, which can improve the efficiency of the system and decisions at run time.\u201d\nBecause so much depends on specific tasks and data, the researchers say it\u2019s difficult to provide accurate estimates of efficiency improvements based on their novel approach. Preliminary results in disease forecasting, however, indicate the team\u2019s new models, algorithms, and techniques can outperform previous state-of-the-art models up to 2.5x in accuracy and 2.4x in reliability.\nThe techniques and tools emerging from this project, formally titled\u00a0 Collaborative Research: Principled Uncertainty Quantification in Deep Learning Models for Time Series Analysis (NSF Award # \u00a0 2106961) , will be open source, and the research findings will be integrated into existing courses, tutorials, and workshops.\nFacebook Research Award\nPrakash and Zhang are taking another tack as well to improve the current state of predictive modeling.\nThe pair recently earned a\u00a0 Facebook 2021 Statistics for Improving Insights, Models, and Decisions \u00a0research award. Their proposal,\u00a0 Non-Parametric Methods for Calibrated Hierarchical Time-series Forecasting , was one of 10 winners recently announced by Facebook Research.\nAccording to the team, nonparametric statistical methods can be very flexible and effective for modeling time-series data when there are many unknowns in a dataset. Generally speaking, this is because nonparametric tools analyze group medians rather than group means. As a result, scientists can better understand outliers and can use them to strengthen.\n\u201cOur goal is to develop principled end-to-end models that incorporate hierarchical constraints and behaviors. We will also incorporate signals from different views such as demographics signals, time-series signals, and mechanistic models, to let them mutually reinforce each other to make the models more accurate, reliable, and robust,\u201d said Zhang.\nOnce the project is complete, the results of the research will be used to improve predictive modeling in healthcare, public health, and a variety of industrial applications.\n\u201cFor example,\u201d said Prakash, \u201cFacebook can use this technique to forecast demands in their data centers in different geographic regions. This will give them lead time to make their infrastructure more robust and efficient.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nContact\nAlbert Snedeker, Communications Manager II albert.snedeker@cc.gatech.edu\nEmail\nalbert.snedeker@cc.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
