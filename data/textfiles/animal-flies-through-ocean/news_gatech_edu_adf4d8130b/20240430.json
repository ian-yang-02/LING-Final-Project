They \"fly\" with wings.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nEmail\nSea butterflies, or Limacina helicina, is a zooplankton snail that lives in cold oceans.\nFeb 18, 2016\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nIt turns out that the sea butterfly ( Limacina helicina ), a zooplankton snail that lives in cold oceans, lives up to its name. Georgia Institute of Technology researchers went to the Pacific Ocean to scoop up hundreds of the 3-millimeter marine mollusks (pteropods) and then used high-speed cameras to watch how they move. They found that sea butterflies don\u2019t paddle like most small water animals. Instead, they\u2019re like flying insects, flapping their wings to produce lift and propel them through the water.\n\u201cSnails evolutionarily diverged from flying insects 550 million years ago,\u201d said\nDonald Webster , a professor in Georgia Tech\u2019s School of Civil and Environmental Engineering. \u201cHence, it is amazing that marine snails are using the same figure-eight wing pattern that is typical of their very distant airborne relatives.\u201d\nAnother amazing similarity between the pteropods and insects is the use of a clap-and-fling wing motion. Each species claps its wings together, then rapidly flings them apart to generate enhanced lift.\n\u201cAlmost all other plankton use their appendages as paddles, kind of like a turtle,\u201d said David Murphy, who led the study and received his Georgia Tech doctoral degree in 2012.\u00a0 \u201cSea butterflies are honorary insects.\u201d\nMurphy is now a postdoctoral fellow at Johns Hopkins University.\nThe team did find one major difference in sea butterflies and flying insects. Nearly two-thirds of the plankton\u2019s body is its shell. When it\u2019s not moving forward, it sinks to the ocean floor. To avoid sinking, the pteropod rotates its body up to 60 degrees with each stroke. The rotation puts its wings in the proper position to flap downward during every half-stroke (about 10 times per second) and move in an upward, zig-zag path in the water.\n\u201cInsects and birds don\u2019t typically rotate their bodies in a similar manner to generate lift,\u201d said Webster. \u201cBy rotating their shell during each stroke, sea butterflies put their wings in a position to always generate upward thrust and fly forward.\u201d\nThe researchers study the plankton for two reasons. First, they play a vital role in the food web in the Pacific, Arctic and Southern Oceans. Fish, seals and sea birds eat them in massive quantities. Second, absorption of carbon dioxide increases the acidity of the oceans. As carbon dioxide levels increase in the future, so will seawater acidity, which breaks down the shells of pteropods. The Georgia Tech team wanted to better understand how they moved. The next steps in the research are seeing how changes in both shell composition and fluid viscosity affect its ability to rotate its body and \u201cfly\u201d upward.\nCivil Engineering Postdoctoral Fellow Deepak Adhikari and School of Biology Professor Jeannette Yen also co-authored the research paper.\nThey both traveled to Antarctica\nin 2014, in part, to study pteropods, which grow as large as six millimeters in the frigid Southern Ocean.\nIn addition to better understanding the biomechanics of the animal\u2019s movement, the team thinks their findings could someday help engineers build miniature autonomous robots that swim in the ocean.\nThe study, \u201cUnderwater flight by the planktonic sea butterfly,\u201d is published in the current issue of the\nJournal of Experimental Biology .\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nRead the study\nSchool of Civil and Environmental Engineering\nRead the Full Feature Story\nContact\nJason Maderer\nNational Media Relations\n404-660-2926 maderer@gatech.edu\nEmail\nmaderer@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
