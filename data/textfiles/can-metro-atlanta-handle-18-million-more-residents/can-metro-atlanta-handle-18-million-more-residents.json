With the urban core growing, we have an opportunity. to pursue a different kind of urban form that is higher density and more walkable. A lot of the recent growth in Atlanta is adding density without necessarily improving the quality of urbanism.\u201d\nHe explains that, especially in downtown Atlanta, retrofitting existing properties will play a key role in transforming neighborhoods through the replacement of \"lower-value infrastructure,\" such as surface parking lots, with higher-density housing. In a post-pandemic environment, the conversion of office space to mixed-use properties is emerging as a strategy in urban areas\nlike Atlanta .\nA 2023 report\nidentified the need for 391,878 housing units\nwithin the five-county core at the current population level.\nMike Dobbins , professor of the practice in the School of City and Regional Planning, credits efforts made by the mayor's office and nonprofit organizations such as the\nUrban Land Institute\nto increase availability.\n\"We're living in a situation where housing values are too high because big money investors are bidding up real estate prices throughout the region. Even nationally, it's double the rate of wage increases. The biggest question is how can we bring down housing costs,\u201d he said.\nRandolph and Dobbins agree that addressing Atlanta\u2019s housing needs is more complicated than simply adding supply.\n\u201cOur priority must be building housing that is affordable to low- and middle-income households, and in a way that promotes mixed-income, walkable neighborhoods with equitable, car-free access to amenities like parks, schools, and community-serving retail,\u201d Randolph said.\nLabor\nAlong with population growth, the region will add an estimated 856,000 jobs, with significant gains in healthcare, technology, and waste management. To maintain a labor force that can fill the jobs of the future, Dobbins stresses that continued investment in K-12 education, especially in traditionally underserved communities, is vital to accommodate new growth and overcome existing challenges of inequity.\nAtlanta has the highest income inequality in the nation. According to\nthe Atlanta Wealth Building Initiative , the average white family\u2019s median income is $83,722 compared to $28,105 for Black families and $43,110 for Latino families. That gap widens when examining wealth, which for white households is\n46 times higher than that of Black households in Atlanta .\nThe ARC study notes that \"virtually all the net growth will come from racial and ethnic minority groups.\u201d Randolph points to policy as a necessary tool in improving workforce development for current and future residents to support equitable and inclusive growth across the region. He adds that institutions like Georgia Tech can play a role in expanding access to the advanced degrees often needed to fill the jobs created by the city\u2019s emerging status as a technology hub, with an emphasis on ensuring access to these degrees among historically disadvantaged groups in the city.\nTransportation\nThe other 900,000 projected new residents will reside among the remaining 16 counties in the Atlanta region. The ARC predicts the most rapid growth in Forsyth, Barrow, Paulding, Cherokee, Walton, and Coweta, and the need for affordable housing will extend to the surrounding counties, as will the need to travel throughout the region.\nRyan Gravel , the Georgia Tech alumnus and mind behind the Atlanta BeltLine, says transit improvements are needed to ensure each county is connected to Atlanta\u2019s city center.\n\u201cWe haven't made a substantial new transit investment since 2000,\u201d he said. \u201cMeanwhile, the region has grown substantially since then. We haven't been laying the foundation for that future growth, which means it will come in ways that we don't want: more traffic, more congestion, and more inequities in communities of color.\u201d\nGravel, founder of the consulting firm Sixpitch, rejects adding lanes to existing highways, saying that strategic improvements to MARTA \u2014 the rail system constructed in 1979 \u2014 will reduce traffic while allowing residents to live outside of the five-county core.\n\u201cAs the saying goes, the best time to plant a tree is 20 years ago,\u201d he said. \u201cThe second-best time is now. We didn\u2019t do it 20 years ago, but we could start now.\u201d\nIn his 2024 State of the City address, Dickens announced plans to construct a new MARTA rail station on the Southside at the Murphy Crossing redevelopment project site, connecting the system to Beltline for the first time. The mayor revealed preliminary plans to add three infill MARTA stations throughout the city, however, specific locations were not announced.\nPlans to add a portion of the light-rail system around the BetlLine are currently under review, with construction on the Streetcar East expansion project \u2014 extending Atlanta Streetcar service from downtown Atlanta to Ponce de Leon Avenue \u2014 projected to begin construction in 2025 and begin service in 2029. In 2025, the\nMARTA Rapid Summerhill project\nwill begin service from downtown to Capitol Gateway, Summerhill, Peoplestown, and the BeltLine through dedicated bus lanes with transit signal priority to bypass traffic.\nA \u201cBeloved Community\u201d\nThe Atlanta region\u2019s transformation will not happen overnight, but anchor institutions like Georgia Tech can contribute along the way. Randolph sees current plans to revitalize portions of the city\u2019s Westside as an example of how neighborhoods can be revitalized for current residents while simultaneously building with future growth in mind.\n\u201cIt\u2019s important that we continue to play a positive role in not just physically developing the Westside but also thinking about how we can strengthen the economy of Westside neighborhoods through our own procurement and purchasing practices. It's an example of how Georgia Tech, as an engine of economic development, can play a positive role in propelling that growth while ensuring that the growth is inclusive.\u201d Randolph said.\nThe solutions to the ARC\u2019s projected growth will not be cheap or easily attained, but as Gravel points out, it\u2019s an opportunity for Atlanta to honor its past as it marches toward its future, aspiring to Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s idea of the beloved community.\n\u201cThe prosperity of the metropolitan region stands on the shoulders of the Civil Rights Movement,\u201d he said. \u201cIf that's who we are when we're at our best, then we should use that as a model for how we move forward. How we accommodate that future change should be based on decisions to ensure that this place is a place for everyone.\u201d\nContact\nSteven Gagliano\n- Institute Communications\nEmail\nSteven.gagliano@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
