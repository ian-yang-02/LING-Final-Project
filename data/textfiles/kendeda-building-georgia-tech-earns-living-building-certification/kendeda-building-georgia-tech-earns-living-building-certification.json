The certification from the International Living Future Institute independently verifies that The Kendeda Building is among the greenest in the world.\n\u201cWe feel a responsibility to lead by example,\u201d said \u00c1ngel Cabrera, president of Georgia Tech where The Kendeda Building is located. \u201cThis building \u2014 which is a tribute to the power of human ingenuity to find new solutions to our greatest challenges \u2014 aligns with our longstanding vision for our campus to serve as a laboratory for innovation to inspire and develop tomorrow\u2019s leaders who advance technology and improve the human condition.\u201d\nThe Living Building Challenge (version 3.1) requires a 12-month performance period, during which time the project must prove it is net-positive for energy and water. This means it must generate more energy from onsite renewable sources than it uses, and also collect and treat more rainwater onsite than it uses for all purposes, including for drinking.\nMeeting all seven Petals in the Living Building Challenge \u2014 Place, Water, Energy, Health + Happiness, Materials, Equity, and Beauty \u2014 The Kendeda Building is the first Living Building Challenge-certified building of its scale in the southeastern U.S., where a warm humid climate poses many challenges. In spite of this, over the performance period, the building generated 225% of the energy needed to power all of its electrical systems from solar panels on its roof. It also collected, treated, and infiltrated 15 times the amount of water needed for building functions.\n\u201cWe partnered with Georgia Tech on this transformational project because the institution is full of world-class problem-solvers. Students passing through The Kendeda Building today will be the engineers, architects, scientists, product designers, urban planners, and policymakers of tomorrow,\u201d said Diana Blank, the founder of The Kendeda Fund, whose $30 million grant to Georgia Tech made the building possible. \u201cBy raising the bar for building performance, we are encouraging Georgia Tech to keep reaching higher. We want students and faculty to embrace the challenge, continually asking \u2018How can we improve on this?\u2019\u201d\nThe project\u2019s goal is to support Georgia Tech\u2019s mission while transforming the architecture, engineering, and construction industries in the southeastern U.S. by advancing regenerative building and innovation, and by showcasing synergies between environmental stewardship, social equity, and economic development.\nTo ensure Living Building Challenge certification by fulfilling the requirements in the Petals performance categories, the Kendeda Building\u2019s performance metrics incorporated the following:\nThe energy-efficient electrical and mechanical equipment and tight building envelope, with a 330-kilowatt photovoltaic canopy supplies 225% of the building\u2019s energy needs on an annual basis.\nThe photovoltaic canopy shades the building and captures rainwater. The water is stored in a 50,000-gallon cistern in the basement before being treated and used for all purposes, including drinking.\nThe building is composed of materials screened to ensure the absence of hazardous \u201cRed List\u201d chemicals, such as bisphenol A (BPA), halogenated flame retardants, phthalates, and formaldehyde. Chemicals on the Red List have been shown to harm human and environmental health, even though they are common in most buildings.\nWood from sustainably managed forests, salvaged materials, and other sourcing strategies significantly reduce the building\u2019s embodied carbon emissions.\nBy eliminating 99% of its construction waste and incorporating reclaimed, locally sourced materials such as reclaimed wood for the structural decking and salvaged slate tile in the restrooms, the project diverted more waste from the landfill than it sent to the landfill.\nComposting toilets nearly eliminate potable water use for sewage conveyance and allow for human waste to be turned into fertilizer for use offsite.\nThe building allows for universal access. Its central feature is an accessible ramp connecting the terraced main floor so that everyone has a similar experience throughout the building.\nThe design and construction team went above and beyond the Living Building Challenge Equity Petal by promoting an equitable and inclusive sense of community. To build the ceiling panels and floor systems, for example, the general contractor partnered with\nGeorgia Works! , a nonprofit helping chronically homeless men become self-sufficient.\n\u201cLiving buildings are the future,\u201d said Scott Cannon, executive vice president and general manager of building operations in Georgia and South Carolina for Skanska, the general contractor. \u201cWe\u2019ve been committed to sustainability for years and have seen how projects like this are a catalyst to reshape how people think about the built environment. It illustrates the practical and replicable solutions, materials, and technologies that other buildings in the Southeast can use to meet similar environmental standards.\u201d\nIn a region challenged by flooding and drought, The Kendeda Building also shows that regenerative design can treat stormwater, conserve potable water, lower the risk of downstream flooding, reduce the burden on existing infrastructure, and save money on utilities.\n\u201cIf there was any doubt, we have shown that net-positive energy and net-positive water are both within reach in Atlanta and across the Southeast,\u201d said Joshua Gassman of Lord Aeck Sargent, one of the lead architects on the project. \u201cUsing analytics and sound building science, we were able to provide comfort to the building\u2019s occupants, connect them to nature and the history of the place, and live within the water and energy means of the site. We were able to do all of this while creating a clear and sustainable vision for the future.\u201d\nAt $544 per gross square foot, The Kendeda Building is 13% more expensive than a comparable building at Georgia Tech. However, in reality, there are few comparable buildings of this type that include the infrastructure for net-positive energy and water in the construction cost.\n\"We took the lessons we learned from the Bullitt Center and adapted those ideas for a new climate and new building type,\" said Margaret Sprug, principal at The Miller Hull Partnership, which designed the building in collaboration with Lord Aeck Sargent and served as the lead architect of the Bullitt Center, another well-known living building. \u201cThe Kendeda Building serves as an inspiration and gathering place for people from around the region who are advancing sustainability and regenerative design.\u201d\nThe knowledge and processes used with The Kendeda Building are already being transferred to other projects. Thousands of people have toured the project, the entire design and construction team has learned deep sustainability lessons throughout the life of the project, and the students and administrators who inhabit the building on a daily basis will all take these lessons out into the world and apply them to their future projects.\nThe Kendeda Building\u2019s achievement is being celebrated at Living Future \u201821, a virtual gathering of the world\u2019s leading architects, contractors, and product designers.\nFor more about The Kendeda Building, visit\nlivingbuilding.gatech.edu\nand\nlivingbuilding.kendedafund.org .\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nThe Georgia Institute of Technology, or Georgia Tech, is a top 10 public research university developing leaders who advance technology and improve the human condition.
