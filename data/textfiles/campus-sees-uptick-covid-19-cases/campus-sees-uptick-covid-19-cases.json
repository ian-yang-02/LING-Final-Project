Dr. Ben Holton, senior director of Stamps Health Services, indicates a few reasons why that may be.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nEmail\nStudents Julianne Coughlin and Adam Davis and teaching assistant Yousef Bushesri take preventive measures while working in the Architecture Building.\nOct 22, 2020\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nSince returning to campus in August, the Georgia Tech community has shown a commitment to public health recommendations to slow the spread of the coronavirus \u2014 regular testing, mask wearing, and social distancing among them. As the weather turns cooler and flu season begins, now is not the time to let up on those preventive measures.\nCases of Covid-19 have risen slightly in the past week, both on campus and in the greater community. Dr. Ben Holton, senior director of Stamps Health Services, indicates a few reasons why that may be.\n\u201cThe pattern we\u2019re seeing as we do contact tracing is that people seem to have others in their friend group \u2014 roommates, suitemates, or close friends \u2014\u00a0who are also testing positive,\u201d Holton said. \u201cTransmission seems to be occurring in smaller friend groups as opposed to large gatherings or random exposures.\u201d\nWith the weather turning cooler, people are spending more time indoors, and some may be less diligent about measures such as mask wearing and social distancing in comfortable settings.\n\u201cEven with small friend groups, you need to wear masks when around others and maintain social distance,\u201d Holton said.\nWhen spending time indoors, Holton recommends finding larger spaces with good ventilation where you can spread out and make sure there is appropriate physical distancing. Activities that require a lot of talking or singing are higher risk \u2014 as are places where people may have to speak more loudly or be closer to one another to hear each other, such as in a restaurant.\nTransmission can also be prevented by limiting interactions in the community in high risk settings, such as in bars, restaurants, and large gatherings. Holton indicated that Georgia Tech may be seen as a bubble, but it\u2019s a porous bubble. Students, faculty, and staff also live and interact off campus.\nPrevention After Infection\nAdditionally, Holton said they are seeing some people who have had Covid-19 no longer taking precautions. Even if they may not be at risk for reinfection right away, taking precautions for those around them is still important.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t help the community effort to see people not wearing masks, not distancing,\u201d Holton said.\nFor those who have tested positive for Covid-19 and since recovered, the current Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommendation is that they not be retested for three months following the initial infection if they remain asymptomatic. Should they develop new symptoms, though, they should seek care and be retested. And, after three months, they should begin testing again at Tech\u2019s\nasymptomatic surveillance testing sites .\nPreparing for the Flu\nAs Covid-19 cases rise, flu season is also setting in. Two more large flu clinics will take place next week, Oct. 28 and 29,\nfrom 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. at McCamish Pavilion . All students, faculty, and staff are invited to stop in to get their flu shot.\nAside from receiving a flu shot, prevention for the flu and Covid-19 is similar: maintain distance from others, wash your hands, wear a mask to prevent transmission, and don\u2019t go out if you don\u2019t feel well.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t distinguish a cold or flu from Covid-19,\u201d Holton said. Students with any kind of symptoms should seek care and\nget tested\nfor Covid-19 at Stamps Health Services. Those without symptoms should\ncontinue weekly asymptomatic surveillance testing\nat locations across campus.\nFor more information about prevention, the CDC offers guidelines for both\nCovid-19\nand\nseasonal flu .\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nStamps Health Services: Coronavirus Testing\nStamps Health Services: Flu\nContact\nKristen Bailey\nInstitute Communications\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
