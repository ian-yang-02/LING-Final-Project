The camp is sponsored by the Micron Foundation and is designed to \u201cpique students' curiosity and challenge their minds through hands-on STEM and semiconductor activities.\u201d\nThe day began at the\nInstitute for Electronics and Nanotechnology\n(IEN), where students learned about ferrofluids, thin films, magic sand, measuring their height in nanometers, and the size and scale of the universe. They also visited the\nMaterials Characterization Facility\nfor an introduction to characterization and demonstrations of some of its tools, including the digital optical microscope and atomic force microscope. The IEN portion of the day concluded with a window tour of the IEN cleanroom and an opportunity to gown up in \u201cbunny suits,\u201d the standard uniform worn by cleanroom users.\n\u201cWe\u2019re committed to developing the pipeline of the future microelectronics workforce,\u201d said Mikkel Thomas, assistant director of workforce development at IEN. \u201cThis includes K-12 students who may not know what microelectronics are, or the career paths associated with them. We were glad to host part of Chip Camp and introduce these students to IEN.\u201d\nFollowing a lunch break, campers visited the\nInvention Studio makerspace , where they built their own rockets \u2014 and then launched them in Tech Green.\nMicron Chip Camp is a global initiative offering opportunities to students in the U.S. and Asia both in person and online. Micron teamed up with\nSTE(A)M Truck , Atlanta's leader in hands-on STEAM education, for the Georgia session.\nIn addition to hosting students for camps, IEN provides a variety of outreach programs for K-12 and adult learners, which include short courses and seminars, research experiences for undergraduates, and research experiences for teachers.
