What happened next speaks to the sometimes surprising breadth of Tech students\u2019 commitment to problem-solving, collaboration, and community engagement.\nKegley approached a CTL colleague, design assistant Lizzie Turac, ARCH 2023, remembering that Turac had an interest in woodworking and welding. Kegley told her she had a friend who built squirrel homes every year with her husband, \u201cfor the baby squirrels she nursed until they recovered.\u201d Now, though, the rehabilitator\u2019s husband had dementia and could no longer build the homes, even with the plans laid out in front of him. Kegley asked Turac if she could step in and lend her woodworking expertise.\nTurac was also a student assistant in the\nCognitive Empowerment Program\nwithin the SimTigrate Design Lab. \u201cAs part of my role, I work with those diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment on their way to developing dementia, so I felt especially connected to her story, and immediately wanted to help,\u201d she said. \u201cI knew I could help her build houses, but I realized that if I reached out to my peers, I could gather a group of volunteers.\u201d\nAs vice president of undergraduates for the student organization ECO at Georgia Tech, Turac had a receptive audience. Established in 2020, ECO works to bring awareness of responsible material choices to net-zero studio practices that promote environmental wellness within the design community in the School of Architecture and beyond.\nShe asked ECO President\nEmily Mosbaugh \u00a0for permission to advertise and organize a squirrel box-building event through the club. \u201c Everyone who heard the cause felt connected and wanted to help,\u201d Turac said.\nThey found 12 student volunteers, coordinated with the squirrel rehabilitator \u2014 who drove to the Tech campus with blueprints, a supply of wood, and a few baby squirrels \u2014 and spent the day in the\nCollege of Design\u2019s woodworking space.\n\u201cIt really was amazing how, by advertising a call to action through our club, we were able to find so many students willing to sacrifice their Sunday to help this cause,\u201d Turac said.\nThe group plans to build more squirrel homes this summer, inspired by the work and the story behind it. For Turac, it\u2019s been meaningful on many levels. \u201cI am a very people-motivated person, and I\u2019m always happy to unite people to work together,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s the community of like-minded creative people that made this interaction so special.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nContact\nStacy Braukman \u00a0-\u00a0Senior\u00a0Writer and\u00a0Editor\nInstitute Communications\nEmail\nstacy.braukman@comm.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
