(The Rotman lens is key for beamforming networks and is frequently used in radar surveillance systems to see targets in multiple directions without physically moving the antenna system.)\nBut to harvest enough power to supply low-power devices at long ranges, large aperture antennas are required. The problem with large antennas is they have a narrowing field of view. This limitation prevents their operation if the antenna is widely dispersed from a 5G base station.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve solved the problem of only being able to look from one direction with a system that has a wide angle of coverage,\u201d said senior researcher Aline Eid in the ATHENA lab, established in Georgia Tech\u2019s\nSchool of Electrical and Computer Engineering\nto advance and develop novel technologies for electromagnetic, wireless, RF, millimeter-wave, and sub-terahertz applications.\nThe findings were reported in the Jan.12 issue of the journal\nScientific Reports .\nThe FCC has authorized 5G to focalize power much more densely compared with\u00a0 previous generations of cellular networks. While today\u2019s 5G was built for high-bandwidth communication, the high-frequency network holds rich opportunity to \u201charvest\u201d unused power that would otherwise be wasted.\nTapping Into 5G High-frequency Power\n\u201cWith this innovation, we can have a large antenna, which works at higher frequencies and can receive power from any direction. It's direction-agnostic, which makes it a lot more practical,\u201d noted Jimmy Hester, senior lab advisor and the CTO and co-founder of Atheraxon, a Georgia Tech spinoff developing 5G radio-frequency identification (RFID) technology.\nWith the Georgia Tech solution, all the electromagnetic energy collected by the antenna arrays from one direction is combined and fed into a single rectifier, which maximizes its efficiency.\n\u201cPeople have attempted to do energy harvesting at high frequencies like 24 or 35 Gigahertz before,\u201d Eid said, but such antennas only worked if they had line of sight to the 5G base station; there was no way to increase their angle of coverage until now.\nOperating just like an optical lens, the Rotman lens provides six fields of view simultaneously in a pattern shaped like a spider. Tuning the shape of the lens results in a structure with one angle of curvature on the beam-port side and another on the antenna side. This enables the structure to map a set of selected radiation directions to an associated set of beam-ports. The lens is then used as an intermediate component between the receiving antennas and the rectifiers for 5G energy harvesting.\nThis novel approach addresses the tradeoff between rectenna angular coverage and turn-on sensitivity with a structure that merges unique radio frequency (RF) and direct current (DC) combination techniques, thereby enabling a system with both high gain and large beamwidth.\nIn demonstrations, Georgia Tech\u2019s technology achieved a 21-fold increase in harvested power compared with a referenced counterpart, while maintaining identical angular coverage.\nThis robust system may open the door for new passive, long-range, mm-wave 5G-powered RFID for wearable and ubiquitous IoT applications. The researchers used inhouse additive manufacturing to print the palm-sized mm-wave harvesters on a multitude of everyday flexible and rigid substrates. Providing 3D and inkjet printing options will make the system more affordable and accessible to a broad range of users, platforms, frequencies, and applications.\nReplacing Batteries With Over-the-air Charging\n\u201cThe fact is 5G is going to be everywhere, especially in urban areas. You can replace millions, or tens of millions, of batteries of wireless sensors, especially for smart city and smart agricultural applications,\u201d said\nEmmanouil (Manos)Tentzeris , Ken Byers Professor in Flexible Electronics in the\nSchool of Electrical and Computer Engineering .\nTentzeris predicts that power as a service will be the next big application for the telecom industry, just as data overtook voice services as a major revenue producer.\nThe research team is most excited by the prospect of service providers embracing this technology to offer power on demand \u201cover the air,\u201d eliminating the need for batteries.\n\u201cI've been working on energy harvesting conventionally for at least six years, and for most of this time it didn't seem like there was a key to make energy harvesting work in the real world, because of FCC limits on power emission and focalization,\u201d Hester said. \u201cWith the advent of 5G networks, this could actually work and we\u2019ve demonstrated it. That\u2019s extremely exciting \u2014 we could get rid of batteries.\u201d\nThis work was supported by the Air Force Research Laboratory and the National Science Foundation (NSF) - Emerging Frontiers in Research and Innovation program.
