In these cases, exposure to light can hinder or even spoil the process.\nIn a\nnew study\npublished in\nCurrent Biology , researchers in Georgia Tech\u2019s\nSchool of Biological Sciences\nhave engineered one of the world\u2019s first strains of yeast that may be happier with the lights on.\n\u201cWe were frankly shocked by how simple it was to turn the yeast into phototrophs (organisms that can harness and use energy from light),\u201d says\nAnthony Burnetti , a research scientist working in Associate Professor\nWilliam Ratcliff \u2019s laboratory and corresponding author of the study. \u201cAll we needed to do was move a single gene, and they grew 2% faster in the light than in the dark. Without any fine-tuning or careful coaxing, it just worked.\u201d\nEasily equipping the yeast with such an evolutionarily important trait could mean big things for our understanding of how this trait originated \u2014 and how it can be used to study things like biofuel production, evolution, and cellular aging.\nLooking for an energy boost\nThe research was inspired by the group\u2019s past work investigating the evolution of multicellular life. The group published their first report on their\nMulticellularity Long-Term Evolution Experiment\n(MuLTEE) in\nNature\nlast year, uncovering how their single-celled model organism, \u201csnowflake yeast,\u201d was able to evolve multicellularity over 3,000 generations.\nThroughout these evolution experiments, one major limitation for multicellular evolution appeared: energy.\n\u201cOxygen has a hard time diffusing deep into tissues, and you get tissues without the ability to get energy as a result,\u201d says Burnetti. \u201cI was looking for ways to get around this oxygen-based energy limitation.\u201d\nOne way to give organisms an energy boost without using oxygen is through light. But the ability to turn light into usable energy can be complicated from an evolutionary standpoint. For example, the molecular machinery that allows plants to use light for energy involves a host of genes and proteins that are hard to synthesize and transfer to other organisms \u2014 both in the lab and naturally through evolution.\nLuckily, plants are not the only organisms that can convert light to energy.\nKeeping it simple\nA simpler way for organisms to use light is with rhodopsins: proteins that can convert light into energy without additional cellular machinery.\n\u201cRhodopsins are found all over the tree of life and apparently are acquired by organisms obtaining genes from each other over evolutionary time,\u201d says\nAutumn Peterson , a biology Ph.D. student working with Ratcliff and lead author of the study.\nThis type of genetic exchange is called horizontal gene transfer and involves sharing genetic information between organisms that aren\u2019t closely related. Horizontal gene transfer can cause seemingly big evolutionary jumps in a short time, like how bacteria are quickly able to develop resistance to certain antibiotics. This can happen with all kinds of genetic information and is particularly common with rhodopsin proteins.\n\u201cIn the process of figuring out a way to get rhodopsins into multi-celled yeast,\u201d explains Burnetti, \u201cwe found we could learn about horizontal transfer of rhodopsins that has occurred across evolution in the past by transferring it into regular, single-celled yeast where it has never been before.\u201d\nTo see if they could outfit a single-celled organism with solar-powered rhodopsin, researchers added a rhodopsin gene synthesized from a parasitic fungus to common baker\u2019s yeast. This specific gene is coded for a form of rhodopsin that would be inserted into the cell\u2019s vacuole, a part of the cell that, like mitochondria, can turn chemical gradients made by proteins like rhodopsin into energy.\nEquipped with vacuolar rhodopsin, the yeast grew roughly 2% faster when lit \u2014 a huge benefit in terms of evolution.\n\u201cHere we have a single gene, and we're just yanking it across contexts into a lineage that's never been a phototroph before, and it just works,\u201d says Burnetti. \u201cThis says that it really is that easy for this kind of a system, at least sometimes, to do its job in a new organism.\u201d\nThis simplicity provides key evolutionary insights and says a lot about \u201cthe ease with which rhodopsins have been able to spread across so many lineages and why that may be so,\u201d explains Peterson, who Peterson\nrecently received\na Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) Gilliam Fellowship for her work.\nCarina Baskett , grant writer for Georgia Tech\u2019s\nCenter for Microbial Dynamics and Infection , also worked on the study.\nBecause vacuolar function may contribute to cellular aging, the group has also initiated collaborations to study how rhodopsins may be able to reduce aging effects in the yeast. Other researchers are already starting to use similar new, solar-powered yeast to study advancing bioproduction, which could mark big improvements for things like synthesizing biofuels.\nRatcliff and his group, however, are mostly keen to explore how this added benefit could impact the single-celled yeast\u2019s journey to a multicellular organism.\n\u201cWe have this beautiful model system of simple multicellularity,\u201d says Burnetti, referring to the long-running\nMulticellularity Long-Term Evolution Experiment (MuLTEE) . \u201cWe want to give it phototrophy and see how it changes its evolution.\u201d\nCitation:\nPeterson et al., 2024, Current Biology 34, 1\u20137.\nDOI:\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2023.12.044\nAdditional Media\nRelated links\nA Journey to the Origins of Multicellular Life: Long-Term Experimental Evolutio\u2026\nGraduate Student and Advisor Pair Awarded HHMI Gilliam Fellowship\nSciences Scholars Named University Center of Exemplary Mentoring Program Fellows\nContact\nAudra Davidson\nCommunications Officer II, College of Sciences\ndavidson.audra@gatech.edu\nEmail\ndavidson.audra@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
