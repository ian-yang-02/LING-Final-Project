One spiral wave creates tachycardia \u2014 a heart rate that\u2019s too fast \u2014 and multiple spirals cause a state of disorganized contraction known as fibrillation. Researchers from the Georgia Institute of Technology offer a new method to disrupt spiral waves that uses less energy and that may be less painful than traditional defibrillation.\nThis research has been ongoing in\nSchool of Physics\nProfessor\nFlavio Fenton\u2019s\nlab with his student Noah DeTal and research scientist Abouzar Kaboudian. Their latest findings are published in the paper, \u201c Terminating Spiral Waves with a Single Designed Stimulus: Teleportation as the Mechanism for Defibrillation,\u201d\nin the journal\nProceedings of the National Academy of Science .\nThe Problem with Spiral Waves\nElectrical waves enable the heart to contract and send blood throughout the body. When a wave becomes a spiral, its rotation is faster than the heart\u2019s natural pacemaker and suppresses normal cardiac function. Instead, one spiral wave can spawn more spirals until the heart is overtaken by multiple spiral waves, leading to disorganized contraction, and preventing the heart from supplying the body with blood.\nFor years, scientists and doctors have worked to find the best way to stop spiral waves before they get out of control. Yet for over half a century the best method has been a single strong electric shock. The 300 joules of energy required for defibrillation excites not just the heart cells, but the entire body, making it very painful for the patient.\nOver the years researchers have experimented with using weaker shocks to reorganize arrythmias.\n\u201cWe still did not have a clear understanding of how defibrillation worked,\u201d said Fenton. \u201cThis research explains the minimum energy required to actually terminate an arrhythmia and I believe it clarifies the mechanism for defibrillation.\u201d\nThe Symmetrical Solution\nThe researchers determined that because spiral waves develop in pairs, they must also be terminated in pairs. Every spiral wave is connected to another spiral going in the opposite direction. Bringing the spiral waves together through an electric shock instantly eliminates both waves.\nThe researchers used a mathematical method to identify the key regions for electrical shock stimulation to target spiral waves. They determined that a stimulus delivered to the tissue areas a spiral wave just left and were able sustain a new wave could defibrillate the heart.\nIn the process of terminating the spiral waves, the researchers were actually moving them, as well, through a concept they named \u201cteleportation.\u201d\n\u201cWe call it teleportation because it\u2019s very similar to what you see in science fiction where something is moved instantaneously from one place to another,\u201d Fenton said.\nSpiral waves can be teleported anywhere in the heart using this approach. In particular, spiral waves can be moved so that they collide with their partners, which extinguishes them. Fenton explained that for successful defibrillation to occur, all pairs of spiral waves must be eliminated in this manner.\nThe researchers plan to further test this concept using two-dimensional cultures of heart cells.\n\u201cThe next step is to is to prove experimentally that what we did numerically is possible,\u201d Fenton said.\nEventually, Fenton added, they want to develop methods that could be used clinically, and are partnering with cardiologists at Emory University on this work.\ndoi:\u00a0 https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2117568119\nContact\nTess Malone, Research Writer/Editor\nEmail\ntess.malone@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
