It also includes Coffee County, which is not on the coast, but was also severely impacted by flooding during 2017\u2019s Hurricane Irma.\nThe counties are home to 408 manufacturing facilities that employ 23,000.\nThe MDAP creation follows a devastating 2017 hurricane season in which Hurricane Irma led to a mandatory evacuation of the coast\u2019s nearly 540,000 residents and business owners, and resulted in estimated damages of more than $670 million. That\u2019s on top of a 2016 evacuation of the Georgia coast following Hurricane Matthew, which caused more than $500 million in damages.\nThe goal with this tailored approach to help manufacturers on the Georgia Coast is two-pronged, said Ben Cheeks, GaMEP\u2019s coastal region manager.\n\u201cFirst, we want to assist as many manufacturers as possible and get them operating at pre-Hurricane Irma levels \u2014 that includes employment and fully contributing to the regional and state economies,\u201d Cheeks said. \u201cThe second part of this effort is to help them develop plans that they will already have in place to address future hurricanes and other natural disasters so they will positioned for as little disruption as possible in resuming operations.\u201d\nAs part of the offering, GaMEP will leverage its expertise and resources at Georgia Tech, as well as its local, state, and federal economic development partners, including the Technical College System of Georgia and the MEP network, among other organizations, Cheeks said. Pooling resources at all levels ensures maximum impact for the affected companies and communities, he added.\nThe MDAP initiative will include assessments of the manufacturers\u2019 needs, helping prioritize opportunities for sustainability and growth. It also will incorporate the development of pre and post-natural disaster protocols that address challenges manufacturers will face following hurricanes and other natural disasters, such as supply chain and infrastructure disruption, labor displacement, and financial constraints.\n\u201cWe\u2019re taking a 360-degree approach with this effort,\u201d Cheeks said. \u201cIt\u2019s designed to help position our coastal manufacturers proactively and ahead of the likely after-effects we will see in future storms that will affect the Georgia Coast.\u201d\nEligible manufacturers are encouraged to email Ben Cheeks, GaMEP\u2019s coastal region manager at\nben.cheeks@innovate.gatech.edu .\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nGeorgia Manufacturing Extension Partnership\nContact\nFor media inquiries, contact:\nP\u00e9ralte C.
