In an animal model, the technique enhanced the survival rate of transplanted insulin-producing cells, restoring insulin production in response to blood glucose levels and curing these diabetic animals.\nThe technology could also help patients who must have their pancreas removed because of severe pancreatitis, an inflammatory disease. Using the material and protein combination, the researchers evaluated multiple locations for implanting the islet cell clusters, the first time such a direct comparison of transplant sites has been made.\n\u201cWe have engineered a material that can be used to transplant islets and promote vascularization and survival of the islets to enhance their function,\u201d said Andr\u00e9s Garc\u00eda, a Regents\u2019 Professor in the Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology. \u201cWe are very excited about this because it could have immediate patient benefits if this proves successful in humans.\u201d\nThe research, supported by the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation and the National Institutes of Health, was reported June 2 in the journal Science Advances.\nType 1 Diabetes Affects Millions\nAbout 1.25 million Americans have type 1 diabetes, also known as juvenile diabetes, a disease characterized by the body\u2019s inability to produce insulin. To control the disease, patients must frequently test their glucose levels and inject insulin to maintain the proper balance. But some patients suffer life-threatening hypoglycemic episodes, and the disease has other serious health consequences.\nUsing cells from cadavers, doctors have been experimentally transplanting pancreatic islets into humans for decades, but as many as 60 percent of the transplanted islets die immediately because they are cut off from their blood supply and are killed by an immune response due to direct injection into the bloodstream, and those that survive the transplant usually die within several months. In testing done so far, the islets have been placed into the vasculature of the liver, which has significant blood supply \u2013 but might not be the ideal location because of the hostile immune environment.\nEngineering a New Solution\nSo Garc\u00eda and collaborators, including Georgia Tech postdoctoral researcher and first author Jessica Weaver, set out to engineer a new approach to transplanting the cells. They developed a new degradable polymer hydrogel material used to deliver the cells as they are injected into the body. And they incorporated into the gel a protein known as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which encourages the growth of blood vessels into the transplanted cells.\n\u201cThe transplanted islets need a lot of oxygenation and a connection to the body\u2019s circulatory system to sense the glucose levels and transport the insulin,\u201d noted Garc\u00eda, who is also the Rae and Frank H. Neely Endowed Chair in Mechanical Engineering. \u201cIn addition to protecting the islets, our engineered material promotes the formation of new blood vessels to nourish the cells.\u201d\nVEGF has been tried before, but in quantities too large, it stimulates the growth of leaky blood vessels that don\u2019t provide long-term oxygenation. Too little VEGF doesn\u2019t grow vessels rapidly enough to maintain the transplanted islets, which are clusters containing hundreds of cells. Without sufficient vasculature in the clusters, the cells in the center don\u2019t survive.\nWeaver used diabetic mice to compare locations in the body where the transplanted cells could be placed. She studied locations in the liver, under the skin, in the mesentery regions near the intestines and in an epididymal fat pad in the abdomen.\nPotentially Treating More Patients\n\u201cWe were able to study the transplant sites in parallel and really look at the pros and cons of each to compare the survival rates of the cells in each area,\u201d said Weaver. \u201cIslet cells are very precious because we get so few from each donor. We need them all to survive to help a patient with type 1 diabetes get off insulin.\u201d\nIn the liver location, as many as three donors are now required to get enough transplantable islets to provide glucose control in a single patient. If researchers could reduce the loss of cells, they could one day treat two or even three times as many patients from the limited number of cadaver donors available, Garc\u00eda noted.\nEvaluating the Technique\nWeaver studied the animal models for as long as 100 days, and found that the islet clusters transplanted with the hydrogel and VEGF developed many blood vessels and engrafted into their new locations. As expected, the hydrogel material disappeared and was replaced by new tissue which grew around the islets.\nTo track the long-term viability of the islet cells, she used cells with a gene that produces a green luminescence when excited by certain wavelengths of light. By measuring the signal returned from the transplant locations, she was able to determine how many of the cells survived. Introducing a dye into the bloodstream then allowed her to image the growing vasculature around the islets.\nThe abdominal fat pad turned out to provide the most optimal transplant location. In humans, the equivalent structure is called the omentum, a blood vessel-rich region that other researchers are evaluating as an islet transplant location. Should the technique be used in humans, the cells could be placed there laparoscopically in a minimally-invasive procedure. The hydrogel would be injected in liquid form and would polymerize in the transplant site, creating a flexible gel that would conform to bodily structures to improve both blood vessel connections and tissue integration.\nWhat\u2019s Next\nAs a next step, Garc\u00eda and Weaver would like to study the technique in larger animals. After that, human clinical trials would be required to show whether the combination of hydrogel material and protein will benefit patients with type 1 diabetes. Ultimately, the researchers hope stem cells might provide a source of islets that could be transplanted without the need of cadaveric donor islets and immune system suppression.\nWeaver, a researcher at the Diabetes Research Institute before joining Georgia Tech, said she was surprised at how well the new technology worked. The imaging provided a clear view of the growing vascular system surrounding the islet clumps.\n\u201cWhen we first started doing the imaging, I\u2019m pretty sure I screamed the first time I saw it,\u201d said Weaver. \u201cIt was so beautiful to see the vasculature. I wasn\u2019t expecting to see such perfect blood vessel growth into the islets.\u201d\nThis research was supported by the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation (grant 2-SRA-2014-287-Q-R), the NIH Innovation and Leadership AQ37 in Engineering Technologies and Therapies Postdoctoral Training (grant T90-DK097787-03), and the Ruth L.
