She collaborated with dozens of companies as the director of the Georgia Center of Innovation's aerospace team from 2022 to 2023.\nThat experience inspired the Ph.D. candidate and 2022 Foley Scholar to explore the effects on workers when technology is implemented to automate traditional paper-based processes. \u00a0 Making Meaning from the Digitalization of Blue-Collar Work \u00a0 won a best paper award at the 2023 Conference on \u00a0 Computer Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing \u00a0 (CSCW) this week in Minneapolis.\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to cast meaningful work into a new light with automation and technology design,\u201d Sheehan said. \u201cThe intention is so focused on delivering efficiency and optimizing the process. Companies and technologists forget about user input from workers using these systems.\u201d\nMicrosoft and other major tech companies have \u00a0 announced commitments \u00a0 to use technology to foster a culture of meaningful work within the workplace. However, Sheehan said that small businesses often lack the resources and knowledge required to incorporate such beneficial technology. Others design the technology with only productivity in mind and without considering if it makes their employees\u2019 jobs more meaningful.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of research that shows there\u2019s a technology gap, particularly for small businesses,\u201d Sheehan said. \u201cI\u2019m not always advocating for technology as a solution, but I look at what exists critically and ask, \u2018Is this technology doing what we want it to? If the goal is to support workers, how is it doing that?\u2019\u201d\nSheehan worked with a small Georgia-based manufacturing company to conduct an 18-month study. She designed and deployed off-the-shelf tools to automate the company\u2019s shipping and receiving processes that required time and paperwork.\nWith the support of researchers from Georgia Tech\u2019s \u00a0 Institute of People and Technology \u00a0 (IPAT), she customized a wearable and mobile app. The workers used the app to check off critical tasks within the shipping process one by one.\nThe results were mixed.\nSheehan said many ground-floor shipping experts were frustrated by the frequency of having to repack orders because of customer complaints about improper shipping. The workers insisted they\u2019d done the job correctly. The mobile app allowed them to take pictures of each order after packaging for quality assurance.\nThe workers appreciated the feature, but they also provided negative feedback. In some cases, the app required workers to perform tasks contrary to methods that suited them and made them feel productive. It also took away a sense of autonomy and pride in expertise from workers because it instructed them what to do step by step. Instead of making the job easier, workers felt like their superiors didn\u2019t trust them to do the job correctly.\n\u201cIt helped in certain areas like not having to take notes on paper anymore and using outdated equipment. However, they struggled to see how it would preserve meaning in their job in terms of working with their hands and doing various tasks at any given time.\n\u201cWe create universal systems and solutions for mobile apps that are often deployed without understanding the context of organizational practices. That\u2019s a problem. Now, the workers have to adapt their processes to make this tool work in practice. They\u2019re being asked to give up how they do things,\u201d Sheehan said.\nShe added that automated technology systems need to go beyond convenience and productivity, and these systems may cause more harm than good if it diminishes meaning and value from workers.\n\u201cBy leaving the worker perspective out of the design process, we limit the potential of these technologies,\u201d she said. \u201cProductivity still relies on people being engaged in the process. If we\u2019re going to create true productivity, we need to make sure those jobs are valuable and that people feel what they do matters. That leads to less turnover and higher job satisfaction rates.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nContact\nNathan Deen, Communications Officer\nSchool of Interactive Computing\nnathan.deen@cc.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
