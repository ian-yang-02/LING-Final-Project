It\u2019s light-filled, with lots of plants, a flowing water feature, and a neutral color palette \u2013 shades of soft blue, grey, beige, and sage green. It\u2019s relaxed and welcoming, and that\u2019s by design.\nThe center, which opened in January, is the home of the Cognitive Empowerment Program, a joint effort between Emory University\u2019s Brain Health Center and the Georgia Institute of Technology to empower people living with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a distinct decline in thinking. The condition is often a precursor of Alzheimer\u2019s disease and impacts up to 20% of Americans over age 64, an age group that\u2019s expected to double by the year 2050.\nTwice a week, people with MCI (called program members) and their care partners, usually spouses or adult children, visit Executive Park to participate in art and nutrition classes, physical therapy, gentle yoga, and brain exercises. There\u2019s also a \u201ctech bar\u201d for help operating or troubleshooting mobile devices. The goal is to empower participants to take charge of their lives through education and independent living. Dr. Allan Levey, director of the Emory University Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Research Center, says members and care partners have already praised the program.\n\u201cBy design, program benefits are wide-ranging and personalized, providing individuals with tools to take control over risk factors and behaviors that we hope will promote their cognition, emotional, physical, and spiritual well-being,\u201d said Levey, who is also professor and chairman of Emory\u2019s Department of Neurology. \u201cThe program also provides hope and the personal reward that they are contributing to the fight against Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\u201d\nSteve Baltz and his wife Lyn Reagan started the year-long program in January with the inaugural group. Baltz had a stroke in 2003, which affected \u201cthe memory part of his brain,\u201d Reagan said. He recovered and continued working for the next 10 years. After retiring, Baltz became less active and more isolated at home. Then, his memory began to decline. He forgets whether he fed the dog and misplaces things.\nReagan says she and her husband are \u201cincredibly grateful\u201d for the program; it helps him to get out of the house and socialize. \u201cHe loves it. He just can\u2019t wait to go.\u201d\nBaltz, a retired physician, believes \u201cthis is an opportunity for us to give back [to the medical and research communities] because we\u2019re right here at the forefront of MCI research.\u201d\nAs members of the first group of participants, the Atlanta couple now serve as mentors to newer members and their care partners \u2013 couples like Fred and Marsha Rueff, who joined the program in February.\nDoctors diagnosed Fred with MCI six years ago, and over the past year, his memory has worsened. He has trouble with language and remembering names but is still excellent at problem-solving and math.\n\u201cFred\u2019s great to take when you\u2019re shopping sales because he can figure out the percentage off,\u201d Marsha said.\nActivities at the Cognitive Empowerment Program help to keep Fred\u2019s brain sharp. He enjoys yoga classes and maintains a daily journal of his activities. \u201cThis program has given us a whole new level of hope.\u201d\nUnique Research Opportunity\nWhile the Cognitive Empowerment Program serves as therapy for members, it\u2019s also a living laboratory, providing a unique research opportunity for Georgia Tech and Emory.\nThe program\u2019s innovation accelerator, led by Georgia Tech\u2019s Jennifer DuBose, advances research by breaking down barriers to collaboration. Researchers and students, some supported by\nannual seed grants , work in the heart of the Executive Park space where they can easily observe and interact with program members.\n\u201cThey can watch while people are having physical therapy and yoga and see them hanging out on the sofas. I didn\u2019t want people to have a one-off experience with the members,\u201d said DuBose, a principal research associate in the\nCollege of Design\nand associate director of\nSimTigrate Design Lab .\nDuBose often has lunch at the center with program participants and leads sessions where she works one-on-one with them. During one recent session, members placed emoticon stickers on printed \u201cjourney maps\u201d from their homes to the center to express how their feelings changed over the course of the day. It\u2019s a simple and effective way for researchers to learn about members\u2019 anxieties, routines, and limitations related to memory loss.\nCraig Zimring, a professor in the School of Architecture and director of SimTigrate Design Lab, is directing the program\u2019s built environment core, researching how design can improve cognition, mood, and functioning for people with MCI. His team worked alongside the Executive Park center\u2019s architect to inform the space design and will develop solutions for other therapeutic and home settings.\nZimring also leads talks at the center on topics like how sound and light affects mood and sleep patterns. He shows how the facility\u2019s advanced lighting system automatically adjusts throughout the day. Participants are engaged, asking questions and chiming in with their personal experiences.\nOutside of the center, Georgia Tech researchers are developing a tablet application for members and their care partners, which provides curated information about MCI.\n\u201cWe\u2019re able to foster a continuum of care by providing useable and useful information even when members aren\u2019t at the program facility,\u201d said Beth Mynatt, executive director of the\nInstitute for People and Technology\nand co-director of the Cognitive Empowerment Program technology core.\nMynatt modeled the MCI application on her previous work on the\nMyPath\napplication for breast cancer patients.\nGari Clifford, professor of biomedical informatics at Emory, co-leads the technology core, directing sensing and analytics research to discover new patterns that best depict progress or decline in people with MCI. Drawing on expertise from Georgia Tech\u2019s\nAware Home\nand\nHome Lab , technology core researchers are also creating\nsmart home technologies\nto monitor members\u2019 activity, guide overall MCI care, and provide personalized support for everyday activities and concerns.\nThe Cognitive Empowerment Program will recruit a total of 90 participants in the first year, whom researchers will follow for one year. Program participants have already bonded with researchers, staff, and each other over a shared experience, carpooling to the center and forming friendships and support networks outside of the program.\n\u201cWe\u2019re embedded in people\u2019s lives,\u201d DuBose said. \u201cI\u2019m hopeful that they\u2019ll become engaged and trust us, and that they see themselves as collaborators in research.\u201d\nEditor\u2019s note : The Cognitive Empowerment Program suspended in-person programming on March 17 in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. The technology core research team immediately provided the MyCEP tablet application to support virtual programming by the therapeutic team. This rapid research initiative will explore how to support empowerment for people with MCI using online and interactive content. In-person programming will resume as soon as it\u2019s safe for members.\nResearch News\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\n177 North Avenue\nAtlanta, Georgia\u00a0 30332-0181\u00a0 USA\nMedia Relations Contact : John Toon (404-894-6986) (jtoon@gatech.edu).\nWriter : Alyson Powell Key\nAdditional Images\nContact\nJohn Toon\nResearch News\n(404) 894-6986\nEmail\njtoon@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
