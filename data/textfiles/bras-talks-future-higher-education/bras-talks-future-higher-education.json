Bras, Georgia Tech\u2019s provost and executive vice president for academic affairs, participated in \u201cThe Future of Higher Education,\u201d panel as part of the Milken Institute Global Conference 2018. The 21 st\nannual conference hosted attendees from more than 60 nations and included event tracks on jobs and education, industry, media and technology, aging, and equality, among others.\n\u201cHigher education must be responsive to the changing nature of both learner needs and the demands of employers,\u201d said Bras. \u201cThat will require new delivery methods, new products, and new interaction points to meet those needs on-demand and in real time.\u201d\nIn late April, Georgia Tech released\nDeliberate Innovation, Lifetime Education , a report that outlines innovative and alternative educational models to address the changing needs of learners and employers. The report followed more than two years of work by Tech\u2019s Commission on Creating the Next in Education (CNE), a collaborative effort of more than 50 faculty, staff, and students. Anchored in a recommendation called the Georgia Tech Commitment to a Lifetime Education, the report envisions a university of the future that provides an educational experience that can be personalized as professional interests or needs shift over an individual\u2019s lifetime.\nThe other panelists included Bill Achtmeyer, founder and senior managing director of EY-Parthenon, Mitch Daniels, president of Purdue University, Yoshimasa Hayashi, minister of education, culture, sports, science and technology for the Government of Japan, and Candace Thille, director, learning science and engineering at Amazon.com.\nThe panel, held at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel in Los Angeles, was moderated by Jeffrey Selingo, a visiting scholar at Tech\u2019s Center for 21 st\nCentury Universities.\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nDeliberate Innovation, Lifetime Education\nVideo: Future of Higher Education Panel\nContact\nSusie Ivy\nInstitute Communications\n404-385-3782\nEmail\nsusie.ivy@comm.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
