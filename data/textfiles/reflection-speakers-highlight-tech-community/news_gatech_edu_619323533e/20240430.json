For the students selected as reflection speakers, it presents a unique opportunity to address their fellow graduates, professors, and family members.\nAt each of Georgia Tech\u2019s Fall Commencement ceremonies (bachelor\u2019s, master\u2019s, and Ph.D.), a graduating student is given three minutes to deliver an inspiring message. The bachelor\u2019s speaker is Lama Bahanan, a biomedical engineering major. The master\u2019s speaker is Aayushi Mody, an architecture major. And the Ph.D. speaker is Dakshitha Anandakumar, also a biomedical engineering major.\nStudents must apply to become a reflection speaker. A panel of faculty, staff, and students selects the finalists, who present a full version of their speech to the committee. Those selected as reflection speakers are required to work with Tech\u2019s Communication Center in preparation for the ceremony.\nLama Bahanan\nLama Bahanan has always enjoyed public speaking, and she did it often back home in Saudi Arabia. At Tech her speaking opportunities were mostly in her classes, but now she has the ultimate speaking opportunity at Commencement.\n\u201cI truly believe that the Tech community is like no other,\u201d she said. \u201cWhatever problem you may have, there is always a source to support you.\u201d That\u2019s why she co-founded the Saudi Student Association, to help students like her feel more comfortable and to encourage them to meet new people from different countries.\nAfter graduating she will return to Saudi Arabia, where she will be an associate consultant with Strategy& - PwC in Riyadh. She\u2019s also looking forward to being near her family again.\n\u201cI really miss my family,\u201d she said. \u201cMy mom encouraged me to be independent and do things on my own. My dad encouraged me to be curious and to try new experiences. I owe everything in my life to them.\u201d\nBahanan\u2019s parents and older brother will celebrate Commencement with her.\nAayushi Mody\nAayushi Mody applied to be a reflection speaker because she thought it would be a unique way to connect with and inspire her fellow students.\n\u201cEveryone involved in the speaker selection process was very supportive,\u201d she said. \u201cThe best part was when I informed my lab friends about my selection \u2014 they were all so happy.\u201d\nHer speech is about a particular experience at Georgia Tech and how lessons from that experience can be adopted by all graduates to help them in their lives beyond Tech.\nAfter earning a master\u2019s degree in architecture, Mody plans to practice sustainable architecture and design high-performing buildings to reduce negative environmental impacts.\nThe native of Surat, Gujarat, India wishes her family could be with her on Commencement. \u201cI\u2019m missing them badly,\u201d she said. She will celebrate with her fianc\u00e9 and close friends. \u201cWithout them, this journey would have been very different and difficult.\u201d\nDakshitha Anandakumar\nFrom the start, Dakshitha Anandakumar knew the Georgia Tech community would be the theme of her reflection speech.\n\u201cThe community empowered me to be brave and chase opportunities without being tied down by social norms,\u201d she said. \u201cI have been fortunate to have met some of the most inspiring people here through campus organizations and classes who have all been champions for diversity, equity, and inclusion. I am sure several others in the graduating cohort share similar experiences, and through my speech I want to encourage them to continue working for the betterment of the community.\u201d\nAnandakumar said the last couple of years of graduate school have passed quickly and working on the reflection speech gave her the opportunity to look back at her journey.\n\u201cIt was a good reminder that tough times don\u2019t last but tough people do,\u201d she said.\nAnandakumar is from Bashettyhalli, a village in Karnataka, a southern state of India.\u00a0Her parents will travel to Atlanta, for the first time, to celebrate Commencement with her.\n\u201cI cannot wait to see how proud they will be to watch me give the reflection speech,\u201d she said. \u201cMy parents have sacrificed so much so that I could study here. I hope watching me graduate will make them feel that it was all worth it.\u201d\nAfter graduating she will work as a research scientist at SiriusXM. In her free time, she plans to be a volunteer teacher at NGOs in India.\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nGeorgia Tech Commencement\nCommencement Wishes\nFall 2022 Commencement Speakers\nWhat Not to Wear: Commencement Edition\u2026and Other Tips For Your Graduation Day\nBreaking Down the Cap and Gown\nBeth Quay: Taking Care of Unfinished Business\nBalancing Parenthood and the Pursuit of a Ph.D.\nMission Accomplished: An Army Veteran\u2019s Path to Commencement at Georgia Tech\nContact\nVictor Rogers\nInstitute Communications\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
