The main objective of NASSCOM\u2019s COE-IoT is to create innovative applications and domain capability, which is similar to CDAIT\u2019s mission of expanding and promoting the Internet of Things\u2019 potential and transformational capabilities.\n\u201cWe are honored to collaborate with a premier high tech organization such as NASSCOM to promote the many benefits of the fast-growing Internet of Things,\u201d said Alain Louchez, managing director of CDAIT. \u201cIn close cooperation with NASSCOM\u2019s IoT center, we intend to explore ways to leverage IoT technologies to accelerate and optimize the pace of digital transformation throughout the economy.\u201d\nThe agreement between NASSCOM and Georgia Tech will allow both organizations to combine their efforts to raise awareness of IoT and create IoT-related events for the purpose of developing a vibrant global IoT ecosystem facilitating the effective and efficient adoption of IoT technologies. The partnership will also prompt conversations around IoT that will promote interoperability across industry and geographic markets.\n\u201cThe disruptive nature of IoT will have a major impact in all areas of the consumer\u2019s life \u2013 across all industries including industrial, healthcare, agriculture and smart homes,\u201d said Sanjeev Malhotra, chief executive officer of COE-IoT. \u201cIoT will also be used across these industries to improve productivity with minimum usage of natural resources.\u00a0We are happy to be partnering with Georgia Tech, a leading institute with a focus on emerging technologies, leading to a mutually beneficial agreement that will help us combine Georgia Tech\u2019s advanced technology research along with the thriving innovation ecosystem in India.\u201d\nThrough its COE-IoT located in Bangalore, NASSCOM is focusing on systemically expanding the technology ecosystem, with the center providing a platform to address challenges such as the lack of understanding that leads to low adoption levels and security issues faced by the industry.\nCDAIT\n(pronounced \"sedate\") is a global, non-profit, partner-funded center located at Georgia Tech in Atlanta, Georgia, that fosters interdisciplinary research and education while driving general awareness about the Internet of Things. It aims at efficiently identifying, understanding and solving for its sponsors challenges and problems that may arise along the whole IoT value chain.
