A Georgia Tech researcher will advise each team and conduct research in support of their needs and goals.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve spent the past year in workshops and dialogue with local governments across Georgia to better understand their challenges and priorities,\u201d said Debra Lam, managing director, Smart Cities and Inclusive Innovation at Georgia Tech. \u201cFrom these communications, we developed a program that is sensitive to the local context while fast-tracking smart communities. We aim to create more models for smart development that can be shared and applied across the state and beyond.\u201d\nGeorgia Smart is seeking proposals in the areas of smart mobility and smart resilience. Applications are due May 1.\nLocal Georgia governments of any size --\u00a0cities, counties or consolidated city-county governments --\u00a0will lead selected teams. Each of the four winning teams will receive direct grant funding of up to $50,000, in addition to a required local match.\nGeorgia Power is the lead sponsor of the program, with additional financial support from the Atlanta Regional Commission.\nAdditional partners include: Association County Commissioners of Georgia, Georgia Centers for Innovation, Georgia Chamber of Commerce, Georgia Department of Community Affairs, Georgia Municipal Association, Metro Atlanta Chamber and Technology Association of Georgia.\n\u201cCreating a better-connected Georgia requires research and collaboration from many stakeholders across every layer of the public and private sector,\u201d said Christine Primmer, strategic manager of the Georgia Power Smart Cities initiative. \u201cWe are proud to be a leading partner in the Georgia Smart Communities Challenge as one component of our larger commitment to improving every community we serve while also building the future of energy with a more reliable and adaptive power grid.\u201d\nSmart community opportunities can help local governments and the entire region address multiple issues including mobility and economic development, said Doug Hooker, executive director, Atlanta Regional Commission.\n\u201cCommunity initiatives can be more successful through collaborative, people-focused approaches, and those qualities are what make the Georgia Smart Communities Challenge an important effort for the region,\u201d Hooker said.\nA series of\nworkshops and webinars\nwill take place in March and April, including an April 9 event on campus, to assist communities with the application process. Each team is required to send at least one representative to at least one of these events.\nFor more information about the Georgia Smart Communities Challenge, click\u00a0 here .\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nGeorgia Smart Communities Challenge\nContact\nFor media inquiries about Georgia Smart,\u00a0contact Laura Diamond,\nlaura.diamond@gatech.edu\nFor all other inquiries, email\nscii@ipat.gatech.edu\nEmail\nlaura.diamond@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
