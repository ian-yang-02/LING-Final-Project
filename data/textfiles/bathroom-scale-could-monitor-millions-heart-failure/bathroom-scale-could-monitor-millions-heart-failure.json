Touch the metal pads.\u201d The device records an electrocardiogram from Bill\u2019s fingers and - more importantly \u2013 circulation pulsing that makes his body subtly bob up and down on the scale. Machine learning tools compute that Bill\u2019s heart failure symptoms have worsened.\nThis is how researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology envision their experimental device reaching patients someday, and\u00a0 in a new study , they reported proof-of-concept success in recording and processing data from 43 patients with heart failure. A future marketable version of the medical monitoring scale would ideally notify a doctor, who would call Bill to adjust his medication at home, hopefully sparing him a long hospital stay and needless suffering.\nThe pulsing and bobbing signal is called a\u00a0 ballistocardiogram \u00a0(BCG), a measurement researchers took more commonly about 100 years ago but gave up on as imaging technology far surpassed it. The researchers are making it useful again with modern computation.\n\u201cOur work is the first time that BCGs have been used to classify the status of heart failure patients,\u201d said Omer Inan, the study\u2019s principal investigator and\u00a0 an associate professor in Georgia Tech\u2019s School of Electrical and Computer Engineering .\nHealthcare crisis\nHeart failure \u00a0affects 6.5 million Americans and is a slow-progressing disease, in which the heart works less and less effectively. Many people know it as congestive heart failure because a major symptom is fluid buildup, which can overwhelm the lungs, impeding breathing and possibly causing death.\nPatients endure repeat hospitalizations to adjust medications when their condition dips, or \u201cdecompensates,\u201d making heart failure a major driver of hospital admissions and healthcare costs. Home monitoring reduces hospitalizations but currently requires an invasive procedure.\nGeorgia Tech research was behind the launch \u00a0of such an implantable\u00a0 heart failure home monitoring device \u00a0in 2011. But this new solution would potentially dispense with the procedure, cost much less, and be much simpler to use \u2013 lowering patients\u2019 resistance to home monitoring.\nGiven its early stage, the study\u2019s BCG-EKG scale performed well in hospital tests but also in in-home tests, which was promising, since the solution principally targets eventual home use.\nThe research team, which included collaborators from the University of California, San Francisco, and Northwestern University,\u00a0 published their results in August 2019, in the journal\u00a0 IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering . The research was funded by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute at the National Institutes of Health.\nBallisto scribble\nThe EKG part of the experimental scale is not new nor its great diagnostic information, but it alone does not say enough about heart failure. The BCG part is mostly new, and it appears valuable to heart failure monitoring but also challenging to record and interpret.\n\u201cThe ECG (EKG) has characteristic waves that clinicians have understood for 100 years, and now, computers read it a lot of the time,\u201d Inan said. \u201cElements of the BCG signal aren\u2019t really known well yet, and they haven\u2019t been measured in patients with heart failure very much at all.\u201d\nThe EKG is electrical; the body conducts its signals well, and the recordings are clear.\nThe BCG is a mechanical signal; body fat dampens it, and it faces a lot of interference in the body like tissue variations and muscle movement. BCGs are also noisier in people with cardiovascular disease.\nPatients with heart failure tend to be feebler, and initially, the researchers worried they would wobble on scales during home tests, adding even more noise to the BCGs. But the recordings were very productive.\nThough a BCG read-out is scribble compared to an EKG\u2019s near-uniform etchings, BCGs have some patterns that parallel an EKG\u2019s. For example, the big upward spike in an EKG is followed by the BCG\u2019s big \"J-wave.\"\nInconsistent throbbing\nThe researchers processed BCGs with three machine learning algorithms, revealing patterns that differ when a patient\u2019s heart failure is compensated, that is, healthier, from when it is decompensated.\n\u201cIn someone with decompensated heart failure, the cardiovascular system can no longer\u00a0 compensate for the reduced heart function , and then the flow of blood through the arteries is more disorderly, and we see it in the mechanical signal of the BCG,\u201d Inan said. \u201cThat difference does not show up in the ECG because it\u2019s an electrical signal.\u201d\n\u201cThe most important characteristic was the degree to which the BCG is variable, which would mean inconsistent blood flow. If you chop up the recording into 20-second intervals and the individual segments differ from each other a lot, that\u2019s a good marker of decompensation,\u201d Inan said.\nAlso READ:\nSix important cardiac solutions in preclinical, clinical and other human testing\nThese researchers coauthored the study: James Rehg,\u00a0 Burak Aydemir, Supriya Nagesh, and Mobashir Hasan Shandhi from Georgia Tech; Joanna Fan and Liviu Klein from the University of California, San Francisco; Mozziyar Etemadi and Alex Heller from Northwestern University.
