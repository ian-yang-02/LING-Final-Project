It gave out 1,000 pieces in three hours to hundreds of kids.\n\u201cBest Halloween ever,\u201d said Chernova, an assistant professor in the School of Interactive Computing. \u201cBoth kids and parents loved getting candy from a real robot, and many people stayed around to watch it work. Now all of my neighbors want one for their house next year!\u201d\nThe credit for the event goes to Chernova\u2019s research team, who got the idea after she mentioned that Halloween is overwhelming at her house because of the crowds. The students went to work, training Sawyer,\na collaborative machine built by Rethink Robotics , in less than an hour. They simply showed the robot the motions that were required. The robot did the rest of the work the rest of the night.\n\u201cIt was fun to watch the faces of the kids when they walked up to the house,\u201d Chernova said. \u201cEveryone wanted to know who was remotely controlling the robot, but everything was autonomous. It was a lot of fun!\u201d\nThe robot wore a hat, cape and mask.\nWhat\u2019s next?\n\u201cMaybe we\u2019ll have Sawyer carve a turkey on Thanksgiving,\u201d Chernova said. \u201cOr hang ornaments during the holidays.\u201d\nChernova oversees Georgia Tech\u2019s\nRobot Autonomy and Interactive Learning (RAIL) lab ,\nwhich works to make robots more accessible to people. Andrew Silva, Jonathan Balloch, David Kent, Siddhartha Banerjee, Angel Daruna, Asif Rana and Weiuy Liu are the students who worked on the Halloween project.\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nControlling a Robot Using Point and Click\nGeorgia Tech Women in Robotics\nVisit the RAIL Lab\nContact\nJason Maderer\nNational Media Relations\nmaderer@gatech.edu\n404-660-2926\nEmail\nmaderer@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
