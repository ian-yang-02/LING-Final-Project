But a new study finds that flying insects like bees and moths may struggle with insurmountable issues to this escape route.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nEmail\nSep 11, 2023\nThis story by Jennifer Woodruff is\nshared jointly\nwith the University of Colorado Denver.\nIn response to rising global temperatures, many plants and animals are moving to higher elevations to survive in cooler temperatures. But a new study from the University of Colorado Denver (CU Denver) and Georgia Tech finds that for flying insects \u2014 including bees and moths \u2014 this escape route may have insurmountable issues that\u00a0could mean their doom.\nThe research team examined more than 800 species of insects from around the world and discovered that many winged insects are moving to higher elevations much slower than their non-flying counterparts. This is because the thinner air at higher elevations provides less oxygen for species to use. Because flight requires more oxygen to generate energy for movement than other styles of movement, such as walking, these species are migrating\u00a0more slowly.\nThe\u00a0 team\u2019s findings were published \u00a0in this week\u2019s\u00a0 Nature Climate Change \u00a0journal.\nJesse Shaich , postbaccalaureate student at CU Denver, is also a member of the research team.\n\u201cWhen we think about where species will be able\u00a0to\u00a0live under climate change in the coming decades, we need to remember that animals are sensitive to more than just how hot or cold they are,\u201d said CU Denver Assistant Professor of Integrated Biology \u00a0Michael Moore , who led the study.\nDeclining insect biodiversity has direct impact on humans\nIf flying insects\u2019 native habitats get too warm too quickly, and they can\u2019t find a suitable alternative or adapt in time, that will likely lead to their extinction. Beyond just being bad for the bugs themselves, loss of insects is bad news for humans as well. Most crop pollinators are the flying species the researchers expect to be vulnerable, and their extinction would be catastrophic to global food supply. Not only would this have implications for agriculture and food supply chains, but similar challenges are likely true for other species that need a lot of oxygen to live.\n\u201cOur earth\u2019s biodiversity is rapidly declining, especially amongst insects. The global loss of insects will be ecologically catastrophic, so we urgently need to understand why and how this is happening,\u201d said\nJames Stroud , assistant professor of Biological Sciences at Georgia Tech.\nBroadening research on high elevation challenges\nTo conserve as many species as possible, researchers need to grasp the full scope of challenges plants and animals face, whether they can overcome these challenges, and to predict the locations where they can survive. High elevation environments are also difficult for new species because of the scarcity of food, stronger winds, more extreme cold snaps, and increased ultraviolet radiation.\nMoore concludes, \u201cIf we want to design effective conservation strategies, we must consider a broader range of environmental factors that species need to live.\u201d\nAbout Georgia Institute of Technology\nThe\u00a0 Georgia Institute of Technology,\u00a0 or\u00a0 Georgia Tech, \u00a0is one of the top public research universities in the U.S., developing leaders who advance technology and improve the human condition.
