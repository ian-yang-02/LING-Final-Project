Images produced by the portal are analyzed within minutes of a train\u2019s passage, allowing any issues identified to be reported immediately.\nTwo train portals are currently in operation on adjacent tracks in Leetonia, Ohio, and the company plans to have as many as a dozen in service by the end of 2024. Among them will be a train portal already under construction near Jackson, Georgia, which is located south of Atlanta.\n\u201cNorfolk Southern is deploying Digital Train Inspection Portals to enhance rail safety across the company\u2019s 22-state network,\u201d said Mabby Amouie, chief data scientist for the company. \u201cThe portals feature cutting-edge machine vision inspection technology developed in partnership with GTRI, which engineered the hardware, and Norfolk Southern\u2019s Data Science/Artificial Intelligence and Mechanical teams, which built the brains behind the program.\u201d\nThe machine vision portion uses 38 high-resolution cameras consisting of a mix of area and line scan cameras to photograph critical components of each rail car moving through the portals. Powerful lights comparable to those used in sports stadiums allow the cameras to take approximately a thousand photographs of each moving rail car.\n\u201cBeing able to look at the train while it\u2019s moving at 60 miles per hour provides visibility into defects that would be difficult to see otherwise,\u201d said Gary McMurray, division chief of GTRI\u2019s Intelligent Sustainable Technologies Division. \u201cYou want to be able to look at a train while it\u2019s in motion because that\u2019s when components are stressed, and you can see other dynamic faults.\u201d\nTo reduce the amount of data that must be analyzed, each camera is aimed at a specific area of the train and takes photographs only when components of interest are visible. \u201cThe high-speed cameras are strategically placed at angles to capture things that are difficult to detect with the human eye during stationary inspections,\u201d said Amouie.\nSensors at each portal determine the speed of each train passing through and use that information to precisely control when the photographs are taken.\n\u201cEven with a train traveling 60 miles per hour, we are able to calculate in real time when to tell each camera to take a picture,\u201d said Colin Usher, a GTRI senior research scientist who led development of the machine vision system. \u201cOnly images of critical components are taken and the other areas of the train that are inconsequential to identifying defects are not captured. That optimizes the image capture and saves space in the computer system.\u201d\nThe images produced by the system are analyzed by artificial intelligence algorithms developed by Norfolk Southern. The algorithms were designed to provide a combination of high accuracy and very low rates of false positives. If defects are spotted, the AI systems reports them immediately.\n\u201cThe computer transmits the information to Norfolk Southern\u2019s Network Operations Center, where the data is reviewed by subject-matter experts to identify and address issues to proactively ensure the safety of rail operations,\u201d Amouie said. \u201cCritical defects are flagged for immediate handling.\u201d\nThe machine vision system uses image compression techniques to reduce the size of the photographs processed by computer servers located in the portals. For a single train, the data analyzed can amount to as much as 500 gigabytes. Because the inspection needs to be done quickly, the image processing is done on-site.\nThe inspection portals must operate year-round in all kinds of weather conditions and in geographic locations that range from extreme heat to cold. The machine vision system therefore has to operate despite heavy vibration levels, temperature extremes, rain and snow \u2013 and to remain clean as trains pass over.\nTo protect the cameras, air blown over the camera lenses shields them, while air-conditioned enclosures prevent overheating of the equipment. The system operates in a tunnel structure that helps protect the equipment and control lighting, which must be consistent across the train being inspected.\nThe project, which began in 2021, involved approximately a dozen researchers in four GTRI laboratories. The research built on imaging work done earlier for a variety of applications, including the food processing industry, which needed to monitor poultry on moving processing lines.\n\u201cBy partnering with GTRI, Norfolk Southern is tapping into the best in machine vision technology in any market,\u201d Amouie said. \u201cWe chose GTRI to be a partner because they develop advanced technology solutions and large-scale system prototypes to address the most difficult problems in national security, economic development and the overall human condition.\u201d\nWriter:\nJohn Toon \u00a0(john.toon@gtri.gatech.edu)\nGTRI Communications\nGeorgia Tech Research Institute\nAtlanta, Georgia USA\nThe\nGeorgia Tech Research Institute (GTRI)\nis the nonprofit, applied research division of the Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech).\u202fFounded in 1934 as the Engineering Experiment Station, GTRI has grown to more than 2,900 employees, supporting eight laboratories in over 20 locations around the country and performing more than $940 million of problem-solving research annually for government and industry.\u202fGTRI's renowned researchers combine science, engineering, economics, policy, and technical expertise to solve complex problems for the U.S. federal government, state, and industry.\nAdditional Media\nContact\n(Interim) Director of Communications\nMichelle Gowdy\nMichelle.Gowdy@gtri.gatech.edu\n404-407-8060\nEmail\nmichelle.gowdy@gtri.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
