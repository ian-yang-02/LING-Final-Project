Xenesis has licensed the technology from NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), and will work with Georgia Tech and JPL to mature it for use as a primary communication system for satellites as small as CubeSats.\n\u201cWe expect to significantly add to the total bandwidth of information that we can get down from space, and the more bandwidth we have, the more information we can exchange and the more value we can get from satellite networks,\u201d said\nBrian Gunter , an assistant professor in Georgia Tech\u2019s\nDaniel\u00a0Guggenheim School of Aerospace Engineering\nwho will be leading the project.\nGunter\u2019s lab has experience with small satellites, and will apply that expertise to the project with Xenesis \u2013 which signed a $1.2 million contract on June 14 to support the work. Georgia Tech\u2019s contribution will be to miniaturize the original JPL technology, update the control software, space qualify all the hardware and test the improved system from space \u2013 likely from the International Space Station.\n\u201cWith all of the satellites that are going into space, everything from CubeSats to major satellites, there is more information being generated than can ever be downloaded,\u201d said Dennis Poulos, chief technology officer at Xenesis. \u201cMost of today\u2019s systems depend on radio frequency downlinks, and there is just a limited amount of bandwidth available for use.\u201d\nLaser-based systems can expand that bandwidth to beyond 10 gigabits per second, Poulos said. In addition to boosting bandwidth, optical systems can use smaller antennas, use power more efficiently, and provide better data security.\nMark LaPenna, CEO of Xenesis, compared the benefits of the planned space-based network to the jump in performance from terrestrial dial-up connections of the 1990s to today\u2019s high-speed broadband services.\n\"Xenesis recognizes the need for a global communications revolution, and we plan to empower space with an optical product called XenHub,\u201d LaPenna said. \u201cThrough this architecture, any company, mission or global operator on the ground or in space, will be able to compete on a level playing field for the first time since Sputnik.\"\nThe laser communications transceiver developed by JPL consists of two components: (1) an optics module that includes a five-centimeter telescope, two-axis gimbal, monitoring sensors and thermal control system, and (2) an electronics module with a transmitter, processor, controllers and power conditioning systems.\nThough it is subject to interference from clouds, the laser system will benefit from producing a narrow beam that can travel farther than comparable radio-frequency transmissions at the same power level.\nThe initial focus will be space-to-ground communication, though the system could also be used for cross-linking communication between satellites. The small antenna size is also more suitable to the small-form satellites envisioned for future constellations that may include thousands of spacecraft.\n\u201cOnce we can show that this works from space to ground, that will demonstrate that the technology can survive the harsh environment of space, and allow us continue the development of the transceiver for commercial use,\u201d Gunter added. \u201cThis has the potential to open up a range of new capabilities, including the ability to provide high-volume data services to anywhere in the world.\u201d\nIn Georgia Tech\u2019s School of Aerospace Engineering, the contract will support three or four graduate students, a postdoctoral researcher, and a group of undergraduate students, Gunter said. \u201cThis will be a major satellite project for our lab, and we look forward to advancing the technology with our collaborators.\u201d\nResearch News\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\n177 North Avenue\nAtlanta, Georgia\u00a0 30332-0181\u00a0 USA\nMedia Relations Contact : John Toon (404-894-6986) (jtoon@gatech.edu).\nWriter : John Toon\nAdditional Images\nContact\nJohn Toon\nResearch News\n(404) 894-6986\nEmail\njtoon@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
