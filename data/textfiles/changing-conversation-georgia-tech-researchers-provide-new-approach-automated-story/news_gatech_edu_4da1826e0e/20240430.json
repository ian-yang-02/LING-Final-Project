You pose a request: \u201cHey Voice Assistant, tell me a story about Georgia Tech.\u201d More often than not, you get a related response \u2013 \u201cGeorgia Tech is located in Atlanta, Georgia. Would you like me to provide you with directions?\u201d \u2013 but one with slightly unnatural language and only limited information.\nDespite the enormous strides made in artificial intelligence to develop systems that can answer simple questions and requests, the kinds of natural conversational language humans have with each other when giving more complex directions or telling stories has thus far been out of reach.\nResearch from\nGeorgia Tech \u2019s\nSchool of Interactive Computing , however, provides a novel approach that improves the combination of automated story generation with natural language. The development is an important step in providing AI assistants the capability to more naturally converse with humans.\n\u201cLet\u2019s think of a future version of Siri or Alexa, where you have a complex task that\u2019s not just \u2018Look this thing up on the internet,\u2019 or \u2018Tell me what the weather is outside,\u2019\u201d said Mark Riedl, an associate professor at Georgia Tech and the faculty lead on the research. \u201cMaybe you want to plan your day or a birthday party. Think of the response like a little story, a narrative that conveys the requested information.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a missing capability in AI \u2013 they just don\u2019t understand us or communicate with us in the same ways that we understand each other.\u201d\nRiedl and his team approached the challenge by viewing the exchange of information as stories \u2013 a series of events, one after the other, that leads to some conclusion. Past research on the topic identified patterns in language to identify how stories are constructed \u2013 namely that a verb generally changes the action and conveys a new event in a story.\n\u201cBy boiling down these stories drawn from the internet to essential verbs and actions, we can extract patterns from stories better,\u201d Riedl said. \u201cThere are a lot of ways to talk about marriage, but at the end of the day someone is marrying someone else.\u201d\nThis paper, the third in the series, took the next step: If you take away all the words to identify the patterns in a story, you need to be able to put them back in naturally and intelligently in a way that humans are accustomed to. Put simply, it\u2019s like building an outline and then filling in the details.\nThe system works by building the outline through a neural network trained on sequencing events. With the help of story examples drawn from the internet, it applies machine learning to produce a series of events, one leading to the most likely next outcome. That outline guides a second neural network that applies natural language \u2013 grammar, syntax, spelling, everything else you need to make the story intelligible \u2013 to produce more elaborate sentences.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re asking for directions for how a birthday party should go, you don\u2019t want just \u2018Jill eats cake; Jill opens presents,\u2019\u201d Riedl said. \u201cYou want something more akin to the stories we share as humans. It\u2019s actually more difficult for us to process information when it\u2019s delivered in a way we\u2019re not accustomed to.\u201d\nThe researchers found that an ensemble approach works the best. They use a series of five algorithms, each with different capabilities in accuracy and natural language generation, produces the best stories. Because one algorithm isn\u2019t uniformly better at all aspects of the task, it will be run through all five to find the highest confidence level of the sentence.\n\u201cOne technique might provide bland sentences, but is accurate with the actual content,\u201d Riedl said. \u201cAnother might be very good at putting in a narrative flourish, but they fail more often. You want that nicer sentence, but you also want it to be able to catch mistakes in the content.\u201d\nThe ensemble approach scored significantly higher in human studies than the individual algorithms alone. Human trust in their AI and robot assistants, Riedl said, was key to adoption in the future.\n\u201cThe key is that you want to place that trust in your machine counterpart, but it has to earn that trust on correctness and accuracy,\u201d he said.\nThe paper is titled\nStory Realization: Expanding Plot Events into Sentences , and will be presented at the\n34 th\nAAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence\non Feb. 7-12 in New York City.
