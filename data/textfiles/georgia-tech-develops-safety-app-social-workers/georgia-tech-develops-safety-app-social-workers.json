It works with the Click Safe app, which is used by child-welfare investigators and case managers.\nWhen pressed, the button on a key fob transmits a signal via Bluetooth to an app on the worker\u2019s state-issued cellphone. The phone then silently notifies the agency\u2019s call center, where a trained operator contacts the nearest 911 center with details on the alarm, a description of the employee, the location, and a request to rush law enforcement officers to the scene.\nDFCS professionals can\u2019t choose where they go, but the app is \u201ca way to protect them when they\u2019re protecting Georgia\u2019s children,\u201d said Tom Rawlings, the division\u2019s interim director.\n\u201cOur child-safety professionals are trained to de-escalate unpleasant situations, but having a panic button gives them assurance that help will be there if their verbal techniques aren\u2019t successful,\u201d Rawlings added.\nDevelopment of Click Safe represents cooperation between two state entities. GTRI worked on the project at the request of Gov. Nathan Deal as part of his child-welfare initiatives.\n\u201cGeorgia Tech is proud to be part of this innovative collaboration between the Georgia Tech Research Institute, the state of Georgia, and the Department of Family and Children Services,\u201d said President G.P. \u201cBud\u201d Peterson. \u201cWe expect the Click Safe emergency-response system to become a powerful tool in helping protect DFCS case managers and child-welfare investigators in sometimes-dangerous situations as they focus on their vital work of ensuring the safety of Georgia\u2019s children.\u201d\nThe work draws on GTRI\u2019s specialized telecommunications expertise. Scientists adapted off-the-shelf technology to stand up to rigorous field testing to ensure reliable functionality across the state.\nThe system operates silently and out of sight. That\u2019s to keep from alerting anyone threatening a case worker that law enforcement is on the way and potentially making a tense situation more dangerous in the minutes before officers arrive.\nTo prevent accidental triggering of the device, the button must be pressed either for five seconds or five times in succession.\nLearn more about the device\u00a0 here .\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nGeorgia social workers get unique safety app\nEmail\nlaura.diamond@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
