Remember\nEllen Ripley in that Power Loader in\nAlien ? Or the crazy mobile platform\nGeorge McFly wore in 2015 in\nBack to the Future, Part II\nbecause he threw his back out?\nResearchers are working on real-life robotic assistance that could protect workers from painful injuries and help stroke patients regain their mobility. So far, they have required extensive calibration and context-specific tuning, which keeps them largely limited to research labs.\nMechanical engineers at Georgia Tech may be on the verge of changing that, allowing exoskeleton technology to be deployed in homes, workplaces, and more.\nA team of researchers in\nAaron Young\u2019s\nlab have developed a universal approach to controlling robotic exoskeletons that requires no training, no calibration, and no adjustments to complicated algorithms. Instead, users can don the \u201cexo\u201d and go.\nTheir system uses a kind of artificial intelligence called deep learning to autonomously adjust how the exoskeleton provides assistance, and they\u2019ve shown it works seamlessly to support walking, standing, and climbing stairs or ramps.\nThey described their \u201cunified control framework\u201d March 20 in\nScience Robotics .\n\u201cThe goal was not just to provide control across different activities, but to create a single unified system. You don't have to press buttons to switch between modes or have some classifier algorithm that tries to predict that you're climbing stairs or walking,\u201d said Young, associate professor in the\nGeorge W. Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering .\nGet the full story on the College of Engineering website.\nAdditional Media\nDean Molinaro walks up an adjustable ramp while wearing an experimental exoskeleton, demonstrating how the team collected data in their effort to develop a unified control framework for robotic assistance devices.
