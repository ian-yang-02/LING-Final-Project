Projects overseen by the board, including student-focused sites such as\nCourse Critique , are run through the Institute's AWS and Plesk platforms, mirroring industry trends.\n\u201cThe IT Board creates helpful products for students, but it also helps our members by giving them the tools to work within this professional setting. With so many companies using cloud-based systems, our students are getting hands-on experience with these tools, so they already have that on their resum\u00e9 and are set up to find jobs when they leave Georgia Tech,\" said Tyler Katchen, the outgoing SGA joint vice president of IT (JVPIT).\nThe board is responsible for tweaking existing sites, but its members are always seeking innovative ways to improve the student experience. The board is close to completing an app that enhances the career fair queueing process by allowing students to secure their place in line to speak with major industry players. By simplifying this process, the board hopes that attendees can spend less time waiting and more time speaking with prospective employers.\nMuch of the IT Board's work is done behind the scenes, but Katchen and his team aren't in search of the spotlight.\n\u201cWhen people see an app we develop, they may not realize how much work goes into it, but we feel the impact in other ways. The projects that are well received by students are ones where they maybe don't recognize the product; they just see themselves using it,\u201d he said. For him, the reward is \u201cseeing it all come together. A lot of it is just taking pride in your work.\u201d\nSince the formulation of the JVPIT role \u2014 serving both undergraduate and graduate SGA \u2014 in 2020, the board has continued to expand membership and take on larger tasks, including rebuilding the Course Critique site, which originated in 1976 as a tool to help students plan their schedules. Looking ahead, Katchen identified improvements to security measures in GitHub, as well as streamlining surveying efforts for student organizations, as some of the board\u2019s top priorities.\nThe third-year computer science student recently handed over a 28-page transition document to his successor, outlining the status of current projects and day-to-day responsibilities. While he enjoyed his time at the helm, Katchen is ready to return to the keyboard.\n\"I'm a computer science nerd through and through,\" he said. \"So, I'm ready to put my head down and code.\"\nAdditional Media\nContact\nSteven Gagliano\n- Institute Communications\nEmail\nSteven.gagliano@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
