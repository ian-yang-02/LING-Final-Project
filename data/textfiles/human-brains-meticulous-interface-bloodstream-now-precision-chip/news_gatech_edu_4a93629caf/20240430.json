Credit: Georgia Tech / YongTae Kim lab\nFeb 10, 2020\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nA scrupulous gatekeeper stands between the brain and its circulatory system to let in the good and keep out the bad, but this porter, called the blood-brain barrier, also blocks trial drugs to treat diseases like Alzheimer\u2019s or cancer from getting into the brain.\nNow a team led by researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology has engineered a way of studying the barrier more closely with the intent of helping drug developers do the same.\u00a0 In a new study , the researchers cultured the human blood-brain barrier on a chip, recreating its physiology more realistically than predecessor chips.\nThe new chip devised a healthy environment for the barrier\u2019s central component, a brain cell called the astrocyte, which is not a neuron, but which acts as neurons\u2019 intercessors with the circulatory system. Astrocytes interface in human brains with cells in the vasculature called endothelial cells to collaborate with them as the blood-brain barrier.\nBut astrocytes are a particularly fussy partner, which makes them a great part of the gatekeeper system but also challenging to culture in a physiologically accurate manner. The new chip catered to astrocytes\u2019 sensibilities by culturing in 3D instead of in a flat manner, or 2D.\nThe 3D space allowed astrocytes to act more naturally, and this improved the whole barrier model by also allowing cultured endothelial cells to function better. The new chip presented researchers with more healthy blood-brain barrier functions to observe than in previous barrier models.\n\u2018Astro\u2019 in astrocyte\n\u201cYou need to be able to closely mimic a tissue on a chip in a healthy status and in homeostasis. If we can\u2019t model the healthy state, we can\u2019t really model disease either, because we have no accurate control to measure it against,\u201d said YongTae Kim,\u00a0 an associate professor in Georgia Tech\u2019s George W. Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering \u00a0and the study\u2019s principal investigator.\nIn the new chip, the astrocytes even looked more natural in the 3D space, unfolding the star-like shape that gives them their \u201castro\u201d name. In the 2D cultures, by contrast, astrocytes looked like fried eggs with fringes. With this 3D setting, the chip has added possibilities for reliable research of the human blood-brain barrier, where currently alternatives are few.\n\u201cNo animal model comes close enough to the intricate function of the human blood-brain barrier. And we need better human models because experimental drugs that have successfully entered animal brains have failed at the human barrier,\u201d Kim said.\nThe team\u00a0 published its results on January 10, 2020, in the journal\u00a0 Nature Communications . The research was funded by the National Institutes of Health. Kim has founded a company with plans to mass-produce the new chip in the future for use in academic and potentially pharmaceutical research.\n[Ready for graduate school?\u00a0 Here's how to apply to Georgia Tech. ]\nChoosy, bossy astrocytes\nThe brain is the only part of the body outfitted with astrocytes, which regulate nourishment uptake and waste removal in their own, unique way.\n\u201cUpon the brain\u2019s request, astrocytes collaborate with the vasculature in real-time what the brain needs and opens its gates to let in only that bit of water and nutrients. Astrocytes go to get just what the brain needs and don\u2019t let much else in,\u201d Kim said.\nAstrocytes form a protein structure called aquaporin-4 in their membranes that are in contact with vasculature to let in and out water molecules, which also contributes to clearing waste from the brain.\n\u201cIn previous chips, aquaporin-4 expression was not observed. This chip was the first,\u201d Kim said. \u201cThis could be important in researching Alzheimer\u2019s disease because aquaporin-4 is important to clearing broken-down junk protein out of the brain.\u201d\nOne of the study\u2019s co-authors,\u00a0 Dr. Allan Levey \u00a0from Emory University, a\u00a0 highly cited researcher \u00a0in neurological medicine, is interested in the chip\u2019s potential in tackling Alzheimer\u2019s. Another,\u00a0 Dr. Tobey McDonald , also of Emory, researches pediatric brain cancer and is interested in the chip\u2019s possibilities in studying the delivery of potential brain cancer treatments.\nBarrier acting healthy\nAstrocytes also gave signs that they were healthier in the chip\u2019s 3D cultures than in 2D cultures by expressing less of a gene triggered by pathology.\n\u201cAstrocytes in 2D culture expressed significantly higher levels of LCN2 than those in 3D. When we cultured in 3D, it was only about one fourth as much,\u201d Kim said.\nThe healthier state also made astrocytes better able to show an immune reaction.\n\u201cWhen we purposely confronted the astrocyte with pathological stress in a 3D culture, we got a clearer reaction. In 2D, the ground state was already less healthy, and then the reaction to pathological stresses did not come across so clearly. This difference could make the 3D culture very interesting for pathology studies.\u201d\nNanoparticle delivery\nIn testing related to drug delivery, nanoparticles moved through the blood-brain-barrier after engaging endothelial cell receptors, which caused these cells to engulf the particles then transport them to what would be inside the human brain in a natural setting. This is part of how endothelial cells worked better when connected to astrocytes cultured in 3D.\n\u201cWhen we inhibited the receptor, the majority of nanoparticles wouldn\u2019t make it in. That kind of test would not work in animal models because of cross-species inaccuracies between animals and humans,\u201d Kim said. \u201cThis was an example of how this new chip can let you study the human blood-brain barrier for potential drug delivery the way you can\u2019t in animal models.\u201d\nAlso Read: \u00a0 Flickering Light Mobilizes Brain Chemistry That May Fight Alzheimer\u2019s\nThese researchers also coauthored the study: Song Ih Ahn, Yoshitaka Sei, Hyun-Ji Park, Jinhwan Kim, Yujung Ryu, and Jeongmoon Choi, and Hak-Joon Sung of Georgia Tech.
