In the meantime, South Korea is blasting pop music, weather and news broadcasts and recorded criticisms of North Korea with loudspeakers on the border. Speaking of loudspeakers, turn up the volume on your computer because Associate Professor Zhigang Peng is allowing people to hear what the explosion (and its predecessors) sounded like when their signals rumbled through the ground. He explains how it works: \"Signals from the North Korean explosion were detected about 100 miles from the border at a seismological station in Mudanjiang, China. So we sped up the frequency 100 times faster than normal,\" Peng said. \"That way the frequency is within the range that humans can hear. This is similar to how we fast-forwarded cassette players to hear higher pitch in the old days. Then we did the same for four other recent explosions from North Korea. \"Seismology alone\u00a0cannot tell whether it was a hydrogen bomb or not. However, what we can tell from the existing data (either by visual display or the sounds) is that this week\u2019s seismic events are actually slightly smaller than the 2013 event. The new event also appeared to be very similar to the previous events, suggesting that they occurred at nearby\u00a0locations and were similar types of explosions.\" Peng used the same process several years ago to\nlisten to the 2011 Japan earthquake.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nJason Maderer National Media Relations 404-660-2926 maderer@gatech.edu\nEmail\nmaderer@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
