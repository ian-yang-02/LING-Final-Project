The researchers fabricated the struts from shape memory polymers that unfold when heated.\n\u201cTensegrity structures are extremely lightweight while also being very strong,\u201d said Glaucio Paulino, a professor in Georgia Tech\u2019s\u00a0School of Civil and Environmental Engineering. \u201cThat\u2019s the reason there\u2019s a heavy amount of interest right now in researching the use of tensegrity structures for outer space exploration. The goal is to find a way to deploy a large object that initially takes up little space.\u201d\nThe research, which was reported June 14 in the journal\u00a0 Scientific Reports , was sponsored by the National Science Foundation and the Air Force Office of Scientific Research.\nThe researchers used 3-D printers to create the struts that make up one of the primary components of the tensegrity structure. To enable the struts to be temporarily folded flat, the researchers designed them to be hollow with a narrow opening that runs the length of the tube. Each strut has an attachment point on each end to connect to a network of elastic cables, which are also made with 3-D printers.\nOnce the struts were heated to 65 degrees Celsius, the researchers could partially flatten and fold them into a shape resembling the letter W. The cooled structures then retain the temporary shape.\nWith all cables attached, the objects can be reheated to initiate the transformation into tensegrity structures.\n\u201cWe believe that you could build something like an antenna that initially is compressed and takes up little space, but once it\u2019s heated, say just from the heat of the sun, would fully expand,\u201d said Jerry Qi, a professor in the\u00a0George W. Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering\u00a0at Georgia Tech.\nA key component of making 3-D printed objects that can transform into tensegrity structures was controlling the rate and sequence of expansion. The shape memory polymers enable the researchers to fine-tune how quickly each strut expands by adjusting at which temperature the expansion occurs. That enables structures to be designed with struts that expand sequentially.\n\u201cFor bigger and more complicated structures, if you don\u2019t control the sequence that these struts expand, it tangles and you have a mess,\u201d Paulino said. \u201cBy controlling the temperature at which each strut expands, we can have a phased deployment and avoid this entanglement.\u201d\nThe term \u201ctensegrity\u201d comes from a combination of the words \u201ctensional integrity,\u201d and the concept has been used as the structural basis for several notable projects through the years, including a large pedestrian bridge in Brisbane, Australia, and stadium roofs such as the Georgia Dome stadium in Atlanta and the Olympic Gymnastics Arena in Seoul, South Korea.\nThe researchers envision that the new 3-D printed structures could be used for super light-weight structures needed for space exploration or even shape-change soft robots.\n\u201cThese active tensegrity objects are very elegant in design and open up a range of possibilities for deployable 3-D structures,\u201d Paulino said.\nThis research was supported by the National Science Foundation under grant No. CMMI-1538830 and Air Force Office of Scientific Research under grant No. 15RT0885.
