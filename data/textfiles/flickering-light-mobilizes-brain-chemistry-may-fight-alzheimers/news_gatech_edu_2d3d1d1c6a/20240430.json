But in recent years, perplexing experiments using flickering light have shown promise.\nNow, researchers have tapped into how the flicker may work. They discovered in the lab that the exposure to light pulsing at 40 hertz \u2013 40 beats per second \u2013 causes brains to release a surge of signaling chemicals that may help fight the disease.\nThough conducted on healthy mice,\u00a0 this new study \u00a0is directly connected to human trials, in which Alzheimer\u2019s patients are exposed to 40 Hz light and sound. Insights gained in mice at the Georgia Institute of Technology are informing the human trials in collaboration with Emory University.\n\u201cI\u2019ll be running samples from mice in the lab, and around the same time, a colleague will be doing a strikingly similar analysis on patient fluid samples,\u201d said Kristie Garza, the study\u2019s first author. Garza is a graduate research assistant in the lab of Annabelle Singer at Georgia Tech and also a member of Emory\u2019s neuroscience program.\nOne of the surging signaling molecules in the new study on mice\u00a0is strongly associated with the activation of brain immune cells called microglia, which purge an Alzheimer\u2019s hallmark \u2013 amyloid beta plaque, junk protein that accumulates between brain cells.\nImmune signaling\nIn 2016, researchers discovered that light flickering at 40 Hz mobilized microglia in mice afflicted with Alzheimer\u2019s to clean up that junk.\u00a0 The new study looked for brain chemistry that connects the flicker with microglial and other immune activation in mice and exposed a surge of 20 cytokines \u2013 small proteins secreted externally by cells and which signal to other cells. Accompanying the cytokine release, internal cell chemistry \u2013 the activation of proteins by phosphate groups \u2013 left behind a strong calling card.\n\u201cThe phosphoproteins showed up first. It looked as though they were leading, and our hypothesis is that they triggered the release of the cytokines,\u201d said Singer, who co-led the new study and is an\u00a0 assistant professor in the Wallace H. Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering at Georgia Tech and Emory .\n\u201cBeyond cytokines that may be signaling to microglia, a number of factors that we identified have the potential to support neural health,\u201d said Levi Wood, who co-led the study with Singer and is an\u00a0 assistant professor in Georgia Tech\u2019s George W. Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering .\nThe team published\u00a0its findings\u00a0 in the\u00a0 Journal of Neuroscience \u00a0on February 5, 2020 . The research was funded by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke at the National Institutes of Health, and by the Packard Foundation.\nSinger was co-first author on\u00a0 the original 2016 study at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , in which the therapeutic effects of 40 Hz were first discovered in mice.\nSci-fi surrealness\nAlzheimer\u2019s strikes, with few exceptions, late in life. It\u00a0 destroys up to 30% of a brain\u2019s mass , carving out ravines and depositing piles of amyloid plaque, which builds up outside of neurons. Inside neurons, phosphorylated\u00a0 tau protein \u00a0forms similar junk known as\u00a0 neurofibrillary tangles \u00a0suspected of destroying mental functions and neurons.\nAfter many decades of failed Alzheimer\u2019s drug trials costing billions, flickering light as a potentially successful Alzheimer\u2019s therapy seems surreal even to the researchers.\n\u201cSometimes it does feel like science fiction,\u201d Singer said.\nThe 40 Hz frequency stems from the observation that brains of Alzheimer\u2019s patients suffer early on from a lack of what is called gamma, moments of gentle, constant brain waves acting like a dance beat for neuron activity. Its most common frequency is right around 40 Hz, and exposing mice to light flickering at that frequency restored gamma and also appears to have prevented heavy Alzheimer\u2019s brain damage.\nAdding to the surrealness, gamma has also been associated with esoteric mind expansion practices, in which practitioners perform light and sound meditation. Then, in 2016, research connected gamma to working memory, a function key to train of thought.\nCytokine bonanza\nIn the current study, the surging cytokines hinted at a connection with microglial activity, and in particular, the cytokine\u00a0 Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor \u00a0(M-CSF).\n\u201cM-CSF was the thing that yelled, \u2018Microglia activation!\u2019\u201d Singer said.\nThe researchers will look for a causal connection to microglia activation in an upcoming study, but the overall surge of cytokines was a good sign in general, they said.\n\u201cThe vast majority of cytokines went up, some anti-inflammatory and some inflammatory, and it was a transient response,\u201d Wood said. \u201cOften, a transient inflammatory response can promote pathogen clearance; it can promote repair.\u201d\n\u201cGenerally, you think of an inflammatory response as being bad if it\u2019s chronic, and this was rapid and then dropped off, so we think that was probably beneficial,\u201d Singer added.\nChemical timing\nThe 40 Hz stimulation did not need long to trigger the cytokine surge.\n\u201cWe found an increase in cytokines after an hour of stimulation,\u201d Garza said. \u201cWe saw phosphoprotein signals after about 15 minutes of flickering.\u201d\nPerhaps about 15 minutes was enough to start processes inside of cells and about 45 more minutes were needed for the cells to secrete cytokines. It is too early to know.\n20 Hz bombshell\nAs controls, the researchers applied three additional light stimuli, and to their astonishment, all three had some effect on cytokines. But stimulating with 20 Hz stole the show.\n\u201cAt 20 Hz, cytokine levels were way down. That could be useful, too. There may be circumstances where you want to suppress cytokines,\u201d Singer said. \u201cWe\u2019re thinking different kinds of stimulation could potentially become a platform of tools in a variety of contexts like Parkinson\u2019s or schizophrenia. Many neurological disorders are associated with immune response.\u201d\nThe research team warns against people improvising light therapies on their own, since more data is needed to thoroughly establish effects on humans, and getting frequencies wrong could possibly even do damage.\nAlso read:\nA family coping with Alzheimer\u2019s leads you through our fight against it\nAlso read:\nWhy Alzheimer\u2019s research probably needs to shift focus\nLu Zhang and Ben Borron\u00a0 from the Wallace H.
