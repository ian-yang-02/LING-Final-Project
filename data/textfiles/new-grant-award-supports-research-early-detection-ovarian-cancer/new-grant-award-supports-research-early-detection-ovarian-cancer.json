The work is led by John McDonald, a professor in the School of Biological Sciences.

In contrast, when caught early \u201cabout 94 percent of patients live longer than five years after diagnosis,\u201d according to the American Cancer Society.\nThe problem is that there is no good test for detecting the disease at an early stage.\nAbout seven years ago McDonald and colleagues decided to see if they could change that by merging the disparate disciplines of biology, analytical chemistry and computer science. \u201cBringing the computer into it was novel at the time,\u201d said McDonald, who is also director of Georgia Tech\u2019s Integrated Cancer Research Center.\nHis Georgia Tech collaborators on the initial work were Professor Facundo Fern\u00e1ndez, the Vasser Woolley Foundation Chair in Bioanalytical Chemistry, and Alex Gray, an assistant professor of computer science (Gray has since left Georgia Tech to become VP for Artificial Intelligence Science at IBM). They were joined by clinical consultant Dr. Benedict Benigno, a gynecological oncologist and CEO of the Ovarian Cancer Institute in Atlanta.\nPromising Results\nThe researchers initially analyzed blood samples from 49 healthy women and 46 with early-stage ovarian cancer. They specifically focused on metabolites in those samples. Metabolites are molecules like fatty acids that our cells produce through enzymatic reactions.\nIn the molecular equivalent of finding needles in a haystack, they proceeded to analyze some 40,000 metabolites to see if there were any associated with the cancer patients that differed from those in samples from the healthy women. These could be biomarkers for the disease; molecules to screen for in an annual test.\nThrough a variety of techniques, the team first pared down the original thousands of metabolites to a collection of 255 candidate biomarkers. They then applied machine learning to that set, asking the computer to find any metabolites that were over- or under-expressed in the cancer samples.\n\u201cThat\u2019s what machine learning is all about,\u201d McDonald said. \u201cThe computer is simply looking for correlations in very large data sets, then it comes back to you with what it has found.\u201d\nIn 2015 the team reported in the journal Scientific Reports the discovery of 16 metabolites that could distinguish women with ovarian cancer from those without the disease with 100 percent accuracy. \u201cBasically we modeled the face of cancer at the metabolic level,\u201d McDonald said.\nMoving Forward\nWith the new $100,000 grant, the researchers hope to validate their earlier work with samples from some 1,000 women, as compared to the roughly 100 they originally studied. The new study will also include samples from a much more diverse set of women (the original samples were from Caucasian women).\nThey also aim to expand the work to look for biomarkers associated with different types of ovarian cancer. \u201cWe want to be able to distinguish between a Type II cancer with high malignant potential \u2013 one that\u2019s highly likely to spread outside the ovary \u2013 and a Type I with low malignant potential. A cancer with high malignant potential you\u2019d want to treat right away, while a cancer with low malignant potential might not require immediate surgery,\u201d McDonald said.\nIn conclusion, McDonald said, \u201cit\u2019s exciting because the initial results look like [our approach] might work.\u201d\nResearch News\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\n177 North Avenue\nAtlanta, Georgia 30332-0181\u00a0 USA\nMedia Relations Assistance : John Toon (404-894-6986) (jtoon@gatech.edu).\nWriter : Elizabeth Thomson\nAdditional Images\nContact\nJohn Toon\nResearch News\n(404) 894-6986\nEmail\njtoon@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
