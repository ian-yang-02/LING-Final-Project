Transit is critical to the future of Georgia Tech, which aims to provide more sustainable service offerings to the campus community. The addition of PTS to the I&S portfolio complements and advances several of the Institute\u2019s strategic goals and efforts for which I&S is responsible. These include the Sustainability Next Plan, the Comprehensive Campus Plan, and the Living Campus initiative. In addition, PTS leadership values operational strategies that prioritize sustainability, exceptional service, and responsible fiscal stewardship. This is evident with their transition one year ago to a self-operation model and the recent addition of fuel-efficient, hybrid vehicles to the Stinger bus fleet.\nAs the PTS team transitions to I&S, they will report temporarily to Jerel Harris, assistant vice president for Environmental Health and Safety, until a permanent reporting structure is established. To help ensure a smooth transition, no changes to PTS\u2019s organizational structure or service offerings will happen until the PTS team is fully integrated and is able to take part in long-term visioning and goal-setting.\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nParking and Transportation Services\nInfrastructure and Sustainability\nContact\nRachael Pocklington\nInstitute Communications\nEmail\nrpocklington@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
