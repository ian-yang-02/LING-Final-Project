They oohed in awe as the booster rockets separated, then roared when the pair landed in synchronicity.\nAnd they howled with laughter when they saw a car in space.\n\u201cIt was awesome! It was unbelievable to see something so historic,\u201d said Swapnil Pujari.\nHe was one of 30 or so Georgia Tech aerospace engineering students who crowded into a lab in the Engineering Science and Mechanics Building Tuesday afternoon to watch a livestream of SpaceX\u2019s first test flight of the world\u2019s most powerful rocket \u2014 the Falcon Heavy.\nFrom the sound in the room, the launch was an unquestionable success.\n\u201cI got goosebumps when I saw the two boosters land at the same time,\u201d said William Jun, a fourth-year undergraduate in the Daniel Guggenheim School of Aerospace Engineering. \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve witnessed the beginning of a new era.\u201d\nIt\u2019s hard to imagine what he\u2019ll feel the next time the Falcon Heavy launches.\nTuesday\u2019s launch only carried one piece of cargo, a red Tesla Roadster that is expected to orbit the sun for the next billion years. The next Heavy rocket will be stuffed with satellites. One of them is scheduled to be Prox-1, a 154-pound, rectangular-shaped metal box that was built and tested by Jun, Pujari and other Georgia Tech students. It\u2019s the first spacecraft built on campus that will fly in space.\n\u201cThis is the part of the space industry that we live for,\u201d said Professor Glenn Lightsey, who watched the launch with the students. \u201cUltimately, there is a day when you find out if the thing you\u2019ve thought about and planned for actually works or not. Today (Tuesday) it happened for SpaceX. Six months from now, it will happen for us at Georgia Tech.\u201d\nProx-1 is a 24\u201d by 22\u201d by 12\u201d satellite that will deploy a smaller spacecraft, LightSail 2, which will attempt the first controlled solar sail flight in Earth orbit.\nAs that sail unfurls, Prox-1 will move and observe LightSail from a short distance and acquire images of the glimmering structure in action.\u00a0Georgia Tech will serve as mission control.\n\u201cOur students are going to have their hardware in space, making measurements and sending their data back to Earth,\u201d said Lightsey. \u201cThis is a really unique experience that wasn\u2019t even possible before this century. It\u2019s a new way of doing things in STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) education.\u201d\nProx-1 is currently at the Air Force Research Lab in New Mexico, undergoing a series of tests to make sure the satellite can withstand the rugged, violent ride inside the Falcon Heavy. It\u2019s one of the final pre-flight steps for a six-year project that has included more than 400 Georgia Tech students. From there it will be shipped to Florida and await an official launch date from SpaceX.\nAlthough they enjoyed the experience together for Tuesday\u2019s launch, don\u2019t expect many of the same students to gather on campus to watch Prox-1 blast into space.\n\u201cOh, I will be in Florida for sure!\u201d said Pujari.\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nProx-1 Leaves Campus\nProx-1 Mission Website\nDaniel Guggenheim School of Aerospace Engineering\nContact\nJason Maderer\nNational Media Relations\nmaderer@gatech.edu\n404-660-2926\nEmail\nmaderer@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
