The black holes\u2014which represent those detected by LIGO on Dec. 26, 2015\u2014were 14 and 8 times the mass of the sun, until they merged, forming a single black hole 21 times the mass of the sun. In reality, the area near the black holes would appear highly warped, and the gravitational waves would be difficult to see directly. Image credit: LIGO/T. Pyle\nJun 15, 2016\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nThe Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) Scientific Collaboration, which includes Georgia Tech researchers, and the Virgo collaboration have observed a second gravitational wave event. The observation was made in the early morning hours (UTC) of December 26, 2015. It is smaller than the initial, historic detection made in September 2015, but was also produced by a pair of colliding black holes. Gravitational waves, or ripples in the fabric of spacetime, carry information about their origins and the nature of gravity that cannot otherwise be obtained. Physicists say the December waves were produced during the final moments of the merger of two black holes\u201414 and eight times the mass of the sun\u2014to produce a single, more massive spinning black hole that is 21 times the mass of the sun. LIGO estimated the September black holes were 29 and 36 times the mass of the sun. \u201cIt is very significant that these black holes were much less massive than those observed in the first detection,\u201d said Gabriela Gonzalez, LIGO Scientific Collaboration spokesperson. \u201cBecause of their lighter masses compared to the first detection, they spent more time\u2014about one second\u2014in the sensitive band of the detectors. It is a promising start to mapping the populations of black holes in our universe.\u201d The signal was detected by both of the twin LIGO detectors located in Louisiana and the state of Washington. During the merger, which occurred approximately 1.4 billion years ago, a quantity of energy roughly equivalent to the mass of the sun was converted into gravitational waves. The detected signal comes from the last 27 orbits of the black holes before their merger. \u201cOnce again, the collaborative work of hundreds of scientists and engineers has allowed us to pull the curtains and peek into the new window of the universe that was opened last September,\u201d said Laura Cadonati, Georgia Tech professor and chair of LIGO\u2019s data analysis council. \u201cWe now have two strong signals from merging black holes and we are now excitingly awaiting for more discoveries to come in the next months as the detectors improve and our analysis is robust.\u201d Cadonati is one of 12 Georgia Tech faculty members, postdoctoral researchers and students in the LIGO Scientific Collaboration. The team continues to develop tools and techniques to detect, analyze and characterize sources from the first science run of Advanced LIGO, including this second event. \u201cWith this second discovery of a binary black hole merger, we begin to unveil a population of black holes in the universe,\u201d said Professor Deirdre Shoemaker, director of Georgia Tech\u2019s\nCenter for Relativistic Astrophysics\nand a member of LIGO. \u201cThis hints at the excitement to come as we probe deeper into the sky, listening to the story gravity is telling us about the universe.\u201d The first detection of gravitational waves, announced on February 11, 2016, was a milestone in physics and astronomy. It confirmed a major prediction of Albert Einstein\u2019s 1915 general theory of relativity and marked the beginning of the new field of gravitational-wave astronomy. LIGO research is carried out by the LIGO Scientific Collaboration, a group of more than 1,000 scientists from universities around the United States and in 14 other countries. More than 90 universities and research institutes in the LSC, including Georgia Tech, develop detector technology and analyze data. Approximately 250 students are strong contributing members of the collaboration. The LIGO Observatories are funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF), and were conceived, built and are operated by Caltech and MIT. The new discovery, accepted for publication in the journal\nPhysical Review Letters , was made by the LIGO Scientific Collaboration (which includes the GEO Collaboration and the Australian Consortium for Interferometric Gravitational Astronomy) and the Virgo Collaboration using data from the two LIGO detectors.\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nCenter for Relativistic Astrophysics\nContact\nJason Maderer jason.maderer@comm.gatech.edu\nEmail\njason.maderer@comm.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
