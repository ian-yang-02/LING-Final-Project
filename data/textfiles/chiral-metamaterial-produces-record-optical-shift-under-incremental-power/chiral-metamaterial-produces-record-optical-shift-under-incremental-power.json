(Credit: Rob Felt, Georgia Tech)\nMar 01, 2017\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nGeorgia Institute of Technology researchers have demonstrated an optical metamaterial whose chiroptical properties in the nonlinear regime produce a significant spectral shift with power levels in the milliwatt range.\nThe researchers recently demonstrated properties of their chiral metamaterial, in which they spectrally modified two absorptive resonances by incrementally exposing the material to power intensities beyond its linear optical regime. With a 15 milliwatt change in excitation power, they measured a 10-nanometer spectral shift in the material\u2019s transmission resonances and a 14-degree polarization rotation.\nThe researchers believe that may be the strongest nonlinear optical rotation ever reported for a chiral metamaterial, and is about a hundred thousand times larger than the current record measurement for this type of structure. The research, supported by the National Science Foundation and the Air Force Research Laboratory, was reported February 27 in the journal\nNature Communications .\n\u201cNanoscale chiral structures offer an approach to modulating optical signals with relatively small variations in input power,\u201d said Sean Rodrigues, a Ph.D. candidate who led the research in the laboratory of Associate Professor\nWenshan Cai\nin Georgia Tech\u2019s\nSchool of Electrical and Computer Engineering . \u201cTo see this kind of change in such a thin material makes chiroptical metamaterials an interesting new platform for optical signal modulation.\u201d\nThis modulation of chiroptical responses from metamaterials by manipulating input power offers the potential for new types of active optics such as all-optical switching and light modulation. The technologies could have applications in such areas as data processing, sensing and communications.\nChiral materials exhibit optical properties that differ depending on their opposing circular polarizations. The differences between these responses, which are created by the nanoscale patterning of absorptive materials, can be utilized to create large chiroptical resonances. To be useful in applications such as all-optical switching, these resonances would need to be induced by external tuning \u2013 such as variations in power input.\n\u201cWhen you increase the power, you shift the spectrum,\u201d Rodrigues said. \u201cIn effect, you change the transmission at certain wavelengths, meaning you\u2019re changing the amount of light passing through the sample by simply modifying input power.\u201d For optical engineers, that could be the basis for a switch.\nThe material demonstrated by Cai\u2019s lab are made by nano-patterning layers of silver \u2013 approximately 33 nanometers thick \u2013 onto glass substrates. Between the carefully-designed silver layers is a 45-nanometer layer of dielectric material. An elliptical pattern is created using electron beam lithography, then the entire structure is encapsulated within a dielectric material to prevent oxidation.\n\u201cIt is the engineering of these structures that gives us these chiral optical properties,\u201d Rodrigues explained. \u201cThe goal is really to take advantage of the discrepancy between one circular polarization versus the other to create the broadband resonances we need.\u201d\nThe material operates in the visible to near-infrared spectrum, at approximately 740 to 1,000 nanometers. The optical rotation and circular dichroism measurements were taken with the beam entering the material at a normal incident angle.\nThe researchers induced the change in circular dichroism by increasing the optical power applied to the material from 0.5 milliwatts up to 15 milliwatts. While that is comparatively low power for a laser system, it has a high enough energy flux (energy transfer in time) to instigate change.\n\u201cThe beam size is roughly 40 microns, so it is really focused,\u201d said Rodrigues. \u201cWe are putting a lot of energy into a small area, which causes the effect to be fairly intense.\u201d\nThe researchers don\u2019t yet know what prompts the change, but suspect that thermal processes may be involved in altering the material\u2019s properties to boost the circular dichroism. Tests show that the power applications do not damage the metamaterial.\nCai\u2019s laboratory has been studying chiral materials of different kinds for a variety of optical applications. In June 2015, they\nreported the realization\nof one of the long-standing theoretical predictions in nonlinear optical metamaterials: creation of a nonlinear material that has opposite refractive indices at the fundamental and harmonic frequencies of light. Such a material, which doesn\u2019t exist naturally, had been predicted for nearly a decade.\nIn addition to those already mentioned, the research included Shoufeng Lan, Lei Kang, Yonghao Cui, Patrick Panuski, Shengxiang Wang and Augustine M.
