Undergraduate students have until 5 p.m. on Friday, March 26, to vote, and graduate students have until 5 p.m. on Monday, March 29. All voting can be done at\nelections.gatech.edu .\nUndergraduate students have four items to vote on: the undergraduate presidential ticket, members of the Undergraduate House of Representatives (UHR), a proposed constitutional amendment, and a referendum on changing the fight song. Two teams are running for the presidential ticket: Sam Ellis and Ajanta Choudhury and Kyle Smith and Salmata Barrie for president and vice president, respectively. Seats in UHR are broken down by academic major, class/year, and special constituencies, including transfer and international students.\nThe constitutional amendment, if passed, would allow for amendments to the undergraduate SGA\u2019s constitution to pass with either 2/3 of the student body\u2019s votes or 3/4 of UHR\u2019s votes. The amendment requires 2/3 of the votes cast in this election to pass. Full details can be found\nhere .\nBoth undergraduate and graduate students can vote on the referendum on changes to the fight song. The change would switch a word in the second verse of \u201cRamblin\u2019 Wreck.\u201d Instead of saying, \u201cIf I had a daughter, sir / I\u2019d dress her in white and gold / and put her on the campus / to cheer the brave and bold\u201d to \u201cIf I had a daughter, sir / I\u2019d dress her in white and gold / and put her on the campus / to\njoin\nthe brave and bold.\u201d\nFinally, graduate students can also vote on the graduate presidential ticket. The only pair running is Stephen Eick for president and Paulino \u201cPJ\u201d Jarquin for executive vice president. Elections for the Graduate Student Senate (GSS) will be held in the fall.\nLearn more about the responsibilities of each SGA position on the organization\u2019s\nwebsite .\nAdditional Images\nContact\nGrace Wyner\nInstitute Communications\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
