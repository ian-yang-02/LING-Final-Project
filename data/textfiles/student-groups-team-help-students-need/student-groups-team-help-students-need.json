Each ticket costs $5 and one ticket can count toward one prize basket. The range of baskets includes a Sustainable Living Basket (which includes an indoor mushroom growing kit), two Board Game Bundles, and a School Spirit Basket (featuring a Buzz Pillow Pet). The Student Hospital Connections, Residence Hall Association, Association of Environmental Engineers and Scientists, and Pride Alliance also pitched in and provided donations to make the raffle possible.\nWith the purchase of at least one ticket, people will automatically be entered to win a $50 Amazon gift card. SOS will also ship the prizes to winners if they are off campus.\u00a0 The raffle entry will close on Friday, March 26, and the drawing for the winners will take place on March 27 at 7 p.m.\nTickets can be purchased using the following link:\nforms.gle/98zExHYJxHUwunAT8\nIf you have any questions, contact Silas Ever, SOS treasurer, at lever3@gatech.edu.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nVanesa Vargas\nInstitute Communications\nEmail\nstucomm@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
