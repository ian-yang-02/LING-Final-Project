He suspected high ammonia levels, which proved chemically less feasible. Today, many scientists suspect the warming gas was methane. Credit:\u00a0NASA-JPL\nDec 11, 2017\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nSomewhere in our galaxy, an exoplanet is probably orbiting a star that\u2019s colder than our sun, but instead of freezing solid, the planet might be cozy warm thanks to a greenhouse effect caused by methane in its atmosphere.\nNASA astrobiologists from the Georgia Institute of Technology have developed a comprehensive new model that shows how planetary chemistry could make that happen. The model, published in a\u00a0 new study in the journal\u00a0 Nature Geoscience , was based on a likely scenario on Earth three billion years ago\u00a0and was actually built around its possible geological and biological chemistry.\nThe sun produced a quarter less light and heat then, but Earth remained temperate, and methane may have saved our planet from an eon-long deep-freeze, scientists hypothesize. Had it not, we and most other complex life probably wouldn\u2019t be here today.\nThe new model combined multiple microbial metabolic processes with volcanic, oceanic and atmospheric activities, which may make it the most comprehensive of its kind to date. But while studying Earth\u2019s distant past, the Georgia Tech researchers aimed their model light-years away, wanting it to someday help interpret conditions on recently discovered exoplanets.\nThe researchers set the model\u2019s parameters broadly so that they could apply not only to our own planet but potentially also to its siblings with their varying sizes, geologies, and lifeforms.\nEarth and its siblings\n\u201cWe really had an eye to future use with exoplanets for a reason,\u201d said\u00a0 Chris Reinhard, the study\u2019s principal investigator \u00a0and an assistant professor in Georgia Tech\u2019s School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences. \u201cIt\u2019s possible that the atmospheric methane models that we are exploring for the early Earth represent conditions common to biospheres throughout our galaxy because they don\u2019t require such an advanced stage of evolution like we have here on Earth now.\u201d\nReinhard and first author Kazumi Ozaki\u00a0 published their\u00a0 Nature Geoscience \u00a0paper on December 11, 2017 . The research was supported by the NASA Postdoctoral Program, the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, the NASA Astrobiology Institute and the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation.\nPrevious models have examined the mix of atmospheric gases needed to keep Earth warm in spite of the sun\u2019s former faintness, or studied isolated microbial metabolisms that could have made the needed methane. \u201cIn isolation, each metabolism hasn\u2019t made for productive models that accounted well for that much methane,\u201d Reinhard said.\nThe Georgia Tech researchers synergized those isolated microbial metabolisms, including ancient photosynthesis, with geological chemistry to create a model reflective of the complexity of an entire living planet. And the model\u2019s methane production ballooned.\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to think about the mechanisms controlling the atmospheric levels of greenhouse gases in the framework of all biogeochemical cycles in the ocean and atmosphere,\u201d said first author Ozaki, a postdoctoral assistant.\nAlso READ: The Earth is not a lab beaker; it\u2019s a shifty, humongous lab\nCarl Sagan and the faint Sun\nThe Georgia Tech model strengthens a leading hypothesis that attempts to explain a mystery called\u00a0 the \u201cfaint young Sun paradox\u201d \u00a0pointed out by\u00a0 iconic late astronomer Carl Sagan \u00a0and his Cornell University colleague George Mullen in 1972.\nAstronomers noticed long ago that stars burned\u00a0 brighter as they matured and weaker in their youths . They calculated that about two billion years ago, our sun must have shone about 25 percent fainter than it does today.\nThat would have been too cold for any liquid water to exist on Earth, but paradoxically, strong evidence says that liquid water did exist. \u201cBased on the observation of the geological record, we know that there must have been liquid water,\u201d Reinhard said, \u201cand in some cases, we know that temperatures were similar to how they are today, if not a little warmer.\u201d\nSagan and Mullen postulated that Earth\u2019s atmosphere must have\u00a0 created a greenhouse effect \u00a0that saved it. Back then, they suspected ammonia was at work, but chemically, that idea proved less feasible.\n\u201cMethane\u00a0 has taken a lead role \u00a0in this hypothesis,\u201d Reinhard said. \u201cWhen oxygen and methane enter the atmosphere, they chemically cancel each other out over time in a complex chain of chemical reactions. Because there was extremely little oxygen in the air back then, it would have allowed for methane to build up much higher levels than today.\u201d\nIron, and rust photosynthesis\nAt the core of the model are two different types of photosynthesis. But three billion years ago, the dominant type of\u00a0 photosynthesis we know today \u00a0that pumps out oxygen may not have even existed yet.\nInstead, two other very primitive bacterial photosynthetic processes likely were essential to Earth\u2019s ancient biosphere. One transformed iron in the ocean into rust, and the other photosynthesized hydrogen into formaldehyde.\n\u201cThe model relied on lots of volcanic activity spewing out hydrogen,\u201d Ozaki said. Other bacteria fermented the formaldehyde, and other bacteria, still, turned the fermented product into methane.\nThe two photosynthetic processes served as the watch spring of the model\u2019s clockwork, which pulled in 359 previously established biogeochemical reactions spanning land, sea and air.\n3,000,000 runs and raging methane\nThe model was not the type of simulation that produces a video animation of Earth\u2019s ancient biogeochemistry. Instead, the model mathematically analyzed the processes, and the output was numbers and graphs.\nOzaki ran the model more than 3 million times, varying parameters, and found that if the model contained both forms of photosynthesis operating in tandem, that 24 percent of the runs produced enough methane to create the balance needed in the atmosphere to maintain the greenhouse effect and keep ancient Earth, or possibly an exoplanet, temperate.\n\u201cThat translates into about a 24 percent probability that this model would produce a stable, warm climate on the ancient Earth with a faint sun or on an Earth-like exoplanet around a dimmer star,\u201d Reinhard said. \u201cOther models that looked at these photosynthetic metabolisms in isolation have much lower probabilities of producing enough methane to keep the climate warm.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re confident that this rather unique statistical approach means that you can take the basic insights of this new model to the bank,\u201d he said.\nOther explanations for the \u201cfaint young Sun paradox\u201d have been more cataclysmic and perhaps less regular in their dynamics. They include ideas about routine asteroid strikes stirring up seismic activity thus resulting in more methane production, or about\u00a0 the sun consistently firing coronal mass ejections\u00a0 at Earth, heating it up.\nAlso READ: Some good news on climate change and methane\nThe research was co-authored by Eiichi Tajika, Peng K.
