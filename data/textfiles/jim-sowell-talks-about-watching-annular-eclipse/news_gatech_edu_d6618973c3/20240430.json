It will cross North, Central, and South America with varying degrees of visibility.\n\"The entire country will see at least a partial eclipse,\" Sowell said. \"Go out and experience it and see it for yourself.\"\nIn Atlanta, viewers will see a partial solar eclipse and notice the sky is darker than usual. In parts of the country where the eclipse will be seen in totality, it will look like a \"ring of fire\" around the moon. This rare event won\u2019t happen again in the U.S. for more than 20 years.\nThe Georgia Tech Observatory will be open for viewing of the event on Oct. 14 from 11:30 a.m. to 3 p.m., with telescopes on the grounds of the Howey Physics Building. All viewing events are contingent on clear weather; monitor\nastronomy.gatech.edu\nfor updates.\nVideo courtesy of\nThe Weather Channel .\nAdditional Media\nRelated links\nGeorgia Tech Observatory\nNASA: Oct. 14, 2023, Annular Eclipse Information\nContact\nJess Hunt-Ralston\nCollege of Sciences\nGeorgia Tech\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
