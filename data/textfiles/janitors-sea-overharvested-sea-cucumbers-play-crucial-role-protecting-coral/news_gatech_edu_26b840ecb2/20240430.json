Known as the rainforests of the sea, they create habitats for 25% of all marine organisms, despite only covering less than 1% of the ocean\u2019s area.\nCoral patches the width and height of basketball arenas used to be common throughout the world\u2019s oceans. But due to numerous human-generated stresses and coral disease, which is known to be associated with ocean sediments, most of the world\u2019s coral is gone.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like if all the pine trees in Georgia disappeared over a period of 30 to 40 years,\u201d said\u00a0 Mark Hay , Regents\u2019 Chair and the Harry and Anna Teasley Chair in Environmental Biology in the\u00a0 School of Biological Sciences \u00a0at the Georgia Institute of Technology. \u201cJust imagine how that affects biodiversity and ecosystems of the ocean.\u201d\nIn first-of-its-kind research, Hay, along with research scientist\u00a0 Cody Clements , discovered a crucial missing element that plays a profound role in keeping coral healthy \u2014 an animal of overlooked importance known as a sea cucumber.\nRead about how they figured it out at Georgia Tech Research News .\nContact\nCatherine Barzler, Senior Research Writer/Editor\ncatherine.barzler@gatech.edu\nEmail\ncatherine.barzler@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
