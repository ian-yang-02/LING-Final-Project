The Council will identify issues of campus racial and gender disparity, bias, and inequity to be addressed in order to deliver upon the Institute\u2019s vision of diversity and inclusion. The members represent diverse voices and perspectives from staff, faculty, and students.\u00a0Their initial meeting will be Nov. 30.\nIn addition to Husbands Fealing, other Ivan Allen Faculty appointed are Carol Colatrella,\u00a0 associate dean for graduate studies and faculty development; Mary Frank Fox, ADVANCE Professor in the School of Public Policy; and Richard Utz, chair of the School of Literature, Media, and Communication.\nIn addition to her appointment to the Institute council, Colatrella also leads the Ivan Allen College\nDiversity and Inclusion Council .\nThe GTDEIC will continuously monitor and assess the Institute\u2019s progress on achieving its goals for becoming a model campus community for diversity, equity, and inclusion and develop evidenced, informed recommendations, which they will submit periodically to\u00a0Cabrera and the Institute\u2019s Executive Leadership Team for consideration in developing strategic actions.\n\u201cOur Diversity and Inclusion Council is one of several action steps announced this past summer to deliver on our promise of inclusion,\u201d said President Cabrera. \u201cAs outlined in our\nnew strategic plan , we are striving to remove barriers to access and success, and to build an inclusive community where people of all backgrounds have the opportunity to learn and contribute to our mission.\u202fI am grateful to the individuals who volunteered to serve as inaugural council members, and\u00a0look forward to working closely with them as they identify issues and propose new courses of action.\u201d\nCampus research has revealed discrepancies in the satisfaction levels of various groups. The\n2017 Faculty and Staff Climate Assessment Surveys\nand\n2018 Student Climate Assessment Survey\nrevealed high levels of faculty, staff, and student satisfaction on a wide array of campus experiences on a number of dimensions measured across multiple social identities, such as faculty rank, job function, gender, and race.\n\u201cThe surveys also revealed there are some important differences in levels of satisfaction reported regarding some campus experiences,\u201d said Archie Ervin, vice president for\nInstitute Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion \u00a0(IDEI). \u201cDisaggregation of the data by social identity reveal lower levels of satisfaction with campus experiences on a number of dimensions measured by the survey that deserve attention and deeper exploration to understand why the differences exist and what action steps, if any, could be taken to address root causes of problematic or potentially adverse differences of experiences for campus members.\u201d\n\u201cIn sum, the climate assessment reports help us to understand our strengths and suggest areas where we should focus our attention to improve experiences of some members of the Tech community,\u201d Ervin added. \u201cGiven the baseline data obtained by the Climate Assessment Surveys, and the recent development of college-level diversity councils, the establishment of an Institute-wide council on diversity, equity, and inclusion is both timely and necessary for the next iteration of an improved overarching strategy to achieve Tech\u2019s goals for diversity and inclusion.\u201d\nThe GTDEIC will be charged with the following objectives:\nProvide a forum for Georgia Tech stakeholders representing all divisions of the Institute to identify and consider forward-looking, proactive strategies, methods, and approaches to enhance diversity, equity, and inclusion practices and outcomes at Georgia Tech;\nCreate a setting in which Institute leadership can share and vet diversity, equity, and inclusion-related issues and opportunities; and\nDevelop data-informed recommendations to improve diversity, equity and inclusion and allow the Institute to lead by example as a model institution advancing inclusive innovation.\nThe group will be chaired by Ervin, and Pearl Alexander, executive director of IDEI\u2019s Staff Diversity, Inclusion, and Engagement, will serve as vice chair. The GTDEIC is composed of representatives from across the campus academic and administrative units, faculty, staff\u00a0and student governance (undergraduate and graduate) and other faculty and staff who enhance the diversity of perspective of the Council.\nO\nOther council members include the following:\nChaouki Abdallah, Maryam Alavi, Sonia Alverez-Robinson, Nelson Baker, Terry Blum, Sandi Bramblett, Barrett Carson, Kim Cobb, Cheryl Cofield, Melanie DeMaeyer, Lynn Durham, Shoshanna Engel, Bonnie Ferri, Byron Fitch, Kelly Fox, Steven French, Steven Girardot, Rebecca \u201cBeki\u201d Grinter, Martha Grover, Lea Harris, James Hudgens, Joe Hughes, Javier Irizarry, Charles Isbell, Laurence Jacobs, Denise Johnson-Marshall, Paul Kohn, Renee Kopkowski, Keona Lewis, Brielle Lonsberry, Susan Lozier, Joe Ludlum, Steve McLaughlin, Joseph Montoya, Tegra Myanna, Frank Neville, Loraine Phillips, Dana Randall, Stephanie Ray, Elora Raymond, Catherine Ross, David Ross, Leslie Sharp, Todd Stansbury, John Stein, Yuanzhi Tang, Frank Trammer, and Mitchell Walker.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nCourtney Hill\nCommunications Manager\nInstitute Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion\ncourtney.hill@gatech.edu\nEmail\ncourtney.hill@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
