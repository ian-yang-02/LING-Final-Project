He is competing in the Championship Ice Dance division with his partner, Breelie Taylor, from Ringgold, Georgia.\nVollmer and his partner train with the Atlanta Figure Skating Club and competed as juniors at last year\u2019s skating championships. This year they are competing at the senior level.\nVollmer doesn\u2019t just excel on the ice, he\u2019s an outstanding student as well. He graduated from UCLA with degrees in both geophysics and math at the age of 19. He earned a Presidential Fellowship from Georgia Tech and joined the ocean science and engineering program. He works with Professor Jean Lynch-Stieglitz in a research group that makes chemical and isotopic measurements of the tiny shells of micro-organisms that accumulate on the ocean floor in order to reconstruct past states of the ocean and atmosphere.\nVollmer, who also serves as a teaching assistant, is currently working on a project that involves reconstructing the deep ocean oxygen content in order to better understand why atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations were so low during the height of the Ice Age.\n\u201cTyler is an excellent student \u2014 very smart and capable in the lab as well,\u201d Lynch-Stieglitz said. \u201cHe really enjoys being a TA, and the students think he does a great job with it.\u201d\nDespite his prowess in skates, he\u2019s looking to a future in science. His goal is to become a professor to teach and train a new generation of climate scientists.\nYou can catch Vollmer in competition live Friday night by tuning in to the first phase of competition on NBCSN. The Rhythm Dance airs live from 4 to 6 p.m. The Free Dance follows on Saturday night, starting at 9 p.m.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nSteven Norris , Georgia Tech Institute Communications\nEmail\nstephen.norris@comm.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
