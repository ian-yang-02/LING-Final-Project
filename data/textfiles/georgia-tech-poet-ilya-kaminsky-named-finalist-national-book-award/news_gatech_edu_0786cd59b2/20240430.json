The\nNational Book Foundation\nwill announce the winner Nov. 20.\nThis is believed to be the first time a non-U.S. born refugee is a finalist for the National Book Award in Poetry, according to the foundation.\n\u201cIt is a great honor to be named a finalist for the National Book Award among poets whose work I so admire and have read with much attention for some time now,\u201d\nKaminsky\nsaid. \u201cI have worked on this book for more than a decade, and it is gratifying and humbling to see the response.\u201d\nKaminsky is the Margaret T. and Henry C. Bourne Jr. Chair in Poetry in the\nSchool of Literature, Media and Communication\nand is director of the\nPoetry@Tech\nprogram, which engages Georgia Tech students and the public, and presents the South\u2019s premier poetry reading series. In addition to his stature as one of his generation\u2019s greatest poets, Kaminsky also has worked with refugees. Kaminsky, who is Jewish, was born in Odessa, Ukraine, in 1977, when the country was still part of the Soviet Union. His family was granted asylum in the United States in 1993. He joined Georgia Tech in 2018.\nDeaf Republic\nfollows the lives of ordinary citizens living in an occupied country who go deaf the moment a boy with a hearing impairment is shot and killed by soldiers. It was inspired by Kaminsky\u2019s own experience of navigating his youth in the Soviet Union as a person living with hearing impairment.\nJohn Tone, interim dean of the\nIvan Allen College , congratulated Kaminsky for being named a finalist, and said his appointment in 2018 highlighted the College\u2019s commitment to integrating strong liberal arts perspectives into the curriculum of one of the top technological research universities in the country.\n\u201cI am so proud that Ilya is a member of the faculty of the Ivan Allen College of Liberal Arts, where we work every day to bring innovative human-centered scholarship and creativity to bear on crucial issues here in Atlanta and all around the globe,\u201d\nTone\nsaid.\n\u201cThrough his words, and his work to raise awareness and support for refugees around the world, Ilya has shown how an engaged and vital liberal arts can help change the world for the better. Through the Poetry@Tech program, he continues that important mission,\u201d Tone said. \u201cAmong other things, he has helped bring poetry to public school classrooms in Atlanta, broadened the conversation about poetry to include marginalized communities, and organized a series of upcoming events focused on the work of refugee poets.\u201d\nRichard Utz , chair and professor in the School of Literature, Media, and Communication, said it is an \u201cincredible honor to have Ilya Kaminsky as a finalist for one of the most coveted and prestigious literary awards in the country.\u201d\n\u201cThis honor follows his receiving a Guggenheim fellowship as well as an American Academy of Poets Fellowship, and all this since he joined us last year,\u201d Utz said. \u201cThis shows how faculty in the humanities confirm Georgia Tech's status as a top-ranked university, a place at which human-centered creativity is fully integrated with science and technology.\nKaminsky praised the creative and interdisciplinary community found in the school and College as a combination of \u201cbrilliant students whose excitement about poetry is unmistakable and an amazing community of scholars, many of whom are first-rate writers of poetry.\u201d\n\u201cGiven that my own work has to do with literary arts in several different languages, and my education has to do with law and history and philosophy, in addition to poetry, I find this to be an inspiring place to work, where new ideas are discussed daily and many exciting things occur,\u201d he said.\nWhether or not\nDeaf Republic\nnets the National Book Award in November, Kaminsky has already cemented his reputation as one of the world\u2019s leading poets. But, he adds, he still has much more to say.\n\u201cIt is a great time in American poetry, and there have been so many powerful and very moving books of poetry published this year,\u201d Kaminsky said. \u201cSo I am tremendously grateful to be a part of this generation, and to have the chance to be alive and writing at this moment in time.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nContact\nMichael Pearson\nmichael.pearson@iac.gatech.edu\n404.894.2290\nEmail\nmichael.pearson@iac.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
