Specifically, the blade packaging for the tool.\nTheir blade packaging was designed to protect health care workers from accidental injuries that can occur when handling exposed scalpel blades.\nNow their invention,\nScal-Pal , is one of six competing for Georgia Tech\u2019s\nInVenture Prize , an annual innovation competition. The winner will be chosen March 14.\nCurrently doctors and nurses must handle the blade with their fingers to remove it or attach a new one to the scalpel handle. The foil packaging around a fresh blade is opened like an adhesive bandage. One person opens the packaging, while a second person grabs the exposed blade with needle holders and inserts it into the scalpel handle.\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy for accidents to happen because the packaging forces the blade to be exposed,\u201d said Alpharetta native Bailey Klee. \u201cI was job shadowing in an operating room and I saw a nurse take off the blade and cut herself. We found a way to prevent that from happening again.\u201d\nScal-Pal\nworks much the same way as switching out razor blades. The blade is stored inside a single-use box made from pre-recycled polyethylene, akin to the plastic used in milk jugs. The scalpel handle is inserted into the box and the blade is attached. To remove the used blade, the scalpel is inserted back into the box and the blade is released from the handle and trapped inside. The entire box is then thrown away.\nThe team 3D printed the pink and black box in the\nBME Machine Shop .\n\u201cOur design works because the blade is never exposed,\u201d said Sydney Platt, who is from Lake Jackson, Texas. \u201cNo one has to touch it directly.\u201d\n\u201cThere is a market and a need for what we developed,\u201d added Nicholas Quan from Richmond Hill, Ga.\nHospitals spend more than $116 million a year on scalpel related injuries, reported Rachel Mann, a native of Homer Glen, Ill. Those same hospitals use more than 1 million scalpel blades a day.\n\u201cWe need to gain exposure with medical device manufacturers,\u201d Mann said. \u201cWe\u2019re hopeful the InVenture Prize will help make that happen.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nGeorgia Tech InVenture Prize\nContact\nLaura Diamond\nMedia Relations\u00a0 laura.diamond@gatech.edu\n404-660-2927\nEmail\nlaura.diamond@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
