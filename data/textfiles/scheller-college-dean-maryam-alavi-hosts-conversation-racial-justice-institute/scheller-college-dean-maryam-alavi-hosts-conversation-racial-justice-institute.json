The virtual event was the last in a lineup presented by Alavi and Scheller\u2019s Diversity & Inclusion Speaker Series this fall.\n\u201cWe are hosting these sessions in order to elevate the voices of those who can educate and enlighten the community around vitally important issues,\u201d\nAlavi said earlier this year . \u201cThese events are open to the public, and our hope is that Scheller and Georgia Tech students, alumni, faculty, and staff, along the wider business community will join together to engage in open, honest dialogue and learning around diversity and inclusion.\u201d\nAlexander has navigated a progressive 30-year career catalyzing transformations in culture and organizational leadership practices. She leads professional development and engagement experiences designed to\u00a0build and nurture\u00a0global leadership capacity towards equity-mindedness and\u00a0inclusive\u00a0excellence. She is also co-founder of Georgia Tech\u2019s Inclusive Leaders Academy and principal director of the Leading Women@Tech program. Alavi has served on the Leading Women@Tech advisory board since the program\u2019s inception in 2016.\nAlexander discussed some of the challenges that 2020 has presented including the \u201cdouble pandemic\u201d of racial injustice and Covid-19. She also explained concepts of antiracist ideology, racial justice practices, individual resiliency skills and practices, and anti-racism best practices for organizations by relaying the importance of building anti-racism and inclusion into its organizational culture, institutional strategy, and structures.\n\u201cMaryam talked a little bit about Institute Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion and we have indeed been busy this year,\u201d Alexander opened. \u201cWe had lots of conversations over the summer -- we started right after the death of George Floyd and all the surrounding activities: the protests, the hashtags. This evening, I want to end with our common human experience in mind and understanding that we probably need some centering, and that we need to focus on solidarity and some really practical things we can do as we are working to shift and become better people, and so that we can create a better world.\u201d\n\u201cOne practice we can all embrace is empathy,\u201d Alexander added, just after the event. \u201cBeing willing to engage with others through the practice of empathy means fewer assumptions, less judgement, deep listening and mindfulness -- other skills associated with racial justice and just a few that are taught through the Inclusive Leaders Academy and our culture-coaching initiatives.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nContact\nCourtney Hill\nCommunications Manager\nInstitute Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion\ncourtney.hill@gatech.edu\nEmail\ncourtney.hill@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
