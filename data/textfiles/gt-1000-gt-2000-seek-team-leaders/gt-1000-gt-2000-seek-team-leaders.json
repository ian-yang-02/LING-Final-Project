The courses meet one hour a week and are taught by faculty and staff volunteers. Tech students who are interested in mentoring and working with these newly accepted Yellow Jackets are encouraged to apply to be a Team Leader. TLs are volunteers, receiving neither\u00a0pay nor academic credit, but are able to give back to the campus community and have a rewarding experience working with incoming students.\nTeam Leaders work closely with instructors and serve as an additional contact for first-year and transfer students, offering support to those who may feel overwhelmed by the transition.\n\u201cAs mentors and leaders on campus, TLs have a rewarding impact on incoming students by helping them adjust to life at Georgia Tech and pursue their path of success here,\u201d said Lacy Hodges, assistant director for Academic Transition Programs. \u201cGT1000/GT2000 could not exist without team leaders. They are an integral part of the program.\u201d\nStudents value what Team Leaders have to say because the message is peer to peer.\n\u201cWe can advise students who are struggling to go to tutoring or go to the Counseling Center. It\u2019s easy for them to say that we \u2014 as faculty and staff \u2014 don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to be a student. But\u00a0the TL can say, \u2018Yes, I do know,\u2019\u201d Hodges said.\nAll students are eligible to apply, even if they have not taken GT 1000 or GT 2000. To learn more, attend an information sessino on\nMonday, Nov. 29, from 7 \u2013 8 p.m. via Blue Jeans .\u00a0 RSVP to attend .\nQuestions about the program or application process can be sent to\ngt1000@gatech.edu .\nAdditional Images\nContact\nKristen Bailey\nInstitute Communications\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
