Casey Cagle visited the Georgia Institute of Technology campus Oct. 6 to get a firsthand look at Technology Square\u2019s thriving innovation ecosystem.\nCagle met with President G.P. \u201cBud\u201d Peterson and Chris Downing, vice president of the Enterprise Innovation Institute (EI 2 ), Georgia Tech's chief unit dedicated to economic development and innovation and the nation\u2019s largest and most comprehensive university-based program of its kind.\nThe visit was designed to show Cagle how the activity at Tech Square brings entrepreneurs, startups, and Fortune 500 firms together to connect, create, and collaborate, and ways to replicate that success across Georgia.\nHe toured Tech\u2019s Advanced Technology Development Center (ATDC). Led by Jennifer Bonnett, general manager, ATDC is an EI 2\nprogram that serves as Georgia\u2019s statewide technology incubator.\nCagle discussed startup efforts successes and challenges with several ATDC companies, including Clean Hands Safe Hands, a wireless hand hygiene monitoring system for hospitals, and Gozio Health, where he learned about its smartphone-based wayfinding platform that improves hospital visits for both visitors and medical facilities.\nThe lieutenant governor also met with VeriSolutions, a sensor-based startup that works with restaurants to prevent inventory loss, optimize staff efficiency, and improve customer food safety.\n\u201cAtlanta could be the Silicon Valley of the Southeast,\u201d Cagle said following the tour, which included visits to two corporate innovation centers: health insurer Anthem\u2019s Innovation Studio and Southern Co.\u2019s Energy Innovation Center.\nPaul Judge, a Tech graduate with a doctorate in computer science and chairman of Pindrop, told the lieutenant governor that venture capitalists see that Atlanta has a distinct advantage in terms of talent and access to Georgia Tech resources and expertise.\nPindrop, a cybersecurity company located at the historic Biltmore \u2014 which the Georgia Tech Foundation has acquired \u00a0\u2014 is a Georgia success story.\nCEO Vijay Balasubramaniyan launched the company in 2010 while he was pursuing his doctoral degree at Tech\u2019s College of Computing. The then-fledgling company started out in VentureLab, Tech\u2019s incubator for startups founded by Tech students and faculty. Pindrop also received early financial support from the Georgia Research Alliance to bring the idea to a viable concept stage. VentureLab also partnered with Flashpoint, a Georgia Tech startup accelerator that works with founders to get them to think strategically about their business.\nIt then went through ATDC\u2019s Signature program and graduated in 2014. Pindrop announced this year that it had raised $75 million in its Series C funding round.\n\u201cWe\u2019re doing a wonderful job, and we have to protect, help, and encourage what\u2019s going on here in Atlanta. We also have to spread that across the state,\u201d Cagle said.\nEI 2\nhas been doing that through ATDC, Downing said, noting the \u201c ATDC @\u201d\nprogram \u2014 which brings the incubator\u2019s curriculum and management to its partner communities \u2014 currently operates in Savannah, Augusta, Athens, and soon, Peachtree Corners.\n\u201cA core part of our mission at EI 2\nas Georgia Tech\u2019s chief economic development arm, is to do that and help communities across the state scale and help them leverage their assets for economic development,\u201d Downing said.\nAdditional Images\nEmail\nperalte.paul@comm.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
