What about a\nbillionaire ?\nYou have the chance when the Mega Millions lottery numbers are drawn tonight, July 29.\nThe problem: Chances are you aren\u2019t going to win. But we understand that, right?\nLew Lefton, Georgia Tech mathematician, crunches big calculations for a living.\nWith five white balls out of a drum containing 70 balls, and one red ball drawn from a drum with 25 red balls, Lefton says there are an astronomical 302,575,350 possible winning combinations. You\u2019ll have to pick the right one to win big.\nAlso astronomical is the payout. Many would be over the moon with a $1 million payout, but $1 billion? Consider this for perspective: 1 million seconds is about 11 days; 1 billion seconds is about 31 years!\nWhile you can\u2019t do anything to improve your odds of winning, you can decrease the likelihood of having to share that jackpot.\n\u201cPlay numbers higher than 31,\u201d Lefton says.\nMany people play birthday numbers, so choosing higher, less popular numbers means you\u2019re less likely to have to split the winnings.\nAlso, people statistically choose odd numbers more often. So, choosing high, even numbers may be your best bet, according to Lefton.\nWhat\u2019s even more astronomical? The size of the U.S. economy is $23 trillion. Georgia Tech economist Tibor Besedes says a billion-dollar jackpot is a drop in the bucket.\u00a0 \u201cAbout 0.004% of the economy.\u201d\nBecause the winner will likely spend their payout on a variety of items, lottery jackpots have little ripple effect on the economy as a whole.\n\u201cThis wouldn\u2019t have the impact on the level of a business investing $1 billion in the state of Georgia on a new production facility.\u201d\nUnless this jackpot winner has just that kind of investment in mind.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nSteven Norris\nDirector, Media Relations & Social Media\nGeorgia Tech\nEmail\nsnorris@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
