Billions of people globally \u2014 close to half of the world\u2019s population \u2014 lack access to improved sanitation. But a global research team, led by Georgia Tech Associate Professor Shannon Yee, Ph.D., has been developing a portfolio of reinvented toilets that bring together the best concepts from the last decade of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation-led\u00a0 Reinvent the Toilet Challenge .\nIn the most recent phase of this effort, the Gates Foundation selected\u00a0 Yee \u00a0to assemble the best of the ideas from the challenge and develop a new, affordable toilet \u2014 the Generation 2 Reinvented Toilet (G2RT) \u2014 as a solution to the world\u2019s sanitation problem. The G2RT team includes 70 engineers, scientists, and industrial designers from universities and corporations around the world.\nGlobal inequity in access to toilets has led to the death of more than 500,000 children by preventable diarrheal disease each year. While it is primarily the world\u2019s poorest communities that are most affected by the lack of safe sanitation, the crisis in areas of developed countries shouldn\u2019t be overlooked. In rural parts of America, there are currently hundreds of thousands of people without steady access to clean water and proper sanitation.\nThe G2RT aims to drastically shift human waste away from traditional sewage treatment infrastructure to a system that processes waste onsite in household bathrooms.\n\u201cIt\u2019s no longer about running pipes to a central treatment plant,\u201d explains Yee. \u201cIt\u2019s about using new technology to reinvent a product that can be mass produced and accessible to the entire world.\u201d\nHow will this project affect the way people use the bathroom? While using the G2RT won\u2019t differ from current toilet designs, how the toilet processes waste will be drastically different. Instead of relying on a network of pipes and millions of gallons of water, G2RT will treat human waste within the toilet appliance itself. Urine will go through a filtration process that produces clean water, and fecal matter will be reduced to pathogen-free solids and clean water.\nCurrently, Yee and his team are nearing the end of the development phase and will begin field testing it in South Africa, India, and China as well as at laboratory sites on Georgia Tech\u2019s campus and in laboratories in Switzerland starting in 2022. The G2RT is now ready for demonstration, and the team will continue to the next phase in their journey to showcase the technology to potential commercial manufacturers.\nThe G2RT is about the size of a washing machine but can be refined to be smaller, more durable, and easier to maintain. The target price for an individual reinvented toilet is $450.\n\u201cIt needs to be affordable to be accessible to the entire world,\u201d Yee says. \u201cCollaboration with government agencies and the private sector is going to be critical in moving toward the adoption of this new sanitation solution.\u201d\nYee is passionate and confident that the G2RT has the potential to make a positive impact on the billions of people in need of improved sanitation.\nMore information on this project can be found here:\nhttps://www.gatesnotes.com/Development/10-years-of-reinventing-the-toilet\nhttps://www.gatesnotes.com/Development/Heroes-in-the-field-Dr-Shannon-Yee\nAdditional Images\nContact\nAyana Isles\nInstitute Communications\naisles3@gatech.edu\nEmail\naisles3@gatech.edu\nAdditional information\nShannon Yee featured in\nFortune Magazine\nfor leading the global effort to redesign the toilet.\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
