Everyone is invited, especially visiting alumni, to view the latest additions to the center\u2019s suite of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometers.\nNMR spectrometry is a powerful analytical tool, providing information such as molecular structure and dynamics. Advances in instrumentation have enabled NMR spectrometry to move into solid-state and solution applications. Lately, NMR has been used increasingly in high-throughput screening for drug discovery and related uses.\nAnalysis by NMR is based on the interaction of certain atomic nuclei with an external magnetic field. The higher the frequency of this external magnetic field, the greater the sensitivity of the instrument, and the richer the information one can get from NMR analysis\nIn July 2016, the Georgia Tech NMR Center installed two\nBruker Avance instruments , one with a 700-MHz, and the other with an 800-MHz, magnet. These are among the highest-field-strength-magnets currently available in the market.\n\u201cThe recent investment of more than $5 million in new solid-state and solution capabilities enables advanced studies encompassing the imaging of small objects, the atomic level structure and dynamics of ceramics, small molecules of relevance to biology and materials science, synthetic polymers and biological macromolecules,\u201d says\nAngus P. Wilkinson , a chemistry professor and associate chair for operations and undergraduate programs in the\nSchool of Chemistry and Biochemistry.\n\u201cGeorgia Tech\u2019s investment in this scientific equipment not only will make our experiments more successful and our research more grandiose,\u201d says\nJulia Kubanek , a professor of biological sciences and the associate dean for research in the College of Sciences. \u201cThey have already been effectively used to recruit new faculty to Georgia Tech,\u201d she adds.\nNMR instruments use superconducting magnet technology, cooling the magnet to the extremely low temperature of\u00a04 K, with the help of liquid helium. \u201cIn addition to our working instruments, a\u00a0sectioned magnet will be available for inspection\u00a0so that visitors can gain an appreciation of the internal construction of these very expensive magnets,\u201d Wilkinson says. Also on display will be the newly installed helium recovery plant, which takes helium as it boils off from the magnets and condenses it to liquid helium at 4 K. Given the shortage of helium worldwide, \u201cthis system helps conserve a nonrenewable and very expensive resource,\u201d Wilkinson says.\nLeslie Gelbaum , the center\u2019s manager and a principal research scientist in the School of Chemistry and Biochemistry, will be on hand to answer questions and consult on scientific problems relating to biological and non-biological molecules in solution.\nJohannes Leisen , the center\u2019s assistant director and also a principal research scientist in the School of Chemistry and Biochemistry, will be available to answer questions and consult on problems that relate to studies of solid samples and imaging.\nThe open house will take place at 2:00-4:00 pm on Friday, Oct. 28, 2016. The center is located in the basement of the\nMolecular Science and Engineering Building\n(901 Atlantic Drive), room G143.\nVisitors are asked to gather in room G021 for an introductory slide show and snacks, before going to room G143 in small groups for the lab tour.\nFor more information, contact Wendy Harris, 404.894.1180.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nWendy Harris\nSchool of Chemistry and Biochemistry\nEmail\nwendy.harris@chemistry.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
