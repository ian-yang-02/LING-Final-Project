Respiratory viruses like influenza infect the body through mucosal membranes, and the proof-of-concept project will help evaluate whether snippets of influenza proteins \u2013 tiny fragments of the virus \u2013 could be added to two common bacterial strains to create the antibody response. Antibodies in the mucosal membranes might then complement those created by traditional intramuscular injections to head off flu infection.\nThe research, supported by the\nAir Force Research Laboratory\n(AFRL), will study whether or not the harmless bacteria can be successfully modified to carry snippets of a viral coat protein that could stimulate the desired response in mucosal membranes lining the gut. Beyond reducing influenza infection in the general population, improved protection against the flu could have a significant impact on the U.S. military, which wants to provide the best possible protection for its warfighters to reduce possible impacts on readiness and training from influenza outbreaks.\nAt Georgia Tech, the project is a collaboration between researchers at the Georgia Tech Research Institute (GTRI) and the Georgia Tech\nSchool of Biological Sciences . All of the research at Georgia Tech will be done using BSL-2 facilities designed for this type of study. The award does not include research on animals or humans.\n\u201cUltimately, this could one day make vaccination programs much more effective,\u201d said Michael Farrell, a GTRI principal research scientist. \u201cThis isn\u2019t going to be a replacement for flu vaccines as they currently exist, but it could act as an adjuvant \u2013 something that\u2019s done in addition to vaccination to increase the overall immune response. To benefit from it, you might take a pill like you do with probiotics now.\u201d\nUsing Common Probiotic Bacteria as Vehicles\nThe project will focus on two common probiotic bacteria:\nEscherichia coli\n\u2013 a gram-negative bacterium better known as\nE. coli\n\u2013 and\nLactococcus lactis , a gram-positive bacterium found in cheese, buttermilk, and other dairy food items. The researchers will attempt to coax the bacteria to express the influenza virus\u2019 Hemagglutinin (HA) receptor protein on their outer cell surface. There, the protein would stimulate an antibody response in the gut mucosal membrane as it passes through the body\u2019s gastrointestinal tract.\n\u201cWe\u2019re using some well-established probiotic bacteria that have been utilized for dozens of years, are well vetted and safe for humans,\u201d said\nBrian Hammer , an associate professor in the School of Biological Sciences who specializes in bacterial genetics. \u201cUltimately, the idea is to use these bacteria as a chassis to create living vaccines, since the body already tolerates them both well.\u201d\nResearchers at AFRL and Georgia Tech envision that a single pill or capsule would carry the bacteria into the gastrointestinal tract to provide the necessary antibody stimulation. The bacteria would be modified so they could not reproduce, preventing them from becoming part of the body\u2019s gut microbiome \u2013 a diverse collection of bacteria that live in the body and help carry out specific functions, including metabolizing food and modulating the immune system.\n\u201cWe know the human microbiome is intimately involved in human health and disease, influencing processes in ways that have both positive and negative outcomes for us,\u201d said Richard Agans, senior research biological scientist at the U.S. Air Force School of Aerospace Medicine (USAFSAM). \u201cRecently, we have started to better understand how the microbiome communicates with our bodies and how we can identify, target, and promote the beneficial aspects. Currently, we are working to determine how to utilize these microbial communities to better protect our warfighters as well as the general public.\u201d\nOvercoming Challenges of Manipulating Bacteria\nHammer\u2019s lab specializes in manipulating proteins of organisms such as bacteria and viruses to create novel fusions. Among the techniques available is the new CRISPR-Cas, the gene-editing technology that was the subject of a Nobel Prize in 2020, but other more traditional techniques may also be used to get the influenza surface protein where the researchers want it to be.\nAmong the challenges ahead is that adding a new component to bacterial organisms can be difficult.\n\u201cIn general, bacteria have evolved with the genetic components they need to survive,\u201d Farrell explained. \u201cIf you add something else, they may just kick it out. It\u2019s very hard to find a neutral location in the bacterial genome where we can stably add new functionality. This is especially true for this effort, in which there will be no cointroduction of antimicrobial resistance markers.\u201d\nIn addition, the probiotic bacteria strains that are widely used in research as model organisms, or \u201clab rats,\u201d are adapted to living in laboratory conditions. This project, however, will use natural commensal strains that co-exist in humans. That approach may make it even more challenging to add the appropriate material for expressing the viral proteins on the bacteria cell surfaces, Hammer said.\n\u201cWe used to perceive that genes could be shuffled around in the bacteria without much effect on them, but we\u2019re learning now that location really matters,\u201d he said. \u201cOne of the concerns is that tools that work on the \u2018lab rat\u2019 versions of these bacteria will not be as readily accepted by these commensals.\u201d\nAs part of the project, the researchers will have to show that the addition of the protein doesn\u2019t cause instability in the bacteria, and that the modified bacteria generate the correct response when exposed to human immune cells in culture.\nProof of Concept Could Lead to Broader Vaccine Therapies\nBeyond its importance to the military, influenza was chosen to study this adjuvant approach because a number of vaccines exist for this virus, and they have been well studied over the years. If this approach works with influenza, the combination of pill and injection might be useful for vaccines against other respiratory viruses.\n\u201cIf this is ultimately successful, it could be the first foray into showing that these vehicles, these probiotics, could potentially be scaled up for lots of different therapeutic uses,\u201d said Hammer. \u201cBy customizing the cargo, this approach could be rapidly adapted to address new and emerging threats that may arise in the future.\u201d\nProject Provides Student Opportunity\nThe two-year project life was chosen because of the expected difficulty \u2013 and because another of its goals is to train a master\u2019s degree student in the bacterial modification techniques being utilized.\nThe Georgia Tech researchers have chosen an underrepresented minority student who holds an undergraduate degree in biology from Kennesaw State University and has worked in a commercial DNA laboratory. Katrina Lancaster will begin work on this project during fall semester, collaborating with both Hammer and Farrell \u2013 and the students and other researchers in their labs.\n\u201cThis student will have excellent opportunities, not only to learn the skills in the lab and take the coursework, but also to develop a rich network of connections, both in the School of Biological Sciences and at GTRI, that will be helpful in moving forward and advancing their career,\u201d Hammer said. \u201cIt\u2019s a really beautiful combination of components for this project.\u201d\nThe project is funded through the AFRL\u2019s Minority Leaders Research Collaboration Program (ML-RCP).\n\u201cPartnering with academic institutions, such as GTRI, presents great opportunities for our team to interact and work with top minds in these fields to develop better outcomes for everyone,\u201d Agans said. \u201cWe are especially grateful for the opportunity to mentor and provide opportunities for underrepresented students with STEM aspirations. We are excited to work with GTRI in this endeavor and envision this being just the first step.\u201d\nUSAFSAM is part of the Air Force Research Laboratory\u2019s 711th Human Performance Wing.\nWriter: John Toon (john.toon@gtri.gatech.edu)\nGTRI Communications\nGeorgia Tech Research Institute\nAtlanta, Georgia\nThis story first appeared in the\nGTRI newsroom .\nAdditional Images\nContact\nJess Hunt-Ralston\nDirector of Communications\nCollege of Sciences at Georgia Tech\nEmail\njess@cos.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
