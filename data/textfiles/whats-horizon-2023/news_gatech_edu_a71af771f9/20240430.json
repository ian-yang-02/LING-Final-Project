With this in mind, we asked several members of the Georgia Tech community to share what they are looking forward to \u2014 personally or professionally \u2014 in 2023.\n\u201cMy\nlab moved to Cherry Emerson\nlate last year. So, this year I am looking forward to hallway conversations with my new neighbors, and I am hoping to strike up some new collaborations at the interface between biophysics, microbiology, and evolutionary biology.\u201d\n\u2014Peter Yunker, associate professor, School of Physics\n\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to shaping a more fulfilling and engaging employee experience at Georgia Tech. In Human Resources, we\u2019ve been working tirelessly to develop programs and practices that will help Tech recruit, support and develop our talented workforce. I\u2019m excited for faculty and staff to experience positive culture shifts and hope we inspire enthusiasm as we share and celebrate the deep love that exists for working at Tech.\u201d\n\u2014Skye Duckett, vice president and chief human resources officer, Georgia Tech Human Resources\n\u201cPersonally, I am looking forward to spending more time with my wife, Amanda, and our dog, Buzz, at our family place on the coast. I'm also looking forward to watching my fellow 2001 alumnus, Coach Brent Key, lead our Yellow Jackets this fall!\u201d\n\u2014William Smith, director, Office of Emergency Management and Communications\n\u201cI am very much looking forward to taking the\nCultivate Well-Being strategic focus\nto the next level as we are able to start planning and implementation in earnest, guided by our roadmap. I am also excited about the prospect of enhancing our efforts to promote student belonging and facilitate student success as we launch the new\nJohn Lewis Student Leadership Pathways\nand move toward making the Black cultural center a reality.\u00a0I am also planning to visit the Georgia Tech-Europe campus for the first time! On the personal front, I can\u2019t wait for Season 7 of\nOutlander\n(Starz) or Season 2 of\nShadow and Bone\n(Netflix). I also get to celebrate my blue point Siamese kitten turning one year old in February.\u201d\n\u2014Luoluo Hong, vice president for Student Engagement and Well-Being\n\u201cI am looking forward to all that 2023 has to offer me personally. I am the one who\u2019s usually immersed in my professional career and family and friends.\u00a0However, this year, it\u2019s all about me, and accomplishing some of the personal goals that I\u2019ve set for myself. So, I am excited and looking forward to the completion of my first children\u2019s book series.\u00a0I have been working on it for a few years and it\u2019s finally coming together.\u00a0It will be released in August 2023.\u201d\n\u2014Quinae\u2019 A. Ford, administrative manager, GTRI Project Management Office\n\u201cThe Georgia Tech Alumni Association has named this the Year of Engagement.\u00a0I am excited about connecting with even more alumni and inviting them to gather on campus and with Yellow Jackets in their community, to grow together with our professional education programs, and to give back to each other and the Institute. We are closing in on 200,000 living alumni this year, so we are grateful for the partnerships we enjoy across campus to help us reach our vast constituency. We are striving to build an Alumni Association that is with our alumni in 2023 and\nfor a lifetime .\u00a0Go Jackets!\u201d\n\u2014Dene Sheheane, MGT 1991, president of the Georgia Tech Alumni Association\nContact\nVictor Rogers\nInstitute Communications\nEmail\nvictor.rogers@comm.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
