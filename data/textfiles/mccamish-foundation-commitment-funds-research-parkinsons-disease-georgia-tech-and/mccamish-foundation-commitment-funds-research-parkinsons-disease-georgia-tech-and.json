Coulter Professor and Chair in the Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering.\nDec 07, 2020\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nApproximately 60,000 Americans are diagnosed with Parkinson\u2019s disease every year, and more than 10 million people worldwide are living with the disease, according to the Parkinson\u2019s Foundation (parkinson.org).\nResearchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology and Emory University have received a landmark commitment to accelerate the scope and impact of Parkinson\u2019s disease studies and to position Georgia as a hub for collaborative research on this and other neurological diseases.\nThe multiyear commitment from the McCamish Foundation will drive transformational research that harnesses science, engineering, and technology at Georgia Tech and Emory to better analyze the complexities of the brain and transform the treatment of Parkinson\u2019s and other disorders of the nervous system. The Wallace H. Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering (BME), an academic collaboration between Georgia Tech and Emory, is uniquely positioned to lead this new kind of translational neuroscience discovery driven by engineering innovation.\n\u201cFor 22 years, Georgia Tech and Emory University have collaborated to improve the lives of individuals diagnosed with many of the world\u2019s most challenging diseases. Through the sustained support of transformational philanthropy, the Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering has become a national model for academic partnerships,\u201d said Georgia Tech President \u00c1ngel Cabrera. \u201cThis visionary and generous commitment from the McCamish Foundation will allow us to expand and accelerate collaboration and discovery to the point that an exciting new treatment for Parkinson\u2019s disease and other neurological disorders could be within our reach.\u201d\nEmory President Gregory L. Fenves added, \u201cThis generous commitment will enable Emory and Georgia Tech to build on our powerful\u00a0biomedical\u00a0partnership as we work to combat Parkinson\u2019s and other devastating neurological\u00a0diseases. New\u00a0treatments and cures require a deep commitment \u2014 I am grateful for our friends at the McCamish Foundation who will help us make the progress and find the answers that patients and families so urgently need.\u201d\nGordon Beckham Jr. has felt the impact of Parkinson\u2019s personally, with the loss of his father, Hank McCamish, to the disease. Beckham now sits on the board of directors of the Parkinson\u2019s Foundation and works to raise awareness to beat the disease. He said his goal is to build a strong research community in Georgia that will create new frontiers in the treatment of the degenerative disease.\n\u201cThe McCamish Foundation has been in discussions on and off with Georgia Tech, since my dad\u2019s passing, about innovative approaches to dealing with Parkinson\u2019s,\u201d said Beckham, CEO of the Atlanta-based McCamish Group LLC and president of the McCamish Foundation. \u201cWe have always been impressed by the amazing depth of talent at Tech.\u201d\nThe McCamish name is well-known at Georgia Tech. Alumnus Hank McCamish, IM 1950, is the namesake of Tech\u2019s basketball arena, McCamish Pavilion. Over the years, the family has supported numerous causes at Georgia Tech. This commitment is one of the largest in the Institute\u2019s history and is the first of its kind for the Institute.\n\u201cMore recently, we met Susan Margulies and learned of the formal biomedical engineering collaboration between Tech and Emory, two of the top institutions in the country in their respective fields,\u201d Beckham said. \u201cAt the same time, the University of Georgia (UGA) is making major investments in Parkinson\u2019s research. Given all this momentum within the state of Georgia, with BME as a nexus, the McCamish Foundation felt the timing was right to try something new at Tech and Emory while also leveraging the existing powerful collaboration between Tech, Emory, and UGA.\u201d\n\u201cWe already participate in robust research collaborations with Georgia Tech and Emory,\u201d said UGA President Jere W. Morehead. \u201cWe look forward to expanding our partnerships in order to leverage the complementary strengths of our three institutions to bring new hope to those who suffer from this terrible disease.\u201d\nBeckham said The McCamish Foundation dreams of a day when all Parkinson\u2019s related conversations begin with, \u201cRemember when.\u201d\nThe McCamish commitment will support faculty research on neurological diseases, including establishing a seed fund to support high-risk, high-reward research ventures. It will also provide fellowships for graduate students and create regular interactions among researchers at Tech, Emory, and UGA, including an annual national conference focused on Parkinson\u2019s disease. The idea is to give researchers space to collaborate and brainstorm unconventional ideas that hold the greatest promise for significant discoveries.\n\u201cOur vision is to create the next frontier in neuroscience and neurotechnology by confronting the enormous complexities of the dynamic brain and nervous system,\u201d said Susan Margulies, the Wallace H. Coulter Professor and Chair in the Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering. \u201cOur brains engage with, adapt to, and are influenced by the world around us. Studying the changing chemical and electrical brain dynamics is a direct path to detecting and treating Parkinson\u2019s disease and other neurological disorders.\u201d\n###\nAbout the Wallace H.
