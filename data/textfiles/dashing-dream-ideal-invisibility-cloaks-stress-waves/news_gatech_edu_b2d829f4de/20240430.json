Sorry, it appears impossible.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nEmail\nRoman arenas have survived in many earthquake-prone regions. Did the Romans inadvertently build seismic wave cloaks when they designed colosseums? Some researchers believe they did due to the arenas' resemblance to modern experimental elastodynamic cloaking devices. Photo:\u00a0DAVID ILIFF.

It would have perfectly steered stress waves in the ground, like those emanating from a blast, around objects like buildings to make them \u201cuntouchable.\u201d\nDespite casting serious doubt on dozens of theoretical papers that have pursued\u00a0\u201celastodynamic\u201d cloaking, the new study\u2019s authors from the Georgia Institute of Technology don\u2019t think civil engineers should completely give up on it, just on the idea of an ideal cloak. Limited cloaking could still add a degree of protection to structures, particularly against some stress waves common in earthquakes.\n\u201cWith cloaking, there is this expectation that if you get any kind of stress wave from any kind of direction, a cloak should be able to hide the object from it. We now see that it is not possible,\u201d said principal investigator Arash Yavari, a\nprofessor in Georgia Tech\u2019s School of Civil and Environmental\u00a0Engineering\nand in the George W. Woodruff School of\u00a0Mechanical Engineering. \u201cBut for a large class of disturbances, namely the in-plane disturbances, you could probably design a good cloak.\u201d\nIn an earthquake, in-plane disturbances are seismic waves that track along\u00a0flatter and broader --\u00a0or planar --\u00a0paths\u00a0through the surface of the Earth.\nYavari and coauthor Ashkan Golgoon, a graduate research assistant studying with Yavari, published their study\nin the journal\nArchive for Rational Mechanics and Analysis,\na leading journal on theoretical solid mechanics, on May 16, 2019 . The research was funded by the Army Research Office.\nHere's what the dream of cloaking for stress waves looks like,\u00a0some theoretical errors the researchers\u00a0say\u00a0have errantly\u00a0perpetuated\u00a0that dream and what to do now that the bubble has burst.\nThe dream cloak\nThe theoretical dream of elastodynamic cloaking to steer stress waves past a structure like it isn\u2019t even there has a lot in common with the dream of an invisibility cloak, which would bend light \u2014 electromagnetic waves \u2014 around an object then point it out the other side.\nThe light waves hitting the viewer\u2019s eye would reveal what is behind the object but not the object itself. In elastodynamic cloaking, the waves are not electromagnetic but mechanical, moving through the ground. Hypothetically, cloaking the object would completely isolate it from the waves.\nIn a scenario to protect, say, a nuclear reactor from any stress waves traveling through the ground, whether from a natural or human-made calamity, ideally, civil engineers might lower the base of the reactor into a hole below the surface of the ground. They would build a protective cylinder or a half-spherical underground bowl around it with special materials to steer the stress waves around the circle.\nThere are dreams, then there are the study\u2019s findings.\n\u201cWe proved that the shape of the cloak does not matter, whether spherical or cylindrical, you can\u2019t completely cloak,\u201d Yavari said.\n[Thinking about grad school?\u00a0 Here's how to apply to Georgia Tech. ]\nThe erroneous analogy\nA lot of theory and math from electromagnetic (light) cloaking has been transferred onto elastodynamic cloaking research, and some of the former appears to have thrown a wrench into the latter.\n\u201cMany times, analogies from other fields are useful, but elasticity adds multiple physical factors that you don\u2019t have in electromagnetism,\u201d Yavari said. \u201cFor example, the balance of\nangular momentum\nis being violated in much of the research literature.\nAngular momentum is a property of mass in rotational motion, and it is resistant to changes. Many people have experienced angular momentum by\ntilting a spinning gyroscope\nand watching it stubbornly move down an unexpected path.\nAlthough it\u2019s a wave, light is photons, which have no mass. Stress waves, on the other hand, travel through matter \u2014 specifically, solid matter as opposed to liquid or gas \u2014 and that adds pivotal\u00a0dynamics to the equation.\nThose dynamics\u00a0also affect that hole that hides the object. Without it, the stress waves travel pretty uniformly through a medium, but with it, stresses concentrate around the hole and mess up the neat geometry of the wave patterns.\nThe Roman cloak?\nWhat to do? Cloak anyway. If the ideal solution does not exist, make an imperfect one.\n\u201cThe math says that cloaking is not possible in the strict sense. When you understand that, you don\u2019t waste time,\u201d Yavari said. \u201cYou formulate problems that optimize with what you do know around targeted stresses or loads you want to protect against.\u201d\nEngineers could protect against\u00a0important earthquake stresses if they use materials that have been specifically pre-stressed, have certain elastic properties and distribution of densities that are detailed in the study. A real-life cloak can fall short of an ideal and still be great.\n\u201cIf instead of 100 percent of the wave energy I only feel 10 or 20 percent, it\u2019s a huge deal because engineering is not a pursuit of absolute ideals,\u201d Yavari said.\nEven the ancient Romans, notoriously math-phobic, appear to have\ninadvertently built seismic cloaks in their design of amphitheaters , according to a report in\nMIT Technology Review . Their resemblance to modern experimental cloaking devices may have helped preserve them for 2,000 years in seismically active regions.\nThe new study also examined a popular idea in civil engineering\u00a0that building with a family of materials that have a microstructure making them \u201c Cosserat solids \u201d might allow for perfect cloaking. The authors concluded that this also can\u2019t work. The study did not consider so-called\nmetamaterials , which have received attention for rerouting in particular light waves.\nAlso READ:\nThe Kendeda \"living building\" will generate its own electricity and extract its water from the air .\nThis research was supported by the Army Research Office (grants ARO W911NF-16-1-0064 and ARO W911NF-18-1-0003 .\nAny findings, conclusions or recommendations are those of the authors and not necessarily of the Army Research Office.\nWriter and Media Representative :\nBen Brumfield (404-660-1408)\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\n177 North Avenue\nAtlanta, Georgia \u00a030332-0181 \u00a0USA\nEmail:\u00a0 ben.brumfield@comm.gatech.edu\nAdditional Images\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
