Credit: NOAA (National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration)\nMay 19, 2020\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nHard data gained from fossilized corals have spoken strongly against a popular theoretical\u00a0assumption that volcanic activity may have influenced El Nino events.\nA study published in the journal\u00a0 Science\nin March and\u00a0led by researchers from Rice University and the Georgia Institute of Technology parsed the record archived by ancient tropical Pacific coral over the past millennium. That record could help scientists refine their models of how changing conditions in the Pacific influence the occurrence of\u00a0 El Ni\u00f1o events , which are major drivers of global climate.\nThe researchers found that the ratio of oxygen isotopes sequestered in coral \u2013 an accurate measure of historic ocean temperatures \u2013 showed no correlation between El Ni\u00f1o events and estimates of\u00a0 sulfate particles \u00a0ejected into the atmosphere by tropical volcanic eruptions.\nThe coral data was collected on trips to the Pacific over the course of 20 years, by teams led by\u00a0 Kim Cobb , a professor in Georgia Tech\u2019s School of Earth and Atmospheric Science. Those coral records have shown little connection between known volcanoes and El Ni\u00f1o events over that time. Like tree rings, these\u00a0 paleoclimate \u00a0archives have held chemical indicators, the oxygen isotopes, of oceanic conditions at the time they formed.\nThe corals\u00a0yield\u00a0a high-fidelity record that tracks\u00a0the\u00a0 El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation \u00a0(ENSO) in the heart of the central tropical Pacific. The ENSO is a natural oscillation of hotter and cooler surface water temperatures that peak every few years to trigger El Ninos in the hot phases and La Ninas in the cool phases.\nChallenging established models\nAccording to Rice climate scientist and the study's\u00a0corresponding author\u00a0 Sylvia Dee , previous climate model studies have tied volcanic eruptions, which increase sulfate aerosols in the atmosphere, to increased chances for an El Ni\u00f1o event. But the ability to analyze climate conditions based on oxygen isotopes trapped in fossil corals has extended the climatological record in this key region across more than 20 ancient eruptions. Dee said this has allowed for a more rigorous test of the connection.\n\u201cA lot of climate modeling studies show a dynamical connection where volcanic eruptions can initiate El Ni\u00f1o events,\u201d Dee said. \u201cWe can run climate models many centuries into the past, simulating volcanic eruptions for the last millennium. But the models are just that \u2014 models \u2014 and the coral record captures reality.\u201d\nThe coral records Cobb and her colleagues studied for this particular research held unambiguous markers of conditions over 319 years, from 1146-1465. This and data from other corals spans more than 500 years of the last millennium and, they wrote, \u201cpresents a window into the effects of large volcanic eruptions on tropical Pacific climate.\u201d\nThat span of time includes the\u00a0 1257 eruption of Mt. Samalas , the largest and most sulfurous of the last millennium.\nExpanding coral records\nCobb said her lab has been developing techniques and expanding the coral record for years.\n\u201cMy first expedition to the islands was in 1997, and it has been my sole focus pretty much since then to extract the best records that we can from these regions,\u201d she said, noting the lab has issued many papers on the topic, including a groundbreaking 2003 study on ENSO in\u00a0 Nature .\nCobb said dating the ancient coral samples depends on precise\u00a0 uranium-thorium dating , followed by thousands of mass spectrometric analyses of coral oxygen isotopes from powders drilled every 1 millimeter across the coral\u2019s growth axis.\n\u201cThat speaks to the temperature reconstruction,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re borrowing on 70 years of work with this particular chemistry to establish a robust temperature proxy in corals.\u201d\nThe oxygen-16 to oxygen-18\u00a0 isotopes \u00a0revealed by spectrometry show that the temperature of the water at the time the coral formed, Cobb said.\n\u201cThe ratio of those two isotopes in carbonates is a function of the temperature,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s the magic: It\u2019s based on pure thermodynamics.\u201d\n\u201cThis beautiful coral record is highly sensitive to El Ni\u00f1o and\u00a0 La Ni\u00f1a \u00a0events based on its location,\u201d Dee added. \u201cScientists have reconstructed the timing of those volcanic eruptions from\u00a0 ice-core records . We compared the timing of the largest eruptions to the coral record to see if volcanic cooling events had any impact on tropical Pacific climate.\u201d\n\u201cOur study suggests that linkage\u00a0doesn\u2019t exist or, if it does, it is obscured by the large natural variability in the climate system,\u201d Dee said. \u201cIn general, El Ni\u00f1o is a natural oscillator in the climate system.\u201d\nCo-authors of the paper were Julien Emile-Geay from the University of Southern California; Toby Ault from Cornell University; Lawrence Edwards from the University of Minnesota; research scientist Hai Cheng of Minnesota University and Xi\u2019an Jiaotong University, China; and Christopher Charles from the University of California, San Diego.
