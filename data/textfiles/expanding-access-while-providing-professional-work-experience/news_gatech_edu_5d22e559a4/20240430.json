The school enrolls more than 500 students from families who couldn\u2019t otherwise pay for a private, college preparatory education. While families contribute a portion of the $16,400 cost of education, the school fundraises approximately $5,000 per student. The remaining 60% of the cost is earned by the students, who work at area businesses as part of Cristo Rey\u2019s Corporate Work Study Program.\nIn his sophomore year of high school, Pizano landed at Georgia Tech and worked in the College of Engineering\u2019s dean\u2019s office. He had never been to campus and wasn\u2019t yet thinking of college, although he hoped to one day study engineering.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know much at all about Georgia Tech,\u201d said Pizano, who grew up in Atlanta. \u201cMy only goal was to make some connections and do the best I could. That year, I set my heart and mind on Tech.\u201d\nPizano loved Georgia Tech so much that he returned to the dean\u2019s office to work his senior year, then applied and was accepted as a student.\nOnce a 15-year-old sitting in Tech Tower, uncertain about what to do for college, Pizano is now a third-year civil engineering student with a focus on transportation systems.\n\u201cI came here in high school, loved the people, and kept coming back,\u201d said Pizano, who stayed on in the dean\u2019s office as a student assistant in 2020 and 2021. \u201cMy job in the dean\u2019s office gave me a kickstart to my current success at Tech.\u201d\nPizano said the work-study experience at Georgia Tech also taught him the pillars of working in a professional environment, an opportunity that isn\u2019t typically available to high school students. It\u2019s one of Cristo Rey\u2019s main goals, with Georgia Tech playing a supporting role since the school was founded eight years ago.
