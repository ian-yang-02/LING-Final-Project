In fact, at some point, it may be easier to count the objects not connected to the internet than the ones that are, said Alain Louchez, managing director of Georgia Tech\u2019s\u00a0Center for the Development and Application of Internet of Things Technologies\u00a0(CDAIT).\n\u201cThis is what I mean when I say that the internet of things will give rise to a pulsating world \u2014 devices all over constantly sending and receiving data,\u201d he said.\nAs that internet of things wave approaches, Georgia Tech researchers are exploring the implications of a connected world\u00a0\u2014 from finding ways to keep hackers at bay to developing the next-generation of wireless and cellular networks capable of supporting so many new devices.\nRead the complete article\nin Georgia Tech's\nResearch Horizons\nmagazine.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nJosh Brown\nResearch News\n(404) 385-0500\nEmail\njosh.brown@comm.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
