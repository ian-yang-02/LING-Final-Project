Rapid biodiversity loss is affecting every corner of the globe, as species of plants, mammals, fish, and reptiles disappear due to the changing climate. While much of the climate crisis and biodiversity loss looks grim, a group of researchers has recently highlighted some of the newest tools being used to address it.\nScientists at the Georgia Institute of Technology and Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems in Stuttgart have published a perspectives piece on the different tools used throughout the world that are aiding in the conservation of wildlife and biodiversity.\nThey highlight advances in technology, including both hardware and software, as well as frugal resources that are changing the way animals are protected. The research was published in the\nJournal of The Royal Society Interface\nin August.\n\u201cWe are experiencing technological advancements of low-cost hardware, open-source software, machine learning, and more that can help with global conservation efforts,\u201d said Andrew Schulz, postdoctoral researcher in the haptic intelligence department at Max Planck Institute and recent Ph.D. graduate from the\nGeorge W. Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering . \u201c For\nresearchers and people interested in learning about the ways conservation technology and tools are created, this piece serves as a starter guide to the field.\u201d\nIn the article, the researchers presented five case studies of conservation tools, including open-source innovation, environmental DNA, computer vision, game theory and optimization, and frugal technology. Researchers also highlighted the importance of indigenous design in these conservation tool interventions and warned not to employ toxic practices, such as colonization of conservation or parasitic conservation. These practices take advantage of native lands, where conservationists refuse to work with local or indigenous populations and often do not cite or credit their help or expertise.\nOne\ncase study looked at\nAudioMoth , a device that allows low-cost access to bioacoustics research. Recently, an AudioMoth was paired with an animal observation tower to track bird migrations over Georgia Tech\u2019s campus. AudioMoth can also monitor aquatic environments, like coral colonies, to assist with species identification and habitat restoration.\u00a0It\u2019s used in a wide range of fields to monitor the biodiversity of a habitat or even help with the\nearly detection of poachers to prevent wildlife decline.\n\u201cOne of the best parts about this project was working with so many excellent researchers,\u201d Schulz said. They included Suzanne Stathatos from Caltech and the project\u2019s co-leaders, Cassie Shriver and Benjamin Seleb, from Georgia Tech\u2019s\nquantitative biosciences Ph.D. program . \u201cAs early-career researchers working together, it is great to see that the conversations about conservation tool construction are growing and being led by outstanding Ph.D. students.\u201d\nAt Georgia Tech, conservation tools are constantly being built and implemented. The Tech4Wildlife student organization is working to implement conservation tech solutions, including a\nrabies dispenser for our campus foxes, bird monitors in the EcoCommons,\nand\nforage feeders for Zoo Atlanta\u2019s gorillas .\n\"I'm proud to see Cassie, Ben, and\u00a0Andrew\u00a0collaborating across fields and institutions to move conservation technology forward, and it inspires me about the future of conservation science,\u201d said William Ratcliff, associate professor in the\nSchool of\u00a0Biological Sciences\nand director of the quantitative biosciences program.\nCITATION:\nConservation tools: the next generation of engineering\u2013biology collaborations \u00a0 Andrew K.
