This new crystal was synthesized for the first time only a year ago. Corroboration by other physicists of Mourigal\u2019s newly produced experimental data could take a decade or more.\nConfused? Meet quantum physics\nA \u201cliquid\u201d found inside a solid object may sound confusing to many people.\nWelcome to quantum materials, part of the twilight zone called quantum physics, which scientists have been struggling for a century to grasp a nanometer at a time, and where they use terms like \"liquid\" and \"solid\" to mean things other than water and rocks. Though much about it is yet undiscovered, quantum physics describes the underlying reality of matter.\nComputers, smart phones, superconductors and MRI machines are engineered from it. But its laws about the atomic realm defy human perception of what is real, and some sound so preposterous that they have become popular science brain teasers.\n\u2018Spooky\u2019 entanglement bonanza\nTake quantum entanglement,\u00a0the core of Mourigal\u2019s research on the apparent spin liquid in the crystal: If two particles, electrons, for example, become entangled, they can be physically separated by many miles, and still be intimately linked to one another. Actions applied to one particle then instantaneously effect the other.\nAt first, this theory was too odd even for the father of relativity, Albert Einstein,\nwho lampooned it\nas \u201cspooky action at a distance.\u201d\nEntanglement has since been proven in experiments, but now scientists like\nMourigal, an experimental physicist at the Georgia Institute of Technology , and his team, have taken it much farther. The synthetic crystal he has examined, an ytterbium compound with the formula YbMgGaO 4 , is likely brimming with observable \u2018spooky\u2019 connections.\n\u201cImagine a state of matter where this entanglement doesn\u2019t involve two electrons but involves, three, five, 10 or 10 billion particles all in the same system,\u201d Mourigal said. \u201cYou can create a very, very exotic state of matter based on the fact that all these particles are entangled with each other. There are no individual particles anymore, but one huge electron ensemble acting collectively.\u201d\nMourigal,\nformer postdoctoral fellow Joseph Paddison\nand graduate student\nMarcus Daum\npublished their observations\nin the journal\nNature Physics\non Monday, December 5, 2016. They collaborated with colleagues at the University of Tennessee and Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Work was funded by the National Science Foundation and the U.S. Department of Energy.\nQuantum computing dreams\nThis massive \"spooky\" entanglement makes a system of electrons a quantum spin \u201cliquid.\u201d The term is not meant in the everyday sense, as in water. Here, it describes the collective nature of electrons\u2019 spins in the crystal.\n\u201cIn a spin \u2018liquid,\u2019 the directions of the spins are not tidily aligned, but frenzied, although the spins are interconnected, whereas in a spin \u2018solid\u2019 the spin directions have a neat organization,\u201d Mourigal said.\nIf the discovery stands, it could open a door to hundreds of yet unknown quantum spin liquid materials that physicists say must exist according to theory and mathematical equations. In the distant future, new quantum materials could become, by today\u2019s standards, veritable sorcerer\u2019s stones in quantum computing engineers\u2019 hands.\nBeijing\u2019s ytterbium crystal success?\nThe ytterbium crystal was first synthesized a year ago\nby scientists in China , where the government in Beijing has invested heavily in hopes of creating synthetic quantum materials with novel properties. It appears they may have now succeeded, said Mourigal, an assistant professor at\nGeorgia Tech\u2019s School of Physics .\nOne of the only previously observed apparent quantum spin liquids occurs in a natural crystal called\nherbertsmithite, an emerald green stone found in 1972\nin a mine in Chile. It was named after mineralogist Herbert Smith, who died nearly 20 years prior to the discovery.\nResearchers\nobserved its apparent spin liquid nature in 2012\nafter Massachusetts Institute of Technology scientists succeeded at reproducing a purified piece of the crystal in their lab.\nEncyclopedia of spin liquids\nThat initial discovery was just the beginning of an Odyssey. Because of its chemical makeup, herbertsmithite produces just one single entanglement scheme. Physics math says there must be myriads more.\n\u201cFinding herbertsmithite was like saying, \u2018animals exist.\u2019 But there are so many different species of animals, or mammals, or fish, reptiles and birds,\u201d Mourigal said. \u201cNow that we have found one, we are looking for different kinds of spin liquids.\u201d\nThe more spin liquids experimental physicists confirm, the more theoretical physicists will be able to use them to bend their minds around quantum physics. \u201cIt\u2019s important to create the encyclopedia of them,\u201d Mourigal said. \u201cThis new crystal may be only our second or third entry.\u201d\nWhat neutron scattering revealed\nPhysicists from the University of Tennessee\nsucceeded in replicating the original ytterbium crystal, and Mourigal examined it at\nOak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL),\nwhere it was cooled down to a temperature of -273.09 degrees Celsius (0.06 degrees Kelvin).\nThe cooling slowed the natural motion of the atoms to a near stop, which allowed the researchers to observe the electron spins\u2019 dance around the Ytterbium (Yb) atoms in the YbMgGaO 4\ncrystal. They used a powerful superconducting magnet to line the spins up in an orderly fashion to create a starting point for their observations.\n\u201cThen we removed the magnetic field, and let them go back to their special kind of wiggling,\u201d Mourigal said. His team carried out the observations at the\nORNL Spallation Neutron Source , a Department of Energy Office of Science User Facility. The SNS has about the power and size of a particle supercollider, and allowed the scientists to watch the concert of electrons\u2019 spins by bombarding them with neutrons.\nNormally, when one electron flips its spin, researchers would expect it to create a neat chain reaction, resulting in a wave going through the crystal. The wave of electron spins flipping in sequence might look something like fans at a football game standing and sitting back down to make a wave go around the stadium.\nBut something odd happened. \u201cThis jumbly kind of spin wave broke down into many other waves, because everything is collective, everything is entangled,\u201d Mourigal said. \u201cIt was a continuum of excitations, but breaking down across many electrons at once.\u201d\nIt was qualitatively similar to what was observed using the same technique on herbertsmithite.\nNobel Prize topology donut\nTo authenticate the observations made by Mourigal's team, theoretical physicists will have to crunch the data with methods that, in part, rely on topology,\u00a0 a focus of the 2016 Nobel Prize in Physics . Mourigal thinks chances are they will pass muster. \u201cAt first glance, this material is screaming, \u2018I\u2019m a quantum spin liquid,\u2019\u201d he said.\nBut it must undergo a years-long battery of stringent mathematical tests. The theoretical physicists will wrap the data around a mathematical \u201cdonut\u201d to confirm whether or not it is a quantum spin liquid.\n\u201cThat\u2019s meant seriously,\u201d Mourigal said. \u201cAs a mathematical mental exercise, they virtually spread the spin liquid around a donut shape, and the way it responds to being on a donut tells you something about the nature of that spin liquid.\u201d\nThough entangled particles appear to defy space and time, the shape of space they occupy affects the nature of the entanglement pattern.\nThe possibility of a quantum spin liquid was first demonstrated in the 1930s, but only using atoms placed in a straight line. Physicists have been searching in the decades since for materials containing them.\nZhiling Dun and Haidong Zhou from the University of Tennessee, and Georg Ehlers, Yaohua Liu and Matthew Stone from Oak Ridge National Laboratory coauthored the paper ( 10.1038/nphys3971) .
