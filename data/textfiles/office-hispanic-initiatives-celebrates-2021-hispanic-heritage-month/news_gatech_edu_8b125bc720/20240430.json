Mexico and Chile celebrate independence days on Sept. 16 and 18, respectively. D\u00eda de la Raza (Day of the Race) is also recognized in the U.S. and in some Latin American countries on Oct. 12 as the anniversary of Christopher Columbus\u2019 arrival in what would become known as North, Central, and South America. The day also centers around honoring the native people, traditions, and cultures of the Americas.\nThe Center for Student Diversity and Inclusion's\u00a0 Office of Hispanic Initiatives\n(OHI) will sponsor and co-sponsor a host of virtual and in-person events open to faculty, staff, and students in celebration of 2021 Hispanic Heritage Month, which carries the national theme \"Esperanza: A Celebration of Hispanic Heritage and Hope.\"\n\u201cThe overall number of\u00a0Hispanic/Latinx students at Georgia Tech continues to grow and Hispanics/Latinxs are now the largest ethnic minority in the U.S.,\u201d Jorge Breton, director of OHI said. \u201cHispanic Heritage Month is a great opportunity to celebrate and recognize the economic, scientific, cultural, and social contributions of these communities, especially as the Institute \u2013 and society at large \u2013 makes efforts to be more diverse, equitable, and inclusive.\u201d\nDiley Hern\u00e1ndez, associate vice president for\nInstitute Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion\nadded, \u201cHispanic Heritage Month is always a special time of reflection for the Hispanic/Latinx community. This is a time for coming together, gathering strength in our values, our cultural practices, and through our common stories. It is especially during difficult times like these that the deep sense of community that is so prevalent in our cultures becomes a centerpiece of our resiliency and fuels our hope. Tenemos esperanza en un mejor futuro pues sabemos que estamos juntos en esta lucha por un mundo m\u00e1s\u00a0justo para todos.\u201d [\u201c We are hopeful for a better future because we know we are together in this fight toward a most\u00a0just world for all .\u201d]\nSome of the 2021 Hispanic Heritage Month events include: Latinos/Hispanics in STEM: A Career Path Series Featuring\u00a0Dr. Nicole Mendoza\nTuesday, Sept. 21, 4-5 p.m.\nNicole Mendoza, senior researcher in Wind Energy Systems at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, will share her story as part of the GoSTEM\nLatinos/Hispanics in STEM: A Career Path Series .
