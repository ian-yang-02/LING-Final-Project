(Photo courtesy: SMAH)\nJun 09, 2020\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nWhen Shelley Wunder-Smith volunteered to brush up on her sewing skills to help an organization named Sewing Masks for Area Hospitals (SMAH), she had no idea she would end up becoming the communications director for the group.\n\u201cI was like a lot of people, just absolutely desperate to do something helpful and meaningful during the pandemic,\u201d said Wunder-Smith, a senior writer-editor for the H. Milton Stewart School of Industrial and Systems Engineering (ISyE). \u201cI haven\u2019t sewn since I was a kid but was willing to do whatever I could to support SMAH\u2019s mission.\u201d\nThat mission is to provide supplementary cloth face coverings to healthcare professionals experiencing shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE) due to the Covid-19 pandemic.\nSMAH responded to Wunder-Smith\u2019s willingness to help, and one of the co-founders asked if she would like to be more involved and use her professional communications skills and talent. She immediately said yes.\n\u201cIt was a much better fit for me than trying to re-learn how to sew,\u201d Wunder-Smith said. \u201cAnd, it\u2019s given me the unique challenge of managing crisis communications while in the middle of the fast-paced environment of what is, essentially, a start-up.\u201d\nHer duties include responding to media requests, creating the organization\u2019s website and social media content, developing blog posts, and editing all external documents \u2014 such as patterns and sewing instructions \u2014 for the organization. She also created a press kit, manages social media, and is working on a public relations strategy so the organization can be proactive instead of reactive.\nAnd yes, she has done all this while still working full-time for Georgia Tech. So, it has meant a lot of late nights.\nShortly after joining SMAH, Wunder-Smith reached out to one of her College of Engineering colleagues, Kelsey Gulledge, a communications officer in the Daniel Guggenheim School of Aerospace Engineering, for help with the organization\u2019s social media.\n\u201cI wanted to help in any way that I could,\u201d said Gulledge, \u201cand that happened to be establishing and managing the SMAH Twitter and Instagram accounts. This included establishing the voice and tone, creating content, and coordinating with SMAH volunteers for user-generated content.\u201d\nAs the stay-at-home order continued, Gulledge realized she did not have enough time to work her full-time job, volunteer with SMAH\u2019s social media, and also sew masks.\n\u201cWith the support of the SMAH leadership, I made the decision to alter my volunteerism to focus solely on making masks. Sewing can be really challenging, but I\u2019ve found it to be very therapeutic in these difficult times,\u201d she said.\nAfter Gulledge curtailed her involvement, Wunder-Smith enlisted two ISyE students to assist with social media: Maya Menon, a rising third-year student, and Nithya Koganti, a fifth-year student.\n\u201cMaya and I work together to keep all of SMAH\u2019s social media channels up to date,\u201d said Koganti. \u201cWe post content and create some of it with the help of other SMAH team members.\u201d They also strive to increase engagement with SMAH members and reach people who are not familiar with the organization.\n\u201cI have learned so much from working with this organization during the past month,\u201d said Menon. \u201cI\u2019ve really been able to learn just how much social media engages and brings together a group of people that don\u2019t even know each other to create something so powerful and helpful.\u201d\nWunder-Smith said SMAH\u2019s founders initially thought the group would make about 1,000 face coverings. But by the end of May they had delivered 55,000 masks to area hospitals. The organization recently enlisted another group of ISyE students to address some supply chain issues, which will result in a smoother operation.\nPhu Jaitrong, one of 10 students working on the project, said, \u201cWe've been interviewing and process mapping to identify pain points and issues, some of which we've found so far are supply chain related.\u201d The students are also examining the allocation of work, as well as technology and IT issues.\nSMAH recently received its 501(c)(3) designation, making it one of a few nonprofit groups providing personal protective equipment. The designation allows the organization to apply for grants, and it makes donations tax-deductible. (The organization does not need fabric at this time, but to make a financial donation or to volunteer, see the\nwebsite .)\nWhen asked what she has learned from this experience, Wunder-Smith said, \u201cGo where the important work is happening, and give yourself to it. Sometimes that means you don\u2019t get to do the thing you\u2019re best at. Sometimes that means you find a new way to do that thing. Sometimes you find that the thing you\u2019re actually best at is being willing to give yourself where you can help. Because if the work is really important, you don\u2019t have to be. Because it\u2019s not about you.\u201d\nNOTE: As of press time, SMAH is responding to current events by expanding its original mission of supplying PPE to healthcare workers. Once they provide the remaining 3,000 masks that have been requested by local healthcare facilities, SMAH\u2019s administrative team will pivot the organization to supporting the black and African American communities and providing face coverings for civil rights protesters. If there is a second Covid-19 wave in the fall or winter, SMAH will return to its original mission.
