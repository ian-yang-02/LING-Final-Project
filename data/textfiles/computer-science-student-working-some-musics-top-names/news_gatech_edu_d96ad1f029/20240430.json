When he\u2019s not studying or completing assignments for one of the nation\u2019s top computing programs, he\u2019s a software engineering intern at American Express. And he\u2019s also helping to represent some of the biggest names in Hollywood at one of America\u2019s premier talent agencies.\nHow does he do it? \u201cI keep a very organized calendar of all my daily meetings and classes and an organized to-do list of emails, assignments, and projects I need to complete.\u201d\nSharma is an assistant at William Morris Endeavor (WME), whose clients include Robert DeNiro, Serena Williams, Taylor Swift, Kanye West, and scores of other celebrities. Sharma works in the firm\u2019s Music Central operation, focusing on high-profile clients in the electronic dance music space including Martin Garrix, KYGO, Marshmello, and others.\nThis all started a few years ago at Music Midtown, an outdoor music festival held near campus at Piedmont Park in Atlanta. \u201cIt was one of the best experiences of my time here at Tech. I noticed how a crowd of thousands can come together and enjoy an event at such a large scale,\u201d he said.\nSharma was inspired to respond to an ad to work at another music festival operating the software that controlled the lighting systems for the stage. After that, he was hooked. And, he says, music has been an important part of his journey at Tech as well.\n\u201cLike most students, music allows me to be passionate about the work that I'm doing and gives me the energy and motivation to go through my day. I'll have different playlists I use when preparing for an interview, doing homework, or just taking some time to relax,\u201d he explained.\nIn 2020, Sharma organized the Alone Together Music Festival, a virtual event that drew more than 2.4 million views over 48 hours with stages on both the East and West Coasts, and he says his knowledge of technology has helped him create more meaningful and interactive experiences at these music events.\n\u201cI have been able to bridge the gaps and highlight things such as how lighting rigs at a live festival can interface with an artist's CDJs (compact disc jockeys), or feedback on an artist's demos while keeping in mind how it would play at a large festival.\u201d\nIt was Sharma\u2019s music festival work that caught the eye of the agency, and his tech prowess has also served him well in his work representing some of entertainment\u2019s biggest names. He\u2019s helped automate and digitize the contracting process for WME \u2014 a system that is often navigated by written sticky notes and folders full of papers. The contracts and stipulations they hold are critical in Hollywood and beyond.\n\u201cI am coming up with ideas and they see someone who is trying to move forward,\u201d he said.\nAs Sharma finishes his final credits this semester, he doesn\u2019t see himself slowing down any time soon. He plans to work as a software engineer, but will make time to expand his agency work and take an active role in musical artist management.\n\u201cI don't really consider my tasks for music as work. It's something I enjoy and would want to do in my free time anyway.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nContact\nSteven Norris\nInstitute Communications\nsnorris@gatech.edu\nEmail\nsnorris@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
