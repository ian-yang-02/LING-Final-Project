They jammed with hosts Savannah Guthrie, Matt Lauer, Natalie Morales, and Al Roker during a segment on future technology. The broadcast also included two musicians who played on campus during February\u2019s\nMargaret Guthman Musical Instrument Competition . Watch the Today Show clip Weinberg\u2019s band included\nShimon , an improvising, marimba-playing robot, and three\nShimi\nmachines, which danced to the beats. The machines have received extensive press coverage in recent years, but this was their first time performing together with humans on a live, national broadcast. \u201cIt\u2019s thrilling to see the excitement that people have for our creative robots,\u201d said Weinberg, whose research focuses on ways that machines can play with and inspire humans. \u201cIf a robot can come up with something new, it can inspire me to think about music in a different way. It may also play it in a way that I would have never done so with other people.\u201d The Guthman competition instruments on the broadcast were Ed Potokar\u2019s Magnetic Percussion Tower, and Jonathan Sparks\u2019 Nomis device. Both won awards during the Guthman competition.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nJason Maderer National Media Relations 404-660-2926\nEmail\njason.maderer@comm.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
