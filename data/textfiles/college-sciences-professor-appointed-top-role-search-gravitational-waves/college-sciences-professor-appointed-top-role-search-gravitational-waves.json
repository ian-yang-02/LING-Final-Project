This next step will enable a better understanding of the universe and create the directions for the development of future generations of instruments.\nTo help guide them into this new chapter of discovery, members of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) have appointed Georgia Tech Professor Laura Cadonati as their first-ever deputy spokesperson of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration (LSC). Together with the spokesperson, she will speak on behalf of LIGO when new detections are announced and oversee the management of a number of divisions, including data analysis and astrophysics.\n\u201cI am proud and honored to be a member of the LSC. We\u2019ve already done something great by detecting two black hole collisions from billions of years ago,\u201d said Cadonati, a professor in the the College of Sciences and School of Physics. \u201cI\u2019m eager to work with the astronomy and astrophysics community to create this new dawn of gravitational wave astrophysics that will continue to decode the mysteries of the universe.\u201d\nCadonati will collaborate closely with MIT\u2019s David Shoemaker, LIGO\u2019s newly elected spokesperson, as they restructure the 1,000-member organization.\n\u201cDr. Cadonati has extensive expertise in data analysis, as well as experience in creating and leading a National Science Foundation-supported LIGO group as a single investigator,\u201d said Shoemaker, a senior research scientist at the MIT Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research. \u201cShe covers both the research and the leadership sides of the house, which are integral for our continued success in cultivating the scientific advances from the LSC.\u201d\nCadonati previously served as chair of the LIGO Data Analysis Council. She coordinated and guided the activities of hundreds of scientists around the world who work together to analyze the data coming out of the LIGO detectors in Louisiana and Washington.\nLIGO detected the first-ever gravitational wave in September of 2015, the result of two black holes crashing into each other nearly 1.5 billion years ago. The waves, ripples in the fabric of spacetime, were originally predicted in 1915 by Albert Einstein in his general theory of relativity. LIGO captured a second wave in December of 2015, again from colliding back holes.\n\u201cThose were huge milestones. These initial detections opened a new window of the universe and gave us our first glimpse,\u201d said Cadonati. \u201cThis new chapter will allow us to create a path that will bring our field to its full potential.\u201d\nIt includes preparing for two things that excite Cadonati. The first would be the discovery of gravitational waves from binary coalescences that include neutron stars. Scientists believe a collision of neutron stars would result in the production of electromagnetic waves (or light), absent when black holes come together.\n\u201cDetecting that type of event would allow us to combine the information encoded in gravitational and electromagnetic waves,\u201d she said. \u201cIt would also reveal more clues about the properties of neutron stars, which are related to nuclear matter here on Earth.\u201d\nThe second signature on Cadonati\u2019s wish list is a core-collapse supernova explosion in our galaxy, an event that marks the final moments of a star\u2019s life. These explosions, which are expected to occur every 20-30 years, leave behind a black hole or neutron star and emit gravitational waves, electromagnetic waves and neutrinos.\nWitnessing either of these events would give scientists a better understanding of the early universe.\nLIGO is roughly halfway through its second advanced science run. It will continue to monitor the universe until the end of August. The group will then take a year off to upgrade and increase the sensitivity of the detectors and begin again in late summer 2018.\nCadonati is part of Georgia Tech\u2019s\nCenter for Relativistic Astrophysics . She and Professors Deirdre Shoemaker and Pablo Laguna are the Institute\u2019s LIGO faculty members. They are joined by more than a dozen Georgia Tech undergraduates, graduate students and postdoctoral fellows in the worldwide collaboration.\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nGeorgia Tech's Center for Relativistic Astrophysics\nLIGO\nSchool of Physics\nContact\nJason Maderer\nNational Media Relations\nmaderer@gatech.edu\n404-660-2926\nEmail\nmaderer@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
