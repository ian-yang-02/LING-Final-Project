Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering, Cola has become one of the preeminent experts in the fields of heat transfer and nanomaterials. He\u2019s worked longer than most other scientists on the planet to understand carbon nanotubes (CNTs).\n\u201cCNTs are nature\u2019s perfect conductor of heat,\u201d he explained. \u201cCarbon atoms are the lightest and carbon-carbon bonds are the strongest, and these two features combine fundamentally to make heat flow through solids with little resistance.\u201d\nAs Cola\u2019s research at Georgia Tech developed, so did the idea behind his company, Carbice.\nUsing recycled aluminum and waste carbon gas, Cola and his team made what is the world\u2019s leading heat-conducting material. With this material they have made a tiny filament only a few atoms in width that helps remove the heat from the products it is assembled with.\nWhile conducting his research at Tech, he realized he had a product that could be extremely successful. \u201cEverything that does work has a byproduct of heat due to innate inefficiency,\u201d he explained.\nThat\u2019s particularly true for electronic devices, where added heat can lead to malfunctions or even fires. And, as electronics have become smaller and denser, they produce even more heat. Carbice carbon helps dissipate that heat.\nCarbice can be used to manufacture everything from smartphones to satellites. According to Cola, satellite makers can save as much as $500 per square inch of thermal filler interface by using Carbice Space Pad.\n\u201cI often say that Carbice is a Second Law of Thermodynamics business,\u201d Cola said.\nAlong his journey \u2014 from starting fullback for Vanderbilt\u2019s football team, to Georgia Tech professor and researcher, and now to successful entrepreneur \u2014 Cola has found support in many different forms.\nHis first research grant was given by the U.S. Air Force. As the Carbice technology grew, Cola was backed by Georgia Tech\u2019s Advanced Technology Development Center (ATDC) and the Georgia Research Alliance.\n\u201cThat, frankly, was key to me coming to Georgia Tech,\u201d he recalled. \u201cThey would give grants to help professors explore commercialization opportunities. That sold me for this ecosystem.\u201d\nIn the past two years, Cola and Carbice received $15 million dollars from venture firms and investors to expand the technology into new markets.\nThe company has just moved out of a Georgia Tech incubator space and into a 23,000-square-foot facility in Atlanta\u2019s West End neighborhood.\n\u201cIt\u2019s important for me to be close to Georgia Tech and the Atlanta community, because I\u2019ve learned so much from both,\u201d said Cola. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot you can learn in Silicon Valley, but my authentic environment has been this Georgia Tech-Tech Square-Atlanta environment.\u201d\nThe new facility is located near the western portion of the BeltLine, one of the largest urban redevelopment programs in the country that consists of multiuse trails redeveloped from former railroad corridors encircling the city of Atlanta. \u201cI\u2019m so excited for Carbice to be so centrally located,\u201d Cola said.\nThe next step is ramping up this facility to start making more of the Carbice material. Cola and his team are hiring more staff and planning for a grand opening later this year. They plan to take \u201cbig steps toward being in more and more technologies,\u201d from smartphones to electric vehicles.\nAnd Cola\u2019s journey as researcher, professor, and entrepreneur continues. \u201cI came here seeing in Georgia Tech a place that would allow me to achieve what I wanted to achieve.\u201d So far, so good.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nSteven Norris\nInstitute Communications\nstephen.norris@comm.gatech.edu\nEmail\nstephen.norris@comm.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
