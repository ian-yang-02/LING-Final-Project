That summer, she married Tech student Munzir Zafar. And, that fall, she began her doctoral studies at Georgia Tech.\n\u201cIt was a huge transition, coming from Pakistan and having never lived in the U.S.,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was a complete change of culture. Being on my own, managing the house, and the Ph.D. on top of that was daunting. When I look back, I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t know a lot of what the Ph.D. really required because I would never have gone down the path. I would have been scared off,\u201d she laughed.\nBut Ahsan didn\u2019t run away. She is graduating with a Ph.D. in computer science, focusing on computer vision, and her husband will graduate this fall with a Ph.D. in electrical and computer engineering, specializing in robotics.\nAhsan and Zafar were born in Karachi, Pakistan, but they didn\u2019t know each other. They met briefly as undergraduates, but went their separate ways and graduated from different schools. She earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in telecommunications from NED University of Engineering & Technology. Zafar attended the National University of Sciences and Technology (NUST) and earned a degree in electronic engineering. They didn\u2019t keep in touch as undergraduates, but he remembered her. Years later he looked her up, they reconnected, and became engaged.\nAhsan said she had always wanted to go into academia and conduct research. She had become interested in computer vision while earning a master\u2019s in computer and information systems, also at NED University. So, pursuing a Ph.D. was next \u2014 and she had just become engaged to Zafar, a Fulbright Scholar at Georgia Tech.\n\u201cSo, of course, my top choice for a Ph.D. was Georgia Tech,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was a seamless transition from the work I had done at the end of my master\u2019s study.\u201d\nAhsan broadly describes computer vision as a way of getting machines to understand the surrounding environment.\n\u201cWe try to feed, for example, photographs and videos to the computer and teach it to recognize what is happening,\u201d she said.\nShe defended her thesis last fall, and in February she joined Home Depot as a data scientist on the core recommendations team. Her current project is for the Home Depot website, designing recommendation algorithms for generating collections of products for customers shopping online.\n\u201cThey have a huge amount of data, and you can do interesting recommendations based on the data you have,\u201d Ahsan said. \u201cThankfully, I have the right combination of skills that they needed \u2014 computer vision expertise and some natural language processing experience \u2014 so, I can combine those skills to help recommend products based on what the customer is shopping for at the moment. So far, I am really enjoying myself!\u201d\nZafar studies robotics and is interested in designing control algorithms for generating stable, safe, and useful behaviors of robotic systems.\nHis interest in robotics began during his undergraduate years. He wanted to pursue a field that has direct application and widespread support in Pakistan, because he and Ahsan plan to establish a working collaboration with their home country through academia and/or entrepreneurship.\n\u201cIt won\u2019t be difficult to have a career in robotics in Pakistan,\u201d he said.\nAhsan said she dreams of going back into academia someday.\n\u201cI have seen successful examples of people who have one foot in academia and one foot in industry. It has worked out wonderfully for some of our faculty,\u201d she said. \u201cIf that option opens up, I can definitely pursue that.\u201d\nAmong the things Ahsan will miss most about Georgia Tech are the aura of campus life and having access to the latest research journals and papers. Zafar, who defended his thesis this month and will be hooded in the fall, said he will miss the people he worked with, conducting research, and spending time with the robots.\nAhsan said she is most excited about the Ph.D. hooding ceremony at Commencement.\n\u201cFor me, it\u2019s a very big deal because there were so many times during the program that I thought: \u2018I\u2019m never going to be able to do it.\u2019 So, the hooding ceremony is a formal acknowledgement that I made it.\u201d\nAhsan\u2019s aunt from Pakistan will attend the ceremony. Her parents and Zafar\u2019s parents will watch the livestream from Pakistan.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nVictor Rogers\nInstitute Communications\nEmail\nvictor.rogers@comm.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
