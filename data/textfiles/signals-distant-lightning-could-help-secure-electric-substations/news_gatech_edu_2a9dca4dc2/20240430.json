Background lightning signals from thousands of miles away would authenticate those signals, preventing malicious actors from injecting fake monitoring information into the system.\nThe research, done by engineers at the Georgia Institute of Technology, has been tested at substations with two different electric utilities, and by extensive modeling and simulation. Known as radio frequency-based distributed intrusion detection system (RFDIDS), the technique was described February 26 at the 2019 Network and Distributed System Security Symposium (NDSS) in San Diego.\n\u201cWe should be able to remotely detect any attack that is modifying the magnetic field around substation components,\u201d said\nRaheem Beyah , Motorola Foundation Professor in Georgia Tech\u2019s\nSchool of Electrical and Computer Engineering\nand co-founder of Fortiphyd Logic, Inc. \u201cWe are using a physical phenomenon to determine whether a certain action at a substation has occurred or not.\u201d\nOpening substation breakers to cause a blackout is one potential power grid attack, and in December 2015, that technique was used to shut off power to 230,000 persons in the Ukraine. Attackers opened breakers in 30 substations and hacked into monitoring systems to convince power grid operators that the grid was operating normally. Topping that off, they also attacked call centers to prevent customers from telling operators what was happening.\n\u201cThe electric power grid is difficult to secure because it is so massive,\u201d Beyah said. \u201cIt provides an electrical connection from a generating station to the appliances in your home. Because of this electrical connection, there are many places where a hacker could potentially insert an attack. That\u2019s why we need an independent way to know what\u2019s happening on grid systems.\u201d\nThat independent approach would use an antenna located in or near a substation to detect the unique radio-frequency \u201cside channel\u201d signatures produced by the equipment. The monitoring would be independent of systems now used to monitor and control the grid.\n\u201cWithout trusting anything at all on the grid, we can use an RF receiver to determine if an impulse occurred in the shape of an \u2018open\u2019 operation,\u201d Beyah said. \u201cThe system operates at 60 Hertz, and there are few other systems that operate there, so we can be sure of what we\u2019re monitoring.\u201d\nHowever, hackers might be able to figure out how to insert fake signals to hide their attacks. That\u2019s where the lightning emissions known as \u201csferics\u201d come in.\n\u201cWhen a lightning flash hits the ground, it forms an electrical path miles tall, potentially carrying hundreds of thousands of amps of current, so that makes for a really powerful antenna radiating energy,\u201d said\nMorris Cohen , an associate professor in the Georgia Tech School of Electrical and Computer Engineering. Each flash creates signals in the very low frequency (VLF) band, which can reflect from the upper atmosphere to travel long distances.\n\u201cSignals from lightning can zigzag back and forth and make it all the way around the world,\u201d Cohen noted. \u201cLightning from South America, for example, is easily detectable in Atlanta. We\u2019ve even seen lightning echo multiple times around the world.\u201d\nSecurity staff remotely monitoring substations would be able compare the lightning behind the 60 Hz substation signals to lightning data from other sources, such as one of the 70,000 or so other substations in the United States or a global lightning database. That would authenticate the information. Since lightning occurs more than three million times every day on average, there is plenty of opportunity to authenticate, he noted.\n\u201cEven if you could synthesize the RF receiver\u2019s data feed digitally, generating something realistic would be difficult because the shape of the pulse from lightning detected by our receivers varies as a function of the distance from the lightning, the time of day, latitude and more,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cIt would take a lot of real-time computation and knowledge of sophisticated physics to synthesize the lightning signals.\u201d\nWorking with two different electric utilities, the researchers \u2013 including graduate research assistant Tohid Shekari \u2013 analyzed the RF signals produced when breakers were turned off for substation maintenance. They also used computer simulations to study a potential attack against the systems.\n\u201cThe signal from a lightning stroke is very distinct \u2013 it is short, around a millisecond, and covers a huge frequency range,\u201d Cohen added. \u201cThe only other process on Earth that is known to generate something similar is a nuclear explosion. The emissions from the power grid are very different and none of it looks like a pulse from lightning, so it is easy enough to separate the signals.\u201d\nThe researchers have filed a provisional patent on RFDIDS, and hope to further refine the security strategy, which independent of equipment manufacturer. Beyah believes there could be applications beyond the power industry for remote monitoring of other RF-emitting devices. The system could tell transit operators if a train were present, for example.\n\u201cThe power grid is our most critical piece of infrastructure,\u201d Beyah notes. \u201cNothing else matters if you don\u2019t have electrical power.\u201d\nIn addition to those already mentioned, the research team also included recent master\u2019s degree graduate Christian Bayens and assistant professor Lukas Graber, both from Georgia Tech.\nCITATION : Tohid Shekari, et al., \u201cRFDIDS: Radio Frequency-based Distributed Intrusion Detection System for the Power Grid,\u201d (2019 Network and Distributed System Security Symposium).\nResearch News\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\n177 North Avenue\nAtlanta, Georgia\u00a0 30332-0181\u00a0 USA\nMedia Relations Contact : John Toon (404-894-6986) (jtoon@gatech.edu).\nWriter : John Toon\nAdditional Images\nContact\nJohn Toon\nResearch News\n(404) 894-6986\nEmail\njtoon@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
