Operating at more than five times the speed of sound, these systems can alter course after takeoff, making them hard to intercept. The U.S. government\u2019s proposed fiscal year 2022 budget for hypersonics research and development is $3.8 billion, representing a nearly 20% increase from the previous year.\nDeveloping vehicles capable of traveling at over a mile per second \u2014 speeds that cause vehicle surface temperatures to heat up to 2,200 degrees Celsius \u2014 presents daunting engineering challenges for hypersonics materials and systems.\nTo address these hurdles and enhance U.S. hypersonics capabilities, the\nUniversity Consortium for Applied Hypersonics\n(UCAH) has tapped the Georgia Institute of Technology and key academic partners for four grants valued at $6 million over the next three years. The awards draw on Georgia Tech and the\nGeorgia Tech Research Institute\n(GTRI) expertise across advanced, high-temperature materials science and aerospace and mechanical engineering research \u2014 areas critical for future advances of these vehicles.\n\u201cHypersonics research is a big area of focus for Georgia Tech. It\u2019s an area where the College of Engineering and GTRI can really collaborate and build upon GTRI\u2019s strong foundation to be a real force in hypersonics,\u201d said Devesh Ranjan, Ring Family Chair and associate chair for Research in the George W. Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering, who also serves as co-director of UCAH.\nBuilding a Future Workforce\nRanjan, who also co-chairs the Hypersonics Taskforce at Georgia Tech, considers the UCAH grants a huge win for Georgia Tech on three fronts:\nHelping build the future workforce of highly skilled researchers in hypersonics.\nEnabling technology transfer of key research into industry.\nApplying high-temperature material advances in new fields, whether it be better power plant materials, higher efficiency sensors, or new propulsion systems that could enable commercial planes to fly from Los Angeles to New York City in only 15 minutes.\nGeorgia Tech expects to engage a broad community of undergraduate, master\u2019s, and Ph.D. students to tackle these projects. The continuity of a three-year research program opens the door for both GTRI and the engineering schools to co-advise graduate students.\n\u201cThe UCAH workforce development goal to attract the next generation of scientists and engineers is important and a high priority for us,\u201d said Kenneth Allen, chief scientist for GTRI\u2019s Advanced Concepts Laboratory.\n\u201cWorkforce development is one of the key reasons we are doing this consortium,\u201d noted Gillian Bussey, director of the Department of Defense\u2019s Joint Hypersonics Transition Office (JHTO), which funded the awards.\nJHTO\u2019s mission includes engaging with the Science & Technology (S&T) community to develop hypersonics technologies and transition them to operational capabilities.\n\u201cWe\u2019re focused on applied hypersonics, which is why we ask proposers to team with industry or national labs to help make their proposed projects more relevant and transitionable,\u201d Bussey said, noting that a key challenge with S&T is connecting the university research community to warfighter needs. \u201cOur goal for this consortium is not only more relevant S&T that can be better inserted into our programs, but also a university ecosystem that better understands our problems.\u201d\nAccording to Bussey, Georgia Tech researchers excelled at showing they understood the applied research questions posed by UCAH, which restricted the number of white papers from universities to three in the initial phase.\n\u201cGeorgia Tech\u2019s three papers got picked for the project proposal phase, and then for three proposal projects. So, they batted a thousand. No one else did that and I think it's a testament to the legacy and experience that Georgia Tech has, particularly with GTRI, in working in the applied area,\u201d Bussey said.\nThe awarded grants address several emerging areas of hypersonics, from testing advanced control system strategies to materials and composites capable of withstanding extreme temperatures.\nContrasting Hypersonics Versus Conventional Systems\nHypersonic vehicles differ dramatically from conventional vehicles, according to Allen. To illustrate, he pointed out that intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) travel at roughly 15,000 miles an hour, or over Mach 15, but follow a parabolic trajectory with 80% of their flight time spent in space.\n\u201cHypersonic vehicles, on the other hand, do not have simple parabolic trajectories and they navigate within the atmosphere. Both facts introduce a host of interesting research problems,\u201d he said.\nThe first problem \u2015 maneuverable low-altitude flight \u2015 introduces challenges in tracking for ground-based systems since the Earth\u2019s curvature can block the line of sight. Allen said this maneuverability also eliminates the ability to predict simple trajectories.\nThe second problem concerns vehicle velocities beyond Mach 5 within the atmosphere, which \u00a0Allen explained causes \u201ca violently disruptive process for the vehicle.\u201d\n\u201cImagine at speeds on the order of one mile per second, these vehicles must be able to withstand ripping through this sea of gases, which are disruptive enough to tear away electrons and break apart molecules. This has adverse effects on the materials, such as the disintegration of the materials exposed to the vehicle\u2019s hottest surfaces,\u201d he said.\nPlanning Better Vehicle Simulation Paths\nOne of the UCAH grants will optimize and validate multimodal control strategies for future vehicles. A key challenge facing these aircraft is that they nominally fly on the border of where they are structurally sound, explained Jonathan Rogers, principal investigator for the grant.\n\u201cWhile most aircraft have buffers designed into the system to handle unexpected loads or heating, hypersonic vehicles have little margin against heating or other aerodynamic loads,\u201d he said. Rogers serves as the Lockheed Martin Associate Professor of Avionics Integration in the Daniel Guggenheim School of Aerospace Engineering. \u201cIt's hard to design margin into the system when we don't know a lot about what the system will experience.\u201d\nTo combat that uncertainty, Rogers\u2019 research team will design trajectory models so that vehicle operators can plan the path the vehicle will take. These paths will be used in simulations to \u201cmake sure the vehicle actually flies them.\u201d\nRogers and his co-PIs Anirban Mazumdar and Mark Costello will build on previous research collaborations with Sandia National Labs Autonomy for Hypersonic Program, as well as collaborate with researchers at Texas A&M University.\nWhat most excites Rogers is the prospect of Georgia Tech\u2019s research being applied and adopted by the hypersonics community. He points to the historical challenge of academic research getting published but not adopted.\n\u201cWith the funding agency being JHTO, there\u2019s definitely an emphasis on transitioning the technology to use,\u201d he said.\nBuilding a Thermal-Tolerant Window Prototype\nAnother grant involves work with three other universities to validate a prototype window design that can tolerate thermal strains, or be able to withstand the full Mach 5 \u2013 10 service temperature cycle and remain joined and sealed to the frame of the vehicle.\nAaron Stebner, associate professor in the Woodruff School, is working closely with researchers at Ohio State University, Texas A&M, and North Carolina A&T State University, as well as aerospace designers and fabricators at Spirit AeroSystems.\nAccording to Stebner, high-temperature alloys and ceramic coatings used on hypersonic vehicles prevent the electronics from communicating through them. \u201cThe metals interfere with the electronics communications,\u201d he explained.\nTo overcome this problem, hypersonic vehicle builders install a small communications window made from a single crystal version of alumina with low enough density to not interfere with the electronics. However, when the window along with the rest of the vehicle heats up to 900 degrees Celsius, \u201cin a couple seconds, the airframe metal expands much more than the ceramic,\u201d Stebner explained, adding that the phenomenon, called thermal expansion, either causes the ceramic to crack at a cooler temperature or a gap to form between the ceramic and the metal at Mach 5 and above.\n\u201cOur project is about making sealing and joining technologies that are sufficient for solving this problem,\u201d he said.\nTesting New Radome and Window Materials\nA third UCAH grant brings together experts from GTRI and Professors Ellen Yi Chen Mazumdar and Surya Kalidindi from the Woodruff School to test new high-temperature radio frequency (RF) radomes and develop infrared (IR) window materials.\nMany\u00a0current hypersonic vehicles lack onboard RF and IR sensors because of the lack of high- temperature window and radome materials.\u00a0Windows and radomes need to simultaneously be transparent to RF or IR wavelengths and handle similar forces and temperatures as the vehicle surface.\u00a0To make sensors a reality, new methods for developing and characterizing materials is needed.\u00a0Innovations in these areas will enable next-generation vehicle designs, which \u201cwill help the vehicles achieve active decision-making in flight,\u201d said Ellen Yi Chen Mazumdar, the principal investigator and assistant professor in mechanical engineering and aerospace engineering.\n\u201cTo enable either radar or optical sensing in hypersonic vehicles, we need to study and develop radome and window materials. Temperature handling is always a challenge, so we are pushing the boundaries of what we can do with existing materials,\u201d she said.\nPart of this research includes developing infrared materials that can self-calibrate. Mazumdar explained that as these vehicles heat up, so will the window. An unfortunate effect is that the window itself will start to heat up and begin to emit brighter in the infrared than the objects the vehicle is looking at. \u201cTo eliminate that effect, you have to calibrate out the window emission and wavefront distortion contributions,\u201d she said.\nAnother big focus of the project is testing smaller radome samples at higher temperatures. Developing new materials is expensive and building smaller, 1- to 4-inch-diameter samples instead of 12-inch samples could lead to smaller test facilities that are easier and less expensive to build. This can create faster material development cycles. By subjecting the material samples to extremely high temperatures, investigators will recreate, as closely as possible, the conditions that would be experienced during flight.\nGTRI\u2019s Allen said their work on the radome and window materials \u201cis an extension of our existing core competencies in sensors and systems engineering, including materials science for high-temperature composites, material measurements with relevant temperature profiles, sensor development integration, modeling, simulation, and analysis of hypersonics systems.\u201d\nUsing Ultrasound to Identify Defects in Hypersonics Materials\nStebner is driving a fourth UCAH grant that will leverage machine-learning-enhanced ultrasound inspection to better characterize manufacturing defects in hypersonics materials. He said that this research will find application in many industries beyond national defense, from nuclear energy to aerospace.\nHe noted that companies that process nuclear fuels need the same high-temperature materials used in hypersonics to contain the fuels while they are being processed.\n\u201cWe have proposed a big NASA program manufacturing high-temperature materials for \u00a0nuclear engines,\u201d Stebner said. \u201cWe also have active projects through the Boeing Georgia Tech Alliance on the manufacturing of these materials. In all cases, across many industries, non-destructive evaluation of internal manufacturing defects is critical to achieve qualification. I really see these UCAH projects not only solving the short-term critical research needs of the government in this particular domain, but also seeding a broader field of study for decades.\u201d\n*Editors note: All photos and video for this story were taken in July, 2021, prior to updated mask\u00a0 guidance \u00a0issued by Georgia Tech.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nAnne Wainscott-Sargent\nEmail\nasargent7@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
