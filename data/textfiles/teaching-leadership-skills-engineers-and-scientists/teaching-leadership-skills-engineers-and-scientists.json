So, not only has he developed a leadership course for chemical engineering majors, he also recently published his first book on the subject.\n\u201cThe whole effort on leadership was an outgrowth of one of our required courses in chemical engineering,\u201d said Hess, professor and Thomas C. DeLoach, Jr. chair, in the School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering.\nChemical engineering seniors must take a course in chemical and process safety (CHBE 4515). \u00a0About 15 years ago, Hess began teaching the course, which had been offered for about six years before he started teaching it. After teaching the course for one semester, he decided to incorporate some exercises on ethics, professionalism, and decision-making.\n\u201cWhen you make decisions in a chemical process \u2014 or any process \u2014 you\u2019re looking at cost, profits, safety, ethics, and all the interactions of these different things. And, of course, there isn\u2019t a clean answer,\u201d Hess said. \u201cYou\u2019re optimizing, trying to get the best situation. I found that students had very little insight into how to think about that. They knew how to make good decisions if they based it on technical information. But when you take other things into account \u2014 the ethical and behavioral questions \u2014 this is what a leader deals with all of the time.\u201d\nFour years ago, Hess wondered if students could benefit from having some background in leadership as viewed through their technical background and mindset. He reflected on his time as a leader and how he, as a technical person, interacted with non-technical people and dealt with biases, values, priorities, and beliefs of individuals.\n\u201cI realized that I think about things in a certain way. I interact mostly with technical people, and with very few people outside [the technical field]. The biggest issues you encounter are soft-skill issues,\u201d he said.\nSo, Hess approached David Sholl, the department chair, with an idea to teach a course focusing on the problems that leaders face early in their career. He could not find many books or articles that dealt with early career leadership issues.\n\u201cLeadership books are usually written by MBAs because they are frequently the people in high-level leadership positions,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd, people in those positions deal with somewhat different types of problems than the ones you deal with early in your career.\u201d\nHe likes a particular quote that sums up the situation nicely: \"Good judgment is the result of experience, and experience is the result of bad judgment.\"\nHess says, \u201cThat is how we learn. It\u2019s instructive, but it\u2019s a slow process because you aren\u2019t going to make all of the mistakes within a reasonable time frame.\u201d\nIn class, Hess likes to present scenarios and then ask students to make decisions or suggest approaches to dilemmas based on that information. For example, he asks them to imagine they are the project leader in charge of putting a team together. There is a person who is among the most talented in the field, but he is rude, arrogant, impatient, and people quit the team when they have to work with him. Should you put him on the team? What are the consequences of putting him on the team or not putting him on the team? If you put him on the team, how do you manage that?\n\u201cThere is no good, hard answer,\u201d Hess said. \u201cAnd, that drives technical people up the wall! They want to know the answer. There is no right answer to most of these situations. You figure out the best thing to do given all of your constraints, analogous to solving design problems, but with people difficulties added to the mix.\u201d\nOne of the points he makes is that the same leadership dilemma can exist in two different organizations or teams, but the best approach may be different. That\u2019s because the people, personalities, cultures, and time frames are different.\n\u201cI don\u2019t claim that the course will take care of these problems,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat it is intended to do is build awareness that these kinds of situations exist and to discuss ways to think about addressing such issues.\u201d\nHis advice to students is: Don\u2019t get frustrated. Use your technical skills \u2014 organization, critical thinking, and creative problem-solving \u2014 to solve the people issues.\nThe class is offered to graduate students in the fall and to undergraduates in the spring. So far, the course has been available only to chemical engineering students. After his second time teaching the course, Hess decided to turn his class notes and slides into his first book. The title is\nLeadership by Engineers and Scientists: Professional Skills Needed to Succeed in a Changing World , and it was published in April by the American Institute of Chemical Engineers in association with Wiley.\nThe book is brief by design, fewer than 250 pages, with lots of references for more information. It is written as a textbook, with homework questions as well as many discussion questions and scenarios, and ways to think about some of the situations. Hess will use the book in his class this fall, but he said the book also will be useful for others.\n\u201cAnyone who is considering or has recently been placed in a leadership position should benefit from the perspective offered in this book,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you aren\u2019t in a formal leadership position, it will help you to understand what your manager is going through. And, this should help you become a better employee.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nContact\nVictor Rogers\nInstitute Communications\nEmail\nvictor.rogers@comm.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
