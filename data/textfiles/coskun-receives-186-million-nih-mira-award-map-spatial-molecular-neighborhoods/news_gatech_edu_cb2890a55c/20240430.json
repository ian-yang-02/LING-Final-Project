Quantifying is proving.\u201d So, with that in mind, Coskun and his team have developed multiplex imaging tools and combined them with machine learning techniques \u2013 for believing and quantifying.\nNow, to support Coskun\u2019s research, the National Institutes of Health has granted him the prestigious\u00a0 Maximizing Investigator\u2019s Research Award \u00a0(MIRA) from the National Institute of General Medical Sciences.\u00a0Coskun and his team will use the five-year, $1.86 million award for a project entitled,\u00a0 \u201cDissecting subcellular and cellular organization by spatial molecular neighborhood networks.\u201d\nThey plan to probe subcellular and cellular organization, counting molecular neighborhoods\u00a0and building maps to help researchers better understand the spatial organization of cells and molecules, insights that can open the door to game-changing personalized treatments for multiple diseases.\n\u201cThe spatial organization of these neighborhoods, of RNA and protein molecules, is important for cellular function,\u201d said Coskun,\u00a0a Bernie Marcus Early Career Professor in the Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering at Georgia Tech and Emory University. \u201cSo, we\u2019re basically making maps of molecules within the cell.\u201d\nThe maps can ultimately help researchers identify cell types that would best treat various diseases, while also explaining why some patients will respond to a particular treatment, and others won\u2019t.\nThe NIH\u2019s MIRA program provides researchers with greater stability and flexibility in funding while enhancing their ability to creatively tackle ambitious scientific problems. And part of the aim, said Coskun, \u201cis to address basic biology questions that have implications on multiple diseases in the future. This single cell work has that kind of potential.\u201d\nFor Coskun, the MIRA is the next phase of support in a flurry of awards that have come his way recently: it\u2019s the fifth NIH grant his lab has received this year, with a total value of $3.6 million.\n\u201cThis year has been a great year for us,\u201d said Coskun. \u201cIt\u2019s encouraging to receive this kind of recognition and support for research and technology that we believe will play an important role in the lives of patients.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nContact\nWriter:\nJerry Grillo\nEmail\njerry.grillo@ibb.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
