Would he be satisfied with the progress the nation has made to ensure that all Americans enjoy the promise of the rights to \"life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness?\"\n\u201cIt has been nearly 50 years since the assassination of Dr. King, yet many of the same issues he worked to address, including racial discrimination, poverty, and social justice, continue to be important to many in our nation today,\u201d said Archie Ervin, vice president for Institute Diversity. \u201cThat is why the theme of this year\u2019s MLK Celebration at Georgia Tech is \u2018Setting the Agenda for the Next Civil Rights Movement.\u2019\u201d\nDuring Georgia Tech\u2019s MLK Lecture on January 11, Bakari Sellers, CNN political analyst, lawyer, and activist, honored Dr. King\u2019s legacy while setting the agenda for the next civil rights movement with students, faculty, staff, and community members. During his remarks, Sellers asked the audience: \u201cHow far have we come, and where do we go from here?\u201d\n\u201cWhen you think about the sacrifice of the civil rights leaders like Marion Barry and Julian Bond, and you ask yourself, \u2018Where do we go from here?\u2019 there are two choices \u2014 chaos or community \u2014 as Dr. King once outlined,\u201d said Sellers. \u201cThe answer between these choices lies fundamentally in our ability to dream with our eyes open.\u201d\nAccording to Sellers, \u201cWhen you dream with your eyes open, you seek nothing less than excellence.\u201d He gave an example from his own life, when he made history in 2006 as the youngest member of the South Carolina state legislature and the youngest African-American elected official in the nation.\n\u201cWe have to remember the names that are not taught. For example, Shirley Chisholm helped paved the way for Hillary Clinton,\u201d remarked Sellers. \u201cWe stand on the shoulders of countless heroes who deserve from us to continue this journey on the race to excellence.\u201d\nTo view the MLK Lecture in its entirety, visit\nhttps://youtu.be/I1QildvSWeA .\nGeorgia Tech\u2019s MLK Celebration is sponsored by Institute Diversity, Ivan Allen College of Liberal Arts, Office of Government and Community Relations, Office of Student Diversity Programs, and Student Government Association.
