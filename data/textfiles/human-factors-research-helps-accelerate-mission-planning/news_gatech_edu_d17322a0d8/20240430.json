This effort could benefit all Department of Defense (DoD) agencies for collaborative mission planning.\n\u201cWe are working with Navy and Marine Corps aviators to identify areas in mission planning where work-flow can be streamlined, reducing the time required to mission plan,\u201d said Marcia Crosland, project director for GTRI\u2019s Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS) User Interface Design and Usability efforts. \u201cOur task has been to define the user interface concepts and decision-making tools to help reduce the time required for mission planning. We\u2019ve created detailed designs and specifications to direct current and future development of mission planning systems.\u201d\nMission planning needs to support the ability to collaboratively plan missions involving multiple aircraft but currently does not have that capability. The planning challenge can be quite complex, involving multiple targets, ground-based threats, different aircraft types and a variety of weapons systems. The most complex part of the process is often done by multiple pilots using whiteboards, paper, and spreadsheets to combine relevant information, consider alternatives, and reveal complicated issues.\nInformation from the whiteboarding process is then entered into the software system, which produces the mission plans that go on board the aircraft. The GTRI human factors team realized that supporting these whiteboarding activities in the mission planning system could accelerate the mission planning process, and they created new designs to support this functionality.\n\u201cWe are making recommendations for how the Navy can streamline the process and move it all into the digital world to eliminate the paper and whiteboard processes,\u201d said Crosland. \u201cThat will allow aircrews to plan a mission more efficiently, reducing the time required and potentially highlighting places where automated decision-making tools could be brought into the process.\u201d\nShe added: \u201cWe tried to understand the tasks of the user and therefore how the workflow could be streamlined. From that, we designed user interfaces that better implement the tasks, and we developed a style guide to help the DoD software programmers who were implementing it.\u201d\nAt each iteration of the process, prototype interface designs were evaluated with experts. In some cases, those experts visited the GTRI team in Atlanta to review and discuss the designs.\n\u201cWe took them through each of the screens to find out what is intuitive to them and what is not,\u201d Crosland said. \u201cWe did this multiple times with different user groups to make sure we had a good set of interface concepts. In this work, it\u2019s critical to involve the intended users of the system.\u201d\nThe GTRI team has applied lessons learned from a variety of domains \u2013 desktop and web design, and commercial and military applications. For instance, shortening the distance between buttons on a screen, reducing the number of clicks necessary for a task, consolidating screens, and providing a consistent workflow direction make a digital system easier and faster to use \u2013 whether it\u2019s a website or mission planning system.\n\u201cWe want to make the system a companion for the aircrews so they consider it a partner in these critical processes,\u201d she added. In one case, the researchers were able to consolidate nine separate screens, each with different tabs, into a single screen.\n\u201cAt the root of all user interface design, whether it\u2019s web or something else, is creating a time-efficient task that is intuitive so using it takes less time and less training and creates fewer errors,\u201d Crosland said. \u201cIf you can cut down on errors because users understand the system, it will make the system more efficient.\u201d\nGTRI\u2019s Human Systems Engineering Branch (HSEB) has been in operation for more than 30 years to help improve the interaction between warfighters and the technologies they use.\n\u201cWe have significant experience in understanding the domains of mission planning and mission execution, and the components that make technology easier to use,\u201d Crosland said. \u201cWe use established design standards customized for a particular format, whether it\u2019s a mobile tablet or standard computer.\u201d\nIn addition to Crosland, the GTRI team includes more than 20 people. The leadership component includes Tommer Ender, director of GTRI\u2019s Electronic Systems Laboratory (ELSYS); Adam McCorkle and J.D. Fassett, both associate directors in ELSYS; Debra Jones, head of ELSYS\u2019s HSEB, and C.J. Hutto, associate branch head for HSEB.\nThe project\u2019s analysis and design team has included Buddy Ray, Stuart Michelson, Andrew Baranak, Vlad Pop, Liz Weldon, Chandler Price, Courtney Crooks, Chris Hale, Mike Fitzpatrick, Robert Kempf; technical advisor John Huggins; HCI graduate students Catherine Johnson, Sarah Brooks and Rachel Chen, undergraduate students Megan Eberle and Spencer Frum; and other GTRI subject matter experts.\nResearch News\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\n177 North Avenue\nAtlanta, Georgia\u00a0 30332-0181\u00a0 USA\nMedia Relations Contact : John Toon (404-894-6986) (jtoon@gatech.edu).\nWriter : John Toon\nAdditional Images\nContact\nJohn Toon\nResearch News\n(404) 894-6986\nEmail\njtoon@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
