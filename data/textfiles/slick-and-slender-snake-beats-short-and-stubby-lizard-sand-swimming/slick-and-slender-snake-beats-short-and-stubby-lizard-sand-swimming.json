That\u2019s one conclusion from a study of the movement patterns of the shovel-nosed snake, a native of the Mojave Desert of the southwest United States. The research shows how the snake uses its slender shape to move smoothly through the sand, and how its slippery skin reduces friction \u2013 both providing locomotive advantages over another sand-swimmer: the sandfish lizard native to the Sahara Desert of northern Africa. The study provides information that could help explain how evolutionary pressures have affected body shape among sand-dwelling animals. And the work could also be useful in designing search and rescue robots able to move through sand and other granular materials. Using X-ray technology to watch each creature as it moved through a bed of sand, researchers studied the waves propagating down the bodies of both the snakes and sandfish lizards. Granular resistive force theory, which considers the thrust provided by the body waves and the drag on the animals\u2019 bodies, helped model the locomotion and compare the energy efficiency of the limbless snake against that of the four-legged lizard \u2013 which doesn\u2019t use its legs to swim through the sand. \u201cWe were curious about how this snake moved, and once we observed its movement, how it moved so well in the sand,\u201d said\nDan Goldman , an associate professor in the\nSchool of Physics\nat the Georgia Institute of Technology. \u201cOur model reveals how both the snake and the sandfish move as fast as their body shapes permit while using the least amount of energy. We found that the snake\u2019s elongated shape allowed it to beat the sandfish in both speed and energy efficiency.\u201d Information about the factors enabling the snake to move quickly and efficiently could help the designers of future robotic systems. \u201cKnowing how the snake moves could be useful, for instance, in helping robots go farther on a given amount of battery power,\u201d Goldman said. Supported by the National Science Foundation and the Army Research Office, the research was published online December 18, 2014, in the\nJournal of Experimental Biology . The study is believed to be the first kinematic investigation of subsurface locomotion in the long and slender shovel-nosed snake,\nChionactis occipitalis . Measurements made by former Ph.D. student Sarah Sharpe revealed that the snake propagates traveling waves down its body, from head to tail, creating a body curvature and a number of waves along its body that enhance its movement through the sand. As a consequence of the kinematics, the snake\u2019s body travels mostly in the same \u201ctube\u201d through the sand that is created by the movement of its wedge-shaped head and body. Because the snake essentially follows its own tracks through the sand, the amount of slip generated by its motion is small, allowing it to move through the sand using less energy than the sandfish ( Scincus scincus ), whose movement pattern generated a larger fluidized region of sand around its body. Overall, the research showed that each animal had optimized its ability to swim through the sand using its specific body plan. \u201cFor each body wave the snake generates, it moves farther than the sandfish does within a single wave of motion of its body,\u201d Goldman noted. \u201cHaving a long and slender body allows the snake to bend its body with greater amplitude while generating more waves on its body, making it a more efficient sand swimmer.\u201d The snake\u2019s skin is also more slippery than that of the sandfish, further reducing the amount of energy required to move through the sand. Scientists had suspected that long and slender animals would have a sand-swimming advantage over creatures with different body shapes. The research showed that the advantage results from a high length-to-width ratio that allows the formation of more waves. \u201cIf you have the right body shape and slick skin, you can get a very low cost of transport,\u201d explained Goldman. To study the snakes as they moved through sand, Sharpe \u2013 from Georgia Tech\u2019s Interdisciplinary Bioengineering Program \u2013 and undergraduate Robyn Kuckuk, from the Wallace H. Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering at Georgia Tech and Emory University, glued tiny lead markers onto the scales of the snakes. The markers, which fall off when the snakes shed their skin, allowed the researchers to obtain X-ray images of the snakes moving beneath the surface of the sand. Sharpe, now a biomechanical engineer with a research and consulting firm in Phoenix, created detailed videos showing how the snakes moved. Associate professor Patricio Vela and graduate student Miguel Serrano, both from Georgia Tech\u2019s School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, developed software algorithms that allowed detailed analysis of the wave-forms seen on the X-ray movies as a function of time. Stephan Koehler, a research associate in applied physics at Harvard University, applied Resistive Force Theory to obtain data on the snakes\u2019 movement and energy efficiency. Animals swimming in sand can only move if the thrust provided by their bodies exceeds the drag created. The theory predicted that the snakes\u2019 skin would have about half as much friction as that of the sandfish, and that prediction was verified experimentally. Joe Mendelson, director of research at Zoo Atlanta, assisted the research team in obtaining and managing the snakes. Understanding how animals move through granular materials like sand could help the designers of robotic systems better understand how to optimize the use of energy, which can be a significant limiting factor in robotics. \u201cThis research is really about how body shape and form affect movement efficiency, and how we can go between experiment and theory to improve our understanding of these issues,\u201d said Goldman. \u201cWhat we are learning could help search and rescue robots maneuver in complex terrain and avoid obstacles.\u201d Beyond the robotics concerns, the work can help scientists understand biological issues, such as how the body plans of desert-dwelling lizards and snakes converge to optimize their ability to move through their environment. \u201cThese granular swimming systems turn out to be quite useful for understanding fundamental questions about evolutionary biology, biomechanics and energetics because they are simple to analyze and they can describe a good number of systems,\u201d Goldman added.
