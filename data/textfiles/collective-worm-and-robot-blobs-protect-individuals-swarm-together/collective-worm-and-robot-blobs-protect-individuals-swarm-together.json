But together, tens, hundreds, or thousands of the centimeter-long creatures can collaborate to form a \u201cworm blob,\u201d a shape-shifting living liquid that collectively protects its members from drying out and helps them escape threats such as excessive heat.\nWhile other organisms form collective flocks, schools, or swarms for such purposes as mating, predation, and protection, the Lumbriculus variegatus worms are unusual in their ability to braid themselves together to accomplish tasks that unconnected individuals cannot. A new study reported by researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology describes how the worms self-organize to act as entangled \u201cactive matter,\u201d creating surprising collective behaviors whose principles have been applied to help blobs of simple robots evolve their own locomotion.\nThe research, supported by the National Science Foundation and the Army Research Office, was reported Feb. 5 in the journal\nProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences . Findings from the work could help developers of swarm robots understand how emergent behavior of entangled active matter can produce unexpected, complex, and potentially useful mechanically driven behaviors.\nCollective Behavior in Worms\nThe spark for the research came several years ago in California, where\nSaad Bhamla\nwas intrigued by blobs of the worms he saw in a backyard pond.\n\u201cWe were curious about why these worms would form these living blobs,\u201d said Bhamla, an assistant professor in Georgia Tech\u2019s\nSchool of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering . \u201cWe have now shown through mathematical models and biological experiments that forming the blobs confers a kind of collective decision-making that enables worms in a larger blob to survive longer against desiccation. We also showed that they can move together, a collective behavior that\u2019s not done by any other organisms we know of at the macro scale.\u201d\nSuch collective behavior in living systems is of interest to researchers exploring ways to apply the principles of living systems to human-designed systems such as swarm robots, in which individuals must also work together to create complex behaviors.\n\u201cThe worm blob collective turns out to have capabilities that are more than what the individuals have, a wonderful example of biological emergence,\u201d said\nDaniel Goldman , a Dunn Family Professor in Georgia Tech\u2019s\nSchool of Physics , who studies the physics of living systems.\nWhy the Worms Form Blobs\nThe worm blob system was studied extensively by Yasemin Ozkan-Aydin, a research associate in Goldman\u2019s lab. Using bundles of worms she originally ordered from a California aquarium supply company \u2013 and now raises in Georgia Tech labs \u2013 Ozkan-Aydin put the worms through several experiments. Those included development of a \u201cworm gymnasium\u201d that allowed her to measure the strength of individual worms, knowledge important to understanding how small numbers of the creatures can move an entire blob.\nShe started by taking the aquatic worms out of the water and watching their behavior. First, they individually began searching for water. When that search failed, they formed a ball-shaped blob in which individuals took turns on the outer surface exposed to the air where evaporation was taking place \u2013 behavior she theorized would reduce the effect of evaporation on the collective. By studying the blobs, she learned that worms in a blob could survive out of water 10 times longer than individual worms could.\n\u201cThey would certainly want to reduce desiccation, but the way in which they would do this is not obvious and points to a kind of collective intelligence in the system,\u201d said Goldman. \u201cThey are not just surface-minimizing machines. They are looking to exploit good conditions and resources.\u201d\nUsing Blobs to Escape Threats\nOzkan-Aydin also studied how worm blobs responded to both temperature gradients and intense light. The worms need a specific range of temperatures to survive and dislike intense light. When a blob was placed on a heated plate, it slowly moved away from the hotter portion of the plate to the cooler portion and under intense light formed tightly entangled blobs. The worms appeared to divide responsibilities for the movement, with some individuals pulling the blob while others helped lift the aggregation to reduce friction.\nAs with evaporation, the collective activity improves the chances of survival for the entire group, which can range from 10 worms up to as many as 50,000.\n\u201cFor an individual worm going from hot to cold, survival depends on chance,\u201d said Bhamla. \u201cWhen they move as a blob, they move more slowly because they have to coordinate the mechanics. But if they move as a blob, 95% of them get to the cold side, so being part of the blob confers many survival advantages.\u201d\nA Worm Gymnasium\nThe researchers noted that only two or three \u201cpuller\u201d worms were needed to drag a 15-worm blob. That led them to wonder just how strong the creatures were, so Ozkan-Aydin created a series of poles and cantilevers in which she could measure the forces exerted by individual worms. This \u201cworm gymnasium\u201d allowed her to appreciate how the pullers managed to do their jobs.\n\u201cWhen the worms are happy and cool, they stretch out and grab onto one of the poles with their heads and they pull onto it,\u201d Bhamla said. \u201cWhen they are pulling, you can see the deflection of the cantilever to which their tails were attached. Yasemin was able to use known weights to calibrate the forces the worms create. The force measurement shows the individual worms are packing a lot of power.\u201d\nSome worms were stronger than others, and as the temperature increased, their willingness to work out at the gym declined.\nApplying Worm Principles to Robots\nOzkan-Aydin also applied the principles observed in the worms to small robotic blobs composed of \u201csmart active particles,\u201d six 3D-printed robots with two arms and two sensors allowing them to sense light. She added a mesh enclosure and pins to arms that allowed these \u201csmarticles\u201d to be entangled like the worms and tested a variety of gaits and movements that could be programmed into them.\n\u201cDepending on the intensity, the robots try to move away from the light,\u201d Ozkan-Aydin said. \u201cThey generate emergent behavior that is similar to what we saw in the worms.\u201d\nShe noted that there was no communication among the robots. \u201cEach robot is doing its own thing in a decentralized way,\u201d she said. \u201cUsing just the mechanical interaction and the attraction each robot had for light intensity, we could control the robot blob.\u201d\nBy measuring the energy consumption of an individual robot when it performed different gaits (wiggle and crawl), she determined that the wiggle gait uses less power than the crawl gait. The researchers anticipate that by exploiting gait differentiation, future entangled robotic swarms could improve their energy efficiency.\nExpanding What Robot Swarms Can Do\nThe researchers hope to continue their study of the collective dynamics of the worm blobs and apply what they learn to swarm robots, which must work together with little communication to accomplish tasks that they could not do alone. But those systems must be able to work in the real world.\n\u201cOften people want to make robot swarms do specific things, but they tend to be operating in pristine environments with simple situations,\u201d said Goldman. \u201cWith these blobs, the whole point is that they work only because of physical interaction among the individuals. That\u2019s an interesting factor to bring into robotics.\u201d\nAmong the challenges ahead are recruiting graduate students willing to work with the worm blobs, which have the consistency of bread dough.\n\u201cThe worms are very nice to work with,\u201d said Ozkan-Aydin. \u201cWe can play with them and they are very friendly. But it takes a person who is very comfortable working with living systems.\u201d\nThe project shows how the biological world can provide insights beneficial to the field of robotics, said Kathryn Dickson, program director of the Physiological Mechanisms and Biomechanics Program at the National Science Foundation.\n\u201cThis discovery shows that observations of animal behavior in natural settings, along with biological experiments and modeling, can offer new insights, and how new knowledge gained from interdisciplinary research can help humans, for example, in the robotic control applications arising from this work,\u201d she said.\nThis research was supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF) under grants CAREER 1941933 and 1817334 and the Army Research Office under grant W911NF-11-1-0514.
