So, what should you read?\nWe asked faculty members in the School of Literature, Media, and Communication (LMC) to suggest a favorite holiday-themed book. The recommendations range from classics like\nLittle Women\nto collections of gothic Christmas tales and science fiction Christmas stories.\nA Christmas Carol\nBy Charles Dickens, Calla Editions (1843)\n\u201cMy favorite Christmas story is\nA Christmas\nCarol, which Dickens published in 1843 and remains relevant for a Covid-19 Christmas. Since we\u2019ve seen adaptations (with its central character played by Mister Magoo, Scrooge McDuck, Patrick Stewart, and George C. Scott), it\u2019s hard to realize that Dickens wrote it after reading a government report on child labor during a period characterized as the Hungry Forties. Dickens concluded his story by having Scrooge give his clerk a turkey and a raise, a feel-good ending that doesn\u2019t go far enough to solve the problems of Ignorance and Want that Dickens personifies.\u201d\n\u2014 Carol Senf, professor and director of Undergraduate Studies, LMC\nLittle Women ( or\nMeg, Jo, Beth, and Amy)\nBy Louisa May Alcott, with illustrations by Frank Merrill, SeaWolf Press (1868-69)\n\u201cLouisa May Alcott\u2019s novel\nLittle Women\nopens at Christmas with the March sisters discussing presents. The novel explores 19th-century domestic ideologies of gender in ways that still resonate with audiences in describing how Marmee educates her four daughters (Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy March) while their patriarch serves as a chaplain supporting the Union during the Civil War. Self-sacrifice, compassion, generosity, and the importance of respecting love over money are among the lessons the mother imparts to her girls. Greta Gerwig\u2019s 2019 film reorders the narrative to emphasize the pleasures and costs of domesticity for the March women.\u201d\n\u2014Carol Colatrella, professor and associate dean for Graduate Studies, Ivan Allen College of Liberal Arts\nAt Chrighton Abbey and Other Horror Stories\nBy Mary Elizabeth Braddon, Westside Press (2002)\n\u201cIt was a tradition in the 19th-century to read stories as a family\n\u2014\ngothic tales and ghost stories were particularly popular and often read at Christmastime. While\nA Christmas Carol\nby Charles Dickens is the most common example, I recommend a lesser-known collection by the Victorian fiction writer Mary Elizabeth Braddon. Her stories were highly popular in the period and often had sensational themes and mysterious plots.\nOf Chrighton Abbey\nis one of her gothic Christmas stories. It brings together a creepy cast of characters in a Christmas setting, and its central theme surrounds a family curse and ghostly warnings of a death before a wedding day. This collection of Braddon\u2019s tales also provides examples of her other gothic and sensational tales, perfect for a read by the fire on a winter day. There is the creepy, but engaging ghost story, \u2018The Cold Embrace,\u2019 about a young artist haunted by the ghost of a former lover he betrayed, and a fabulous vampiric story called \u2018The Good Lady Ducayne.\u2019\u201d\n\u2014 Narin Hassan, associate professor, LMC\nTyll\nBy Daniel Kehlmann, Pantheon Books (translation copyright 2020)\n\u201cIf you like historical fiction, and if you are in the mood to learn how human beings may have dealt with calamity, war, and pandemic 400 years ago, then Daniel Kehlmann\u2019s\nTyll\nmight be a good pick. This novel, shortlisted for the Booker Prize in 2020, transports the reader back into one of the most tumultuous and bloody periods of pre-modern European history, the Thirty Years War (1618-1648) and into the life of the notorious trickster figure and vagrant folk hero Tyll Eulenspiegel. Tyll\u2019s fable-like adventures in an apocalyptic world question authority and absolute truths in ways that will feel eerily familiar to contemporary readers. His survival skills resemble that of a superhero, but his weapons are a m\u00e9lange of naivete and wit. Is anyone surprised that Netflix is in the process of adapting the novel into a TV series?\u201d\n\u2014Richard Utz, chair and professor, LMC\nThe Tailor of Gloucester\nby Beatrix Potter, F. Warne & Co. (2002), and\nA Child\u2019s Christmas in Wales \u00a0by Dylan Thomas, Orion (1993) (This edition has the reviewer\u2019s favorite illustrations.)\n\u201cMy mum grew up in London, so a lot of our Christmas books were the classic English ones. I still have a kind of nostalgic connection to Beatrix Potter\u2019s\nThe Tailor of Gloucester\n\u2014\neven though half of the words in it were utterly incomprehensible to me (\u201cpenn\u2019orth\u201d and \u201cpipkin\u201d and that sort of thing). It\u2019s about a tailor who falls sick while trying to finish a coat for the mayor\u2019s wedding on Christmas day. Traditionally you\u2019d read it in a little miniature edition, which was part of the charm. An honorable mention for Dylan Thomas\u2019s\nA Child\u2019s Christmas in Wales , a kind of prose poem, which introduced to me the invaluable distinction between Useful Presents (terrible) and Useless Presents (great), a distinction my seven-year-old son has embraced enthusiastically.\u201d\n\u2014 Aaron Santesso, professor, LMC\nLisa Yaszek, professor, LMC, recommended several science fiction Christmas tales:\n\u201c The Star \u201d by Arthur C. Clarke, Harcourt Brace (1950); \u201c The Wild Wood \u201d by Mildred Clingerman, Size 5 1/2 B Publishing (1957);\nA Lot Like Christmas: Stories\nby Connie Willis, Del Rey (2017), and\nChristmas on Mars , a 2008 film written and directed by Wayne Coyne, front man of the Flaming Lips.\n\u201cAt first it might seem surprising that there is a tradition of science fiction Christmas tales \u2014 after all, we often assume that science and religion are antithetical to one another, even in fiction. But who better to give us fresh perspectives on a story that has already been visited and revisited by artists for well over 2,000 years? Indeed, the two classic short stories I\u2019m recommending for this holiday season deliver that fresh perspective in spades, even today. Arthur C. Clarke\u2019s award-winning 1955 short story \u2018The Star\u2019 provides a surprising but deeply moving perspective on science, faith, and the celestial object that guided the wise men to Bethlehem. Two years later, Mildred Clingerman would offer a completely different but equally novel take on Christmas with \u2018The Wild Wood,\u2019 a 1957 short story that explores the terrifying sexed and gendered energies informing our most cherished holiday traditions. Taken together, these stories \u2014 both of which are available online for free in either print or audio form \u2014 will ensure that you never think about the winter holidays quite the same way again.\n\u201cOf course, science fiction is a big tent, and for those of you who prefer humor and magic with your holiday stories, science fiction can provide that, too! Connie Willis is famous for both her humorous science fiction in general and her annual Christmas stories in particular. Her recent collection,\nA Lot Like Christmas: Stories,\nbrings those two together in a truly enchanting blend of sweetness and spice \u2014 a fantastic antidote to the challenges of 2020. And for a story that brings Clarke\u2019s meditation on science, faith, and outer space up to date for this millennium, I recommend checking out Wayne Coyne\u2019s 2008 independent film\nChristmas on Mars . It\u2019s homemade, it\u2019s surreal, and, in the end, it\u2019s hauntingly beautiful. (Bonus points if you\u2019re a Flaming Lips fan!) Copies of either would make excellent stocking stuffers for the science fiction fan in your life.\u201d\nSome of these books are available by searching the Library\u2019s online catalog:\nhttps://www.library.gatech.edu/\nYou can also search other libraries, using Tech\u2019s interlibrary loan system:\nhttps://www.library.gatech.edu/borrow-other-libraries\nAdditional Images\nContact\nVictor Rogers\nInstitute Communications\nEmail\nvictor.rogers@comm.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
