All eight finalists, which also include Virginia Tech, Pennsylvania State University and Purdue University, are vying for four different awards that highlight the key components of economic engagement: talent, innovation, place and connections. APLU is a research, policy and advocacy organization that represents 236 public research universities and state university systems. The winners will be announced at APLU\u2019s 127 th\nannual meeting on Nov. 4. Economic development has been a core mission of Georgia Tech since its founding in 1885. The institution has a number of initiatives and units dedicated to furthering economic development statewide through two key divisions: research with Stephen E. Cross serving as executive vice president of research, and outreach and business development at the Enterprise Innovation Institute (EI 2 ). EI 2\nis charged with a number of development programs\u00a0that include business startup and innovation support through its Advanced Technology Development Center, Flashpoint, and VentureLab. It also has advisory and consulting services through its Innovation Strategy and Impact program, the Georgia Manufacturing Extension Partnership, and the Minority Business Development Agency (MBDA) Business Center, among other initiatives. Technology Square, which is adjacent to Tech\u2019s campus and home to EI 2 , also is a critical component. Besides EI 2 , it also is home to five corporate innovation centers including the AT&T Foundry, the Global Learning Center and two business incubators. \u201cEconomic development has been an important part of Georgia Tech\u2019s mission since we were founded 129 years ago,\u201d said Stephen Fleming, EI 2 \u2019s executive vice president. While EI 2\nis a critical component of that economic development focus, Fleming said it\u2019s a core undertaking at Tech as whole.\u00a0 On the research side, Tech has created 10 Interdisciplinary Research Institutes (IRIs)\u00a0to beef up both industrial and economic engagement. All told, Tech\u2019s direct economic development initiatives surpassed $2.3 billion in fiscal year 2011, the most recent data available. That\u2019s more than any other institution in the University System of Georgia. \u201cWe\u2019ve maintained a consistent focus on economic development for the whole state of Georgia being one of the things that we invest in, one of the things that we focus on, and one of the things we\u2019re proud of doing here,\u201d Fleming said. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to see an entity like APLU recognizing that.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nEnterprise Innovation Institute\nInterdisciplinary Research Institutes\nContact\nLaura Diamond\u00a0 Georgia Tech Media Relations 404-894-6016\nEmail\nlaura.diamond@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
