The long-term initiative will begin with two virtual events and a collaborative online activity during the Fall 2020 semester.\nSoon after his investiture last fall, President \u00c1ngel Cabrera charged leaders and units throughout campus with spearheading a project that would promote, implement, and advance the 17 United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) at Georgia Tech. Adopted by the UN General Assembly in 2015 as part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the SDGs are designed to address the world\u2019s most pressing challenges, including poverty, inequality, climate change, environmental degradation, and peace and justice.\nFeaturing objectives such as \u201cAffordable and Clean Energy,\u201d \u201cIndustry, Innovation, and Infrastructure,\u201d and \u201cSustainable Cities and Communities,\u201d the SDGs appear by name in Tech\u2019s new strategic plan and align with the Institute\u2019s areas of expertise as well as its mission to develop leaders who advance technology and improve the human condition.\n\u201cRepresenting some of the most consequential and complex problems we face as a species, the SDGs range from health and hunger to gender equality and ocean biodiversity,\u201d said President Cabrera. \u201cThey are not nice-to-haves; they are essential for the long-term sustainability of life and human development on our planet.\u201d\nThe new sustainability initiative stems in part from\nTech\u2019s affiliation with the University Global Coalition (UGC) , which President Cabrera chairs and helped found. Established in 2019, the UGC comprises a group of higher education leaders from across the globe who work together to advance the SDGs through education, research, service, and campus operations.\nFall 2020 Programming\nEvents and activities planned for the Fall 2020 semester will focus on how Tech can use the SDGs as a framework to implement the new strategic plan, advance organizational innovation, unite the Institute\u2019s broad spectrum of activities and responsibilities, strengthen Tech\u2019s local and global collaborations, and address urgent challenges such as Covid-19 and racial injustice.\nAdvancing the Sustainable Development Goals at Georgia Tech\nThursday, September 10, 11 a.m. \u2013 12:15 p.m.\nOpen to the public, the first event will feature a keynote address from President Cabrera and a panel discussion moderated by Anna Stenport, chair of the School of Modern Languages and co-director of the Atlanta Global Studies Center. Programming will focus on introducing the campus community to the SDGs, discussing their global importance and relevance to Tech, and demonstrating how the Institute can lead the region in implementing and advancing them.\nSDG Asset Mapping\nSeptember 10 \u2013 23\nFollowing the kickoff event, the Institute community will be invited to participate in a collaborative online effort to identify SDG-related assets \u2014 such as places, programs, projects, organizations, and web-based resources \u2014 that Georgia Tech can leverage to lead higher education in working toward achieving the SDGs. This simple mapping activity will allow community members to create an initial list of SDG-related assets that will become the starting point of the third event, 17 Zooms.\n17 Zooms\nThursday, October 1, 9 a.m. \u2013 noon\nA virtual version of the 17 Rooms event concept developed by The Brookings Institution and The Rockefeller Foundation, 17 Zooms aims to stimulate collective action toward implementing the SDGs. It works by convening 17 distinct groups of specialists to identify, in concert, high-impact objectives that can be met in 18 months.\n17 Zooms will bring together select Georgia Tech faculty, staff, and students, as well as relevant off-campus partners, for small group discussions in 17 different Zoom sessions, one for each SDG. Participants in each group will work together to recommend projects related to their session\u2019s SDG that link research, teaching, operations, and service. At the same time, attendees will learn about existing SDG-related work and connect with people from different backgrounds and disciplines.\nAfter the event, leaders from each session will team up to identify several action\u00a0items for Georgia Tech to implement over the following year and a half that will advance the SDGs and the strategic plan.\nLearn More About Sustainability at Tech\nFor more details about these programs and Tech\u2019s campuswide commitment to sustainability, visit\nSDGs at Tech .\nThe Fall 2020 SDG program committee comprises faculty and staff from the following units:\nAtlanta Global Studies Center\nGlobal Leadership LLC\nImpact LLC\nInstitute Communications\nInstitute Diversity, Equity and Inclusion\nInstitute Relations\nOffice of Campus Sustainability\nRay C.
