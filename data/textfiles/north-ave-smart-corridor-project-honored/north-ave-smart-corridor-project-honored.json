Georgia Tech serves as the research partner for this Atlanta initiative.\n\u201cThis corridor is becoming the most connected one in the state of Georgia, serving as a living lab for active, multi-modal traffic management through technology deployment and data analytics. Smart technology solutions applied here are improving roadway and public safety, mobility and the environment,\u201d according to the\u00a0 news release announcing the award .\nIn August 2017, the City of Atlanta\u00a0 announced an expanded research project with the Institute for the North Avenue project . It involves multiple Smart City technology components designed to: facilitate and promote safety for pedestrian and bicycle traffic; use the latest technology-adaptive traffic signals for a safer, more efficient flow of bus and vehicular traffic in real time conditions; and prioritize fire engines and ambulances traveling along the corridor on emergency response calls.\nGeorgia Tech has partnered with the City since 2015 to design, implement and study Smart City initiatives.\nGeorgia Tech leads several initiatives to bring together industry and public agencies to help local governments implement smart development. The strategies developed serve as models that could be implemented across Georgia and the country.\nThe\u00a0 Georgia Smart Communities Challenge \u00a0provides seed funding and access to a Georgia Tech research team to develop and implement smart design solutions to tackle big challenges such as housing, traffic congestion, sea level rise and shared autonomous vehicles.\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nSmart Cities and Inclusive Innovation\nGeorgia Smart Communities Challenge\nContact\nLaura Diamond\nMedia Relations\n404-894-6016\n@LauraRDiamond\nEmail\nlaura.diamond@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
