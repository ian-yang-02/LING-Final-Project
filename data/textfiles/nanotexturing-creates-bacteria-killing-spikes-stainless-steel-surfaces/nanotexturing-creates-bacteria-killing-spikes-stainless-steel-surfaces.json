If additional research supports early test results, the process might be used to attack microbial contamination on implantable medical devices and on food processing equipment made with the metal.\nWhile the specific mechanism by which the nanotextured material kills bacteria requires further study, the researchers believe tiny spikes and other nano-protrusions created on the surface puncture bacterial membranes to kill the bugs. The surface structures don\u2019t appear to have a similar effect on mammalian cells, which are an order of magnitude larger than the bacteria.\nBeyond the anti-bacterial effects, the nano-texturing also appears to improve corrosion resistance. The research was reported December 12 in the journal\nACS Biomaterials Science & Engineering\nby researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology.\n\u201cThis surface treatment has potentially broad-ranging implications because stainless steel is so widely used and so many of the applications could benefit,\u201d said\nJulie Champion , an associate professor in Georgia Tech\u2019s School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering. \u201cA lot of the antimicrobial approaches currently being used add some sort of surface film, which can wear off. Because we are actually modifying the steel itself, that should be a permanent change to the material.\u201d\nChampion and her Georgia Tech collaborators found that the surface modification killed both Gram negative and Gram positive bacteria, testing it on\nEscherichia coli\nand\nStaphylococcus aureus . But the modification did not appear to be toxic to mouse cells \u2013 an important issue because cells must adhere to medical implants as part of their incorporation into the body.\nThe research began with a goal of creating a super-hydrophobic surface on the stainless steel in an effort to repel liquids \u2013 and with them, bacteria. But it soon became clear that creating such a surface would require the use of a chemical coating, which the researchers didn\u2019t want to do. Postdoctoral Fellows Yeongseon Jang and Won Tae Choi then proposed an alternative idea of using a nanotextured surface on stainless steel to control bacterial adhesion, and they initiated a collaboration to demonstrate this effect.\nThe research team experimented with varying levels of voltage and current flow in a standard electrochemical process. Typically, electrochemical processes are used to polish stainless steel, but Champion and collaborator\nDennis Hess\n\u2013 a professor and Thomas C. DeLoach, Jr. Chair in the School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering \u2013 used the technique to roughen the surface at the nanometer scale.\n\u201cUnder the right conditions, you can create a nanotexture on the grain surface structure,\u201d Hess explained. \u201cThis texturing process increases the surface segregation of chromium and molybdenum and thus enhances corrosion resistance, which is what differentiates stainless steel from conventional steel.\u201d\nMicroscopic examination showed protrusions 20 to 25 nanometers above the surface. \u201cIt\u2019s like a mountain range with both sharp peaks and valleys,\u201d said Champion. \u201cWe think the bacteria-killing effect is related to the size scale of these features, allowing them to interact with the membranes of the bacterial cells.\u201d\nThe researchers were surprised that the treated surface killed bacteria. And because the process appears to rely on a biophysical rather than chemical process, the bugs shouldn\u2019t be able to develop resistance to it, she added.\nA second major potential application for the surface modification technique is food processing equipment. There, the surface treatment should prevent bacteria from adhering, enhancing existing sterilization techniques.\nThe researchers used samples of a common stainless alloy known as 316L, treating the surface with an electrochemical process in which current was applied to the metal surfaces while they were submerged in a nitric acid etching solution.\nApplication of the current moves electrons from the metal surface into the electrolyte, altering the surface texture and concentrating the chromium and molybdenum content. The specific voltages and current densities control the type of surface features produced and their size scale, said Hess, who worked with Choi \u2013 then a Ph.D. student \u2013 and Associate Professor Victor Breedveld in the School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, and Professor Preet Singh in the School of Materials Science and Engineering, to design the nanotexturing process.\nTo more fully assess the antibacterial effects, Jang engaged the expertise of Andr\u00e9s Garc\u00eda, a Regents\u2019 Professor in Georgia Tech\u2019s Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering, and Graduate Student Christopher Johnson. In their experiments, they allowed bacterial samples to grow on treated and untreated stainless steel samples for periods of up to 48 hours.\nAt the end of that time, the treated metal had significantly fewer bacteria on it. That observation was confirmed by removing the bacteria into a solution, then placing the solution onto agar plates. The plates receiving solution from the untreated stainless steel showed much larger bacterial growth. Additional testing confirmed that many of the bacteria on the treated surfaces were dead.\nMouse fibroblast cells, however, did not seem to be bothered by the surface. \u201cThe mammalian cells seemed to be quite healthy,\u201d said Champion. \u201cTheir ability to proliferate and cover the entire surface of the sample suggested they were fine with the surface modification.\u201d\nFor the future, the researchers plan to conduct long-term studies to make sure the mammalian cells remain healthy. The researchers also want to determine how well their nanotexturing holds up when subjected to wear.\n\u201cIn principle, this is very scalable,\u201d said Hess. \u201cElectrochemistry is routinely applied commercially to process materials at a large scale.\u201d\nCITATION : Yeongseon Jang, et al., \u201cInhibition of Bacterial Adhesion on Nano-Textured Stainless Steel 316L by Electrochemical Etching,\u201d (ACS Biomaterials Science & Engineering, 2017).\nhttp://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acsbiomaterials.7b00544\nResearch News\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\n177 North Avenue\nAtlanta, Georgia\u00a0 30332-0181\u00a0 USA\nMedia Relations Contacts : John Toon (404-894-6986) (jtoon@gatech.edu) or Josh Brown (404-385-0500) (josh.brown@comm.gatech.edu).\nWriter : John Toon\nAdditional Images\nContact\nJohn Toon\nResearch News\n(404) 894-6986\nEmail\njtoon@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
