The solar panels that help power the spacecraft cannot be touched by bare human hands. Any sensor or microcomputer moved out of its proper positioning can prevent the satellite from operating.\nTech\u2019s Prox-1 was part of the payload aboard the third launch of the SpaceX Falcon Heavy \u2014 the world\u2019s most powerful operational rocket. Its mission is to deploy LightSail-a solar sailing satellite developed by the Planetary Society.\nGrayson Huggins just completed his bachelor\u2019s degree in aerospace engineering at Georgia Tech. He was part of the student team that built and tested Prox-1 ahead of the Falcon Heavy launch.\n\u201cIt is really one of my proudest achievements in my life, and it\u2019s something nobody can ever take away from me,\u201d said Huggins, who is currently interning at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. \u201cSomething I built will be in space, and that\u2019s amazing to be able to say at 22 years old.\u201d\nProx-1 was scheduled to be deployed approximately 80 minutes after takeoff on the evening of Monday, June 24, but was delayed by a few hours.\nThe satellite will now spend its first week circling Earth quietly, allowing time for the other spacecraft launched into the same orbit to drift away, so that each can be identified individually. Many eyes will be on Prox-1 because it is carrying LightSail.\nOnce deployed from Prox-1, LightSail will unfurl a solar sail about the size of a boxing ring and will attempt to become the first spacecraft to be propelled using only sunlight.\nLightSail is part of a 10-year project sponsored by the Planetary Society, the independent space interest group headed up by engineer and television personality Bill Nye.\nBefore the launch, Georgia Tech aerospace alumna and a former mission manager for Prox-1, Teresa Spinelli, met up with Nye at NASA\u2019s Kennedy Space Center.\n\u201cAs a college student, I was so excited to work on something real that would go to space. It felt like everything I had dreamed of was coming true,\u201d Spinelli says. \u201cWhile I wish Prox-1 would have been able to launch while I was a student, I\u2019m so excited to see it finally get a chance to fly.\u201d\nGeorgia Tech aerospace engineering professor\nGlenn Lightsey\nand former Georgia Tech professor Dave Spencer served as advisors to the more than 200 students who played a role in the Prox-1 project, which has been supported by the Air Force Office of Scientific Research.\nProx-1 is not the only successful satellite mission that started at Georgia Tech. Two cubesats from the\nRANGE project,\n( R anging and\nN anosatellite\nG uidance\nE xperiment) were successfully launched into orbit in December 2018 on board the SpaceX Falcon-9. Many Georgia Tech aerospace students played critical roles in that mission as well.\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nMore About Prox-1 Project\nContact\nSteven Norris\nInstitute Communications\nEmail\nsnorris@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
