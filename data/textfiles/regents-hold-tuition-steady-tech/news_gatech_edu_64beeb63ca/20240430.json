The BOR also voted to allocate to Georgia Tech $484 million in state appropriations for fiscal year 2024 (FY24) \u2014 a 6% increase over last year.\n\u201cI\u2019m proud that we\u2019ve been able to not only avoid increases in tuition and fees over the past four years, but have actually reduced them by $1,100, which is unheard of in higher education,\u201d said Georgia Tech President \u00c1ngel Cabrera. \u201cWe\u2019ve been able to do this thanks to increases in state appropriations, enrollment growth, and the dedication of faculty and staff who constantly find innovative ways to get the job done, serve more students, and deliver the highest value to students in the nation. Georgia Tech is regularly cited among the\nbest values for higher education in the nation\n\u2014 students pay less to go to school and get higher paying jobs when they\u2019re done. It is my hope that Georgia Tech can continue to grow in the future, and I look forward to working with state officials to ensuring that we can continue to do so.\u201d\nState appropriations for FY24 include approximately $11 million for the $2,000\ncost-of-living adjustment\nfor full-time, eligible employees. The majority of pay adjustments will be completed in July.\n\u201cGeorgia Tech remains strong, as demonstrated by our talented students, our growing undergraduate and graduate enrollment, and our incredible staff and faculty,\u201d said Interim Executive Vice President for Administration and Finance and Interim Chief Business Officer Mike Shannon. \u201cThe approved funding will enable us to continue to\nadvance our instructional, research, and service missions.\u201d\nAdditional details regarding the FY24 budget and how it will affect the Georgia Tech community will be provided in the coming weeks as information becomes available.\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nBoard of Regents Approves No Tuition Increase for the 2023-24 Academic Year, Wi\u2026\nPrinceton Review Names Tech No. 1 Best Value Public University\nContact\nRachael Pocklington\nInstitute Communications\nEmail\nrpocklington@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
