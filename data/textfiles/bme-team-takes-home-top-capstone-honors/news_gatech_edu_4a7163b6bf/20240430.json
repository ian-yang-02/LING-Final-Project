They used algorithms, calculations,\u00a0and scientific exercises.\nMore than 200 teams from a dozen schools in three colleges\u00a0showcased their projects at the 2018 Spring Capstone Design Expo, and while they all hoped to take home an award, the fact that they made it that far was an accomplishment in itself. Senior Design is a required course for many majors, and Capstone represents the culmination\u00a0of months of work for the seniors who participated. For some students the projects\u00a0could turn into stepping stones for launching startups. Several teams were presented with\u00a0golden tickets, granting them entry into Georgia Tech's\u00a0CREATE-X startup program. Others students used their projects to wow sponsors, earning them jobs, continued funding to follow up on their work, or in the very least, an important industry collaboration to put on their resume.\nBME team\nKit Cath \u00a0took home Capstone's best overall project award and are\u00a0hoping it opens some doors for them as they approach graduation and look for jobs. The team is made up of biomedical engineering majors Kathleen Jordan,\u00a0Lemou Tieyam,\u00a0Diana Yunda, and\u00a0Alexa Schlein\u00a0developed\u00a0an adaptable catheter for their sponsors in the\u00a0Interventional Radiology Department at Emory University Hospital Midtown.\u00a0Inspired by a Slinky, the catheter tip can bend and adjust to the curves in a patient's\u00a0vascular system, resulting in a snug fit and greatly reducing the amount of time radiologists have to spend adjusting catheters. It will also reduce the number of catheter exchanges, wasted product, procedure lengths, costs, and patient discomfort.\u00a0Everyone on the team is interested in pursing careers in the medical device field.\nFor all teams, the night was a reminder of what Georgia Tech students can accomplish when they put their minds to something.\nFor example, the winning ISyE team worked with FedEx to optimize their linehaul truck fleet. By the team's calculations, adopting their plan will save FedEx more than $200,000 per week. The award-winning civil engineering team discovered that by changing the lane striping at the I-285 and I-20 junction on the west side of Atlanta, bottlenecks can be eliminated and flow improved for miles in every direction, shaving up to 10 minutes off of commute times.\u00a0Team pHAM, from materials science and engineering, developed a filter that\u00a0reduces the acidity of coffee, thereby\u00a0negating\u00a0some of the negative effects of drinking it, such as acid reflux and enamel damage. The un-sponsored\u00a0squad took home the People's Choice Award at this year's InVenture\u00a0Prize competition and is working on commercializing their product.\nVisit the College of Engineering to check the results.\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nCapstone Design Homepage\nPhoto Gallery of the Event\nContact\nBen Wright\nCollege of Engineering\n404-385-2190\nben.wright@coe.gatech.edu\nEmail\nben.wright@coe.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
