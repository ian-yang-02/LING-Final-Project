But\u00a0 a\nnew study\nsuggests \u00a0the rotation may have occurred with ease billions of years ago when RNA\u2019s chemical ancestors casually spun into spiraled strands.\nIn the lab, researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology were surprised to see them do it under conditions thought to be common on Earth just before first life evolved: in plain water, with no catalysts, and at room temperature.\nThe neat spiraling also elegantly integrated another compound which today forms the backbone of RNA and DNA. The resulting structure had features that strongly resembled RNA.\nPivotal twists\nThe study has come a step closer to answering a\nchicken-egg\nquestion about the evolutionary path that led to RNA (from which DNA later evolved): Did the spiral come first, and did this structure influence which molecular components made it later into RNA because they fit well into the spiral?\n\u201cThe spiraling could have had a reinforcing effect. It could have facilitated the molecules getting connected together that have the same\nchirality\n(curve) to connect into a common backbone that is compatible with the helical twist,\u201d said the study\u2019s principal investigator Nicholas Hud,\u00a0 a Regents Professor in Georgia Tech\u2019s School of Chemistry and Biochemistry .\nThe researchers published the new study\u00a0 in the journal\u00a0 Angewandte Chemie \u00a0in December 2018 . The research was funded by the National Science Foundation and the NASA Astrobiology Program under the\u00a0 Center for Chemical Evolution . The center is headquartered at Georgia Tech, and Hud is its principal investigator.\nThe study\u2019s resulting polymers were not RNA but could be have been an important intermediate step in the early evolution of RNA. For building blocks, the researchers used base molecules referred to as \u201cproto-nucleobases,\u201d highly suspected to be precursors of\u00a0 nucleobases , main components that transport genetic code in today\u2019s RNA.\n[Thinking about grad school?\u00a0 Here's how to apply to Georgia Tech. ]\nNucleobase paradox\nThe study had to work around a paradox in chemical evolution:\nMaking RNA or DNA using their actual nucleobases in the lab without the aid of the enzymes of living cells that usually do this job is more than a herculean task. Thus, although RNA and DNA are ubiquitous on Earth now, their evolution on pre-life Earth would appear to have been an anomaly requiring erratic convergences of extreme conditions.\nBy contrast, the Georgia Tech researchers\u2019 model of chemical evolution holds that precursor nucleobases self-assembled easily to into ancestral prototypes -- that were polymer-like and referred to as assemblies -- which later evolved into RNA.\n\u201cWe would call these \u2018proto-nucleobases\u2019 or \u2018ancestral nucleobases,\u2019\u201d Hud said. \u201cFor our overall model of chemical evolution, we\u2019re saying that these proto-nucleobases, which self-assemble into these long strands, could have been part of a very early stage before modern nucleobases were incorporated.\u201d\nOne main suspected proto-nucleobase in this experiment -- and in previous experiments on the possible the evolution of RNA -- was\u00a0 triaminopyrimidine (TAP) .\u00a0 Cyanuric acid (CA) \u00a0was another. The researchers highly suspect TAP and CA were parts of a proto-RNA.\nThe chemical bonds that hold together assemblies of the two suspected proto-nucleobases were surprisingly strong but\u00a0 non-covalent , which is akin to connecting two magnets. In RNA the main bonds holding together modern nucleobases are\u00a0 covalent bonds , akin to welding, and enzymes make those bonds in cells today.\nHelical biases\nA helix can spiral two ways, left-handed or right-handed. In chemistry, a molecule can also be handed, or\u00a0 chiral , making for \u201cL\u201d or \u201cD\u201d forms of the molecule.\nIncidentally, the building blocks of today\u2019s RNA and DNA are all the D form, which make a right-handed helix. Why they evolved like this is still a mystery.\nBatches of TAP and CA the researchers started out with produced roughly equal amounts of right and left-handed helices, but something stood out: Whole regions of a batch were biased in one direction and were separate from other regions that spiraled mostly the other way.\n\u201cThe propensity for the molecules to choose one helical direction was so strong that large regions of the batches were made up predominantly of assemblies that were unidirectionally twisted,\u201d Hud said.\nThis was surprising because the individual molecules of TAP and CA had no chirality of their own, neither L nor D. Still, the twists had a preferred direction.\n\u2018world record\u2019\nThe researchers added two more experiments to test how strongly their RNA-like assemblies preferred making one-handed helices.\nFirst, they introduced a smidgeon of compounds similar to TAP and CA, but which had L or D chirality, to nudge the spiraling direction. The whole batch conformed to the chirality of the respective additive, resulting in assemblies twisting in a unified direction as helices do in RNA and DNA today.\n\u201cIt was the new world record for the smallest amount of a chiral dopant (additive) that would flip a whole solution,\u201d said\u00a0 Suneesh Karunakaran , the study\u2019s first author and a graduate researcher in Hud\u2019s lab. \u201cThis demonstrated how easy it would be in nature to get abundant amounts of unified helices.\u201d\nSecond, they put the sugar compound\u00a0 ribose-5-phosphate \u00a0together with TAP to more closely emulate the current building blocks of RNA. The ribose fell into place, and the resulting assembly spiraled in a direction dictated by the ribose chirality.\n\u201cThis molecule easily formed an RNA-like assembly that was surprisingly stable, even though the pieces were only held together by non-covalent bonds,\u201d Karunakaran said.\nEvolution revolution\nThe study\u2019s results under such simple conditions represent a leap forward in experimental evidence for how the helical twist of biomolecules could have already been in place long before life emerged.\nThe research also expands a growing body of evidence supporting an unconventional hypothesis by the Center for Chemical Evolution, which dispenses with the need for a narrative that rare cataclysms and unlikely ingredients were necessary to produce life\u2019s early building blocks.\nInstead, most biomolecules likely arose in several gradual steps, on quiet, rain-swept dirt flats or lakeshore rocks lapped by waves. Precursor molecules with the right reactivity enabled those steps readily and produced abundant materials for further evolutionary steps.\nBasement engineer\nIn the lab, helix self-assemblage was so productive that it outstripped a detection device\u2019s capacity to examine the output. Regions a square millimeter or more in size were packed with unidirectionally spiraled polymer-like assemblies.\n\u201cTo look at them I had to make adjustments to the equipment,\u201d said Karunakaran. \u201cI punched holes in a foil and put it in front of the beam of our spectropolarimeter.\u201d\nThat worked but needed improvement, so Hud took to his basement at home to build an automated scanner that could handle the experiment\u2019s bountiful results. It revealed large regions of helices with the same handedness.\nAlso READ :\nThis actually happened: Strip all the lynchpins from the ribosome and it still works\nBrian J.
