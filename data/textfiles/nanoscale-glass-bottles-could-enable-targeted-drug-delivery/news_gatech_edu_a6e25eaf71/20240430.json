The fatty acids remain solid at human body temperature but melt a few degrees above. When an infrared laser is absorbed by the dye, the fatty acids will be quickly melted to release the therapeutic drug.\n\u201cThis new method could allow infusion therapies to target specific parts of the body and potentially negating certain side effects because the medicine is released only where there\u2019s an elevated temperature,\u201d said\u00a0Younan Xia, professor and Brock Family Chair in the\u00a0Wallace H. Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering\u00a0at Georgia Tech and Emory University.\u00a0\u201cThe rest of the drug remains encapsulated by the solid fatty acids inside the bottles, which are biocompatible and biodegradable.\u201d\nThe researchers also showed that the size of the hole could be changed, enabling nanocapsules that release their payloads at different rates.\n\u201cThis approach holds great promise for medical applications that require drugs to be released in a controlled fashion and has advantages over other methods of controlled drug release,\u201d Xia said.\nAn earlier method for achieving controlled drug release involves loading the temperature-sensitive material into low-density lipoproteins, which is often referred to as \u201cbad cholesterol.\u201d Another method involves loading the mixture into gold nanocages. Both have disadvantages in how the material used to encapsulate the drugs interact with the body, according to the study.\nTo make the silica-based bottles, the research team started by fabricating spheres out of polystyrene with a small gold nanoparticle embedded in its surface. The spheres are then coated with a silica-based material everywhere except where the gold nanoparticle is embedded. Once the gold and polystyrene are removed, only a hollow silica sphere with a small opening remains. To adjust the size of the opening, the researchers simply changed the size of the gold nanoparticle.\nThe process to load the bottles with their payload involves soaking the spheres in a solution containing the mixture, removing the trapped air, then washing away the excess material and payload with water. The resulting nanocapsules contain an even mixture of the temperature-sensitive material, the therapeutic drug, and the dye.\nTo test the release mechanism, the researchers then put the nanocapsules in water and used a near-infrared laser to heat the dye while tracking the concentration of the released therapeutic. The test confirmed that without the use of the laser, the medicine remains encapsulated. After several minutes of heating, concentrations of the therapeutic rose in the water.\n\u201cThis controlled release system enables us to deal with the adverse impacts associated with most chemotherapeutics by only releasing the drug at a dosage above the toxic level inside the diseased site,\u201d said Jichuan Qiu, a postdoctoral fellow in the Xia group.\nThis research was supported by the National Science Foundation under grant No. ECCS-1542174 through the National Nanotechnology Coordinated Infrastructure.
