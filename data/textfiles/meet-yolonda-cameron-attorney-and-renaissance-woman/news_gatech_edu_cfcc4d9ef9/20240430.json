Today, 19 years later, Cameron is still in Legal Affairs, but the job has changed.\nIn 1999, her position involved reviewing lots of contracts including nondisclosure agreements, material transfer agreements, software licenses, performing arts agreements, and releases. But, many of these agreements are now handled by Georgia Tech Research Corporation (GTRC) or Georgia Tech Purchasing. Other agreements are now standard Georgia Tech template agreements with standardized Georgia Tech terms that can be used repeatedly without any changes other than updating the administrative details such as the date, company name, address, and such.\nA senior attorney specialist, Cameron now spends her time working on trademarks, copyright, and film location agreements.\n\u201cMy biggest practice area is trademarks,\u201d she said. \u201cWe work with Institute Communications in enforcing Georgia Tech trademarks. Our beloved Buzz seems to be the trademark that everyone wants to use [without permission].\u201d\nRoutinely, a notification will come into Institute Communications, often from a Tech alumnus or employee who has spotted a violation of the trademark.\n\u201cBusinesses in the area have used the Georgia Tech logo on Facebook invitations,\u201d Cameron said. \u201cSometimes the trademark has been used on menus. In response, we send a cease and desist letter. Typically, they will stop using the trademark [without further action being taken].\u201d\nCameron also gets questions regarding copyrights. For such inquiries, her office works with the Georgia Tech Library and refers employees to the Board of Regents\u2019 copyright policy webpage.\n\u201cSometimes when a faculty member is doing a presentation, they will have questions regarding the use of an image. They have to perform a fair-use analysis via the Fair Use checklist located on the Board of Regents website,\u201d she said.\nCopyright questions also come up when faculty are developing online courses that use copyrighted materials.\n\u201cFilm location agreements for filming on Georgia Tech\u2019s campus is another big area,\u201d she said. \u201cThese requests can be very fast-paced because they have to be turned around quickly.\u201d\nWith Atlanta\u2019s film industry booming, Cameron said location scouts often look to Georgia Tech.\n\u201cWe are centrally located. We have a beautiful campus. We have a lot of cool buildings. Everybody gravitates here,\u201d she said.\nSome of the buildings that are frequently requested for filming are Clough Commons, Klaus Computing, the Student Center, the Academy of Medicine, and the Campus Recreation Center and its obstacle course.\nSeveral movies or scenes from movies have been filmed on campus, including\nThe Internship, The Accountant, Selma,\nand an upcoming movie starring Melissa McCarthy called\nSuperintelligence.\n\u201cWhen the film industry first came calling [for\nThe Internship\nstarring Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson], Georgia Tech had to develop a policy, process, and documents around filming on campus,\u201d Cameron said.\nLegal Affairs worked with Capital Planning and Space Management (CPSM) to identify the key stakeholders at Georgia Tech. As a result, a film logistics committee was formed, a filming and photography policy and process developed, and a filming application and standard filming location agreements drafted.\n\u201cNow, we have a standard agreement for film requests with a large footprint and another agreement for smaller film requests,\u201d Cameron said. \u201cFor the larger film projects, the request must be evaluated by the film logistics committee, which includes CPSM, Risk Management, Legal Affairs, Institute Communications, Parking and Transportation, Environmental Health & Safety (EH&S), Georgia Tech Police, and building captains for all buildings involved.\u201d\nCameron said she enjoys the variety that her job brings, including working with departments all over campus and putting faces with names.\nGiving Voice to Creativity\nCameron was born in Philadelphia, and her family moved to New Jersey when she was about two. They then moved to Atlanta when she was five, and that\u2019s where she grew up.\nIn college, she earned a dual degree: a bachelor of science in mathematics from Jackson State University, and a bachelor of science in electrical engineering from Georgia Tech.\n\u201cThen I realized, \u2018this technical stuff is not for me,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not my passion. My passion is writing, so I thought about how I could marry the two.\u201d\nAfter graduating, she took a year off before going to law school at George Washington University in Washington, DC. She then worked for a solo practitioner in Midtown Atlanta, primarily doing patent litigation, before coming to Georgia Tech.\nShe still writes. It gives voice to her creative side.\n\u201cOf course, like a lot of writers, I want to write the great American novel one day,\u201d she said. \u201cI have a couple of ideas. Whatever I write will be fiction. Poetry also calls to me.\u201d\nCameron is also a certified yoga instructor, with 200 hours of training. She is a well-being activator (through Tech\u2019s Health Initiatives) for Ethics, Compliance, and Legal Affairs. Once a month, she and a coworker lead a group of colleagues in yoga. And, once a month she volunteers to teach a yoga class for women in the Dekalb County Jail.\nPhotography and book crafting (making and binding books) are other hobbies. She loves taking photos of landscapes and nature, and she enjoys paper crafting of any kind. Years ago, she took classes on campus at Paper & Clay to learn how to develop black and white film.\nShe\u2019s also always on the lookout for an art or paper crafts class. She said she feels a need to balance her analytical, logical side with some sort of creative activity or project.\nLastly, Cameron loves to travel. In June, she and her sister enjoyed a one-week vacation in London.\n\u201cWe did all of the touristy stuff,\u201d she said. \u201cWe got tickets to see\nWicked\nin the West End, and my sister got us tickets to see Ed Sheeran, her favorite artist.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nRead More Staff Stories\nContact\nVictor Rogers\nInstitute Communications\nEmail\nvictor.rogers@comm.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
