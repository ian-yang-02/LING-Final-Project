The regional dialogue at the iconic Tech Tower brought together executive-level representatives from industry, academia, and government to discuss solutions to the challenges facing America\u2019s engineering enterprise. \u201cSince our nation\u2019s founding, the engineering enterprise has been the wellspring of our security and prosperity,\u201d said Jeff Wilcox, Lockheed Martin\u2019s vice president of engineering and founder of NEF. \u201cThe NEF movement is dedicated to bringing together stakeholders from across the engineering community and developing an actionable roadmap to ensure the sustainability of that enterprise.\u201d NEF\u2019s regional dialogue series has been to 14 American engineering hubs, including New York, Los Angeles, Pittsburgh, Boston, and Chicago. Still ahead are dialogues in Phoenix and several more locations in the planning stages. \u201cNEF is a center of gravity pulling everyone together to face engineering\u2019s challenges of capacity, capability and competitiveness. We call those challenges the 3C\u2019s,\u201d Wilcox said.\nAtlanta was chosen as a regional dialogue city because of its significant role in technology, biomedical engineering, manufacturing, and education. Georgia Tech and the Georgia Research Alliance are ideal NEF hosts. Georgia Tech is a renowned science and technology-focused research institution, serving more than 13,000 students in the College of Engineering. The university is acclaimed for its achievements in clean, sustainable energy research, discoveries in diseases and treatment, and advancements in national defense and security, while the Georgia Research Alliance is aligned with\nGeorgia\u2019s universities, and brings focus to science and industry in the region, launching new companies and creating high-value jobs. \u201cAt Georgia Tech, we\u2019ve learned that innovation solutions are many times interdisciplinary and the result of collaboration between education, business, industry, and government,\u201d said Georgia Tech President G. P. \u201cBud\u201d Peterson. \u201cRegional dialogues like this one, initiated by the National Engineering Forum, are helping to stimulate the conversation between thought leaders from all of these groups, and helping to build a community of action with tremendous potential in order to advance U.S. leadership in engineering.\u201d \u201cEngineering talent is critical to the future of American innovation and competitiveness,\u201d said C. Michael Cassidy, President and CEO of the Georgia Research Alliance. \u00a0\u201cWe\nwere proud to cohost the NEF Regional dialogue and look forward to collaborating with our partners from the universities, business and government on how to address the needs of the U.S engineering enterprise.\u201d \u201cIt is critical that we bring together all those who have a stake in preserving and growing the American engineering enterprise,\u201d said Chad Evans, executive vice president of the Council on Competitiveness. \u201cWe need engineers themselves,along with the business community, government leaders, educators and the media collaborating to enlighten our collective national consciousness about the power of engineering and its vital role in our nation\u2019s competitiveness in the global economy.\u201d\nAbout the National Engineering Forum: The National Engineering Forum (NEF) brings together leaders concerned about the sustainability of the United States engineering field and the impact on the nation\u2019s security and prosperity. NEF involves industry executives, academics, policymakers, media, engineering societies, and nonprofits to develop solutions to the challenges facing the U.S. engineering enterprise.
