With a clear mandate to show tightly integrated design, simulation, optimization and building science, the team produced a highly modern, performance-based design of a zero energy home. \u201cCongratulations to team gt.5 for this accomplishment,\u201d said Augenbroe. \u201c Prototype 5\ndemonstrates Georgia Tech's leadership in guiding advanced design solutions through building science and computation. Twenty-eight university teams from the U.S. and Canada competed in this first annual competition to develop cost-effective zero energy ready homes for mainstream builders. In late April the teams presented their innovative designs aimed to transform housing in America to a panel of national experts and researchers in high performance building. These innovations will be incorporated into the Department of Energy and National Renewable Energy Lab\u2019s effort to fight climate change.
