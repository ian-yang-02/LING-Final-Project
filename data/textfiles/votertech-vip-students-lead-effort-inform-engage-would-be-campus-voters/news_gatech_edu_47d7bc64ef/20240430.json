It works to help make it easier for the diverse student body to register and vote.\nIt is getting the job done with all the hallmarks of a typical Georgia Tech project: in-depth research, good organization, and technology, according to\nRichard Barke , a professor in the Ivan Allen College of Liberal Art\u2019s\nSchool of Public Policy\nand one of five instructors who mentor the VIP team members.\n\u201cThe voting process is becoming technologically intense, as we\u2019re seeing in this current iteration, so it makes sense to see what we can do using technology to address some of the problems with elections and voting,\u201d Barke said.\nAs Georgia\u2019s Oct. 5 registration deadline draws near, the team is developing technologies to help voters find information about registration, ballot information, and early and absentee voting.\n\u201cThis project takes place during an important election,\u201d said\nVoterTech\nmember Caleb Torres, a third-year public policy student from Atlanta. Torres also is chief of staff for Georgia Tech\u2019s Undergraduate Student Government Association. \u201cYounger voters, including college students, are turning out in record numbers to the polls, and we want to help ensure every voter is as knowledgeable as possible.\u201d\nThe team of 18 students has split into four groups, each working on a specific issue: One team concentrates on collecting ballot information. The second is working on voter registration efforts. Another team has built a website,\nhttps://vote.cae.gatech.edu , and the fourth is working on a smartphone app.\nThe website offers a simple step-by-step approach to registering to vote or voting, with vetted links to registration sites and information about requesting absentee ballots or finding polling places, in Georgia and across the United States.\nIt also provides links to election protection information and what to do if a voter had to cast a provisional ballot.\nVeteran VIP organizer\nJennifer Leavey , principal academic professional in the College of Sciences, organized VoterTech last year. Leavey is not an expert in politics but wanted to help spark excitement in voting among Georgia Tech students.\n\u201cIt took a while for the students to tease out what they wanted to work on, but now they are really taking off,\u201d Leavey said.\nIn addition to Leavey and Barke, the faculty and staff team includes\nChristopher Le Dantec , an associate professor in the School of Interactive Computing and the Ivan Allen College\u2019s School of Literature, Media, and Communication; Recha Reid, a political scientist and interim assistant director for student innovation and undergraduate\u00a0research in the Office of Undergraduate Education; and Nicole Leonard, advising and outreach manager in the Georgia Tech Honors Program.\n\u201cThe work that these students have done demystifies the voting process for students,\u201d Leonard said.\nReid noted the students\u2019 work is already serving as a \u201ccritical hub\u201d for their peers.\n\u201cOur VIP\u00a0students have surpassed all expectations with their hard work and creativity to expand the tools we have to inform voters and increase voter turnout among Georgia Tech students,\u201d Reid said.\nThe November election is far from the end for VoterTech. Le Dantec expects the experience with this cycle will give the team a clear idea of the challenges students face in engaging in elections. This data will help inform what the group decides to do going forward.\n\u201cThis election season will give us a lot more runway to think more expansively about different kinds of technology solutions we might develop to help in future elections,\u201d said Le Dantec, an expert in\ndigital civics .\nWilliam Wilson, a second-year computer science student from Memphis, Tenn., is a member of the VIP\u2019s registration team. He always wanted to do more to encourage students to vote and found his outlet in VoterTech.\n\u201cThe reaction by students has been overwhelming,\u201d he said. \u201cStudents seem really excited to vote, and we hope our project can add to that.\u201d\nIn addition to the website, the team also is sharing information on\nFacebook\nand\nInstagram .\nAbout VIPs\nStudents participating in\nVertically Integrated Projects\nwork in multidisciplinary teams on projects that span multiple semesters, receiving academic credit\u00a0and invaluable experience as they apply their academic skills to real-world projects.\nThe concept was founded in 2001 at Purdue University by\nEdward J. Coyle , who has been on faculty in Georgia Tech\u2019s\u00a0School of Electrical and Computer Engineering since 2008.\nVIPs have since been adopted at 36 universities worldwide. Georgia Tech, a leader in the VIP Consortium, has one of the world\u2019s most extensive programs.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nMichael Pearson michael.pearson@iac.gatech.edu\nEmail\nmichael.pearson@iac.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
