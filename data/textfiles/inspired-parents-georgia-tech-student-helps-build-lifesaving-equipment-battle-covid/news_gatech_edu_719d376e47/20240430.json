My dad\u2019s currently working as a paramedic in the ER of a local hospital,\u201d Craig said.\nAfter graduating from Our Lady of Mercy Catholic High School in Fayetteville, Craig began studying mechanical engineering at Georgia Tech. Now, as he completes his master\u2019s degree, he\u2019s inspired by his parents' hard work in the community: He is part of a team of graduate and Ph.D. students working with Georgia Tech faculty to develop much-needed protective devices for healthcare workers, like his parents.\n\u201cIdeally, lives will be saved because of this, and I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a greater thing that we could be doing right now,\u201d he says.\nCraig has helped develop face shields and ventilators that have been drawn up and designed with advice from clinicians in hospitals and emergency rooms across Atlanta. And he is currently helping construct a foldable box that serves as a shield to protect healthcare workers while they perform intubations. Intubation is the process of tube insertion necessary to place a patient on a ventilator to assist with breathing during an illness like COVID-19.\n\u201cEven though the patient is sedated, some of those involuntary reflexes are still there. When they cough, that aerosolizes the virus, putting everyone in the room at risk,\u201d said Craig.\nThis box structure that Craig and his team have been working on provides an extra layer of protection for doctors and nurses having to perform this procedure, which is especially helpful given the shortage of standard personal protective equipment.\nThe device also serves another very important purpose.\n\u201cIt also helps keep their N95 masks cleaner, so they can use them for longer,\u201d he explains.\nCraig says this entire experience has made him look around in awe at the people stepping up to the challenge.\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nEmory and Georgia Tech Create Barrier Protection Devices for Use During COVID-19\nContact\nSteven Norris\nInstitute Communications\nEmail\nsnorris@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
