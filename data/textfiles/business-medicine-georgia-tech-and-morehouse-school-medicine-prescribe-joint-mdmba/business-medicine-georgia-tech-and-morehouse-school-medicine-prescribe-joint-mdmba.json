Contract negotiations. Data analytics. Leadership.\nWhether going into solo practice or working for a large hospital, future physicians will need these and other business skills to be successful. To help meet that need, Georgia Tech and Morehouse School of Medicine are partnering to offer a joint, five-year MD/MBA degree.\nStudents enroll and complete their first three years as medical students at Morehouse School of Medicine before entering Tech\u2019s Scheller College of Business for a rigorous one-year, three-semester MBA program. The final year, students return to Morehouse to complete their fourth year of medical studies.\nAllison Rowell, who worked as a registered nurse at Grady Health System and at Piedmont Hospital, is one of the program\u2019s first two students to enroll.\n\u201cI want to leverage MBA training with my unique clinical background to develop solutions to assist health care organizations in achieving greater resource efficiency without sacrificing the quality of care,\u201d Rowell said. \u201cAs a clinician, I will be able to apply my understanding of medicine in the context of cost-effective, value-based health care delivery systems.\u201d\nRowell said that as health care delivery systems become more complex and the market shifts toward value-based care, organizations recognize the advantages of placing clinicians in leadership roles.\n\u201cMy MD/MBA training will prepare me to pivot into this type of role after gaining experience as a practicing physician,\u201d she said.\nJoining Rowell in the new program is Ogechi Nwoko, who worked briefly as a clinical research coordinator for a contracting company that conducted clinical trials for pharmaceutical companies. She has always been drawn to health care, and some of her closest role models were physicians, so she enrolled at Morehouse School of Medicine.\n\u201cI wanted a career that would not only be a challenge but would allow me to make an impact in my community,\u201d Nwoko said. \u201cI chose to pursue an MBA at Georgia Tech because the more I learned about medicine, the more I realized that I wanted to have an impact that reached beyond my community. Learning \u2014 and eventually practicing \u2014 medicine is an honor and a privilege.\u201d\nBy offering this dual degree, Morehouse School of Medicine and Georgia Tech\u2019s Scheller College of Business are preparing students to provide high-quality healthcare in a smart, efficient way.\n\u201cTomorrow\u2019s physician must be business savvy, possess a lot of financial and managerial acumen, and also be entrepreneurial in their mindset,\u201d said Dean Maryam Alavi, Scheller College of Business. \u201cOur curriculum not only develops managerial and financial acumen, but also develops tech savvy and entrepreneurial thinking. This combination of skills enables our MD/MBA students to thrive and excel as physicians.\u201d\nBoth students received full fellowships that were jointly funded by the Scheller College of Business and Morehouse School of Medicine. They began their MBA work this semester, with an intended graduation of 2020 for both degrees.\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nWhite Coats and Yellow Jackets\nMD/MBA Program\nScheller College of Business\nMorehouse School of Medicine\nContact\nSusan Ambrosetti\nScheller College of Business\nEmail\nSusan.ambrosetti@scheller.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
