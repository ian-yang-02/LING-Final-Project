The contest aims to foster innovation, entrepreneurship and start-up creation.\nPartners in the Georgia Chamber initiative include: the University System of Georgia, the Technical College System of Georgia, private colleges and Georgia Tech.\nThe concept is modeled after\nGeorgia Tech\u2019s InVenture Prize , which started in 2009 to leverage the maker culture on campus and encourage students to push their ideas even further. Over the years, Tech students invented a\nsystem to protect first responders , a\nfirst-of-its-kind aiming device for competitive archery , a visual, color-based, rapid and disposable test for anemia and\nmuch more .\nThe Georgia Chamber said the new contest further establishes the state as a leader for entrepreneurship and small business success. The initiative will strengthen Georgia\u2019s pipeline of inventors and startup companies.\n\u201cAs the largest statewide business advocate, the Georgia Chamber of Commerce understands the importance of entrepreneurship and innovation, as it is a longstanding Chamber position to support the implementation of policies that promote commercialization, research activity and collaboration among the private and public sectors,\u201d said Chris Clark, Georgia Chamber president and CEO. \u201cWe encourage participation and look forward to working with our Georgia InVenture Prize partners in our continued efforts to develop local talent and increase access to venture capital.\u201d\nGeorgia Tech\u2019s own InVenture Prize continues to\nreward\nstudents for innovations that aim to solve the world\u2019s big problems. The 2019 competition kickoff will take place Sept. 12.\nIt also inspired a similar annual innovation competition among the colleges in the Atlantic Coast Conference. The\nACC InVenture Prize\nstarted in 2016.\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nGeorgia InVenture Prize\nGeorgia Tech's InVenture Prize\nEmail\nlaura.diamond@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
