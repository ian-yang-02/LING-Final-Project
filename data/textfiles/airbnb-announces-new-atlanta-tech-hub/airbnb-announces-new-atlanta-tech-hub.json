It follows Airbnb\u2019s 2020\u00a0 announcement of its plans to open a technical hub in Atlanta \u00a0to serve as the home for one of its product development teams, the regional base for new technical and non-technical roles over time, and the first step in a broader commitment to a long-term presence in metro Atlanta.\n\u201cWith the opening of our Atlanta Tech Hub, we hope to create many new high-skilled jobs over time and further expand our commitment to serving all stakeholders in Airbnb\u2019s diverse community: Hosts, guests, communities, employees, and shareholders,\u201d said Dave Stephenson, chief financial officer at Airbnb. \u201cAtlanta emerged as the perfect choice for our new tech hub because of its strong educational infrastructure and institutions committed to supporting communities of color.\u201d\nThe space Airbnb has leased in the mixed-use Interlock complex is managed by Georgia Advanced Technology Ventures (GATV), an affiliate of the Georgia Institute of Technology.\u00a0GATV acquires and develops properties near the campus that addresses both Georgia Tech\u2019s academic needs and that of technology companies interested in tapping into its research innovations and student talent.\u00a0 T. Dallas Smith & Company , the nation\u2019s largest African American-owned, pure tenant rep, commercial real estate brokerage firm, represented Airbnb in its search.\n\u201cAtlanta is and always will be open to business, innovation and attracting talent,\u201d said Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens, a Georgia Tech alum. \u201cThis investment is a vote of confidence in the strength of our tech industry and Atlanta\u2019s existing talent. We welcome Airbnb\u2019s new tech hub and I look forward to working together to create a pipeline of technical jobs and economic opportunities for our residents.\u201d\nCommitted to the next generation\nAs part of its recruitment and hiring efforts, Airbnb is constantly innovating and creating new programs to provide local candidates of all backgrounds and experience levels opportunities to join the company. With the opening of the Atlanta Tech Hub, Airbnb will continue its work in developing community partnerships in the city to expand entrepreneurship and create pathways for Atlanta residents to pursue careers in technology. This work builds on Airbnb\u2019s existing partnerships with the NAACP, the Russell Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurship (RICE), Tech Bridge, and others in the Atlanta community.\nSupporting the Atlanta community\nAirbnb is a tool for economic empowerment, providing a path to entrepreneurship for Atlanta residents and helping local families pay their bills by sharing their homes. In the first nine months of 2021, Airbnb brought more than\u00a0500,000 total guest arrivals into Atlanta and 1.7 million to Georgia. Since 2010, Airbnb hosts in Georgia have\u00a0 earned a total of $1.2 billion , and home sharing has served as a source of income for more than 40,000 hosts across the state. Some 56 percent of hosts in Atlanta self-identify as women, and 35 percent are families.\nMost hosts on Airbnb are everyday people sharing the homes in which they live, and the typical host earns $9,600 each year. According to a survey of Airbnb\u2019s U.S. host community, 42 percent said the money they earned on the online lodging marketplace\u2019s platform helped them stay in their homes. One quarter of Atlanta hosts said either they or someone in their household experienced a pay cut or lost work hours in 2020 because of the pandemic; 18 percent said they lost their jobs or were laid off themselves or lived with someone who did.\nAirbnb guest spending also supports local businesses. \u00a0Oxford Economics research \u00a0found that in 2019, Airbnb guest spending in Atlanta supported 3,400 jobs, including 1,200 in the restaurant industry. Almost 40 percent of guests said saving money on their accommodations by staying at an Airbnb listing allowed them to spend more on other goods or services in Atlanta.\n\u201cWe are committed to being a long-term partner to the city of Atlanta,\u201d Stephenson said, \u201cand look forward to continuing our work with local leaders as they promote entrepreneurship and tourism recovery.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nContact\nP\u00e9ralte C.
