We\u2019re assisting companies in their efforts to bring energy costs under control and make smart energy usage part of their daily processes,\u201d Meffert said.\nParticipants in the Southeast MEP Energy Management Program will take a series of classes and webinar sessions, and receive on-site coaching over a 12-month period. Completing the program allows them to be certified by the U.S. Department of Energy as 50001 Ready by showing they\u2019ve implemented the standard into their operations. They can also take an additional step to become certified, Meffert said.\nThe class for the first cohort launches in early 2019 and applications are being accepted at this link :\u00a0 https://gamep.org/southeast-energy-management-program/ .\nThe federal grant covers most of the cost for the training, but participating companies will pay about 25 percent of that. As part of the grant, the GaMEP will partner with MEPs in Tennessee, North Carolina, South Carolina, Alabama, and Texas. Those sister MEPs will find clients in those states to work with them to implement the ISO 50001 management system.\n\u201cFor many companies, energy use is a critical component of their ability to maintain a competitive edge,\u201d Meffert said.\nA medium- to large-sized company with 250 employees or more could spend more than $1 million a year on energy, including electricity, natural gas, fuel, and water.\n\u201cWhat we see with the companies that we\u2019ve worked with to adopt the ISO standard in the past is that they achieve energy performance improvements that go beyond the typical approaches,\u201d he said. \u201cRoughly 70 percent of the savings achieved are through operational controls and behavior change.\u201d\nSince the ISO standard\u2019s adoption in 2011, the GaMEP has helped more than 70 facilities in North America to implement ISO 50001, with most becoming certified, including nine in the Southeast.\n\u201cThis energy management system is applicable to a whole host of industries from textiles and floor coverings to food and beverage to automotive manufacturing,\u201d Meffert said. \u201cOne of the reasons we sought to get more companies in the Southeast to adopt this energy standard is because we have such a strong manufacturing presence in all of these sectors.\n\u201cIncorporating these standards and changing processes for energy usage can really make a difference to the bottom line, while also helping companies meet their competitiveness and sustainability objectives,\u201d Meffert said.\nAbout the Georgia Manufacturing Extension Partnership (GaMEP)\nThe Georgia Manufacturing Extension Partnership (GaMEP) is an economic development program of the Enterprise Innovation Institute at the Georgia Institute of Technology. The GaMEP is a member of the National MEP network supported by the National Institute of Standards and Technology. With offices in 10 regions across the state, the GaMEP has been serving Georgia manufacturers since 1960. It offers a solution-based approach to manufacturers through coaching and education designed to increase top-line growth and reduce bottom-line cost.\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nGeorgia Manufacturing Extension Partnership\nContact\nFor media inquiries, contact:\nP\u00e9ralte C.
