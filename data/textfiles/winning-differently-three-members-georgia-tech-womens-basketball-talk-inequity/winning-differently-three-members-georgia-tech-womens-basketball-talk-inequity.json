Under the direction of Head Coach Nell Fortner, the Yellow Jackets\u2019 12 conference wins were the most the program has had since the 2011-12 season. The team was largely led by graduating senior Kierra Fletcher (#41), who will return to The Flats for the 2021-22 season after being\ngranted a fifth year of eligibility by the NCAA .\nIn addition to completing a historic season, the team also addressed social and racial inequities both on and off the court, via their\nSay Her Name\ncampaign and an initiative with\nOMED: Educational Services \u00a0director and Tech alumnus Sybrina Atwaters called the\nRace and Reel Black Consciousness Series .\nAssociate Head Coach Latasha \u201cTasha\u201d Butts, Athletic Trainer Rachel Matthews, and Fletcher sat down for virtual interviews to reflect on the past year and what their partnership with Atwaters meant for the team.\nHill: Tell us a little about yourself, your background, and how you became a part of the Georgia Tech Women\u2019s Basketball team.\nFletcher: \u201cI\u2019m originally from Detroit, Michigan and I\u2019ve been playing basketball since I was about three years old. I was playing AAU [Amateur Athletic Union]\u00a0basketball about four or five years ago, when one of Tech\u2019s assistant coaches at the time reached out and told me the team was interested in me. I\u2019m from the Midwest, so I wasn\u2019t familiar with Georgia Tech at the time. But after I learned more about Tech, I was pretty interested because it\u2019s right in\u00a0the heart of Atlanta and Atlanta reminds me of Detroit. Georgia Tech is academically prestigious, so that drew me as well. Once I got on campus and saw what it was like, and the different programs it offers, I just felt this was the place for me.\u201d\nMatthews: \u201cColumbia, Maryland,\u00a0is home for me. I came to Tech in 2013 to start my graduate work, then left for a couple of years for experience. I\u2019ve been back here at Tech for four years now, working specifically with the women\u2019s basketball team.\u201d\nButts: \u201cI\u2019m originally from Georgia. I just completed my second year here at Tech, now going into my third. Prior to Georgia Tech, I was at LSU [Louisiana State University]\u00a0for eight years. Prior to LSU, I as at UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles]\u00a0for three years and Duquesne University for one year. I played college basketball for the late-great Pat Summit at the University of Tennessee and also had the opportunity to play professionally in the WNBA [Women\u2019s National Basketball Association] and internationally. All of that led me back home to the state of Georgia and here to Georgia Tech with the women\u2019s basketball team.\u201d\nKierra, what do you like about being a part of the Georgia Tech Women\u2019s Basketball team?\n\u201cI like how diverse our team is. I don\u2019t think you really see the type of diversity we have on our team anywhere else. We\u2019re not just Black and white \u2013\u00a0we have players from Italy, Spain, and Finland, and I really don\u2019t think you see that around the NCAA. Everyone comes from different backgrounds but we still come together to do what we need to do and we\u2019ve really built a family atmosphere.\u201d\nTell us about the team\u2019s historic season. What were some highlights?\nFletcher: \u201cI think the biggest accomplishment this year for us, as\u00a0a team, was making the NCAA Tournament. We hadn\u2019t been there since 2014, and we made it to the Sweet 16. This is something we can definitely build upon going into this upcoming season.\u201d\nMatthews: \u201cThis year was incredibly special for more reasons than one. This season just treated us really well. We were able to find true success in the midst of some craziness, and that\u2019s a testament to our ladies and their resilience. It was a really good time.\n\u201cWe got to travel with our entire program so it was fun to get to know staffers, bond, and connect with many outside of basketball who we didn\u2019t know.\nButts: \u201cIt was rewarding to even have a season \u2013\u00a0and we got through the season healthy. I\u2019m just thankful that our team got to experience this season and it was rewarding that our team met their goal. They wanted to have our name called on Selection Monday [the NCAA's announcement of invited Tournament participants] and go to the Tournament. I\u2019m just so thankful that they were able to reach their goals and go beyond what they thought they\u2019d be able to do and reach the Sweet 16. I\u2019m also thankful for their sanity and their mental health during these times.\u201d\nWhat has it been like playing in the time of Covid-19?\nMatthews: \u201cIt\u2019s certainly been challenging. Specifically, for me, as the primary health care provider. I administer the Covid\u00a0tests, receive the results, and am also the contact tracer. I also handle some of the other daily ins and outs, such as reminding our ladies of wearing masks and practicing social distancing.\u201d\nButts: \u201cThe fear was definitely there. Going into every single day not fully understanding how you can contract the virus has been stressful. We had moments during the season where some of us had to quarantine as a result of contract tracing, but luckily for us, none of the team contracted Covid-19.\n\u201cFor our players I felt badly, especially for our freshmen. They\u2019re entering college and this is their first taste of it \u2013 living in a bubble, having to quarantine. But, what I will say is that our ladies handled it very maturely. They saw the bigger picture and they saw the goal.\u201d\nFletcher: \u201cThe pandemic was a challenge. Having to test multiple times a week was a challenge but also the racial inequality and tough conversations about race and police brutality\u00a0that have been highlighted over this past year were something that were hard to deal with as well. Being a Black woman myself and just seeing things that are happening to people of color at the hands of law enforcement is something that I\u2019ve personally struggled with this past year.\u201d\nSpeaking of racial inequality and injustices, could you tell us a little more about the team\u2019s\nSay her Name\ncampaign?\nFletcher: \u201cThrough discussions with OMED, I learned so much about diversity and inclusion. We can say that we are diverse team, but do we include everyone? As a team, we wanted to do something impactful \u2013 something that people would remember from this season. The\nSay Her Name\ncampaign that we did included videos of every team member talking about a Black woman who lost her life hands at the hands of law enforcement. We looked up the stories of these women and decided to do this to honor one of these women at every game.\n\u201cIn addition to the short video, we would wear a shirt that read \"Say Her Name\"\u00a0and we would repeat this phrase in the video. These would be shown at home games on the big screen and we also put these on social media.\u201d\nMatthews: \u201cMuch credit to Kierra for the initiative \u2013 it was her idea. She had conversations with some of the support staff here with the team, which was then presented to the collective, and everyone loved the idea so, we ran with it. We dedicated the games to these Black women who were unjustly killed and their stories were told in our arena and on social media.\n\u201cBut what most people didn\u2019t see were the intimate moments our team had. Before every game, a Black woman\u2019s name would be read \u2013 such as Sandra Bland,\u00a0Breonna Taylor \u2013 and her story would be told. We had a moment before each game that created emotion just before we played. It really gave our ladies, including myself, a time to step outside of ourselves, a time to step outside the nature and the hype of\u00a0a basketball game and to really look at something much bigger than ourselves. So, while we got to raise awareness and share these stories, it was great for our team to be able to acknowledge something other than ourselves.\u201d\nButts: \u201cThe campaign\u00a0started with a conversation between myself and Kierra. Kierra then took it further and spoke with Coach Nell about it. After those initial conversations, Kierra, Cortnee Walton, and Sydnee Durrah [GTWBB recruiting operations and video staff members, respectively]\u00a0compiled a list of the women we would be representing.\n\"So many NCAA teams were kneeling [in response to police brutality] but we wanted to make sure that what we did was also educational. We wanted to bring to light these social injustices. So, we had a meeting and talked about some things and then came the discussion of what we wanted to do. We loved the idea of the\nSay Her Name\ncampaign. We wanted to build off the campaign that the WNBA did by dedicating their season to Breonna Taylor. But, we wanted to take it a little bit further and not only honor Breonna Taylor but honor a lot of other women who could easily be forgotten. It was very heavy as the season went along to look back and see all of these names but it was something that was necessary.\u201d\nDo you think the team will carry\nSay Her Name\ninto the next season?\nButts: \u201cI honestly don\u2019t know but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a bad idea. This is not something that\u2019s just for\nnow\n\u2013 this is something we live in, every day, and I have no problem continuing with it because we know there will be more names to come.\u201d\nMatthews: \u201cI\u2019d love to see how we could continue this. How do we reach more people and bring more awareness? I hope to see more of this in our upcoming season.\u201d\nWe\u2019ve seen professional and student-athletes get pushback when they raise awareness of racial injustice at games. How do you counter someone who says such messaging should be kept out of sports?\nMatthews: \u201cI think it\u2019s great for professional athletes and student-athletes to use their platform to raise awareness. Government officials have the attention of their offices; people of other notoriety use their status and their position to push for agendas that they believe in, so I think it\u2019s only right that athletes use their platform to freely express themselves. I don\u2019t see racial equality as political in the least bit. I think it\u2019s freedom of speech, so if they want to use their platform and their outlets to raise awareness for what they believe in, then I support that, and I support our ladies who choose to do so.\u201d\nTell us about the OMED-GTWBB\nRace and Reel Black Consciousness Series ?\nMatthews: \u201cMany thanks to Dr. Sybrina Atwaters for having these conversations with our team. I was introduced to her after seeing her on a panel. She had some phenomenal things to share about herself and OMED. So, I thought \u2018How can we incorporate some of her messaging into our team, which is extremely diverse?\u2019 I wanted to do due diligence in educating our ladies on a lot of social issues and give them a space to be honest. So, I reached out to Dr. Atwaters and she came up with\nRace and Reel\nwhich I just thought was so clever.\n\u201cI found it to be challenging and stimulating. Our conversations really impacted me personally, just looking at systemic racism. I\u2019d been educated on racism in the past and how it\u2019s still affecting Black communities today, but she challenged us to look at things right here on our campus, here in Atlanta, to see that racial inequality is right in our back yard.\u201d\nButts: \u201cOur athletic department was doing lots of things with our student-athletes around these topics, but we wanted to give our team more of an intimate setting, over food, to give them the freedom to be themselves and to be able to speak their minds. Rachel and I talked about some things and she mentioned OMED, which is how the ball got rolling.\n\u201cOur first session watching \"Dear White People\"\u00a0was very comfortable and uncomfortable at the same time. Our team is Black, Italian, Spanish, Finnish; we\u2019re from South Carolina, Michigan, Georgia \u2013 we are from all over the place. We have a very diverse team. And our coaching staff \u2013 we have members who are in their 30s, 40s, and 60s. So, everyone has experienced different things. After watching the show and talking about it, it was interesting to see how different team members interpreted it. It was great to be able to talk and to educate and it was an experience that was good for me. Afterwards, our athletes thanked Dr. Atwaters. I definitely want to continue the initiative in the fall. Obviously with Covid, we are limited on some things, but I do want to make sure that we continue these discussions.\u201d\nFletcher: This year and last year were the most I\u2019ve been involved with OMED since I\u2019ve been at Tech. My sophomore or junior year was the first time I had a Black professor. I think that opened my eyes to a lot of things, on top of the death of George Floyd. Our team really took an initiative to be more involved in addressing racial inequality. Like I said before, we have a diverse team, so some of them aren\u2019t fully aware of the history of race and the U.S.\n\u201cWe started doing the\nRace and Reel , the whole team \u2013 including coaches and staff. We would come together once a month on a Saturday with Dr. Atwaters over food and watch a Netflix show, take notes, and then come back for a discussion. I felt\nRace and Ree l was really impactful for us because it opened our eyes to a lot.\u201d\nButts: \u201cGeorge Floyd\u2019s death woke a lot of people up. This is why we wanted to partner with OMED. I always want to be a sounding board for our team, for our coaching staff, and point things out when something is said or done that a person may not realize is offensive. I want to point it out as a Black woman. I can\u2019t expect everyone to understand where I am coming from but I can educate them.\u201d\nWhat\u2019s next for you? What's next for the team?\nButts: \u201cWe\u2019re getting ready for things to be opened back up on campus and having athletes on campus for unofficial visits. We will go on the road in July to recruit and he haven\u2019t done that in over a year. Things haven\u2019t slowed down for us, but we will take a few weeks off before we ramp up at the end of May.\u201d\nMatthews: \u201cThere\u2019s an ongoing joke that there is no off-season in basketball! So right now, we are training a few hours each week; working on skills, honing skills, and rehabbing some athletes. Overall, the summer is the time to exhale, reevaluate and check in with ourselves. It\u2019s the primetime for me to get our athletes feeling better after a long, hard season.\u201d\nFletcher: \u201cAfter this next season is over, I\u2019d like to play professional basketball overseas and get my master\u2019s degree. If I can\u2019t do that, after I\u2019m done playing, my goal is to be a graduate assistant with a team and use my ACC post-graduate scholarship to complete a master\u2019s degree in criminology. I\u2019d like to work for the FBI.\u201d\nKierra, what does leadership mean to you?\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I understood what that meant until my junior year. I lead by example and do the right thing. If I see something that\u2019s unjust, I\u2019m going to speak out against it and that\u2019s what I\u2019ve been doing this whole season.\n\u201cOff the court as well, I\u2019m trying to leave a legacy outside of basketball. Eventually, the ball is going to stop bouncing, so I want to do things that people will remember me by and not just remember me as a basketball player, but as someone who tried to do good.\u201d\nCoach Butts, Kierra was awarded\nOMED\u2019s inaugural Women of Color Student-Athlete Impact Award at the 2021 Tower Awards . What makes her a leader?\n\u201cThat kid \u2013 she\u2019s unbelievable!\u00a0From the first time I stepped on campus two years ago, she and I immediately developed a coach-player bond and I\u2019ve seen her leadership grow. I\u2019ve seen her grow so much and this year was a huge year for her. For her to be able to develop her ideas and speak to our team about making a difference in this world is remarkable.\n\u201cEveryone on our team will run through a wall for her. That speaks to the person that she is. She is going to do wonders in this world.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nHOW SWEET IT IS!\nContact\nCourtney Hill\nCommunications Manager\nInstitute Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion\ncourtney.hill@gatech.edu\nEmail\ncourtney.hill@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
