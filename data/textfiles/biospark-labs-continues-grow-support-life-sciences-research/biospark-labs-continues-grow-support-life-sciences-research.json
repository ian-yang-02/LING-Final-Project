The buildout also includes one large, shared lab as well as two medium-sized and eight smaller private labs, along with additional workspaces and storage to attract and support emerging researchers and commercialization in the bioscience industry.\u202fAdditional cleanrooms are expected to go online in early 2024.\nDeveloped and managed by Georgia Advanced Technology Ventures Inc., an affiliate of the Georgia Institute of Technology, BioSpark Labs is helping to advance the life sciences ecosystem in Atlanta. Strategically located in the Science Square district adjacent to Georgia Tech\u2019s main campus in Atlanta, BioSpark Labs is already home to several bioscience startups, including Arnav Biotech, Exvade Bioscience, SynthBiome, and Karnelian X, an innovator in cancer treatment with significant expansion plans. Microelectronics startup Saras Micro Devices also occupies space in BioSpark Labs.\n\u201cThe BioSpark Labs space is truly tailored to support early-stage companies that need turnkey laboratory amenities for their operations,\u201d said Tony Zivalich, associate vice president for Real Estate Development. \u201cIn addition to its flex-use configuration, it is attractive lab space because of its location in the Science Square district and proximity to Georgia Tech \u2014 and to some of the brightest minds in life sciences research right here in Atlanta.\u201d\nAs a bonus, companies moving into Science Square \u2014 a designated federal opportunity zone \u2014 may benefit from this program, which is designed to provide tax benefits for long-term investors in the district.\nZivalich added that the Science Square district is just getting started.
