First, crush the sample. Georgia Tech / Christopher Moore\nNov 17, 2017\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nFor researchers pursuing the primordial history of oxygen in Earth\u2019s atmosphere, a new study might sour some \u201cEureka!\u201d moments. A contemporary tool used to trace oxygen by examining ancient rock strata\u00a0 can produce false positives, according to the study , and the wayward results can mask as exhilarating discoveries.\nCommon molecules called\u00a0 ligands \u00a0can bias the results of a popular chemical tracer called the chromium (Cr) isotope system, which is used to test sedimentary rock layers for clues about atmospheric oxygen levels during the epoch when the rock formed. Researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology have demonstrated in the lab that many ligands could have created a signal very similar to that of molecular oxygen.\n\u201cThere are some geographical locations and ancient situations where measurable signals could have been generated that had nothing to do with how much oxygen was around,\u201d said\u00a0 Chris Reinhard , one of the study\u2019s lead authors. Though the new research may impact how some recent findings are assessed, that doesn\u2019t mean the tool isn\u2019t useful overall.\nRock record tool\n\u201cWe\u2019re not trying to revolutionize the way the tool is viewed,\u201d said\u00a0 Yuanzhi Tang , who co-led the study. \u201cThis is about understanding its possible limitations to make discerning use of it in particular cases.\u201d\nTang and Reinhard, both assistant professors of biogeochemistry in Georgia Tech\u2019s School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences,\u00a0 published their team\u2019s results in a study on November 17, 2017, in the journal\u00a0 Nature Communications . Their work was funded by the NASA Astrobiology Institute, the NASA Exobiology program, and the Agouron Institute.\n\u201cOn a global level, the chromium isotope system is still a great indicator of atmospheric oxygen levels through the ages,\u201d Tang said. \u201cThe issue we exposed in the lab is more local with isolated samples, especially during eras when there wasn\u2019t much atmospheric oxygen.\u201d\nLeaping ligands\nWithout a dominant oxygen presence,\u00a0 ligands \u00a0likely made a great reactive substitute, as the researchers demonstrated in reactions with chromium. Like oxygen, ligands strongly attract electron pairs, which is what characterizes them as a chemical group.\nAnd like reactions with oxygen, reactions with ligands enable metals like chromium to move around more easily in the world. In this case, the researchers were interested in organic ligands, ligands that contain carbon.\nThey were more apt to match oxygen\u2019s mobility effect on chromium that made it end up as the signals in sedimentary rock that scientists, today, look for as a sign of\u00a0 ancient atmospheric oxygen .\nHere\u2019s roughly how the chromium isotope system works, followed by how organic ligands could make for false positives.\nChromium rollercoaster\nThe Earth is an enormous chemical laboratory performing reactions in conditions varying from arctic cold to volcanic heat, and from crushing ocean depths to no-pressure upper atmospheres. Winds and waves sweep around materials like turbulent conveyor belts, depositing some in sediments that later turn to stone.\nChromium\u2019s ticket for the rollercoaster ride into sedimentary rock was usually an oxidizing agent that made it more soluble and better able to float, and\u00a0 atmospheric oxygen was an ideal oxidizer . The chemical reaction,\u00a0 which can be found in the study \u00a0and involved manganese oxide handing off oxygens to chromium, would be a little like adding pontoons to chromium compounds.\nFor billions of years, Earth\u2019s atmosphere was nearly devoid of O 2 , but after oxygen began increasing, especially\u00a0 in the last 800 million years , \u00a0it became the domineering oxidizer. And characteristics of chromium deposits in ancient layers of rock became a great indicator of how much O 2 \u00a0was in the atmosphere.\nToday, researchers test deep rock layer samples for the relation between two chromium isotopes,\u00a0 52 Cr, by far the most common Cr isotope, and\u00a0 53 Cr, to get a read on oxygen presence\u00a0 across geological eras .\n\u201cYou powder the rock up; you dissolve it with acid, and then you measure the ratio of\u00a0 53 Cr to\u00a0 52 Cr in the material by using mass spectrometry,\u201d Reinhard said. \u201cIt\u2019s the ratio that matters, and it will be controlled by a range of complex processes, but generally speaking, elevated\u00a0 53 Cr in ocean sediment rock tends to indicate oxygen in the atmosphere.\u201d\nBy the way, these Cr isotopes are stable and don\u2019t undergo radioactive decay, thus the system does not work the way\u00a0 radiocarbon dating does, which relies on the decay of carbon 14.\nChemical imposter\nIn the lab, with a small assortment of organic ligands, Tang\u2019s group showed that reactions of chromium with ligands led to\u00a0 53 Cr/ 52 Cr signals that closely mimicked those stemming from oxygen-chromium reactions.\n\u201cLigands have the capability to mobilize chromium as well,\u201d Tang said. \u201cIn fact, ligands might be a significant factor in controlling chromium isotope signals in certain rock records.\u201d\nOrganic ligands were probably around long before Earth\u2019s atmosphere filled up with O 2 . And today, hundreds of millions of years after the reactions occurred, it\u2019s basically impossible to find out if oxygen or ligands were at work.\nLittle discrepancies\nIf not accounted for, ligand reactions can distort small details in rock records about atmospheric oxygen, and they may have already.\nLike paleontologists, who catalog ancient animal bones and other fossils, geologists keep\u00a0 massive, digitized archives of rock that they study to learn more about Earth\u2019s ancient geological history . Scientists began testing physical samples of them with the Cr isotope system around 2009 and adding the results to the records.\n\u201cSince then, some discrepancies have turned up,\u201d Reinhard said. \u201cAncient soil layers were showing evidence of oxygen when it probably shouldn\u2019t have been there. Other samples from the same period weren\u2019t showing that signal.\u201d\nBut some researchers confronted with odd Cr signals have thought they had perhaps stumbled upon a radical find, and they developed explanations for how O 2 \u00a0may have been surprisingly bountiful on the lonesome spot where a particular rock layer formed, while molecular oxygen was scant on the rest of the globe. Others puzzled that atmospheric O 2 \u00a0levels may have risen much earlier than overwhelmingly broad evidence has indicated.\n\u201cA lot of that could be chalked up to other chemical processes and not to interactions with oxygen,\u201d Reinhard said.\nThe study may serve as a cautionary tale about how to view Cr isotope data, especially when they leap off the page.\nAlso READ: Before Animals, Evolution\nWaited\nEons to Inhale\nThe study was co-authored by Emily Saad from Georgia Tech, and Noah Planavsky and Xiangli Wang of Yale University.
