It has been for thousands of years. The continent contains more than 50% of the total area on Earth that is burning, on average, and there is no sign of it stopping \u2014 indeed, the migrating, hemisphere-hopping African wildfire season is steadily increasing.\nThe fire is essentially feeding itself in a kind of feedback loop as aerosols, induced by the perpetual conflagration, interact with the climate. It\u2019s a process that plays a critical role in the regulation of African ecosystems, reinforcing wildfires and paving the way for elevated fire seasons in subsequent years.\nAerosols are tiny particles that have a large impact on the Earth\u2019s climate. They comprise a wide range of materials. Besides the human-induced air pollution that we can see (that brown smog is the interaction of light with aerosols), there are a lot of natural aerosols: salty sea spray, mineral dust, volcanic ash, and wildfire smoke.\nSuspended in the atmosphere, the role of aerosols in our climate is complex. But a new study by Georgia Tech researchers demonstrates the role they play in the African wildfire life cycle. The research, published in the journal\niScience , could have significant implications for understanding the impacts of fires and climate change in Africa and other regions of the planet prone to wildfire.\n\u201cWe used to think that aerosols had a short-term, localized climate impact and can be effectively removed by precipitation within a week. But in this study, we\u2019re showing that isn\u2019t necessarily correct,\u201d said\nYuhang Wang , professor in the\nSchool of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences\nand corresponding author of\n\u201cPositive Feedback to Regional Climate Enhances African Wildfires.\u201d\nThe Wang lab\nworks at solving mysteries of atmospheric pollution, and the team is onto something with its latest research, revealing new clues in its study of wildfires in Africa, where the unique alternation between dry and wet seasons along the equator extends the lifespan of aerosols.\n\u201cBasically, with the combination of wildfires and fire-induced aerosols, the impact of aerosols can be longer term, extending over seasons,\u201d said Wang, whose team invented the tool it needed to complete its investigation.\nBuilding a Better Model\nSeveral years ago, Wang\u2019s lab developed the\nRegion-Specific Ecosystem Feedback Fire (RESFire) Model\nto augment the existing, publicly accessible\nCommunity Earth System Model (CESM) . Managed by the National Center for Atmospheric Research, CESM is an open-source global climate model that provides computer simulations of the Earth\u2019s climate system.\nRESFire improves CESM\u2019s fire simulation capability, helping researchers develop a better grasp of complex fire-climate-ecosystem interactions, \u201cwhich are still not very well understood,\u201d said Wang, whose team used its CESM-RESFire model to study aerosol feedback in Africa for the latest research.\n\u201cWe found that the extension of the aerosols\u2019 lifespan in Africa occurs through a positive feedback mechanism,\u201d said Wang.\nAerosols can essentially give clouds a bad case of constipation, absorbing vapor from the atmosphere and reducing the growth of large cloud droplets, making it difficult for clouds to make large droplets.\n\u201cFire aerosols are transported from burning or dry regions to wet regions,\u201d Wang explained. \u201cThat leads to reduced precipitation and drying of fuel loads.\u201d\nThe Feedback Mechanism\nIdentifying the fire-aerosol positive feedback mechanism in Africa sheds light on wildfire-related climate feedback globally. Other studies have shown that in some coastal areas, such as the western United States, fire smoke alters local fire weather, resulting in positive feedback. These coastal regions have distinct fire seasons, and the escalation caused by aerosol feedback doesn\u2019t persist into the next fire season.\nAfrica is different. With its shifting fire regions and prevailing winds, the positive feedback affects the current season and amplifies burning in the subsequent season. And fire weather season has increased by up to 40% in Africa over the past four decades, which means there may be shifts in distribution and variability of burned areas.\n\u201cThe good news is that this mechanism is self-sustaining. It even has some resilience built in,\u201d Wang said. \u201cThe question is what happens in the presence of persistent global climate change. What we know is, the mechanism underlying this natural system of wildfires depends on the current state of the atmosphere.\u201d\nThe positive feedback mechanism implies that a warmer, drier climate will likely lead to more persistent burning in Africa in the future, the researchers write, concluding, \u201cThe syste matic fire-climate feedback may also be present in other fire-prone tropical regions and has significant ramifications for understanding the impacts of fires and climate change on humans and plant life.\u201d\nCitation:\nAoxing Zhang, Yuhang Wang, Yufei, Zou.\n\u201cPositive feedback to regional climate enhances African wildfires.\u201d\niScience.\nFunding:\nThis work was supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF) (grant 1743401).\nAdditional Media\nContact\nJerry Grillo\nEmail\njerry.grillo@ibb.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
