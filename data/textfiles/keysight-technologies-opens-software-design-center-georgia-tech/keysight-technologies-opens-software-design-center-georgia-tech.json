The company has hired more than two dozen Tech students to work at the design center. (Photo credit: P\u00e9ralte C. Paul)\nOct 17, 2016\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nKeysight Technologies, a leading provider of electronic design and test software, equipment, and services, officially opened the doors to its new Software Design Center in Technology Square Oct. 13.\nWith the official opening of the Fortune 1000 firm\u2019s Software Design Center, the company becomes the 15 th\nmajor corporation to make a home at or near Tech Square\u00a0to tap into the Institute's research, student talent, and innovation ecosystem.\n\u201cWe selected Georgia Tech and Midtown Atlanta based on several things, including the quality of students coming from Tech\u2019s School of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) and School of Computer Science,\u201d said Jay Alexander, Keysight\u2019s chief technology officer.\nOther critical factors were the quality of research and \u00a0longstanding partnerships the company has with researchers in those schools, along with a supportive business climate in Georgia and Atlanta\u2019s quality-of-life attributes, he said. In 2014, Keysight made a $120 million in-kind donation of its software to Georgia Tech, which the Institute is deploying to help students become industry-ready engineers by using the same instruments and software used by customers in government and industry.\n\u201cAll of those things came together for us, making it \u00a0an obvious choice,\u201d said Alexander. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t be happier with our decision.\u201d\nThe Santa Rosa, Calif.-based company\u2019s $13.9 million investment in Georgia is expected to create more than 200 software engineering jobs.\n\u201cTech Square has been a magnet for a number of promising startups, but we\u2019re excited that it also has attracted companies with an impressive legacy like Keysight,\u201d Georgia Tech President G.P. \u201cBud\u201d Peterson said. \u201cFor Georgia Tech, it\u2019s a point of pride and a significant achievement that a company of this caliber believes we can add value to its operations. It is the ideal type of industry leader we seek for Tech Square and Georgia Tech.\u201d\nCompanies such as Keysight also are ideal for Institute alumni and students such as Jonathan Jones, who graduated from Tech in 2016 with a master\u2019s degree in electrical and computer engineering from ECE. He obtained his bachelor\u2019s degree in computer engineering in 2015.\nAt Keysight, he will be part of a team of engineers who are building a new Keysight-wide software platform for rapid application development.\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard people compare it to being a heavily funded startup, and that\u2019s how I like to think about being here in Tech Square,\u201d said Jones, a 23-year-old Macon native. \u201cIt was very attractive to be with the company as it\u2019s starting something new; I like new challenges and tackling something new every day, so when I saw this opportunity, I knew I had to grab it.\u201d\nDeepika Narayanan, who is pursuing her master\u2019s degree in electrical and computer engineering at ECE, echoed Jones\u2019 sentiments.\n\u201cThe fact this is opening in Atlanta and it\u2019s a software design center attracted me to apply for the position, and I\u2019m really excited,\u201d said Narayanan, who expects to graduate in December. The 23-year-old will be working on coding and software development, and she said she hopes to go into data specialization analytics and machine learning.\nUday Ravuri, who also expects to obtain his master\u2019s in electrical and computer engineering at ECE in December, said Keysight\u2019s offerings and culture made it an ideal choice for him.\n\u201cI basically looked for three things \u2014 a cultural fit, technical fit, and career growth,\u201d said Raburi, who will be working as a software engineer for the company. \u201cAnd from the feedback I received from the employees, all three of those important factors seemed to be perfect in this company, and that\u2019s why I went for it.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nEmail\nperalte.paul@comm.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
