Four biomedical engineering students developed\nCauteryGuard , a safer medical device used to remove unwanted tissue and to stop bleeding.\nBoth InVenture competitions leverage the maker culture flourishing at college campuses across the country. The contests foster entrepreneurial confidence and encourage students to push their ideas further.\n\u201cThe InVenture Prize at Georgia Tech continues to give our students exciting opportunities to flex their creative and entrepreneurial muscles through academic competition,\u201d said Rafael L. Bras, Georgia Tech\u2019s provost and executive vice president for Academic Affairs and the K. Harrison Brown Family Chair. \u201cThe success and energy around the competition were the motivators for the ACC provosts to extend the format to the entire conference and increase the collaborative academic initiatives among the 15 schools. We look forward to hosting the ACC InVenture Prize again this year.\u201d\nThe ACC InVenture Prize is sponsored by the ACC Academic Consortium, which supports academic initiatives among member universities.\nDuring the two-day program, students will tour Atlanta incubators and accelerators and meet with entrepreneurs and venture capitalists.\nWhile\n15 teams\nenter the competition, only five will advance to the finale taking place Friday at 8pm in the Georgia Tech Ferst Center for the Arts.\nThe finale will be televised on Georgia Public Broadcasting and other PBS affiliates around the country. The finale can be\nwatched online here .\nTeams will be judged in four areas: entrepreneurship, business model, quality of the idea, and the probability of becoming a successful business.\nFirst place wins $15,000, sponsored by United Technologies Research Center. The second-place team earns $10,000. A $5,000 People\u2019s Choice Award goes to the fans\u2019 favorite, which will be determined by online and text voting during the televised final round.\nCauteryGuard enters the ACC InVenture Prize competition with $25,000 in winnings from the Institute\u2019s competition. The team won first place and was named fans\u2019 favorite.\nThe team redesigned an electrocautery device by adding a retractable tip. This change prevents the risk of burns many doctors and patients face from the device\u2019s exposed tip. It also eliminates the chance of fires in operating rooms because an exposed tip could come into contact with flammable materials.\nThe team members are: Jack Corelli, Hunter Hatcher, Devin Li and Dev Mandavia.\n\u201cIt\u2019s incredible to represent Georgia Tech,\u201d Mandavia said. \u201cWe are thankful for all the support we\u2019ve received over the past year and a half of working on the device.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nACC InVenture Prize\nGeorgia Tech InVenture Prize\nContact\nLaura Diamond\nMedia Relations\n404-894-6016\n@LauraRDiamond\nEmail\nlaura.diamond@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
