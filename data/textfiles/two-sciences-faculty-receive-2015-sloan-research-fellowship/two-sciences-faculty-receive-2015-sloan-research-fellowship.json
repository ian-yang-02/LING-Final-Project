Danielle Dixson , an assistant professor in the School of Biology, investigates the influence sensory cues have on the behavior of coral reef organisms. Her recent work, featured on the cover of the journal\nScience , found that\ncoral larvae and juvenile fishes can smell the difference\nbetween a reef that is unhealthy and one that is a suitable home. She has also published recent work showing that acidic oceans make sharks less interested in their food. Dixson conducts research missions around the globe to study coral reef ecology, and the Sloan Research Fellowship will allow her to continue conducting fieldwork vital to her research. \u201cI am very honored and excited to have been selected as a Sloan Fellow,\u201d Dixson said. \u201cThese funds will allow my lab to conduct research in Belize investigating how larval fishes and corals use chemical cues in settlement site selection and predator evasion.\u201d Chris Reinhard , an assistant professor in the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences, seeks to understand the ways in which biological metabolism and the chemistry of Earth's oceans and atmosphere are coupled and shape one another. He is currently working with the\nNASA Astrobiology Institute , using the lessons learned from reconstructing the history of ocean-atmosphere chemistry to inform the search for life within and beyond our solar system. \u201cThe work I do thrives on collaboration; it is typically interdisciplinary and broad in scope,\u201d Reinhard said. \u201cI've been exceptionally fortunate to have the chance to work with and learn from some incredible people in my young career.\u201d Awarded in eight scientific and technical fields \u2014 chemistry, computer science, economics, mathematics, computational and evolutionary molecular biology, neuroscience, ocean sciences, and physics \u2014 candidates are nominated by fellow scientists. An independent panel of senior scholars selects the winning fellows.\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nDixson lab\nChris Reinhard Research Lab\nContact\nJason Maderer Institute Communications 404-385-2966\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
