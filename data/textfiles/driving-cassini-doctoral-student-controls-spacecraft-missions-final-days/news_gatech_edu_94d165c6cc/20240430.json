(Image credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech)\nSep 12, 2017\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nWhen the\nCassini spacecraft\nplunges into Saturn on September 15 to end a nearly two-decade mission, Georgia Tech student Michael Staab will have a front row seat. It\u2019s almost literally the driver\u2019s seat.\nStaab is working at\nNASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory\n(JPL) in California while pursuing his\naerospace engineering\ndoctoral degree in the distance learning program. He\u2019s a Cassini Spacecraft Flight Controller, which means he\u2019s one of only three people authorized to tell the machine what to do and where to go as it orbits Saturn.\nThe job is almost finished. Just before 8 a.m. (Atlanta time) on Friday, Staab will hear Cassini\u2019s signal for the final time before it dives into the planet\u2019s atmosphere, becoming a part of Saturn.\nStaab has controlled the bus-sized spacecraft since January of 2016, when he was given the keys to the NASA\u2019s flagship Saturn mission. He\u2019s logged more than 1,200 hours at the\nCassini flight console . His commands have directed the spacecraft around Saturn 62 times, hurled it through the planet\u2019s rings and soared Cassini around Saturn\u2019s moons. Although Cassini will technically dive into the planet because of a gravitational nudge by Saturn\u2019s moon Titan, Staab was the one who sent the background sequence code that will send it on its fateful plunge. He uploaded the command a few weeks ago.\nStaab earned his master\u2019s degree in aerospace engineering in 2015. He came to campus earlier this month to talk to students about the mission and what NASA is calling \u201c The Grand Finale .\u201d\nWe asked him a few questions about his job, starting with the obvious:\nHow did you get such a cool gig?\nI fell into this job from a combination of luck and having the right background. I actually had no intention of applying to JPL when I stopped by JPL\u2019s booth at Georgia Tech\u2019s fall career fair. I chatted with one of their reps and, after some persuasion, was convinced to leave a copy of my resume. I received an offer to be a Cassini flight controller a few weeks later. It was the right job and one that I always wanted.\nPrior to attending Georgia Tech, I was a flight test engineering intern at NASA\u2019s Armstrong Flight Research Center at Edwards Air Force Base in California and, later, a test requirements and analysis engineer for Boeing in St. Louis. I had a lot of control room and operations experience, which is exactly what JPL was looking for.\nThe duty of a flight controller at JPL is fairly straight-forward; we possess absolute command and control authority of the spacecraft when tracking it through the Deep-Space Network. We are the only people in the world who can tell the spacecraft what to do. We\u2019re the first to respond to anomalies with either the ground or flight system, and we have the authority to make any real-time decisions to protect the flight system without prior approval. It\u2019s an immense responsibility that only very few people in the world ever get to do. I am still greatly humbled to be given such responsibility by the Cassini flight team so early in my career.\nWhy are you destroying the spacecraft and ending the mission?\nThe mission is ending for two reasons. The first, and most obvious, is that the spacecraft is out of fuel. We primarily use its moon, Titan, to navigate around Saturn \u2013 stealing more than 100 km/s of delta-v from gravitational assists. But we need fuel to maneuver the spacecraft to very precise locations near Titan. Without it, we can\u2019t navigate the planet. Essentially, we\u2019d be flying blind.\nThe second, and more important reason, is because we need to protect Titan and Enceladus from the potential organisms on Cassini. The spacecraft has shown both moons to be suitable for supporting life.\nTitan\nis the most Earth-like world we\u2019ve discovered in the solar system, with methane clouds and methane-filled surface lakes. Cassini has even detected a global, subsurface ocean beneath Titan\u2019s thick, icy surface.\nEnceladus\nis perhaps an even more exciting world. It also has a global, subsurface ocean underneath its icy crust. Unlike Titan, though, Enceladus is shooting samples of its ocean into space from a set of geysers at its south pole. Scientists have dubbed them \u201ccold faithful.\u201d \u00a0Enceladus gave Cassini free samples of its oceans during flybys through its plumes. The spacecraft detected the presence of carbon dioxide, simple organic compounds and molecular hydrogen. Not only do we have organic chemistry taking place in Enceladus\u2019 ocean, but we also have direct evidence of hydrothermal vents on Enceladus\u2019 ocean floor. All the basic ingredients for life \u2013 water, organic chemistry and an energy source \u2013 exist on the moon. Does Enceladus have life in its ocean? We don\u2019t know yet, but it has shown the strongest evidence yet for the possibility of life outside of Earth.\nWe want to go back to Enceladus with better instruments to possibly detect the presence of biological signatures. But to do so, we have to preserve the integrity of the moon and not contaminate it with Earth \u201cbugs,\u201d which might have hitched a ride aboard Cassini. Are you sad?\nYes and no. I will, more than anything, miss working with the Cassini flight team. They\u2019ve become my family at JPL. A part of me is also dealing with the fact that I will no longer get to work in the mission control center. I\u2019ll miss not being able to sit in the chair anymore.\nHowever, Cassini is a victim of her own success. Her discoveries at Titan and Enceladus sealed her fate. We have to dispose of the spacecraft to guarantee it will never impact those biologically interesting moons. And, in the end, Cassini is just a robot. I\u2019m a heartless engineer, but it\u2019s hard to feel sad about the \u201cdeath\u201d of a machine. We like to anthropomorphize our spacecraft at JPL as having personalities and feelings. I don\u2019t. It will be hard on the morning of the 15th to say goodbye to this mission. But I know this isn\u2019t the end of our exploration of the Saturn system. Cassini has ensured we will return. The only question is when.\nWhat\u2019s next for you after Cassini is gone?\nI\u2019m moving over to Mars as a spacecraft systems engineer (SSE) and flight director for the\nMars Exploration Rover Opportunity . In combination with the responsibilities of a flight director, SSEs are a jack of all trades \u2013 from tactical downlink lead, to uplink verification lead, to testbed engineers. These versatile skills are necessary for a mission operating well beyond its original design life. Opportunity was slated for a 90-sol mission (a \"sol\" is a day on Mars). It\u2019s been on the surface for 4,800 and counting.\nWhat is your advice for your fellow Yellow Jackets interested in aerospace and/or planetary science?\nBe inquisitive, innovative and, most importantly, bold. JPL\u2019s motto is \u201cDare Mighty Things.\u201d That really encompasses the spirit of the people and the type of missions the lab designs, builds and operates.\nThere really is no other place on Earth where you can build and operate spacecraft that drive on Mars, orbit Saturn and even travel to interstellar space. These missions require the lab to take bold risks and come up with, to an outsider, crazy ideas. But, as co-worker Adam Steltzner put it, it\u2019s the right kind of crazy.\nIf exploring the solar system and looking for life beyond Earth is something that excites you, JPL is the place for you.\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nJPL's Space Ace\nVideo: Michael Sends Commands to Cassini\nContact\nJason Maderer\nNational Media Relations\nmaderer@gatech.edu\n404-660-2926\nEmail\nmaderer@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
