It was 8am and they all sipped coffee.\nTyler Quill joked that his dentist would kill him for drinking coffee, knowing how the beverage\u2019s acidity contributes to tooth and enamel erosion.\n\u201cThen we started talking about why that happens and how great it would be if we could find a way to fix the problem,\u201d said Quill, who is from Grayson, Ga.\nTogether the team designed pHAM, a filter to reduce coffee\u2019s acidity. They incorporated a mineral blend into the structure of the filter paper, which reduces the acidity of the brewed coffee without negatively affecting the taste.\nThe creation is one of six competing for Georgia Tech\u2019s annual invention competition, the\nInVenture Prize . The 2018 winner will be picked March 14.\nThe filter wasn\u2019t the team\u2019s original idea. First, they designed a thermos that would change the pH of coffee once it was poured. But they realized there was an easier method that could be used earlier in the process.\n\u201cCoffee is brewed with a filter so we realized why not change the pH level during the process of making the coffee,\u201d said Birmingham native Aaron Stansell. \u201cWe\u2019re the basic solution to your acidity problem.\u201d\nThe challenge then became how to put the acidity-reducing mineral blend into the filter paper. Fortunately, team member Michele Lauto, who is from Santa Monica, worked at the Institute of Paper and Science Technology (now called the\nRenewable Bioproducts Institute ) during freshman year and had ideas about adding another layer to the filter.\nThe pHAM filter fits in standard coffee makers and the grounds brew in a normal manner. The team ran tests proving their mineral blend neutralizes the acidity. It doesn\u2019t change the taste, although some people say the coffee tastes smoother and more rounded, said Lucas Votaw, from Herndon, Va.\nThe team hopes to get pHAM into coffee shops and restaurants around the country.\nInVenture won\u2019t be the last time pHAM is on display. It is also their project for the spring\nCapstone Design Expo .\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nGeorgia Tech InVenture Prize\nContact\nLaura Diamond\nMedia Relations\u00a0 laura.diamond@gatech.edu\n404-660-2927\nEmail\nlaura.diamond@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
