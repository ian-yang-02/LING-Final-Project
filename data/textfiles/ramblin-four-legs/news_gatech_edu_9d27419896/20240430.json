Established this fall, the group promotes awareness of service dogs and their training. Many members volunteer as puppy raisers or puppy sitters for\nSoutheastern Guide Dogs , a nonprofit that provides guide dogs to people with visual impairments and service dogs to veterans at no cost.\nPuppy raisers provide care, training, and socialization to a Southeastern Guide Dogs puppy for just over a year, until the puppy is ready for advanced training. Students volunteering as puppy sitters maintain the puppy's training when the raiser is not available. Guide dogs are matched with people from all walks of life, and Tech's student volunteers provide many experiences that help build a solid foundation for future guide dogs.\nTo date, club members have worked with five puppies on campus. The first, Indy, was raised by Anna Hart, fourth-year computer science student and president of Ramblin\u2019 Puppy Raisers. Indy graduated earlier this year as a working guide dog. \u201cI learned the love, patience, dedication, and community it takes to raise a puppy,\u201d Hart said. \u201cIndy took a piece of my heart with him when it was time to give him back, but it was worth it to see him go on to be an incredible, loving, and loyal guide dog and to see how much his handler loves him.\u201d\nHart is currently raising Buzz, a 9-month-old female yellow lab. The Atlanta chapter of Southeastern Guide Dogs raised money to sponsor the pup, and named her in honor of the Ramblin\u2019 Puppy Raisers. \u201cShe's learned to walk on a loose leash past all the bikes, scooters, and squirrels on campus,\u201d Hart said, \u201cas well as how to ride elevators and buses\u201d \u2014 and all of these experiences are helping her learn.\nGoodie was raised by students Sofi Soto and Taylor Van Horn and is now in advanced training at the Southeastern Guide Dogs campus in Palmetto, Florida. The other two puppies in training at Tech are a 6-month-old named Pomp, being raised by Alex Hool and Vania Deal, and a 5-month-old named Peyton, whose puppy raisers are Mazie Anderson and Angela Gomez.\nTech\u2019s campus provides numerous opportunities for learning, from riding campus buses and walking through Tech Square to attending class. The puppies even get to venture off campus. Hart recalled Indy\u2019s \u201cfavorite adventure\u201d at the Georgia Aquarium, where he \u201cstayed focused around all of the people and enjoyed calmly watching the fish, whales, and sharks.\u201d\nGoodie experienced tailgates on Yellow Jacket Alley, attended Ramblin\u2019 On, and watched the Homecoming parade. He did so well relaxing in his Scheller College classes that his professor didn\u2019t notice him until he got up to leave a lecture. He even walked with both of his raisers across the stage during Spring 2022 Commencement.\nThere is also a working guide dog, Brizzy, whose handler, Nola Timmins, is in the club. Brizzy graduated from Southeastern Guide Dogs in February 2020 and loves to keep up her training by attending meetings with the current puppies.\n\u201cI want to allow other students to experience the joy and community in raising a puppy,\u201d Hart said, \u201cand to fill the need for volunteers to provide experiences and foundational training for future guide and service dogs.\u201d\nStudents interested in joining the club can\ncontact Hart .
