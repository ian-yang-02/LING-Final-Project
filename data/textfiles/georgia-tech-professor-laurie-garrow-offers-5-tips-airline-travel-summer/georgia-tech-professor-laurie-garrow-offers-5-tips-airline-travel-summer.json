Check your airport\u2019s parking lot availability before deciding on transportation.\nRemember rideshare rates. \u00a0With the high cost of fuel and a shortage of Uber and Lyft drivers, be sure to check those rates and plan ahead.\nPrepare to be patient \u2014 lines will be long. \u00a0The airline industry is seeing a huge surge in demand, but many airports are short-staffed. Expect to wait longer at security checkpoints, ticketing counters, and baggage claim.\nCovid-19 changed travel. \u00a0Your travel experience will not be the same as pre-pandemic travel. Delays, staffing shortages, price increases, and new policies mean that travelers should do their best to be patient and plan ahead.\nProfessor Laurie Garrow is co-director of the\u00a0 Center for Urban and Regional Air Mobility \u00a0at Georgia Tech. She is an expert in aviation, travel behavior, and data analytics. Laurie offers insight into travel demand, airline operations, and tips for consumer travel planning. She was featured in a\u00a0 CNN Travel article , published on April 27, 2022, taking a look at the surprising reasons Atlanta's airport is the world's busiest.\nAn excerpt:\nHaving Delta Air Lines' world headquarters in Atlanta is a benefit, too.\n\"I do view the innovations of Delta as a local carrier in the area throughout the years to have propelled or maintained Atlanta as the No. 1 airport,\" Garrow said.\n\"Delta in 1955 was the carrier that created the hub and spoke network. So they were the innovators of that concept \u2014 using the spokes to bring all those passengers into a hub, allowing them to transfer\" on to other destinations.\nGrowth helped, too. Through mergers, Delta Air Lines could expand internationally.\n\"They have a lot of joint venture relationships with international carriers that help them build up an international network and again bring passengers into Atlanta as the gateway for other travel into the U.S., or vice versa. Take the people from multiple locations in the U.S., filter them through Atlanta to then go internationally.\"\nAdditional Images\nContact\nAyana Isles\nMedia Relations\nInstitute Communications\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
