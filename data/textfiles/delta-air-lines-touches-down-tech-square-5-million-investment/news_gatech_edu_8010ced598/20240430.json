Delta Air Lines will\ninvest $2 million to build the facilit y, in which it plans to enhance operations and improve customer experience by tapping into the knowledge at Georgia Tech. \u201cDelta Air Lines and Georgia Tech have a rich heritage of working together in everything from research to hiring our co-ops and graduates. We are delighted that Delta\u2019s collaborative research center will provide even greater opportunities for Georgia Tech students, faculty, and staff to work with this outstanding global airline,\u201d said Georgia Tech President G.P. \u201cBud\u201d Peterson. Delta has pioneered many firsts in the airline industry including the use of a hub and spoke system in 1955, being the first U.S. airline with motion graphic maps in the cabin showing the aircraft\u2019s position and route in 1992, and launching the first mobile baggage tracking app in 2011. The innovation center at Georgia Tech will also be a first for any college in the United States. \u201cThis facility is the first of its kind for the domestic aviation industry. Tapping into the bright minds at Georgia Tech is an opportunity to gain new perspectives and approaches across Delta for changes that will advance our business now and for years to come,\u201d said Gil West, executive vice president and chief operating officer for Delta. \u201cAt Delta we are continuously seeking to improve and elevate our operations and the customer experience.\u201d Inside the space, Georgia Tech students will have the opportunity to improve Delta\u2019s day-to-day business operations as well as customer experience. The new research center will be completed by 2016 in the Centergy Building. The building is already home to other industry innovation centers for The Home Depot, Coca-Cola Enterprises, Panasonic, and AT&T. Delta also plans to invest $3 million to the Georgia Tech Foundation to fund the Georgia Tech Advanced Manufacturing Pilot Facility (AMPF). The AMPF establishes Georgia Tech as a national leader in advanced manufacturing with a collaboration among the Schools of Mechanical Engineering, Aerospace Engineering, Industrial and Systems Engineering, Materials Science and Engineering, and Interactive Computing. \u201cWe are grateful to The Delta Air Lines Foundation for their generous commitment that will facilitate breakthrough research in advanced manufacturing,\u201d President Peterson said.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nLisa Grovenstein Institute Communications 404.894.8835\nEmail\nlisa.grovenstein@comm.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
