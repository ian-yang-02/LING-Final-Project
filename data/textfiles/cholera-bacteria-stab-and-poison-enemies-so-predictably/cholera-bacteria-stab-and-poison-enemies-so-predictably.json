The equations were originally used to describe phase separate in materials, namely mixed metals (Model A equations).\u00a0Credit: Georgia Tech / Rob Felt\nFeb 06, 2017\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nThe enemies were thrown together, so the killing began.\nBrandishing harpoon-like appendages covered in poison, two armies of cholera bacteria stabbed each other, rupturing victims like water balloons. Scientists at the Georgia Institute of Technology tracked the battle over sustenance and turf mathematically to gain insights that could, someday, lead to new, targeted therapies to fight infections.\nBut dueling bacteria would not be the infectors in that scenario; they\u2019d be the remedy.\nConceivably, specially engineered assassin bacteria friendly to humans could kill harmful bacteria while sparing hordes of microbes that keep people healthy. By contrast, the antibiotics we use today vanquish harmful and helpful bacteria alike.\n\u201cIf you could target harmful bacteria in the human gut, you could use engineered bacteria as a living antibiotic,\u201d said Brian Hammer, an\nassociate professor at Georgia Tech\u2019s School of Biological Sciences . He cautioned, \u201cWe\u2019re not anywhere near that right now.\u201d\nCalculating bacteria\nBut to harness bacteria for use in medicine or industry, or just to better understand how they thrive and spread, it\u2019s helpful to determine the consistency of their actions over time. That\u2019s where the math comes in.\nGeorgia Tech researchers applied to the bacteria existing physics equations developed to precisely describe the interactions of atoms and molecules. They found that those calculations could also precisely predict that two cholera armies would separate from each other into phases, like oil and water, when they met on the battlefield.\n\u201cThe models predicted pretty much exactly when the phase separation would occur, and then we observed it happening just like the math said it would,\u201d Hammer said. The predictive models were based what's called a \u201cModel A\u201d equation.\n\"Empirically, it's been used to describe metals that undergo phase separation,\u201d Hammer said. \u201cThe type of curve we observed describing our results had never been used to describe living systems before.\u201d\nHammer and Georgia Tech biologists\nWill Ratcliff, an assistant professor , and\nSamuel Brown, an associate professor , teamed up with Peter Yunker, an\nassistant professor in Georgia Tech\u2019s School of Physics\nfor the research. They published their results in\nthe journal Nature Communications\non Monday, February 6, 2017.\nFirst authors were Hammer\u2019s former graduate student\nbiologist Eryn Bernardy , and Brown\u2019s former postdoctoral assistant\nLuke McNally . Their research was funded by the National Science Foundation, the NASA Exobiology program, the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, the Wellcome Trust and the Human Frontier Science Program.\nRotting crab shells\nCholera bacteria are commonly found in water attached with other microbes to the shells of crabs and tiny krill, and\npeople who drink that water can die\nwithin hours due to the severe vomiting and diarrhea the germs cause. The impetus for doing math on dueling cholera came from how they wage turf war on crab shells, which contain a material called chitin that switches on the harpoon function in\nVibrio cholerae . No chitin, no stabbing.\n\u201cI was studying this amazing biological system,\u201d Hammer said, \u201cand I was looking for a way to visualize it.\u201d Ratcliff and Yunker had been applying microscopy and mathematics to study the dynamics of yeast evolution and suggested Hammer give the method a try.\nBut before getting to the math itself, it\u2019s important to understand a few things about\nVibrio cholerae . First of all, most microbiologists think cholera bacteria use the harpoons to kill competing bacteria and not to destroy human cells.\nThe poisonous weapon is called a Type VI secretion system (T6SS), and is common. \u201cThis harpoon system is in about one quarter of Gram-negative bacteria,\u201d Hammer said. \u201cSo, this bacterial dueling is going on all around you.\u201d\nGram-negative bacteria have thinner walls, which can be punctured more easily. Gram-positive bacteria have thicker walls less susceptible to the harpoons, and human cells may be even more difficult to penetrate.\nAnd the stabbing mechanism is not limited to pathogens like cholera. Many harmless bacteria use it, too. But more is known about the mechanism in pathogens, because harmful bacteria are more often the focus of scientific study than harmless bacteria, Hammer said.\nArmed and generous\nHarpooning cholera stab randomly at all bacteria they come into contact with, including each other, but\nVibrio cholerae\nof the same strain are immune to each other\u2019s stabs. So, they kill their enemies but not their own kind.\nThe killing also appears to go hand in hand with cooperative social behavior. The researchers found that bacteria that are good at killing together are also good at sharing with each other and building a community.\nIt starts with creating a common pool of food. \u201cBacteria do a lot of their digestion outside their cells,\u201d Hammer said. But having all that food lying around is risky.\n\u201cYou need a strategy for ensuring that all the effort of chewing up and digesting food benefits you and your relatives, and not someone else who comes and plunders it.\u201d When a strain of bacteria kills invaders, it preserves the fruits of its labor, and multiplies, passing on its genes.\nBrown\u2019s postdoctoral researcher Luke McNally examined the genomes of many types of bacteria (in addition to cholera) that use poison harpoons. Some strains had six or seven harpoons, and some harpoons had multiple poisons. And there appeared to be a correlation between weapons and cooperation.\n\u201cWe found that the more weaponry a bacteria strain had in its genome, the more it looked like it was apt to share,\u201d Hammer said.\nPurple, red, blue\nUnder the microscope, the battling bacteria strains actually did look a little like beads of oil and water separating out on a flat surface. They were stained two different colors like red and blue, so they could be told apart.\n\u201cWe start with two strains well mixed,\u201d Hammer said. \u201cWe jokingly call this the salad dressing model, because you shake oil and water, and they\u2019re well mixed, and you let it sit, and they phase separate.\u201d\nWhen they\u2019re well mixed, the two strains of cholera appear as one purple mass, but as they kill each other and conquer separate territories, they divide into red blotches and blue blotches.\nThere are significant differences between how chemical and living systems operate. For example, the bacteria also reproduce and multiply; molecules don\u2019t. But the basic math that worked for materials\u00a0also worked for the bacteria.\nFuture applications?\n\u201cIn your gut, a lot of useful bacteria are Gram-positive,\u201d Hammer said. \u201cBut there might be a small number of Gram-negative bacteria messing up your gut community, and perhaps engineered bacteria with spears could get rid of just those Gram-negative.\u201d\nAlso, an external material like chitin, which switches the harpoon function on in cholera bacteria, could be given along with assassin bacteria to trigger their weaponry, and then deactivate it when the chitin is gone.\nArben\nKalziqi\nand Jennifer Pentz, and Jacob Thomas all of Georgia Tech, also co-authored the research paper.
