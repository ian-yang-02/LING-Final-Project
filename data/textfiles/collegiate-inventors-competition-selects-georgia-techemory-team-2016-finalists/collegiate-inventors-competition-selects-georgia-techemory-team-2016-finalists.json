Aaron Blanchard and Kevin Yehl are students in the Wallace H. Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering at Georgia Tech and Emory University and in Emory\u2019s Laney Graduate School. Their advisor, Khalid Salaita, Ph.D., is associate professor of chemistry in Emory College. The team is one of only six graduate teams and five undergraduate teams selected nationally.\nThe Emory-Georgia Tech team invented Rolosense, a DNA-powered diagnostic machine that turns chemical energy into rolling motion. This molecular vehicle carries a bead just five microns in diameter at speeds 1,000 times faster than previous motors. The speed of the bead through a sample can indicate the presence of a single gene variation or detect a variety of molecules such as lead using a smartphone application. This could make advanced testing for diseases and contaminants more efficient in remote areas when it\u2019s needed most.\nFounded in 1990, the Collegiate Inventors Competition recognizes and rewards the nation\u2019s top collegiate inventors. In partnership with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), the Collegiate Inventors Competition is the nation\u2019s foremost competition encouraging innovation, entrepreneurship, and creativity in students who are working on cutting-edge inventions at their colleges and universities. The Competition is a program of the National Inventors Hall of Fame and is sponsored by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) and AbbVie Foundation, with additional support from Arrow Electronics.\nEach year, individuals representing a broad cross-section of technological fields serve as first round judges, evaluating entries based on originality of the idea, process (or technology used), level of student initiative, and potential value and usefulness to society.\nThe Finalists will travel to Alexandria, Va., to present their inventions to an esteemed panel of final round judges, comprising the most influential inventors and invention experts in the nation \u2013 National Inventors Hall of Fame Inductees, United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) experts, and AbbVie scientists. The top three entries in the undergraduate and graduate divisions will receive cash prizes.\nThe Awards Ceremony will take place on Nov. 4, 2016, at the USPTO Madison Building in Alexandria, Va. Before the ceremony, from 11 a.m.-noon, competition finalists will showcase their inventions and interact with thousands of USPTO patent and trademark examiners, sponsors, media, and the public at the Collegiate Inventors Competition Expo, which is free and open to all in the community.\n\u201cThe USPTO is proud to host the 2016 Collegiate Inventors Competition,\u201d says Michelle K. Lee, Under Secretary of Commerce for Intellectual Property and Director of the USPTO. \u201cEach year, these students bring innovation to the forefront, developing unique solutions to real world problems. As we continue to promote innovation, we are inspired by the young entrepreneurs who provide us with a glimpse into the future of American technological advancement.\u201d\nThe 2016 Collegiate Inventors Competition final round judges include 10 Inductees from the National Inventors Hall of Fame: Eric R. Fossum (CMOS Active Pixel Image Sensor Camera-on-a-Chip), Marcian \u201cTed\u201d Hoff (Microprocessor), Don Keck (Optical Fiber), Alois Langer (Implantable Defibrillator), Victor Lawrence (Signal Processing in Telecommunications), Radia Perlman (Robust Network Routing and Bridging), Steve Sasson (Digital Camera), Gary Sharp (Polarization-Control Technology), and Jim West (Electret Microphone). Additional expert judges include Elizabeth L. Dougherty and George Elliott representing the USPTO, and Jeffrey Y. Pan, and David Chang-Yen representing AbbVie, Inc.\nFollow the National Inventors Hall of Fame on\nFacebook ,\nTwitter , and\nInstagram\nfor live updates, exclusive interviews with Finalists and winners, and additional information.
