As the federal government\u2019s top infectious disease expert, Fauci has advised seven presidents from both political parties. As a public servant, Fauci\u2019s role was thrust into the national spotlight as our country has faced one the most significant public health crises since the Spanish flu a century ago. For his unwavering commitment to sharing the facts and figures that have helped Americans navigate this pandemic, Fauci has been honored with Georgia Tech\u2019s 2021 Ivan Allen Jr. Prize for Social Courage.\n\u201cI\u2019m deeply honored to accept this award, with gratitude and profound humility,\u201d said Fauci.\nFor Fauci, social courage \u2014 and specifically bravery in the field of science \u2014 means sticking to the principles of what data and evidence provide. In accepting the prize, Fauci said that also means never compromising integrity however inconvenient or uncomfortable the truth may be. The Ivan Allen Jr. Prize for Social Courage, named for Atlanta\u2019s mayor at the height of the civil rights movement in America, honors those who have made a positive impact defending moral principles at the risk of their own careers and even well-being.\n\u201cThe wrenching events that our country has witnessed lately remind us that we have much work to do as individuals, and as a country, to overcome social injustices. As made plain by the Covid-19 pandemic, the adverse effects of health disparities most profoundly affect people of color,\u201d said Fauci. \u201cAs a physician, scientist, and public health official, my main goal is to preserve and protect the health and welfare of all Americans.\u201d\nDuring the Covid-19 pandemic, Fauci has been subject to criticism as he shared guidance intended to help the public protect themselves and each other from this highly contagious virus. He and his family have had to have a security detail at times during the past year due to threats they received. Despite those trials, Fauci says he has continued to share information and science with the public.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a scientist and you\u2019re communicating with the public, the goal is not to show people how smart you are. The goal is for them to understand what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d said Fauci.\nThe trophy that accompanies the annual prize was shipped to Washington D.C. and was given to Dr. Fauci by staff members at the National Institutes of Health, where Fauci has served as director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) since 1984.\nIn a virtual celebration, Fauci joined Georgia Tech President \u00c1ngel Cabrera for a conversation about the intersection of social courage and his role in public health.\n\u201cDr. Fauci has shown an unwavering commitment to science-based guidance, and his voice has become one of the most trusted across the country,\u201d said Cabrera.\nAlso joining the conversation was Fauci\u2019s colleague, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, who said her mentor and hero has been a rock of principle through incredibly challenging circumstances.\n\u201cHe\u2019s done something bold and audacious,\u201d said Walensky. \u201cHe\u2019s told the American people the truth even when it was inconvenient to do so.\u201d\nFauci, now 80 years old, will continue to serve the public in his role at NIAID and as the chief medical advisor to the White House. Responding to a question from Georgia Tech biomedical engineering major Kyra Halbert-Elliott, Dr. Fauci explained where he finds his inspiration to keep working.\n\u201cWhat keeps me on course and not burned out is focusing like a laser beam on the importance of the problem you\u2019re trying to tackle,\u201d said Fauci. \u201cIt could be a sick patient or a particular problem that needs a solution. Understand the enormity of what you do.\u201d\nFauci joins former President Jimmy Carter and the late Congressman John Lewis among the prestigious list of recipients to receive the Ivan Allen Jr. Prize for Social Courage.\nTo see Dr. Fauci\u2019s acceptance speech and conversation with President Cabrera learn more about the Ivan Allen Jr. Prize for Social Courage, visit ivanallenprize.gatech.edu\nAdditional Images\nContact\nSteven Norris\nDirector of Media Relations and Social Media\nInstitute Communications\nEmail\nsnorris@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
