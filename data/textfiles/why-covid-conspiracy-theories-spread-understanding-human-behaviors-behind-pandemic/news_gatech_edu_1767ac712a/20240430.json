Does lack of health insurance discourage people from getting tested,\u00a0even when testing is free? And\u00a0what prevented\u00a0doctors in Italy\u00a0from sharing what they learned about\u00a0oxygen levels,\u00a0even though it\u00a0could\u00a0help\u00a0predict which\u00a0Covid patients\u00a0were at\u00a0the\u00a0highest risk of dying?\nFour faculty members in the School of History and Sociology (HSOC)\u00a0at Georgia Tech\u00a0are\u00a0examining\u00a0 these questions and more \u00a0to help\u00a0craft effective policy responses to the pandemic.\n\u201cThis research by the\u00a0School\u2019s\u00a0faculty shows that the pandemic is not just a problem in biology and medicine. Instead, curbing the pandemic requires scholars who understand human knowledge and human behavior, which are topics at the center of the social sciences and humanities,\u201d said Eric\u00a0Schatzberg, chair of the School of History and Sociology.\nUnderstanding Covid Conspiracies\nHSOC\u00a0Associate\u00a0Professor\u00a0 Amit Prasad \u00a0found something surprising when he\u00a0examined Covid-19\u00a0conspiracy theories:\u00a0these theories are\u00a0not\u00a0automatically\u00a0anti-science.\u00a0Often, purveyors of misinformation use the\u00a0credibility of science and scientists\u00a0to spread\u00a0falsehoods.\nFor\u00a0example,\u00a0Dr. Judy\u00a0Mikovits\u2019s\u00a0pseudo-documentary\u00a0 Plandemic \u00a0received millions of views despite its\u00a0false claims\u2014such as \u201cwearing a mask literally activates your own virus.\u201d\u00a0Why did people believe\u00a0such claims?\nMikovits\u2019s\u00a0falsehoods didn\u2019t matter to viewers\u00a0because\u00a0her\u00a0use \u201cof \u2018science\u2019 and so-called \u2018scientific claims\u2019 in the video facilitated a sense of trust for the general public,\u201d\u00a0wrote Prasad.\nPrasad\u2019s\u00a0research also\u00a0examined\u00a0how the conspiracy theory\u00a0that\u00a0Bill Gates\u00a0had created\u00a0the pandemic spread for different reasons in different communities.\u00a0For instance,\u00a0Prasad argues that within the Black community,\u00a0the messaging reflected \u201cthe long history of mistrust resulting from racial discrimination and exploitation.\u201d\u00a0In contrast, among\u00a0many\u00a0white people,\u00a0the conspiracy was driven by messaging about protecting individual freedom and the republic. This analysis shows that \u201chistories of particular social groups may play a very significant role in the acceptance and spread of misinformation and conspiracies.\u201d\nPrasad\u2019s approach differs from\u00a0past studies\u00a0that\u00a0characterized\u00a0conspiracy theories\u00a0as\u00a0anti-science. These studies\u00a0called for\u00a0clearer communication\u00a0of scientific knowledge to combat\u00a0misinformation.\u00a0But\u00a0Prasad finds that\u00a0better communication\u00a0may not be the most effective solution. \u201cMy research shows that broad characterizations of misinformation and conspiracies as anti-science does not help in properly understanding what is going on,\u201d\u00a0he\u00a0wrote.\nAs Georgia and other states begin to\u00a0transition from mass Covid-19 vaccination efforts to a more targeted approach,\u00a0understanding\u00a0that vaccine skepticism is caused by social and political factors beyond anti-science beliefs can help create more effective messaging.\n\u201cA\u00a0\u2018war\u2019\u00a0on misinformation and conspiracies, which is aimed at banishing them completely, may not work in our instantaneously and globally connected world,\u201d\u00a0concluded\u00a0Prasad. \u201cInstead, we need to carefully study misinformation and conspiracies and deal with them by addressing the social and health issues experienced by particular social groups.\u201d\nPrasad\u2019s\u00a0article,\u00a0 \u201cAnti-Science Misinformation and Conspiracies: COVID\u201319, Post-Truth, and Science & Technology Studies (STS),\u201d \u00a0is open access and\u00a0appeared in\u00a0 Science, Technology and Society \u00a0in April 2021.\nAdvocating for vulnerable families\nHow do social and economic factors\u00a0\u2014\u00a0such as\u00a0relying on public health insurance, living below the poverty line, or losing\u00a0work\u00a0during the\u00a0Covid-19\u00a0pandemic\u00a0\u2014\u00a0disproportionately affect\u00a0Black\u00a0children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and their families?\nHSOC\u00a0Associate\u00a0Professor\u00a0 Jennifer\u00a0 Singh\u00a0will research this\u00a0topic\u00a0in summer 2021,\u00a0with funding\u00a0from\u00a0a\u00a0Special Opportunity for Faculty Development Activities (SODA)\u00a0grant from\u00a0the\u00a0Ivan Allen College of Liberal Arts.\u00a0Her\u00a0 survey\u00a0and interviews \u00a0seek to map disruptions not only in\u00a0children\u2019s\u00a0learning, treatment, and well-being,\u00a0but\u00a0also\u00a0in the well-being of their caregiver.\u00a0According to Singh\u2019s research objective, the goal is\u00a0\u201cto understand how they have managed socially, emotionally, and economically during the Covid-19\u00a0crisis.\u201d\nWith this data, Singh\u00a0plans\u00a0to identify\u00a0how families are coping with\u00a0Covid-related\u00a0barriers\u00a0to\u00a0their children\u2019s continued progress. She hopes to understand\u00a0how\u00a0caregivers\u00a0use support networks\u00a0to balance their\u00a0dual\u00a0roles as financial supporters and supervisors of their\u00a0children\u2019s\u00a0education.\u00a0Finally, Singh\u00a0hopes to identify\u00a0unique opportunities\u00a0and challenges\u00a0presented by\u00a0the\u00a0new learning and social environments that\u00a0emerged\u00a0during the pandemic.\nSingh is\u00a0also\u00a0working with Milan Riddick, a\u00a0fourth-year\u00a0student in the College of Engineering\u00a0minoring in\u00a0 Health, Medicine,\u00a0and Society . Riddick\u2019s\u00a0interdisciplinary President\u2019s Undergraduate Research Award\u00a0(PURA)\u00a0project\u00a0will\u00a0study\u00a0\u201cMistrust of the Covid-19 Vaccine Among Black Citizens of Georgia.\u201d\nQuantifying health and education inequalities\nLower rates of health insurance coverage were associated with lower levels of Covid-19 testing,\u00a0according to a study of state-level data from March 2020 by\u00a0HSOC\u00a0assistant\u00a0professor\u00a0 Allen Hyde \u00a0and\u00a0co-author\u00a0Angran\u00a0Li\u00a0from\u00a0Zhejiang University\u00a0in\u00a0China. This\u00a0relationship\u00a0may have\u00a0exacerbated\u00a0the\u00a0spread of the virus\u00a0and\u00a0the\u00a0deaths associated with it.\n\u201cFurther, lack of health insurance coverage may exacerbate racial and class inequality in Covid-19 testing and subsequent hospitalizations and death,\u201d wrote Hyde and Li.\u00a0 \u201cFor example,\u00a0a majority of\u00a0Covid-19-related deaths reported in Louisiana are African Americans, accounting for 70 percent of the deaths, while African Americans only make up 30 percent of the state\u2019s population (Doubek\u00a02020). Similar patterns have occurred in other cities.\u201d\nIn 2018, about 8% of the U.S. population was uninsured. However, that number varied by state and jumped as high as 17.7% in Texas.\u00a0Research from the Kaiser Family Foundation\u00a0shows that\u00a0in the same year,\u00a0\u201cone in five uninsured adults went without needed medical care due to costs.\u201d\u00a0This\u00a0could\u00a0mean that\u00a0even if uninsured people show symptoms of Covid-19, they may not get tested or seek treatment because of financial concerns.\u00a0Although the Trump Administration announced that Covid-19 testing and treatment would be free, people may\u00a0have been\u00a0unaware\u00a0or skeptical that they would not have to pay.\nHyde\u00a0and Li\u2019s\u00a0research,\u00a0 \u201cA Slow Start on an Urgent Crisis: How Lack of Health Insurance Helps Explain Deficiencies in Coronavirus Testing in U.S. States,\u201d \u00a0was\u00a0published in\u00a0 Contexts ,\u00a0official publication of the American Sociological Association.\u00a0It\u00a0gives\u00a0support to the long-running argument\u00a0that universal health care can save lives.\nHyde also\u00a0worked\u00a0with Li and Amanda\u00a0Maltbie, a Ph.D.\u00a0student at the University of Alabama,\u00a0to research\u00a0the impact of Covid-19 on education. The article, forthcoming in\u00a0the book\u00a0 Social Justice and Education in the 21st Century: Research from South Africa and the United States , examines how disasters reinforce existing structural inequalities and exacerbate them in the aftermath.\nWhat makes knowledge move?\n\u201cKnowledge does not move transnationally by itself,\u201d wrote\u00a0Kranzberg\u00a0Professor Emeritus\u00a0 John Krige \u00a0with co-author Sabina\u00a0Leonelli, professor of Philosophy and History of Science at Exeter University.\u00a0For information to move efficiently\u00a0around the world,\u00a0they found,\u00a0interested parties\u00a0need to have access to \u201ctechnological infrastructure\u201d\u00a0\u2014\u00a0such as\u00a0the internet\u00a0\u2014\u00a0and\u00a0shared\u00a0systems\u00a0for\u00a0data collection and sharing.\nWhen those systems aren\u2019t in place, information doesn\u2019t move as fast as it should, as was the case when it took doctors in Italy two months to get international recognition for their finding that low oxygen levels were a \u201ckey cause and potential predictor\u201d in Covid-19\u00a0deaths. But when\u00a0global\u00a0data-sharing systems are successful, they plug researchers into more extensive networks that hold them accountable, increase their visibility and clout in their home countries, and help amplify their expertise to others.\nBy understanding the challenges\u00a0of\u00a0transnational\u00a0knowledge\u00a0movement, Krige and\u00a0Leonelli\u00a0hope to help mitigate them. Their paper\u00a0documented\u00a0the creation of\u00a0Covid-19 data-sharing systems at\u00a0a\u00a0historically\u00a0significant\u00a0moment, when they were still \u201cin the making,\u201d\u00a0forming and adapting in real-time to the changing Covid-19 situation.\u00a0The first case study focused on the French debate to use a local, centralized contact tracing app versus the decentralized app created by Apple and Google. The second examined an international group called the Research Data Alliance that successfully coordinated and shared Covid information across borders where other groups failed.\nIn\u00a0their work, Krige and\u00a0Leonelli\u00a0envision a better future,\u00a0where doctors, scientists, researchers, government officials,\u00a0policymakers, and experts in every field can\u00a0\u201cengage in a collective effort, driven from the bottom-up, to ensure that everyone, including the most vulnerable victims of Covid-19, benefits\u00a0from the knowledge\u00a0\u2014\u00a0and the vaccine\u00a0\u2014\u00a0that can contain its spread.\u201d\nKrige and\u00a0Leonelli\u2019s\u00a0research\u00a0 \u201cMobilizing the Transnational History of Knowledge Flows. COVID-19 and the Politics of Research at the Borders\u201d \u00a0is open access and\u00a0appeared\u00a0in\u00a0the journal\u00a0 History and Technology \u00a0in March 2021.\nFor more coverage of Georgia Tech\u2019s response to the coronavirus pandemic, please visit our\u00a0 Responding to Covid-19 \u00a0page.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nDi Minardi\ndi.minardi@gatech.edu\nEmail\ndi.minardi@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
