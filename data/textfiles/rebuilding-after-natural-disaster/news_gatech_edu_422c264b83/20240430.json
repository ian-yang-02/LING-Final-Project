Two Georgia Tech experts offer their perspective on infrastructure and how to rebuild after severe weather events.\nAccording to Civil and Environmental Engineering Professor\u00a0 Hermann Fritz , \u201cThere have been significant improvements in Florida and Gulf Coast building codes over the past three decades.\u00a0Hurricane\u00a0Ian\u2019s impact was mostly storm surge and storm wave-driven, while the amount of wind damage was limited and highlights the success of advancing building codes since\u00a0Hurricane\u00a0Andrew.\u201d\nIris Tien , associate professor in the School of Civil and Environmental Engineering, points to hurricanes increasing in frequency and severity and says it\u2019s not enough to build based solely on what\u2019s happened in the past. \u201cWe need to transform our thinking from reacting to events to becoming anticipatory and forward-looking. We don\u2019t want to build just to need to rebuild again when the next\u00a0hurricane\u00a0occurs. In creating resilient infrastructure, we need to anticipate what future events, loadings, shocks, and stressors our infrastructure is going to need to withstand, and build to those levels.\u201d\nFritz shares other experts\u2019 belief that storms are likely to become more frequent, and potentially larger, with higher wind speeds, storm surge, and other hazards. Even in basins where storms have been rare, such as the Arabian Sea, there has been an increase in the frequency of storms, which may be linked to increasing sea surface temperature.\nEach city, state, and region has its own risk exposure, environmental conditions, and population characteristics. It is critical that builders, city planners, and infrastructure operators look to the future to anticipate what conditions are likely to look like and implement solutions that consider the range of possible storm impacts, as well as environment- and population-specific factors to create and tailor solutions for their specific community.\n\u201cLocations and types of infrastructure are both important to consider,\u201d Tien said. \u201cWe need to invest in infrastructure that is adaptive to varying levels of demands anticipated for these systems. We also need to invest in infrastructure where success is evaluated by community and population impacts. This will ensure infrastructure that is resilient, sustainable, and equitable in serving communities moving into the\u00a0 future .\u201d\nAdditional Images\nContact\nAyana Isles\nMedia Relations\u00a0Representative\nInstitute Communications\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
