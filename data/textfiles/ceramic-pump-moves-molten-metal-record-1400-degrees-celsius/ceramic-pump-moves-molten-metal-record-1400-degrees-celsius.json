Use of ceramic components, normally considered too brittle for mechanical systems, was made possible by precision machining \u2013 and seals made from another high-temperature material: graphite.\nThe research was supported by the Advanced Research Projects Agency \u2013 Energy (ARPA-E) and reported in the October 12 issue of the journal\nNature . The pump was developed by researchers from the Georgia Institute of Technology with collaborators from Purdue University and Stanford University.\n\u201cUntil now, we\u2019ve had a ceiling for the highest temperatures at which we could move heat and store it, so this demonstration really enables energy advances, especially in renewables,\u201d said\nAsegun Henry , an assistant professor in Georgia Tech\u2019s\nWoodruff School of Mechanical Engineering . \u201cThe hotter we can operate, the more efficiently we can store and utilize thermal energy. This work will provide a step change in the infrastructure because now we can use some of the highest temperature materials to transfer heat. These materials are also the hardest materials on Earth.\u201d\nThermal energy, fundamental to power generation and many industrial processes, is most valuable at high temperatures because entropy \u2013 which makes thermal energy unavailable for conversion \u2013 declines at higher temperatures. Liquid metals such as molten tin and molten silicon could be useful in thermal storage and transfer, but until now, engineers didn\u2019t have pumps and pipes that could withstand such extreme temperatures.\n\u201cThe hotter you can operate, the more you can convert thermal energy to mechanical energy or electrical energy,\u201d Henry explained. \u201cBut when containment materials like metals get hot, they become soft and that limits the whole infrastructure.\u201d\nCeramic materials can withstand the heat, but they are brittle \u2013 and many researchers felt they couldn\u2019t be used in mechanical applications like pumps. But Henry and graduate student Caleb Amy \u2013 the paper\u2019s first author \u2013 decided to challenge that assumption by trying to make a ceramic pump. \u201cWe weren\u2019t certain that it wouldn\u2019t work, and for the first four times, it didn\u2019t,\u201d Henry said.\nThe researchers used an external gear pump, which uses rotating gear teeth to suck in the liquid tin and push it out of an outlet. That technology differs from centrifugal and other pump technologies, but Henry chose it for its simplicity and ability to operate at relatively low speeds. The gears were custom-manufactured by a commercial supplier and modified in Henry\u2019s lab in the\nCarbon Neutral Energy Solutions\n(CNES) Laboratory\u00a0at Georgia Tech.\n\u201cWhat is new in the past few decades is our ability to fabricate different ceramic materials into large chunks of material that can be machined,\u201d Henry explained. \u201cThe material is still brittle and you have to be careful with the engineering, but we\u2019ve now shown that it can work.\u201d\nAddressing another challenge, the researchers used another high-temperature material \u2013 graphite \u2013 to form the seals in the pump, piping and joints. Seals are normally made from flexible polymers, but they cannot withstand high temperatures. Henry and Amy used the special properties of graphite \u2013 flexibility and strength \u2013 to make the seals. The pump operates in a nitrogen environment to prevent oxidation at the extreme temperatures.\nThe pump operated for 72 hours continuously at a few hundred revolutions per minute at an average temperature of 1,473 Kelvin \u2013 with brief operation up to 1,773 Kelvin in other experimental runs. Because the researchers used a relatively soft ceramic known as Shapal for ease of machining, the pump sustained wear. But Henry says other ceramics with greater hardness will overcome that issue, and the team is already working on a new pump made with silicon carbide.\nAmong the most interesting applications for the high-temperature pump would be low-cost grid storage for surplus energy produced by renewables \u2013 one of the greatest challenges to the penetration of renewables on the grid. Electricity produced by solar or wind sources could be used to heat molten silicon, creating thermal storage that could be used when needed to produce electricity.\n\u201cIt appears likely that storing energy in the form of heat could be cheaper than any other form of energy storage that exists,\u201d Henry said. \u201cThis would allow us to create a new type of battery. You would put electricity in when you have an excess, and get electricity back out when you need it.\u201d\nThe Georgia Tech researchers are also looking at their molten metal pump as part of a system to produce hydrogen from methane without generating carbon dioxide. Because liquid tin doesn\u2019t react with hydrocarbons, bubbling methane into liquid tin would crack the molecule to produce hydrogen and solid carbon \u2013 without generating carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas.\nThe pump could also be used to allow higher temperature operation in concentrated solar power applications, where molten salts are now used. The combination of liquid tin and ceramics would have an advantage in being able to operate at higher temperatures without corrosion, enabling higher efficiency and lower cost.\nThe ceramic pump uses gears just 36 millimeters in diameter, but Henry says scaling it up for industrial processing wouldn\u2019t require dramatically larger components. For example, by increasing the pump dimensions by only four or five times and operating the pump near its maximum rated speed, the total heat that could be transferred would increase by a factor of a thousand, from 10 kW to 100 MW, which would be consistent with utility-scale power plants.\nFor storage, molten silicon \u2013 with still higher temperatures \u2013 may be more useful because of its lower cost. The pump could operate at much higher temperatures than those demonstrated so far, even past 2,000 degrees Celsius, Henry said.\nThis research was supported by the Advanced Research Projects Agency \u2013 Energy (ARPA-E) under award DE-AR0000339.
