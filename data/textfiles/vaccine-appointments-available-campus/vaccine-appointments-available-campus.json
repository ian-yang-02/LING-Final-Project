Thus far,\u00a0 around 15,000 members \u00a0of the campus community have received at least one dose at Tech\u2019s Exhibition Hall, and\u00a0almost 6,000 have received two doses. ( Read why some of them got the vaccine .) Georgia Tech is distributing the Pfizer vaccine, which is a two-dose vaccine.\nFor those who may have been waiting for others to go first, on the fence about vaccination, or not wanting to hunt for an appointment, now is the time to sign up. Appointments are open nearly every day in April and can be booked at\u00a0 mytest.gatech.edu . Vaccination is free and the process takes about 20\u00a0to\u00a030 minutes, including a 15-minute monitoring period after vaccination. ( Watch a video of the vaccination\u00a0process at Georgia Tech .)\nChen Zhou, associate chair for Undergraduate Studies and associate professor in the H. Milton Stewart School of Industrial and Systems Engineering, was one person who thought \u201cwaiting his turn,\u201d even though he was eligible, was the right thing to do. After talking with a colleague, though, he realized his hesitation could be problematic.\n\u201cI heard many people were eligible for the vaccine but did not get it. I teach remotely and can avoid encounters with others,\u201d Zhou said. \u201cSo, I thought I could help if I let others get it first. However,\u00a0 Pinar Keskinocak \u00a0and others told me that it is people like me\u00a0who\u00a0slow down the process. Therefore, I went to get my shots and recorded the process to urge others to do the same.\u201d\nVaccination opens up the possibility to resume some activities that many people have put on hold for over a year.\u00a0 As of\u00a0April\u00a02 , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advises that fully\u00a0vaccinated people can resume domestic travel and do not need to get tested before or after travel,\u00a0or self-quarantine after travel. The CDC also advises that\u00a0they\u00a0can visit with other fully vaccinated people without masks or physical\u00a0distancing, and\u00a0visit\u00a0indoors\u00a0with unvaccinated people from a single household who are at low risk for severe Covid-19 disease without wearing masks or physical distancing.\nStill, those who are vaccinated are encouraged to take precautions in public\u00a0places, such as wearing a mask and physical distancing, and to wear masks, maintain distance, and practice other prevention measures\u00a0when\u00a0visiting with unvaccinated people from multiple households. ( View further guidance from the CDC .)\nThe University System of Georgia\u00a0(USG) has temporarily\u00a0reinstated the use of Non-Closure Emergency Leave\u00a0for\u00a0eligible\u00a0employees receiving a\u00a0Covid-19 vaccination.\u00a0The policy\u00a0is effective\u00a0as of\u00a0March 31, 2021, andwill expire at the conclusion of the Public Health State of Emergency declared in the Governor\u2019s Executive Order.\u00a0 Learn more about how to use leave when you get your vaccine .\nOn campus, all members of the community are encouraged to continue to\u00a0 test , mask, and distance, both during and after vaccination.\nThose who received a first dose of Pfizer elsewhere can receive a second dose from Georgia Tech, as long as it is scheduled for\u00a0at least\u00a021 days after the first dose was administered.\u00a0In addition, a first dose can be received at Georgia Tech and a second elsewhere,\u00a0as\u00a0long as the doses are at least 21 days apart and are both Pfizer vaccines.\u00a0( Nine things to know about the Covid-19 vaccines .)\nGeorgia Tech has been working toward the 1,000-person daily capacity since vaccine planning began in earnest in December, when the first vaccines received emergency authorization from the Food and Drug Administration.\n\u201cGeorgia Tech has led throughout this pandemic, whether it be from our amazing surveillance testing efforts to our campaign, Jackets Protect Jackets. I expect our community to lead once again with vaccinations,\u201d said\u00a0William\u00a0Smith,\u00a0director of the Office of Emergency Management and Communications,\u00a0who took the vaccine as soon as it was available. \u201cThe vaccine is safe, proven, and effective against Covid-19. I certainly encourage anyone who is hesitant to ask others about their experience and ask experts about the vaccine.\u201d\u00a0( Read more about\u00a0Smith,\u00a0who has helped lead the\u00a0campus vaccination effort .)\nLearn more about Covid-19 vaccination on campus at\u00a0 health.gatech.edu/coronavirus/vaccine/ .\u00a0Book your vaccine appointment\u00a0at\u00a0 mytest.gatech.edu .\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nBook a Vaccine Appointment\nTech Community Members Champion the Vaccine\nVideo: Covid-19 Vaccines at Georgia Tech\nAbout the Covid-19 Vaccines at Georgia Tech\nVaccine Dashboard\nContact\nKristen Baliey\nInstitute Communications\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
