As they collide, they become frictionally charged, like a balloon rubbing against your hair, and clump together in a way not observed for sand dune grains on Earth \u2014 they become resistant to further motion. They maintain that charge for days or months at a time and attach to other hydrocarbon substances, much like packing peanuts used in shipping boxes here on Earth.\nThe findings have just been published in the journal Nature Geoscience.\n\u201cIf you grabbed piles of grains and built a sand castle on Titan, it would perhaps stay together for weeks due to their electrostatic properties,\u201d said\nJosef Dufek , the Georgia Tech professor who co-led the study. \u201cAny spacecraft that lands in regions of granular material on Titan is going to have a tough time staying clean. Think of putting a cat in a box of packing peanuts.\u201d\nThe electrification findings may help explain an odd phenomenon. Prevailing winds on Titan blow from east to west across the moon\u2019s surface, but sandy dunes nearly 300 feet tall seem to form in the opposite direction.\n\u201cThese electrostatic forces increase frictional thresholds,\u201d said Josh M\u00e9ndez Harper, a Georgia Tech geophysics and electrical engineering doctoral student who is the paper\u2019s lead author. \u201cThis makes the grains so sticky and cohesive that only heavy winds can move them. The prevailing winds aren\u2019t strong enough to shape the dunes.\u201d\nTo test particle flow under Titan-like conditions, the researchers built a small experiment in a modified pressure vessel in their Georgia Tech lab. They inserted grains of naphthalene and biphenyl \u2014 two toxic, carbon and hydrogen bearing compounds believed to exist on Titan\u2019s surface \u2014 into a small cylinder. Then they rotated the tube for 20 minutes in a dry, pure nitrogen environment (Titan\u2019s atmosphere is composed of 98 percent nitrogen). Afterwards, they measured the electric properties of each grain as it tumbled out of the tube.\n\u201cAll of the particles charged well, and about 2 to 5 percent didn\u2019t come out of the tumbler,\u201d said M\u00e9ndez Harper. \u201cThey clung to the inside and stuck together. When we did the same experiment with sand and volcanic ash using Earth-like conditions, all of it came out. Nothing stuck.\u201d\nEarth sand does pick up electrical charge when it\u2019s moved, but the charges are smaller and dissipate quickly. That\u2019s one reason why you need water to keep sand together when building a sand castle. Not so with Titan.\n\u201cThese non-silicate, granular materials can hold their electrostatic charges for days, weeks or months at a time under low-gravity conditions,\u201d said George McDonald, a graduate student in the\nSchool of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences\nwho also co-authored the paper.\nVisually, Titan is the object in the solar system most like Earth. Data gathered from multiple flybys by Cassini since 2005 have revealed large liquid lakes at the poles, as well as mountains, rivers and potentially volcanoes. However, instead of water-filled oceans and seas, they\u2019re composed of methane and ethane and are replenished by precipitation from hydrocarbon-filled clouds. Titan\u2019s surface pressure is a bit higher than our planet \u2014 standing on the moon would feel similar to standing 15 feet underwater here on Earth.\n\u201cTitan\u2019s extreme physical environment requires scientists to think differently about what we\u2019ve learned of Earth\u2019s granular dynamics,\u201d said Dufek. \u201cLandforms are influenced by forces that aren\u2019t intuitive to us because those forces aren\u2019t so important on Earth. Titan is a strange, electrostatically sticky world.\u201d\nResearchers from the Jet Propulsion Lab, University of Tennessee-Knoxville and Cornell University also co-authored the paper, which is titled \u201cElectrification of Sand on Titan and its Influence on Sediment Transport.\u201d\nThe study is partially supported by the National Science Foundation (EAR-1150794).
