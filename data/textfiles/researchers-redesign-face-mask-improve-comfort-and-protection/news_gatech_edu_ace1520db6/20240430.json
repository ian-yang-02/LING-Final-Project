Based on decades of experience with filtration and textile materials, Georgia Institute of Technology researchers have designed a new mask intended to do just that \u2014 and are\nproviding the plans\nso individuals and manufacturers can make it.\nThe modular Georgia Tech mask combines a barrier filtration material with a stretchable fabric to hold it in place. Prototypes made for testing use hook and eye fasteners on the back of the head to keep the masks on, and include a pocket for an optional filter to increase protection. After 20 washings, the prototypes have not shrunk or lost their shape.\n\u201cIf we want to reopen the economy and ask people to go back to work, we need a mask that is both comfortable and effective,\u201d said\nSundaresan Jayaraman , the Kolon Professor in Georgia Tech\u2019s\nSchool of Materials Science and Engineering . \u201cWe have taken a science-based approach to designing a better mask, and we are very passionate about getting this out so people can use it to help protect themselves and others from harm.\u201d\nThe fundamental flaw in existing reusable cloth masks is that they \u2014 unlike N95 respirators, which are fitted for individual users \u2014 leak air around the edges, bypassing their filtration mechanism. That potentially allows virus particles, both large droplets and smaller aerosols, to enter the air breathed in by users, and allows particles from infected persons to exit the mask.\nThe leakage problem shows up in complaints about eyeglasses fogging up as exhaled breath leaks around the nose, making people less likely to wear them. The fit problem can also be seen in constant adjustments made by wearers, who could potentially contaminate themselves whenever they touch the masks after touching other surfaces.\nTo address the leakage challenge, Jayaraman and principal research scientist\nSungmee Park\ncreated a two-part mask that fastens behind the head like many N95 respirators. The front part \u2014 the barrier component \u2014 contains the filtration material and is contoured to fit tightly while allowing space ahead of the nose and mouth to avoid breathing restrictions and permit unrestricted speech. Made from the kind of moisture-wicking material used in athletic clothing, it includes a pocket into which a filter can be inserted to increase the filtration efficiency and thereby increase protection. The washable fabric filter is made of a blend of Spandex and polyester.\nThe second part of the mask is fashioned from stretchable material. The stretchable part, which has holes for the ears to help position the mask, holds the front portion in place and fastens with conventional hook and eyelet hardware, a mechanism that has been used in clothing for centuries.\n\u201cWe want people to be able to get the mask in the right place every time,\u201d Jayaraman said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t position it correctly and easily, you are going to have to keep fiddling with it. We see that all the time on television with people adjusting their masks and letting them drop below their noses.\u201d\nBeyond controlling air leakage, designing a better mask involves a tradeoff between filtration effectiveness and how well users can breathe. If a mask makes breathing too difficult, users will simply not use it, reducing compliance with masking requirements.\nMany existing mask designs attempt to increase filtration effectiveness by boosting the number of layers, but that may not be as helpful as it might seem, Park said. \u201cWe tested 16 layers of handkerchief material, and as we increased the layers, we measured increased breathing resistance,\u201d she said. \u201cWhile the breathing resistance went up, the filtration did not improve as much as we would have expected.\u201d\n\u201cGood filtration efficiency is not enough by itself,\u201d said Jayaraman. \u201cThe combination of fit, filtration efficiency, and staying in the right place make for a good mask.\u201d\nThe stretchable part of the mask is made from knitted fabric \u2014 a Spandex/Lyocell blend \u2014 to allow for stretching around the head and under the chin. The researchers used a woven elastic band sewn with pleats to cover the top of the nose.\nThe researchers\u00a0made their mask prototypes from synthetic materials instead of cotton. Though cotton is a natural material, it absorbs moisture and holds it on the face, reducing breathability, and potentially creating a \u201cpetri dish\u201d for the growth of microbes.\n\u201cMasks have become an essential accessory in our wardrobe and add a social dimension to how we feel about wearing them,\u201d Park said. So, the materials chosen for the mask come in a variety of colors and designs. \u201cIntegrating form and function is key to having a mask that protects individuals while making them look good and feel less self-conscious,\u201d Jayaraman said.\nThe work of Jayaraman and Park didn\u2019t begin with the Covid-19 pandemic. They received funding 10 years ago from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to study face masks during the avian influenza outbreak. Since then Jayaraman has been part of several National Academy of Medicine initiatives to develop recommendations for improved respiratory protection.\nCovid-19 dramatically increased the importance of using face masks because of the role played by asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic exposure from persons who don\u2019t know they are infected, Jayaraman said. While the proportion of aerosol contributions to transmission is still under study, they likely increase the importance of formfitting masks that don\u2019t leak.\nJayaraman and Park have published their recommendations in The Journal of The Textile Institute, and will make the specifications and patterns for their mask available to individuals and manufacturers. The necessary materials can be obtained from retail fabric stores, and the instructions describe how to measure for customizing the masks.\n\u201cThere is so much misinformation about what face masks can do and cannot do,\u201d Jayaraman said. \u201cBeing scientists and engineers, we want to put out information backed by science that can help our community reduce the harm from SARS-CoV-2.\u201d\nLink to plans, patterns and specifications for this mask\nCITATION : Sungmee Park and Sundaresan Jayaraman, \u201cFrom containment to harm reduction from SARS-CoV-2: a fabric mask for enhanced effectiveness, comfort, and compliance.\u201d ( The Journal of The Textile Institute , 2020)\nhttps://doi.org/10.1080/00405000.2020.1805971\nResearch News\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\n177 North Avenue\nAtlanta, Georgia\u00a0 30332-0181\u00a0 USA\nMedia Relations Contact : John Toon (404-894-6986) (jtoon@gatech.edu).\nWriter : John Toon\nAdditional Images\nContact\nJohn Toon\nResearch News\n(404) 894-6986\nEmail\njtoon@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
