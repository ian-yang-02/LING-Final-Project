The work could have applications in everything from skyscraper windows that control the amount of light and heat coming in and out of a building, to switchable camouflage and visors for military applications, and even color-changing cosmetics and clothing. It also helps fill a knowledge gap in a key area of materials science and chemistry.\nA paper on the research was published in a recent issue of the\nJournal of the American Chemical Society\n(JACS).\nElectrochromic materials change color upon the application of a small electrical potential or voltage. For the last 20 years\nJohn R. Reynolds , a professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology, has been studying and developing electrochromic materials that can switch from a wide range of vibrant colors to clear.\nBut these materials, known as cathodically coloring polymers, have a drawback. Their transmissive, or clear, state is not completely clear. Rather, in this state the material has a light blue tint. \u201cThat\u2019s fine for many applications \u2014 including rear-view mirrors that cut the glare from oncoming cars by turning dark \u2014 but not for all potential uses,\u201d said Reynolds, who has joint appointments in the\nSchool of Chemistry and Biochemistry\nand the\nSchool of Materials Science and Engineering\nat Georgia Tech.\nFor example, the Air Force is working toward visors for its pilots that would automatically switch from dark to clear when a plane flies from bright sunlight into clouds. \u201cAnd when they say clear, they want it crystal clear, not a light blue,\u201d Reynolds said. \u201cWe\u2019d like to get rid of that tint.\u201d\nToward a Solution\nThere is another family of electrochromic materials that can change color when exposed to an oxidizing voltage. These materials, known as anodically coloring electrochromes (ACEs), are colorless materials that turn colored upon oxidation. But there has been a knowledge gap in the science behind the colored oxidized states, known as radical cations. Researchers have not understood the absorption mechanism of these cations, and so the colors could not be controllably tuned.\nIntroducing Dylan T. Christiansen, a graduate student in the Reynolds group. While tinkering with some ACE molecules, he experimented with a new approach to controlling color in radical cations. Specifically, he created four different ACE molecules by making tiny changes to the ACEs\u2019 molecular structures that have little effect on the neutral, clear state, but significantly change the absorption of the colored or radical cation state.\nThe results were spectacular. \u201cI expected some color differences between the four molecules, but thought they\u2019d be very minor,\u201d Christiansen said. Instead, upon the application of an oxidizing voltage, the four molecules produced four very different colors: two vibrant greens, a yellow, and a red. And unlike their cathodic counterparts, they are crystal clear in the neutral state, with no tint. Finally, just like mixing inks, the researchers found that a blend of the molecules that switch to green and red made a mixture that is clear and switches to an opaque black. Suddenly those Air Force visors that switch from crystal clear to black looked more attainable.\n\u201cThe beauty of this is it\u2019s so simple. These minor chemical changes \u2014 literally the difference of a few atoms \u2014 have such a huge impact on color,\u201d said\nAim\u00e9e L. Tomlinson , a professor in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at the\nUniversity of North Georgia\nand the third author of the paper with Reynolds and Christiansen.\nWhat\u2019s Going On?\nHow could such tiny changes have such an effect? That\u2019s where Tomlinson, a computational chemist, comes in.\nFor the last five years she has been analyzing Reynolds\u2019 electrochromic materials with computational models that provide insights into what\u2019s happening at the sub-molecular level. Using those models, coupled with Christiansen\u2019s data for the new ACE molecules, she was able to show how the small chemical changes that were made can drastically alter the electronic structure of the molecules\u2019 radical cation states, and ultimately control the color.\nThe work continues to generate insights into new ACE molecules thanks to continuous feedback between Tomlinson\u2019s models and the experimental data. The models help guide efforts in the lab to create new ACE molecules, while the experimental data from those molecules makes the models ever stronger.\nTomlinson notes that because the work is also helping to illuminate how radical cations work \u2014 they are still not well understood \u2014 it could help others manipulate them for future use in fields beyond electrochromism.\nReynolds commented on the serendipitous nature of the initial discovery. \u201cI think what makes science really interesting is that [sometimes] you see something you really did not expect, you pursue it, and you end up with something that is better than you expected when you started.\u201d\nThis work was funded by the Air Force Office of Scientific Research.
