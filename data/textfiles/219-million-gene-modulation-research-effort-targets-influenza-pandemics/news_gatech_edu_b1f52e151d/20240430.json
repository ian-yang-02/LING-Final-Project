The RNA-based drugs could be delivered to the lungs through a nebulizer or inhaler, which are well-established techniques.\nLed by researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology, the planned four-year initiative includes scientists from Duke University, Emory University, the University of Georgia, the University of Louisiana, Rockefeller University and Acorda Therapeutics. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will also partner with the team and will be funded separately by DARPA. The funding was announced June 27 as part of DARPA\u2019s\nPREPARE\n(Preemptive Expression of Protective Alleles and Response Elements) initiative.\n\u201cViruses are very good at adapting, but they are not very good at adapting when we can use orthogonal methods of fighting them,\u201d said\nPhilip Santangelo , a professor in the\nWallace H. Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering at Georgia Tech and Emory University . \u201cIf we can make this simple and easy for people to use, we will have the ability to fight the virus in multiple ways.\u201d\nKey to the project is modulating gene response \u2014 up-regulating or down-regulating certain gene expression \u2014 but not permanently affecting DNA. \u201cWe need for what we do to be transient,\u201d Santangelo said. \u201cThe immediate threat from a flu pandemic won\u2019t last that long, so we may need the RNA effects to last for a couple of weeks to months.\u201d\nThe first line of defense would be equipping the lungs to better resist infection by the influenza virus. That strategy will involve first identifying genetic targets that could help ward off the virus by making the lungs very resistant to infection. Researchers will then develop drugs to bring about those changes.\n\u201cOur major goal is to identify host genes that, when either suppressed or activated, make cells refractory to influenza virus infection,\u201d said Nicholas Heaton, assistant professor in the Department of Molecular Genetics and Microbiology at Duke University Medical Center. \u201cWe will perform a series of genetic screens to identify these host factors, and then also perform a series of target validation studies both\nin-vitro\nand\nin-vivo .\u201d\nNo drug works perfectly, however, so some people treated to boost resistance to the virus will be infected anyway. But that would open the door to another component of the strategy: drugs that destroy virus RNA.\n\u201cWe have already shown that we can chew up viral RNA, and in this project we will demonstrate that first in small animal models,\u201d said Santangelo.\nOther strategies will be designed to boost the body\u2019s immune system, modifying the neutrophils that respond to influenza to help them more effectively and more rapidly clear infection from the lungs.\n\u201cNeutrophils are the first white blood cells coming into the lung, within minutes of an encounter with the virus,\u201d said Rabindra Tirouvanziam, associate professor in the Emory University School of Medicine. \u201cBecause neutrophils are fast acting, their ability to change RNA expression to adapt to particular conditions was thought to be limited. However, we discovered that neutrophils change their RNA very rapidly after coming into the lung, which opens a critical avenue for RNA-based modulation at the very beginning of inflammation, in order to minimize damaging side effects and maximize protection.\u201d\nFinally, the initiative will attempt to take advantage of influenza vaccines that most people have received during their lifetimes. Flu vaccines made available each year differ according to the expected flu variants, and their effectiveness is rarely more than about 45 percent.\n\u201cFor people who have been vaccinated against flu, we want to strengthen the vaccine to boost the effectiveness of B cells and T cells,\u201d Santangelo said.\nThe research team will develop gene modulation tools that would alter expression in the lungs using RNA-based modulators. The task will involve identifying potential targets, verifying them, and developing drugs that can induce temporary changes. The goal is to have drugs ready for clinical trials by the end of the four-year period.\n\u201cThis is incredibly ambitious,\u201d Santangelo said. \u201cThis work should open a lot of doors for completely new classes of drugs. Conceptually, the ability to temporarily modulate genes to make people more resistant to a pathogen is incredibly exciting.\u201d\nUltimately, the work will open up new means for protecting humans against the effects of viruses.\n\u201cVaccines have a well-established protective capacity against seasonal flu, but they take time to act and become obsolete because of continuous evolution of the flu virus,\u201d Tirouvanziam noted. \u201cThis project proposes to enact rapid modulation of host responses to the flu virus by manipulating RNA in cells. RNA is the transient template that cells use to make proteins, and rapid RNA regulation therefore has the potential to impact acute symptoms and transmission in settings of a flu epidemic with aggressive strains where vaccines would be largely ineffective.\u201d\nIn addition to those already named, the research team will include: James Dahlman, Gabe Kwong and Krish Roy at the Georgia Institute of Technology; Rafi Ahmed, Richard Compans, Jacob Kohlmeier, Sanjeev Gumber and Eliver Ghosn at Emory University; Ian York from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; Jessica Kissinger and Mustafa Nural at the University of Georgia; Charles Gersbach, Gregory Crawford, Timothy Reddy and Xiling Shen at Duke University; Francois Villinger at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette; Jeffrey Ravetch from Rockefeller University; and Michael Tauber at Acorda Therapeutics.\nMedia Relations Contact : John Toon (404-894-6986) (jtoon@gatech.edu).\nWriter : John Toon\nResearch News\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\n177 North Avenue\nAtlanta, Georgia\u00a0 30332-0181\u00a0 USA\nAdditional Images\nContact\nJohn Toon\nResearch News\n(404) 894-6986\nEmail\njtoon@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
