Researchers across both Colleges and the\u00a0 Georgia Tech Research Institute \u00a0(GTRI) are now hard at work on several ambitious projects related to NASA\u2019s planned return to Earth\u2019s moon \u2014\u00a0and beyond.\nLunar Flashlight to Search for Ice on the Moon\nThomas Orlando \u00a0says NASA is always looking for multidisciplinary research programs at the higher education level. He uses a recent win of a key NASA partnership, dubbed the\u00a0 Lunar Flashlight Mission , as an example of what\u2019s been a very successful approach for the Institute.\nOrlando is a professor in the\u00a0 School of Chemistry and Biochemistry , principal investigator for NASA\u00a0 REVEALS \u00a0(Radiation Effects on Volatiles and Exploration of Asteroids and Lunar Surfaces), and former co-founder and director of Georgia Tech\u2019s\u00a0 Center for Space Technology and Research \u00a0(C-STAR.)\nREVEALS is researching ways to prepare NASA for the next generation of its crewed space missions, and is, itself, part of a larger NASA\u00a0\u00a0program,\u00a0 SSERVI\n(Solar System Exploration Research Virtual Institute).\nThe project includes designing spacesuits with radiation detection materials sewn into the suits \u2014 and using the Moon\u2019s natural resources (buried ice for water, minerals at or near the surface) to support astronaut habitats. That ice could also provide drinking water for astronauts and possibly help fuel engines built on site.\n\u201cREVEALS is focusing on the water on the Moon issue. This involves understanding how it is made or delivered, how it is transported, and where it is. The work also involves developing technologies to extract it, a project lead by\u00a0 Peter Loutzenhiser \u00a0( George W. Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering ). We obviously need to know how much is there and whether we can get it and utilize it. This is where Lunar Flashlight comes in,\u201d Orlando says.\nThe Lunar Flashlight project also focuses on deep collaboration and coordination across several agencies and teams.\u00a0 This past summer , the\u00a0 NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory \u00a0(JPL) in Southern California shipped all spacecraft parts to Tech's Atlanta campus to begin assembly and testing. GTRI is now providing the clean room for assembly, and a team of researchers, led by\u00a0 Jud Ready , is managing all the integration and testing of Lunar Flashlight before it\u00a0is\u00a0shipped to the\u00a0Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, for fueling, then on to\u00a0 Kennedy Space Center \u00a0in Cape Canaveral, Florida, for launch in 2022.\n\u201cOur new Center for Space Hardware Assembly, Fabrication and Testing will provide the cleanroom space to assemble Lunar Flashlight and put it through a rigorous series of tests,\u201d says Ready, who is principal investigator of the Lunar Flashlight project. Ready also serves as deputy director of Innovation Initiatives for the\u00a0 Georgia Tech Institute for Materials \u00a0(IMat), is an adjunct professor in the\u00a0 School of Materials Science and Engineering , and is a principal research engineer at GTRI.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no instruction manual right now \u2014 it\u2019s our role to collaborate with the scientists and engineers at JPL and the other partners to write the test and integration procedures, do them, and at the same time to conclusively verify our work,\u201d Ready says.\nTiny CubeSats Take to the Sky\nThe Lunar Flashlight is a\u00a0 CubeSat \u00a0\u2014 a mini-satellite that\u2019s basically what its name implies: a 6U CubeSat (30 x 20 x 10cm), about the size of a desktop tower computer. CubeSats\u00a0can weigh anywhere from 3 to 20 pounds, and can be deployed much easier and at a lower cost than traditional satellites.\nSince their introduction in 1999, CubeSats have become\u00a0 popular \u00a0for science and commercial satellite deployment, while allowing Engineering and Sciences students at schools such as Georgia Tech to design and deploy their own satellites.\n\u201cThat\u2019s great in and of itself, for our students to have an opportunity to build a satellite and send it into space,\u201d\u00a0 Glenn Lightsey , David Lewis Professor of Space Systems Technology in the\u00a0 Daniel Guggenheim School of Aerospace Engineering , and current C-STAR director, says. \u201cThey can apply to a company with a resume that says, \u2018I\u2019ve already built a satellite and it\u2019s in space talking to others.\u2019 Twenty years ago, that just didn\u2019t happen.\u201d\nLunar Flashlight CubeSat will\u00a0have sensitive instrumentation for locating buried ice on the Moon, and Lightsey\u2019s\u00a0team has already built its propulsion system. After launch from Kennedy Space Center, Lunar Flashlight will have its mission control operations run out of Lightsey\u2019s lab.\nEngineering hardware with scientific instrumentation \u2014 Lightsey says you can\u2019t illustrate Georgia Tech\u2019s strengths as a NASA partner any better than\u00a0with interdisciplinary projects like the Lunar Flashlight.\n\u201cI think Georgia Tech has a competitive advantage based on how it is really emphasizing interdisciplinary research from the beginning, from idea generation on. There aren\u2019t many institutions like it in my opinion. It\u2019s in Georgia Tech\u2019s bones.\u201d\nLunar Dust-Busting in NASA\u2019s BIG\u00a0Ideas Challenge\nThe REVEALS program is also looking at ways to wipe out the problem of lunar dust, which can have an inherent electrical charge and can be more damaging to equipment than Earth dust. It can also be a health hazard if it sneaks into an astronaut\u2019s habitat.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an engineering project, but a science problem,\u201d Orlando says. \u201cHere\u2019s an example of where engineering and science got together, and something great came out of it.\u201d\nNASA\u2019s\u00a0 BIG (Breakthrough, Innovative, and Game-Changing) Ideas Challenge , a competition for undergraduates and graduate students to brainstorm away problems for the space agency, was dedicated to lunar dust mitigation for the 2021 version. That project is led by\u00a0 Julie Linsey , a professor in the\u00a0 George W. Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering\nwho is mentored by Orlando and Lightsey, along with REVEALS research\u00a0scientists\u00a0 Micah Schaible \u00a0and\u00a0 Zach Seibers , a student team of engineering students\u00a0\u2014\u00a0 Varun Bose,\u00a0John Fitton,\u00a0Zhen Liu,\u00a0Dicky Silitonga,\u00a0Kristoffer (Kris) Sjolund, \u00a0and\u00a0 Jeffery Zhang . The crew came up with a hybrid brush, which uses both an electrodynamic system (EDS) and ultraviolet (UV) technology to keep dust from building up on lunar spacesuits.\nThe team, which called itself\u00a0 Shoot For the Moon , is among six\u00a0BIG Ideas Challenge finalists. Shoot For the Moon will give a presentation on the hybrid brush at the BIG Ideas Forum in November.\nTwo members of the REVEALS team also recently presented their work on human space exploration.\u00a0 Faris Almatouq , a graduate student in the\u00a0 School of Physics \u00a0working on novel radiation detectors, and\u00a0 Kris Sjolund , a graduate research assistant in mechanical engineering working on the dust brush, both won first prize in the poster contest at the SSERVI/NASA Exploration Science Forum and European Lunar Workshop in July.\n\u201cThese students and co-investigators are all doing great and impactful work,\u201d Orlando says. \u201cThere\u2019s an interesting distribution of students working on BIG Ideas projects. They\u2019re mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, and aerospace engineering students. And there were chemists and other scientists advising them. It was a multidisciplinary student team \u2014 and a multidisciplinary advisory team.\u201d\nFrom our State to our Solar System\nOrlando and Lightsey also note that Tech\u2019s graduates are already finding jobs with\u00a0 Blue\u00a0Origin \u00a0and\u00a0 SpaceX , two of the new commercial space businesses with successful crewed maiden flights earlier in the summer. That\u2019s in addition to how Georgia Tech has seeded NASA and JPL, plus Lockheed, Boeing, and other established aerospace companies, with former students.\n\u201cAlmost half of my students are getting a graduate degree in engineering\u00a0 and \u00a0a graduate degree in science,\u201d Orlando says. \u201cThey typically get a master\u2019s in engineering or materials science and a Ph.D. in chemistry or physics. It markets them much more for SpaceX or NASA. It\u2019s this hybrid training that people are looking for, and I can\u2019t think of a better place for it than Georgia Tech.\u201d\nLightsey and Orlando hope to one day welcome nearby universities, such as Emory University and the University of Georgia, as partners in some of these initiatives. The move would combine resources and expertise from all three institutions to create a first-of-its-kind statewide space science initiative or institute in Georgia.\nThat kind of collaboration could also help create a new powerhouse for planetary and space science research close to home research institutions \u2014 and could help create more job opportunities to retain Georgia talent, with young alumni working in a range of aerospace-related industries with freshly minted Georgia-grown degrees in hand.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of interest,\u201d Lightsey says. \u201cWho doesn\u2019t want to work on space exploration? This is something that resonates with everyone in every discipline. I think all the institutions have different areas of expertise they can contribute. I think collectively we can be much more complete than just one institution by itself.\u201d\nWorld Space Week 2021: Georgia Tech to Host Space Day Atlanta\nThe Daniel Guggenheim School of Aerospace Engineering at Georgia Tech will host\nSpace Day Atlanta\non\nOctober 9, 2021 as an effort to launch local K-12 students\u2019 interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM).\nThe day-long event on campus, organized by NASA\u2019s\nGeorgia Space Grant Consortium\n(GSGC), will allow local schoolchildren to see demonstrations of current aerospace research at Georgia Tech, as well as participate in various hands-on activities such as virtual flights to Mars and rocket building and launching.\nLearn more .\nAdditional Images\nContact\nRenay San Miguel\nCommunications Officer II/Science Writer\nCollege of Sciences\n404-894-5209\nEmail\nrenay.san@cos.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
