This year marks the\n30 th\nanniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act , signed into law on July 26, 1990, by President George H.W. Bush.\n\u201cUnfortunately, many members of the Tech community have a limited understanding of the term \u2018access\u2019 when it comes to understanding the myriad challenges faced by some members of our community,\u201d said Archie Ervin, vice president for IDEI, ahead of the event. \u201cMany of us understand issues of physical access to facilities and technologies. However, fewer realize that many members of our community face additional barriers \u2014 both visible and invisible to most of us.\u201d\nFeatured speaker Haben Girma, the first deaf-blind person to graduate from Harvard Law School and author of\nHaben: The Deafblind Woman Who Conquered Harvard Law School , opened the event and relayed the importance of disability inclusion and disability technologies.\n\u201cIf we can harness more awareness between disability and technology and innovation, everyone will benefit,\u201d Girma said, speaking with the assistance of a hearing translator and braille computer.\n\u201cI have a braille computer; along the bottom are dots. I run my fingers over the dots and feel the patterns,\u201d Girma demonstrated. \u201cThe patterns of the dots make braille. During this presentation, this is what I\u2019m using for communication. I have an assistant who will be typing what people are saying.\u201d\nGirma urged viewers to let go of the idea that disabilities are a burden. \u201cWe have to resist those stories and instead reframe what disability means.\u201d She described winning battles while at Harvard Law (such as successfully arguing for braille menus in campus cafeterias) and learning to salsa dance and surf. Today, she travels the world teaching the benefits of choosing inclusion.\nThe event also featured three panel presentations and discussions, including a group who discussed their experiences with their disabilities on campus and in everyday life.\n\u201cAwareness is only one part of it,\u201d said Danny Housley, assistive technology manager with Tools for Life, part of the College of Design\u2019s\nCenter for Inclusive Design and Innovation\n(CIDI). \u201cI use a white cane and I\u2019m blind. You\u2019re now aware that I have a disability \u2014 what does that change? We want to move toward\nacceptance\nof disability and for people to look at it like a trait, like anything else. I may be blind, but that doesn\u2019t mean that I\u2019m incapable of working.\u201d\n\u201cI think this is a great step toward things that we need to be doing more of,\u201d added Liz Persaud, also a CIDI staffer and panelist. \u201cRecognizing that we have a diversity symposium and being able to focus specifically on disability issues is unbelievably important.\u201d\nOther panels focused on Tech-centered disability technology research and development, design, and Georgia Tech\u2019s IT accessibility policies.\n\u201cThe 2020 Diversity Symposium raised critical awareness of accessibility issues and exclusion that many in our Georgia Tech community and around the world face due to poor design of the built and digital environment,\u201d said Chantal Kerssens, panelist and CIDI\u2019s executive director and director of research. \u201cDisabilities, permanent and temporary, are much more common than we think. Removing barriers and designing for inclusion opens up society and unlocks joy and productivity from which we all stand to benefit.\u201d\nThe symposium also featured live captioning from CIDI.\n\u201cThe Center for Inclusive Design and Innovation was a proud partner in planning the event and we were proud to share our lived experiences, our scholarship, and our service to communities around the country,\u201d Kerssens added.\nThe event ended with the annual awards presented to this year\u2019s\nFaces of Inclusive Excellence\nhonorees and the Diversity Champion Awards honorees, who were recognized for their achievements in accessibility and inclusion on campus. They included Cassie S. Mitchell, assistant professor, Biomedical Engineering (faculty winner); Johan \u201cJohn\u201d Rempel, UX/ICT quality assurance manager, CIDI (staff winner); Nandita Gupta, graduate student, Human-Computer Interaction (student winner); and the Writing and Communication Program in the Ivan Allen College of Liberal Arts School of Literature, Media, and Communication (unit winner).\n\u201cThis year\u2019s\u00a0Diversity Symposium\u00a0told the story that every person in the Tech community is valued and entitled to full access to all that we have to offer to fulfill each person\u2019s aspirations, Ervin added. \u201cSeeing access as an issue of inclusion demonstrates that everyone is welcomed and that we should all be dedicated to eliminating barriers of any kind for our community members.\u201d\nTo learn more and to view the event\u2019s panel recordings, visit:\ndiversity.gatech.edu/12th-annual-georgia-tech-diversity-symposium .\nA full transcript of the event is also available\nhere .\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nIvan Allen College Faculty, Staff,and Students Honored for Diversity and Inclus\u2026\nDiversity Symposium Celebrates Trailblazers\nContact\nCourtney Hill\nCommunications Manager\nInstitute Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion\ncourtney.hill@gatech.edu\nEmail\ncourtney.hill@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
