As a first-year Georgia Tech\nmechanical engineering\nstudent with an automotive concentration, Dass\u2019 journey intertwines his passion for racing with his pursuit of engineering.\nFrom a young age, Dass has shown a fascination with creating and designing machines that move. He fondly recalls how in the 8th grade he saved all his money and invested in a Lincoln Electric welder so that he could build his own go-kart. That experience ignited a passion that propelled him toward mechanical engineering.\n\u201cI discovered go-kart racing in 8th grade and knew that I had found my type of sport,\u201d Dass said.\nBalancing the demands of academia with the rigors of racing is no easy feat. Dass\u2019 schedule is a whirlwind of long racing weekends, with classes sometimes taking a back seat to his passion for motorsports. Despite the challenges, he strives to excel both on the track and in the classroom, juggling coursework with race preparations and commitments.\nDass\u2019 dedication to the sport recently earned him the\n2024 Parella Motorsports Holdings Powering Diversity Scholarship\nfor the Ligier JS Formula 4 series.\nIn a sport as competitive as racing, recognition of his diverse background was both validating and inspiring.\n\u201cI appreciate being recognized as an individual with a diverse background and hope that my presence in motorsports can inspire others to participate in this exciting sport,\u201d Dass explained.\nBeyond racing and engineering, Dass enjoys working on his project cars and playing on his electric guitar. These passions serve as outlets for creativity and relaxation,\nhelping him recharge.\nWith each lap around the track and every project in the workshop, he embodies the spirit of innovation and the relentless pursuit of excellence. As he continues to carve his path in the world of motorsports, one thing remains certain: Harbir Dass is a force to be reckoned with, both on and off the track.\nAdditional Media\nContact\nEvan Atkinson , Institute Social Media Manager\nEmail\neatkinson6@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
