That\u2019s what happens to insects in the Amazon rain forests of Peru, where a tiny slingshot spider launches a web \u2013 and itself \u2013 to catch unsuspecting flies and mosquitoes.\nResearchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology have produced what may be the first kinematic study of how this amazing arachnid stores enough energy to produce acceleration of 1,300 meters/second 2\n\u2013 100 times the acceleration of a cheetah. That acceleration produces velocities of 4 meters per second and subjects the spider to forces of approximately 130 Gs, more than 10 times what fighter pilots can withstand without blacking out.\nThe Peruvian spider and its cousins stand out among arachnids for their ability to make external tools \u2013 in this case, their webs \u2013 and use them as springs to create ultrafast motion. Their ability to hold a ready-to-launch spring for hours while waiting for an approaching mosquito suggests yet another amazing tool: a latch mechanism to release the spring.\n\u201cUnlike frogs, crickets, or grasshoppers, the slingshot spider is not relying on its muscles to jump really quickly,\u201d said\nSaad Bhamla , an assistant professor in Georgia Tech\u2019s\nSchool of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering\nwho studies ultrafast organisms. \u201cWhen it weaves a new web every night, the spider creates a complex, three-dimensional spring. If you compare this natural silk spring to carbon nanotubes or other human-made materials in terms of power density or energy density, it is orders of magnitude more powerful.\u201d\nThe study, supported by the National Science Foundation and National Geographic Society Foundation, was published August 17 in the journal\nCurrent Biology .\nUnderstanding how web silk stores energy could potentially provide new sources of power for tiny robots and other devices, and lead to new applications for the robust material, the researchers say.\nSlingshot spiders, known by the scientific genus name\nTheridiosomatid , build three-dimensional conical webs with a tension line attached to the center. The Peruvian member of that spider family, which is about 1 millimeter in length, pulls the tension line with its front legs to stretch the structure while holding on to the web with its rear legs. When it senses a meal within range, the spider launches the web and itself toward a fly or mosquito.\nIf the launch is successful, the spider quickly wraps its meal in silk. If the spider misses, it simply pulls the tension line to reset the web for the next opportunity.\n\u201cWe think this approach probably gives the spider the advantage of speed and surprise, and perhaps even the effect of stunning the prey,\u201d noted Symone Alexander, a postdoctoral researcher in Bhamla\u2019s lab. \u201cThe spiders are tiny, and they are going after fast-flying insects that are larger than they are. To catch one, you must be much, much faster than they are.\u201d\nSlingshot spiders were described in a 1932 publication, and more recently by Jonathan Coddington, now a senior research entomologist at the Smithsonian Institution. Bhamla has an interest in fast-moving but small organisms, so he and Alexander arranged a trip to study the catapulting creature using ultrafast cameras to measure and record the movement.\n\u201cWe wanted to understand these ultrafast movements because they can force our perspective to change from thinking about cheetahs and falcons as the only fast animals,\u201d Bhamla said. \u201cThere are many very small invertebrates that can achieve fast movement through unusual structures. We really wanted to understand how these spiders achieve that amazing acceleration.\u201d\nThe researchers traveled six hours by boat from Puerto Maldonado to the Tambopata Research Center. There is no electricity in the area, so nights are very dark. \u201cWe looked up and saw a tiny red dot,\u201d Bhamla recalled. \u201cWe were so far away from the nearest light that the dot turned out to be the planet Mars. We could also see the Milky Way so clearly.\u201d\nThe intense darkness raises the question of how the spider senses its prey and determines where to aim itself. Bhamla believes it must be using an acoustic sensing technique, a theory supported by the way the researchers tricked the spider into launching its web: They simply snapped their fingers.\nBeyond sensing in the dark, the researchers also wondered how the spider triggers release of the web. \u201cIf an insect gets within range, the spider releases a small bundle of silk that it has created by crawling along the tension line,\u201d Alexander said. \u201cReleasing the bundle controls how far the web flies. Both the spider and web are moving backward.\u201d\nAnother mystery is how the spider patiently holds the web while waiting for food to fly by. Alexander and Bhamla estimated that stretching the web requires at least 200 dynes, a tremendous amount of energy for a tiny spider to generate. Holding that for hours could waste a lot of energy.\n\u201cGenerating 200 dynes would produce tremendous forces on the tiny legs of the spider,\u201d Bhamla said. \u201cIf the reward is a mosquito at the end of three hours, is that worth it? We think the spider must be using some kind of trick to lock its muscles like a latch so it doesn\u2019t need to consume energy while waiting for hours.\u201d\nBeyond curiosity, why travel to Peru to study the creature? \u201cThe slingshot spider offers an example of active hunting instead of the passive, wait for an insect to collide into the web strategy, revealing a further new functionality of spider silk,\u201d Bhamla said. \u201cBefore this, we hadn\u2019t thought about using silk as a really powerful spring.\u201d\nAnother unintended benefit is changing attitudes toward spiders. Prior to the study, Alexander admits she had a fear of spiders. Being surrounded by slingshot spiders in the Peruvian jungle \u2013 and seeing the amazing things they do \u2013 changed that.\n\u201cIn the rainforest at night, if you shine your flashlight, you quickly see that you are completely surrounded by spiders,\u201d she said. \u201cIn my house, we don\u2019t kill spiders anymore. If they happen to be scary and in in the wrong place, we safely move them to another location.\u201d\nAlexander and Bhamla had hoped to return to Peru this summer, but those plans were cut short by the coronavirus. They\u2019re eager to continue learning from the spider.\n\u201cNature does a lot of things better than humans can do, and nature has been doing them for much longer,\u201d she said. \u201cBeing out in the field gives you a different perspective, not only about what nature is doing, but also why that is necessary.\u201d\nThis research was supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF) through award 1817334 and CAREER 1941933, by the National Geographic Foundation through NGS-57996R-19, and by the Eckert Postdoctoral Research Fellowship from the Georgia Tech School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering.
