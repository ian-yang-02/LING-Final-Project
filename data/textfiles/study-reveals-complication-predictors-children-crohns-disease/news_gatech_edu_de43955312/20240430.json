The results of this research, \u201cPrediction of complicated disease course for children newly diagnosed with Crohn\u2019s disease: a multicentre inception cohort study,\u201d have been published in the journal, The Lancet.\nThis groundbreaking work is the result of the Crohn\u2019s & Colitis Foundation\u2019s \u201cRISK Stratification\u201d study, the largest new-onset study completed on pediatric Crohn\u2019s disease patients. It is a multicenter research initiative that consists of 25 U.S. institutions and three from Canada and a cohort of 1,112 CD children enrolled at diagnosis, of which 913 were included in the published study. Of the 28 research sites, four are located in Atlanta - Emory University, Georgia Institute of Technology, Children\u2019s Healthcare of Atlanta, and the Children\u2019s Center for Digestive Health Care. The goal of this research was to identify measurable indicators of the two most common complications in pediatric Crohn\u2019s disease that require surgery - stricturing and penetrating disease.\nStricturing, also referred to as fibrostenosis, is characterized by a build-up of fibrotic scar tissue which leads to thickening of the intestinal wall and narrowing of the intestinal passage. Penetrating disease is the result of sustained inflammation that spreads beyond the intestinal wall resulting in the creation of fistulas, abnormal connections between the intestine and other organs. Penetrating complications can also lead to the formation of abscesses at the sites of fistulas.\n\u201cTwenty five percent of patients with Crohn\u2019s disease account for 80 percent of complications, hospitalizations, surgery and health care costs. The aim of RISK is to preemptively identify those 25 percent of patients at diagnosis,\u201d Subra Kugathasan, M.D., Emory University, principal investigator and lead author of the paper. \u201cThrough the study of baseline gene expression, immune reactivity, and intestinal bacteria, we have identified distinct biological signatures capable of predicting stricturing and penetrating disease, at diagnosis. After analyzing millions of biological and clinical data points, RISK has generated a composite risk stratification model.\u201d\n\"Stricturing and penetrating disease account for substantial morbidity in both pediatric and adult patients with Crohn\u2019s disease, but there are no validated models to predict risk and the effect of treatment,\" said Caren Heller, M.D., chief scientific officer of the Foundation.\nRISK study researchers looked at intestinal gene expression levels to identify risk factor genes whose levels are altered (increased or decreased) at enrollment, and identified distinct biological gene expression signatures at baseline that could distinguish children who will develop strictures form those who develop fistulas or abscesses, without the confounding effects of treatment on gene expression. Therefore, these genetic signatures together with other biological and clinical variables they evaluated could be used as predictors of complications and treatment outcomes at diagnosis.\n\"Importantly, the functional nature of these genetic signatures is consistent with the clinical presentation of the complications,\" said Ted Denson, M.D., Cincinnati Children's Hospital, co-principal investigator and lead author of the paper. \"This means that while patients who develop fibrostenosis exhibit, at diagnosis, increased levels of several genes involved in the fibrosis process, patients who develop penetrating disease have increased levels of genes involved in the inflammatory response.\"\nIn addition to providing predictive biological signatures for development of complications, the RISK study also found that patients who receive early anti-TNFa biologic treatment, within three months of diagnosis, were less likely to develop penetrating complications. However, patients with stricturing complications were poorly responsive to early intervention with biologics. These data support the utility of risk stratification of pediatric Crohn\u2019s disease patients at diagnosis, and may guide early tailored use of anti-TNFa therapy. The data also highlight the unmet medical need to find new treatment options for children likely to develop strictures.\n\u201cThese discoveries are great steps toward precision medicine in the treatment of pediatric Crohn's disease,\u201d said Andr\u00e9s Hurtado-Lorenzo, Ph.D., Director of Translational Research of the Foundation. \u201cIn the coming years, we plan to translate these findings into a risk diagnostic tool that could use these biological signatures as biomarkers to predict risk of complications and to help clinicians make therapeutic decisions at diagnosis.\u201d\nThe Foundation has made significant investments in support of pediatric IBD research through the PRO-KIIDS network, an umbrella for clinics participating in pediatric IBD research. Although many projects are expected to arise from this network the Risk Stratification has been the flagship study.\n\u201cPediatric patients are the fastest growing group of the IBD population. Under the auspices of the PRO-KIIDS network, every major pediatric IBD center in the country is touched by our work or funding,\u201d said Michael Osso, President and CEO of the Foundation. \u201cThrough the network, and the results of the RISK study, we are furthering research that will significantly lower the treatment burden on kids, and help minimize side effects on the quality of life surrounding the most vulnerable of patients.\u201d\nAs part of the study, Georgia Tech postdoctoral researcher Urko Marigorta analyzed RNAseq gene expression data from biopsies provided by Cincinnati Children's Hospital. The work identified dozens of pathways that are differentially expressed in complicated disease, and showed that immune activity is more disrupted in penetrating disease while extracellular matrix is more involved in stricturing disease. Inclusion of these profiles in a statistical model with the serological and classical markers improved the predictive accuracy of the model significantly.\n\u201cWe performed statistical and bioinformatic analyses of the genomic data which led to enhanced discrimination of which patients are likely to progress to complicated disease,\u201d said Greg Gibson, a professor in the Georgia Tech School of Biological Sciences and one of the paper\u2019s co-authors. \u201cThe involvement of TNF-alpha signaling in progression to stricturing disease is consistent with the overall finding that these are the patients who respond to TNF-alpha therapy.\u201d\nThis seminal work and its discovery represent over $10 million investment by the Crohn\u2019s & Colitis Foundation, nearly 10 years of work, and collaborative team effort. Dr. Thomas Walters from the Hospital for Sick Kids, Canada shares lead authorship with Drs. Kugathasan and Denson. In addition, Dr. Jeffrey Hyams (Connecticut Children\u2019s Medical Center), and Dr. Marla Dubinsky (Mount Sinai Hospital, New York) share authorship.\nAbout the RISK Stratification Study\nThe RISK Stratification Study enrolled 1,800 patients from 28 clinics, with a focus on 913 children with Crohn\u2019s disease enrolled at diagnosis and complication-free following 90 days after diagnosis. This 36-month prospective inception cohort study included well documented clinical, demographic, and biological sample collection every six months on all patients for three years with continuing follow up for five years.\nAbout the Crohn's & Colitis Foundation\nThe Crohn's & Colitis Foundation is the largest non-profit, voluntary, health organization dedicated to finding cures for inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). The Foundation\u2019s mission is to cure Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, and to improve the quality of life of children and adults who suffer from these diseases. The Foundation works to fulfill its mission by funding research; providing educational resources for patients and their families, medical professionals, and the public; and furnishing supportive services for those afflicted with IBD.
