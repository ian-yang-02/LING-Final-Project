Along with eight bowling lanes, Tech Rec is home to billiards tables, table tennis, air hockey, and foosball. The entire facility is a resource for students on campus who need a break from coursework and classes, and is conveniently located in the center of campus. However, with over 50,000 visitors in the past year, repairs were necessary. Due to the\u00a0amount of traffic that the bowling alley gets, the lanes and gutters were beginning to show signs of wear and tear.\nThe Tech Rec team presented a proposal for renovation to the Georgia Tech Student Government Association, who agreed that a makeover was needed in order for Tech Rec to continue to serve students and faculty alike. The Student Government Association helped direct the student activity funds to restoring Tech Rec to its former glory.\n\u201cThe old Tech Rec gutters were falling apart as they were the original gutters from 1970,\u201d said Teresa Weimann, Associate Program Director and Tech Rec Supervisor. \u201cWith the increased usage of the bowling lanes in Tech Rec, it was important to update these as soon as possible. I was excited to have the funding from SGA to install new gutters. These new gutters are made to be sturdy and long-lasting and will look great for many, many years to come.\u201d\nThanks to the Student Government Association\u2019s assistance, Tech Rec now has newly installed lanes, gutters, and ball returns ready for students to use. It\u2019s a great chance for students to visit to try them out and embody Tech Rec\u2019s motto: \u201cStudy hard, play harder!\u201d\nFor more details on Tech Rec and weekly specials like FREE PLAY MONDAY, visit https://studentcenter.gatech.edu/tech-rec .\nAdditional Images\nContact\nTeresa Weimann\nteresa.weimann@stucen.gatech.edu\nEmail\ntechrec@stucen.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
