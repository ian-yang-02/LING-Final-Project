Milton Stewart School of Industrial &amp; Systems Engineering, mentors fourth- and fifth-grade Girl Scouts by exploring STEM and learning key character values.\nFeb 27, 2017\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nWhen five Georgia Tech students \u2014 Brenna Fromayan, Natalie Leonard, Wendy Ng, Anokhi Patel, and Kaitlin Rizk \u2014 co-founded Stempower in 2014, they wanted to boost the flagging self-confidence of young women in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields, despite their natural interest and ability.\n\u201cAs women pursuing STEM degrees from Georgia Tech, Stempower was personally relevant to all of us from the beginning,\u201d remarked Leonard, an undergraduate in the School of Psychology. \u201cThe majority of the co-founders had a role model who provided direct encouragement. Yet for girls growing up without a role model, where can they turn for support? We knew that we needed Stempower to fill this gap.\u201d\nStempower is a mentoring program offered by Georgia Tech women students that encourages girls to explore STEM and learn key character values. Partnering with the Girl Scouts of Greater Atlanta, two Stempower mentors meet bimonthly with fourth- and fifth-grade girls in a given troop. Each meeting is comprised of a different STEM activity \u2014 building rockets, making circuits, or learning to code \u2014 paired with a character lesson like encouraging questions and valuing mistakes.\n\u201cResearch shows that young women start losing interest in math and science during middle school. We created Stempower to mentor elementary school girls in STEM, thereby increasing their self-confidence and providing relatable role models,\u201d said Rizk, an undergraduate in the H. Milton Stewart School of Industrial & Systems Engineering.\nThree years later, after initial support from the Grand Challenges Living and Learning Community, Stempower has become one of the outreach initiatives of the Center for the Study of Women, Science, and Technology (WST), with eight Tech mentors and 100 Girl Scout mentees in the U.S. Stempower was also launched at Uganda\u2019s Makerere University after Rizk witnessed similar women\u2019s empowerment issues during a service project a few years ago.\n\u201cAfter mentoring for years, I still clearly remember my first meeting with a troop,\u201d Leonard reflected. \u201cThe meeting opened with a broad discussion about women scientists and engineers. Upon mentioning Mae Jemison, the first African-American woman astronaut, girls raised their hands and jumped up and down for the opportunity to tell me what they already knew about her. After this first meeting, I walked away impressed by their knowledge and energy and encouraged that supporting these girls through Stempower would help each of them thrive.\u201d\nAccording to Carol Colatrella, professor in the School of Literature, Media, and Communication, assistant dean for graduate studies, and co-director of WST, \u201cWe are excited to support Stempower as their efforts align with WST\u2019s mission and goals to promote the recruitment, retention, and advancement of women students and faculty in STEM fields.\u201d\nIf interested in becoming a mentor, contact\nstempower.gt@gmail.com .
