However, that strapping can cut workers on their arms, hands and faces, said Hannah Larson, who graduated in December with a degree in mechanical engineering.\nPolyester woven strapping would be a safer and stronger solution, but the material was designed to work on flat services. The challenge became how to apply this strapping to tension loads that have round or irregular shapes, said Michael Bailey, who also graduated in December with a degree in mechanical engineering.\nThe answer is\nTensionr , a tool designed to safely tension woven polyester strapping around objects regardless of shape or size.\nThe device, developed by Bailey, Larson and three other recent mechanical engineering graduates, is one of six competing for the\nInVenture Prize , Georgia Tech\u2019s annual invention competition. Winners will be announced March 14.\nThe other team members are: Austin Forgey from McDonough; Lauren Perrine from Potomac, Md.; and Brandon Will from Circle Pines, Minn.\nThe group won best mechanical engineering team during the 2017 Capstone Expo. The project was then called\nBlankity Blank\nand the sponsor was Skyline Steel.\n\u201cWhile we\u2019ve all graduated we realized the scale of this problem goes beyond just one industry and that it\u2019s important to have a safer option,\u201d said Larson, who is from Roswell. \u201cWe believe we have a unique solution for any application.\u201d\nTensionr will protect more than 20 million workers at their jobs every day, the team said. And by pairing a differential with a dual barrel tensioning system, Tensionr evenly supplies the necessary amount of tension for safer product handling, they said.\nThe group formed a company, Dual Strapping Solutions LLC, and are continuing to fine tune the design.\n\u201cWe\u2019re all strong mechanical engineers but we have a large learning curve with the entrepreneurial side,\u201d said Bailey, who is from Canton. \u201cThe InVenture Prize is an additional catalyst to jumpstart our business.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nGeorgia Tech InVenture Prize\nContact\nLaura Diamond\nMedia Relations\u00a0 laura.diamond@gatech.edu\n404-660-2927\nEmail\nlaura.diamond@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
