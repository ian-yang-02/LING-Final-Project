The fellowships will cover tuition for 18 public policy graduate students over three years and provide a stipend to support them during a year-long internship with a governmental, nonprofit, or private-sector organization in D.C.\n\u201cThis gift is absolutely transformative,\u201d said\nCassidy R. Sugimoto , Tom and Marie Patton Chair in the School of Public Policy. \u201cThis experience expands the School\u2019s profile in D.C, but more importantly will allow these students to build networks, earn a seat at the table in Washington, and utilize the strong education they\u2019ve received here at Georgia Tech in future policymaking.\u201d\nLike the existing\nGTDC\nprogram for Tech undergraduates, students chosen for the Byers Family Fellowship will benefit from opportunities to connect with alumni and policymakers in Washington, gain valuable work experience, integrate scholarship and policymaking, and explore public service as a possible career path.\nThe graduate program will focus on climate change, one of the greatest threats to global society.\n\u201cThese public policy graduate students will bring their Georgia Tech training and discipline to government agencies, Congress, and administrations to advocate for innovation in regulations, legislation, and decisions that can have high-leverage effects in energy and sustainability going forward,\u201d Byers said. \u201cOur family has been very impressed with the achievements and impact of Professor Marilyn Brown and others at Tech.\u201d\nGraduate students in the\nSchool of Public Policy\nwho are studying sustainable energy and environmental management issues will be eligible to apply for the highly selective fellowships beginning in January 2024.\nFor more information about making a gift in support of graduate fellowships, contact Senior Associate Vice President for Major Gifts and Next Generation Philanthropy\nJim Hall\nat\njim.hall@dev.gatech.edu .\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nGeorgia Tech Celebrates the Launch of GTDC in Washington, D.C.\nContact\nMichael Pearson\nIvan Allen College of Liberal Arts\nEmail\nmichael.pearson@iac.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
