As the world gets up again, groggily, like a punch-drunk fighter, it\u2019s become increasingly clear that this coronavirus changed everything in our society. And it\u2019s forcing leadership to consider new and evolving paths forward.\nIn the U.S., one of the more challenging and complicated post-pandemic deliberations is around national security and how to respond to the next infectious disease run amok. Georgia Institute of Technology researcher Margaret Kosal addresses the issue in her study,\n\u201cHow Covid-19 is Reshaping U.S. National Security Policy,\u201d\npublished recently in the journal\nPolitics and the Life Sciences .\nThe study was inspired, in part, by Kosal\u2019s participation in National Academy of Sciences (NAS) committees focused on reducing bioterrorism and chemical terrorism.\n\u201cMy work with NAS prompted me to think about how we are designing our strategies and what is driving these choices,\u201d said Kosal, associate professor in the\nSam Nunn School of International Affairs\nwithin the\nIvan Allen College of Liberal Arts .\nIn the wake of the pandemic, the U.S. is actively changing part of its national security enterprise. Kosal researched Department of Defense documents, among other sources, and noted that recent trends are moving policy in a different direction. Directing the national response to infectious disease is a task that has moved from public health into the domain of national security.\nIt\u2019s a process called securitization. And based on Kosal\u2019s findings, the current trend, \u201cturns the securitization debate on its head.\u201d That is, instead of treating an emerging infectious disease, like Covid-19, as a national security problem, there has been a noticeable shift to treat biological weapons and bioterrorism as a public health problem.\nIt\u2019s not quite the \u201cpublic healthization\u201d of biodefense programs, according to Kosal, \u201cbut rather, it is an intermingling of the two, especially in the context of critical aspects of politics and warfare.\u201d\nAnd that presents a potentially confusing problem for national defense and security where clarity and specificity are most important. The use of biological weapons, or an act of bioterrorism, \u201care fundamentally political decisions, choices of warfare,\u201d Kosal said. \u201cBut a disease is not something that depends on political will, and it isn\u2019t influenced by power.\u201d\nAn emerging infectious disease like Covid-19 is clearly a public health issue and should be treated as such, falling under the purview of the National Institutes of Health or Centers for Disease Control, she added, then emphasized, \u201cbut biological weapons and bioterrorism should not be treated like infectious diseases. They are different in very important ways.\u201d\nThe Danger of Bad Information\nComplicating any national security discussion, according to Kosal, are misinformation and disinformation, and the resultant erosion of confidence in institutions, \u201cincluding but not limited to governments,\u201d she wrote. \u201c This is a missing aspect of the current discussions about\nU.S. policies to reduce biological threats, whether from states or terrorists, in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic.\u201d\nThe pandemic revealed a significant weakness in governments\u2019 ability to adequately address the problem of misinformation and disinformation, a failure that manifested in conspiracy theories and the flouting of public health recommendations.\nKosal cited numerous articles and studies that demonstrate how a global crisis opened the door to distortion of the facts, as extremist groups worked to leverage fears and anxieties, usually to broaden the appeal of their own narratives. Some of the more radical included: an al-Qaeda faction that claimed Covid, \u201cis a hidden soldier sent by God to fight his enemies; a leader of Boko Haram faction who told followers the pandemic was, \u201cdivine punishment for the world.\u201d\nKosal observed, too, that economic hardships and other impacts of the pandemic have made it easier for extremist groups to exploit the fragility of weak governments, while gaining followers and resources, and putting a halt to peace-building efforts in some regions. Technology, like the content-generating algorithms used in social media, has helped spread wrong information, too.\n\u201cThe misinformation and disinformation problem is serious because it leads to this loss of confidence in government,\u201d Kosal said. \u201cThat confidence is crucial in the context of disease and in responding to bioterrorism.\u201d\nUltimately, she hopes her study will have an impact on defense policymakers who are helping to form and clarify our nation\u2019s security plans.\n\u201cI\u2019d really like to see more recognition of the political piece,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s critically important for our counter proliferation efforts and for our efforts to reduce the threat of these weapons more broadly.\u201d\nPlacing extremist ideologies and manufactured weapons in a public health context, she argued, lessens the emphasis on the political will and the importance of the relevant strategic choices necessary to address a potential conflict.\nAnd the nature of conflict, she said, \u201cis all about people and power. Diseases don\u2019t care really care about those things.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nContact\nWriter:\nJerry Grillo\nEmail\njerry.grillo@ibb.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
