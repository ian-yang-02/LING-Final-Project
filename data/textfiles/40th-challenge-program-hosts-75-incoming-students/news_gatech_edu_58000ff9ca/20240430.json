Second, history will acknowledge all of you for doing all the right things and staying focused on your academic goals that helped make Challenge 2020 successful in spite of the odds against us,\u201d he continued. \u201cEven though Challenge 2020 was shortened by a couple of weeks, I\u2019m confident we accomplished all of our important goals and objects for the program.\u201d\n\u201cChallenge has been one of the best experiences of my life,\u201d said Cameron Heard, an incoming biomedical engineering major. \u201cThe academic courses here were very rigorous and I feel like they\u2019ve prepared me for the courses I\u2019ll see at Tech. Most importantly, I feel Challenge has helped me grow overall as a person.\u201d\nIn addition to the academic rigor, participants took part in virtual dinners with corporate partners; performed community service activities; participated for a scavenger hunt; made new friends during the opening weekend cookout; and battled the rapids of the Ocoee River during the annual white water rafting excursion \u2013 all while practicing safe measures in the wake of the pandemic.\n\u201cWe implemented additional measures for Challenge outside of what many of our participants were used to practicing on their own, so naturally there was a period of adjustment,\u201d said Jelani Liddell, OMED\u2019s assistant\u00a0director of Outreach Initiatives and director of the program. \u201cOur Challenge counselors did a great job monitoring and reminding students of safety protocols. And our participants understood the precautions and adjusted very well to our modified program.\u201d\nSome of the added precautions were: requesting participants to self-isolate prior to arrival on campus; single-occupancy housing on campus; restricted travel off campus; required isolation upon non-essential off-campus travel; required face coverings in all public spaces; body temperature monitoring; designated isolation rooms; and physical distancing guidelines.\n\u201cOur hybrid-program model allowed us to maintain safe distancing while still maintaining the engagement dynamic which consisted of participant social interaction and peer relationship development,\u201d added Liddell. \u201cWe wanted to ensure that physical distancing did not assume\nsocial\ndistancing. We believe we were able to accomplish that this year.\u201d\nThe closing program was conducted across two ceremonies to account for physical distancing. Awards for most improved and exemplary academic performance were presented to six students in the program's\u00a0computer science, mathematics, and chemistry courses.\nCorporate sponsor BP joined with OMED to support the recognition of 35 students for outstanding academic performance,\u00a0including 18 who earned a 4.0 GPA during the program.\n\u201cComing into college, I wasn\u2019t sure what to expect,\u201d said Nathnael Aberra, a computer science major, ahead of the closing. \u201cBut Challenge has put my worries to rest. I feel great that I got the opportunity to give myself this head start at Tech.\u201d\nThis year\u2019s closing ceremonies also included the presentation of a new award on behalf of Tech's Center of Engineering Education and Diversity (CEED): the National Action Council for Minorities in Engineering (NACME) offered awards to five Challenge students eligible to receive an annual scholarship. \u201cYou are an impressive, proven, and resilient group,\"\u00a0said Sybrina Atwaters, director of OMED and academic coordinator of Challenge. \u201cDuring unprecedented times, this cohort has confronted every challenge placed before them, collectively earned over $30,000 in incentives for the upcoming Fall semester, and established a new Challenge academic record.\"\nThe 2020 program hosted participants from seven states with an ethnicity breakdown of 59% Black/African American, 32% Latinx, 4% Asian, and 4% two or more ethnicities. Student participants majored in more than a dozen\u00a0areas\u00a0of study.\nThis year's\u00a0program was supported by corporate sponsors BP, Eaton, and Procter & Gamble.\nTo learn more about the Challenge program, visit\u00a0 omed.gatech.edu/programs/challenge .\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nOMED: Educational Services Welcomes Largest Challenge Program Cohort in 39 Year\u2026\nContact\nCourtney Hill\nCommunications Manager\nInstitute Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion\ncourtney.hill@gatech.edu\nEmail\ncourtney.hill@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
