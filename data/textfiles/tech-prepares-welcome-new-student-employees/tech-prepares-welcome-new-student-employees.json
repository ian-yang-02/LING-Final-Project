To help them complete the hiring and onboarding process, the ASC will host the annual Student Employee Onboarding event Aug.\u202f16-18 on the third floor of the Clough Undergraduate Learning Commons. The event is open to all newly hired graduate and undergraduate student employees who need assistance completing their in-person onboarding requirements (e.g., Form I-9 verification and notarized Georgia Security Questionnaire).\nAll student employees must complete all steps of the onboarding process, including the in-person requirements, and be hired in OneUSG Connect before beginning work.\nNew student employees should visit\nohr.gatech.edu/student-onboarding\nfor step-by-step instructions on completing the onboarding process, including\nrequired documentation .\nSelecting a Time Slot\nEmail communications will be sent directly to newly hired student employees who have already completed the online Student Hiring Packet ( step 1 of the onboarding process ) but\u202fwho still need to complete the in-person onboarding requirement. These students will have the ability to\u202fselect a 30-minute time slot between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m. on Aug. 16, 17, or 18.\nNeed to Complete In-Person Onboarding but Cannot Attend this Event?\nIf you are a newly hired student and need to complete your Form I-9 and/or notarized Georgia Security Questionnaire, but cannot attend this in-person event, contact the ASC for assistance about onboarding and all questions related to working at Georgia Tech.\nCall 404.385.1111 to schedule an appointment at the ASC.\nSchedule a walk-up appointment online\u202f here .\nSubmit an online Request for Help ticket\u202f here .

Student employees who have\u202falready completed in-person onboarding\u202fat the ASC, located at 500 Tech Parkway, do not need to attend the Student Employee Onboarding event.\nOther Important Notes\nThe Student Employee Onboarding event is not an opportunity for students to find a campus job.
