This allows tracking of the honey bees so they know which bees are coming and going.\n\u201cKind of like mini BuzzCards.\u201d\nThe group is interested in the mating behavior of bees in urban areas.\u00a0Genetic diversity among male bees in honey bee mating areas can lead to stronger, healthier honey bee colonies.\n\u201cWe tag male bees with RFID chips, which allows us to know how old they are when they start taking mating flights, and how weather, pollution, nutrition, and pesticide exposures affect their behavior.\u00a0We can also correlate this behavior with genetic markers,\u201d\u00a0Leavey explains.\nThis work was inspired by Julia Mahood, an Atlanta-area master beekeeper and founder of the citizen science project mapmydca.com.\u00a0She is identifying honey bee mating areas (also known as drone congregation areas) using mechanical drones.\nMany wild flowering plant species along with food crops in our ecosystem depend on pollinators and it is crucial to learn as much as we can about honey bees, and all pollinators, to safeguard their future and ours.\nTo learn more about the Urban Honey Bee Project visit\nbees.gatech.edu .\nAdditional Images\nContact\nEvan Atkinson, Institute Communications\nEmail\neatkinson6@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
