The program assists traditionally underrepresented students who disproportionately have not received sustained career preparation. It also supports those who have faced historical institutional barriers that have hindered their full preparation for career success.\nThe Alliance hosted an inaugural three-week Career Immersion Summer Residential Program from May 16 to June 5. Hosted by the Georgia Tech\nCareer Center\nand Institute Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion\nOffice of Minority Educational Development (OMED) , the campus welcomed 24 student participants for an on-campus experience full of professional development workshops, interview and branding courses, and off-campus experiential learning\u202fopportunities\u202fsuch as\u202finternships, co-ops, shadowing apprenticeships, and student assistantships. Participants also received one-on-one career coaching and mentoring from corporate partners to assist them with identifying ways to align their passions with their majors and desired career paths.\u202fPart of the sponsorship for the immersion program came from an OMED grant awarded by the P&G Higher Education Grant Program.\n\u201cThe ideation behind the Career Alliance and its immersion program emerged from different anchors, yet converged strategically to launch an innovative, equity-focused, student data-driven initiative,\u201d said Sybrina Atwaters, OMED director. \u201cIt not only brought together faculty, staff, and students, but also alumni, corporate leaders, and vendors from more than eight Georgia Tech units, 16 companies, three Tech alumni affinity groups, and seven local businesses. The immersion program is a notable example of how units at Georgia Tech align to champion collaboration in serving all students equitably while meeting institutional goals.\u201d\nThe Career Alliance was launched in spring 2021, inspired through Georgia Tech's participation in the\nTaskforce on Higher Education and Opportunity\nwhere 38 academic institutions across the nation have been collaborating to prepare the nation\u2019s \u201cmost vulnerable college students for\u202fsuccess and stability in\u202fthe post-Covid-19 pandemic economy.\u201d The Taskforce represents 2.5 million students at two-year and four-year public and private institutions including The University of California, Los Angeles; The University of Oregon; Virginia Tech; and Atlanta's Spelman College.\nSonia Alvarez-Robinson, executive director of Georgia Tech Strategic Consulting, serves as Georgia Tech's Taskforce representative. She, along with Atwaters and James Barricelli, executive director of the Career Center, form the Career Alliance's steering committee.\n\u201cI am the first in my family to attend college\nand\nenter into a skilled-career field,\u201d said rising third-year student Jose Luis Miranda-Hernandez, an architecture major. \u201cThe Summer Residential Program has elevated and prepared me. I\u00a0now feel confident in my abilities to communicate, network, self-advocate, and grow as a student and future professional.\u201d\nParticipant Malina Hy, an industrial engineering and neuroscience major, said, \u201cComing into the program, I didn\u2019t know what to expect, but I knew I needed to learn how to navigate the real world \u2014 and fast, since I'll be a fourth-year student this fall.\n\u201cThis program was more than just workshops, networking, and mentorships,\u201d Hy continued. \u201cWhile we learned the hard skills of how to build a resume and prepare for interviews, we also learned how to be inclusive, curious, and resilient.\u201d\nMarkyta Holton, OMED program and operations manager, added, \u201cThe foundation of the immersion program was pinned on building the mind, beliefs, and skill sets of each student individually, and connecting them to opportunities that will become the foundation of their careers. This first cohort not only developed workforce development skills, but they also created lifelong bonds with each other, their mentors, Georgia Tech alumni, and various community partners.\u201d\nThe Career Immersion Summer Residential Program capped with an event at the Georgia Tech Hotel featuring reflections from participants and corporate leaders, and an awards presentation by Holton and peer-career student leaders Bijee Jackson and Vinez Lyde. The evening also included remarks by Alvarez-Robinson, Atwaters, and Tech President \u00c1ngel Cabrera.\nThe Career Alliance @ Georgia Tech will continue through 2023 and will measure participant progress after completion.\nFor more information, visit\nomed.gatech.edu/career-alliance-georgia-tech .\nAdditional Images\nContact\nCourtney Hill\nCommunications Manager\nInstitute Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion\ncourtney.hill@gatech.edu\nEmail\ncourtney.hill@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
