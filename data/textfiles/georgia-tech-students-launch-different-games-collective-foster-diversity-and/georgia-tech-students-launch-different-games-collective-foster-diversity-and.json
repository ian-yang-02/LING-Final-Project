Previous panels and workshops have explored a range of topics \u2014 from games and mental health to global game development. The fourth annual Different Games Conference will occur April 8-9, 2016, at NYU\u2019s Polytechnic School of Engineering in Brooklyn. Within two years, the Different Games Conference has doubled in attendance, speakers, and \u201carcade\u201d games. Last year\u2019s conference featured three programmatic tracks with 60 speakers and 42 playable games in the arcade. Six Georgia Tech students were among the nearly 300 attendees from more than half a dozen countries who participated. When Schoemann came to Georgia Tech as a Ph.D. student, she teamed with Michael Vogel, a graduate student in Georgia Tech\u2019s Digital Media program, and other members to create the Different Games Collective, a grassroots volunteer-run collaborative that creates community resources and events to support marginalized voices in the development of do-it-yourself and independent games. The Different Games Collective encompasses the newly launched Atlanta-based Dear Games, which is a feminist games collaboration with the Georgia Tech Game Studio that supports diverse participation in video game development and culture at the South\u2019s oldest independent feminist bookstore, Charis Books. \u201cDear Games was started for the Georgia Tech community, and it is our hope that in the next few years, we will get more Georgia Tech students and faculty involved in both Dear Games and the Different Games Conference,\u201d explained Vogel. According to Aby Parsons, director of Tech\u2019s LGBTQIA Resource Center and one of the supporters of the Different Games Collective, \u201cSarah, Michael, and their team members have helped to increase Georgia Tech\u2019s presence in the gaming community, especially at a time when diversity in gaming and digital media is a huge issue across the nation.\u201d Georgia Tech students and game designers interested in showcasing their games at the 2016 Different Games Conference arcade can submit an application by Jan. 22, 2016, at\nwww.2016.differentgames.org .
