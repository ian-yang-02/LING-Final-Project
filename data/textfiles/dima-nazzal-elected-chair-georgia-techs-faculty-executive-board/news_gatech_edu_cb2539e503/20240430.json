Milton Stewart School of Industrial and Systems Engineering, has been elected as the new chair of the\nFaculty Executive Board .\nNazzal's election follows years of service and leadership within the Georgia Tech community. A distinguished alumna, she earned her Ph.D. in Industrial Engineering from Georgia Tech in 2006. After Nazzal's return to campus as faculty, she quickly became known for her instructional excellence and received the Curriculum Innovation Award in 2021. In addition to her commitment to student success, Nazzal is known as an advocate for faculty, as demonstrated by her work as part of the campus Covid-19 Taskforce. As chair of the Faculty Executive Board, Nazzal leads the faculty in governance of itself, the curriculum, and Georgia Tech students.\n\"Dima's election comes at a pivotal time for our academic community,\u201d said Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs,\u00a0Steve McLaughlin. \u201cThe charge of faculty governance is to represent the faculty\u2019s interests and to work hand-in-hand\u00a0with\u00a0our administration to make Tech a better place for everyone. Her wealth of experience and commitment to faculty and academic success positions\u00a0her well to lead the Faculty Executive Board\u00a0as they seek\u00a0to address the\u00a0most\u00a0pressing\u00a0issues.\u201d\nGeorgia Tech, as an institution of the University System of Georgia, operates under the model of shared governance, as per Board of Regents policy. This model empowers the faculty with certain rights that enable them to fulfill responsibilities for their own governance, the governance of students, and the maintenance of high educational standards. This means that the faculty community has a governmental voice in processes and decisions that define the academic experience for all of Georgia Tech.\n\u201cThe academic experience looks different than it did even five years ago,\u201d said Nazzal. \u201cWith the many new challenges our faculty are facing both in the classroom and in their research, it is more important than ever that our perspective be present in campus decision making. My hope is that during my tenure as chair of the Faculty Executive Board, Georgia Tech\u2019s faculty will be represented clearly in decisions that impact everything from the classroom to campus life and beyond.\u201d\nFormer Chair of the Faculty Executive Board and current Executive Chief of Staff and Associate Provost, Karie Davis-Nozemack, remarked, \"I am delighted to pass the torch to Dima. Her election is a testament to the strong and visionary leadership within the faculty. I have full confidence in her ability to guide the Board and contribute significantly to the academic governance of our institution.\"\nWriter: Brittany Aiello, Faculty Communications Program Manager,\u00a0Organizational, Academic, and Research Communications\nRelated links\nGeorgia Tech Faculty Governance\nContact\nOffice of the Provost\nEmail\nprovostsoffice@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
