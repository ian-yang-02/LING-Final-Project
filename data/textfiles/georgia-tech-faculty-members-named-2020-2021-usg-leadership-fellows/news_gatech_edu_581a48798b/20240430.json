As subject matter experts, the three faculty members will provide meaningful support to colleagues systemwide.\n\u201cThis group represents the best faculty and staff from USG institutions across the state, and I congratulate them on their selection,\u201d Chancellor Steve Wrigley said. \u201cTheir knowledge and willingness to serve will help the system continue to focus on our top priorities of being more efficient, more affordable and graduating more students.\u201d\nOver a one-year term, Fellows will share their expertise through workshops for USG groups outside their home institutions. During the COVID-19 pandemic, workshops may be delivered virtually. Topics are wide-ranging and can vary from coaching skills for academic leaders and leadership ethics to constructive conflict engagement and change management.\n\u201cThere is a lot of expertise within the University System of Georgia,\u201d said Stuart Rayfield, vice chancellor for Leadership and Institutional Development. \u201cThe entire system benefits when we tap the leadership and knowledge from USG institutions, and it\u2019s a tremendous opportunity for the fellows to grow and develop. It\u2019s a win-win.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nContact\nAaron Diamant\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
