As the glacier flows into the ocean, it becomes sea ice and drives up sea-level. Thwaites Glacier's ice is flowing particularly fast, and some researchers believe it may have already tipped into instability or be near that point, though this has not yet been established.\u00a0Credit: NASA/James Yungel\nJul 08, 2019\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nImages of vanishing Arctic ice are\u00a0jarring, but its\u00a0potential contributions to sea level rise are no match for Antarctica\u2019s, even if receding southern ice is less eye-catching. Now,\na study says\nthat instability hidden within Antarctic ice is likely to accelerate its flow into the ocean and push sea level up at a more rapid pace than previously expected.\nIn the last six years, five closely observed Antarctic glaciers have doubled their rate of ice loss,\u00a0 according to the National Science Foundation . At least one, Thwaites Glacier, modeled for the new study, will likely\u00a0succumb\u00a0to this\u00a0 instability , a volatile process that pushes ice into the ocean fast.\nHow much ice the glacier will shed in the coming 50 to 800 years can\u2019t exactly be projected due to unpredictable fluctuations in climate and the need for more data. But researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology, NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), and the University of Washington have factored the instability into 500 ice flow simulations for Thwaites with refined calculations.\nThe scenarios diverged strongly from each other but together pointed to the eventual triggering of the instability, which will be described in the Q&A\u00a0below. Even if global warming were to later stop, the instability would keep pushing ice out to sea at an enormously accelerated rate over the coming centuries.\nAnd this is if ice melt due to warming oceans does not get worse than it is today. The study used\u00a0present-day ice melt rates because the researchers were interested in the instability factor in itself.\nGlacier tipping point\n\u201cIf you trigger this instability, you don\u2019t need to continue to force the ice sheet by cranking up temperatures. It will keep going by itself, and that\u2019s the worry,\u201d said Alex Robel, who led the study and is an\u00a0 assistant professor in Georgia Tech\u2019s School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences . \u201cClimate variations will still be important after that tipping point because they will determine how fast the ice will move.\u201d\n\u201cAfter reaching the tipping point, Thwaites Glacier could lose all of its ice in a period of 150 years. That would make for a sea level rise of about half a meter (1.64 feet),\u201d said\u00a0 NASA JPL scientist Helene Seroussi , who collaborated on the study. For comparison, current sea level is 20 cm ( nearly 8 inches ) above pre-global warming levels and is blamed for increased coastal flooding.\nThe researchers published their\nstudy in the journal\u00a0 Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences \u00a0on Monday, July 8, 2019. The research was funded by the National Science Foundation and NASA.\nThe study also showed that the instability makes forecasting more uncertain, leading to the broad spread of scenarios. This is particularly relevant to the challenge of\u00a0 engineering against flood dangers .\n\u201cYou want to engineer critical infrastructure to be resistant against the upper bound of potential sea level scenarios a hundred years from now,\u201d Robel said. \u201cIt can mean building your water treatment plants and nuclear reactors for the absolute worst-case scenario, which could be two or three feet of sea level rise from Thwaites Glacier alone, so it\u2019s a huge difference.\u201d\nQ&A\nWhy is Antarctic ice the big driver of sea level rise?\nUnderstanding the instability is easier with this background information:\nArctic sea ice is already floating in water. Readers will likely remember that 90% of an iceberg\u2019s mass is underwater, and that when its ice melts, the volume shrinks, resulting in no change in sea level.\nBut when ice masses long supported by land, like mountain glaciers, melt, the water that ends up in the ocean adds to sea level. Antarctica holds the most land-supported ice, even if the bulk of that land is seabed holding up just part of the ice\u2019s mass, while water holds up part of it. Also, Antarctica is an ice leviathan.\n\u201cThere\u2019s almost eight times as much ice in the Antarctic ice sheet as there is in the\u00a0 Greenland ice sheet \u00a0and 50 times as much as in all the mountain glaciers in the world,\u201d Robel said.\nWhat is that \u2018instability\u2019 underneath the ice?\nThe line between where the ice sheet rests on the seafloor and where it extends over water is called\u00a0 the grounding line . In spots where the bedrock underneath the ice behind the grounding line slopes down, deepening as it moves inland, the instability can kick in.\nThat would look like this: On deeper beds, ice moves faster because water is giving it a little more lift, to begin with, then warmer ocean water can hollow out the bottom of the ice, adding water to the ocean. But, more importantly, the ice above the hollow loses land contact and flows faster out to sea.\n\u201cOnce ice is past the grounding line and only\u00a0over water, it\u2019s\u00a0 contributing to sea level \u00a0because buoyancy is holding it up more than it was before,\u201d Robel said. \u201cIce flows out into the\u00a0 floating ice shelf \u00a0and melts or breaks off as icebergs.\u201d\n\u201cThe process becomes self-perpetuating,\u201d Seroussi said.\n[Ready for graduate school?\u00a0 Here's how to apply to Georgia Tech. ]\nHow did the researchers integrate instability into sea level forecasting?\nThe researchers borrowed\nmath from statistical physics\nthat calculates what haphazard influences do to predictability in a physical system, like ice flow, acted upon by outside forces, like temperature changes. They applied the math to data-packed simulations of possible future fates of Thwaites Glacier, located in West Antarctica, where ice loss is most.\nThey made another\u00a0surprising discovery. Normally, when climate conditions fluctuate strongly, Antarctic ice evens out the effects. Ice flow may increase but gradually, not wildly, but the instability produced the opposite effect in the simulations.\n\u201cThe system didn\u2019t damp out the fluctuations, it actually amplified them. It increased the chances of rapid ice loss,\u201d Robel said.\nHow rapid is \u2018rapid\u2019 sea level rise and when will we feel it?\nThe study\u2019s time scale was centuries, as is common for sea level studies. In the simulations, Thwaites Glacier colossal ice loss kicked in after 600 years, but it could come sooner\u00a0if oceans warm and as the instability reveals more of its secrets.\n\u201cIt could happen in the next 200 to 600 years. It depends on the bedrock topography under the ice, and we don\u2019t know it in great detail yet,\u201d Seroussi said.\nSo far, Antarctica and Greenland have lost a small fraction of their ice, but already, shoreline infrastructures face challenges from\u00a0 increased tidal flooding \u00a0and storm surges. Sea level is expected to rise by up to two feet by the end of this century.\nFor about 2,000 years until the late 1800s, sea level held steady, then it began climbing,\u00a0 according to the Smithsonian Institution . The annual rate of sea level rise has roughly doubled since 1990.\nAlso watch VIDEO :\nEasy explanation of climate change\u2019s sea level threat and the grand challenge of engineering against it by G.
