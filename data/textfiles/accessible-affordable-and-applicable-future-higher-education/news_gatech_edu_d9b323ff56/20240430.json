It\u2019s going to have to change,\u201d President G.P. \u201cBud\u201d Peterson said. \u201cWhat is that new model of higher education going to look like?\u201d\nPeterson noted three possibilities at the conclusion of the discussion. First, education will move away from a calendar-driven model to a knowledge-based one. Second, student success will need new definitions beyond attending college for four years to earn a bachelor\u2019s degree. And third, knowledge isn\u2019t just held by teachers. Students are teaching and learning from one another as well.\nProvost Rafael L.
