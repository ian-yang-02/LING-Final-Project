Credit:\u00a0Kari Greer/USFS Gila National Forest via NASA\nJun 14, 2017\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nSummer wildfires boost air pollution considerably more than previously believed.\nNaturally burning timber and brush launch what are called\nfine particles\ninto the air at a rate three times as high as levels officially noted in emissions inventories at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency,\naccording to a new study . This does not mean that burning biomass produces more pollution than it previously did, but the new research makes clearer how much and what pollutants are inside a wildfire plume.\nFine particles, the microscopic, sooty specks that form\naerosols , are a hazard to human health, particularly to the lungs and heart.\n\u201cBurning biomass produces lots of pollution. These are really bad aerosols to breathe from a health point of view,\u201d said researcher\nGreg Huey from the Georgia Institute of Technology , which led the study. The research also describes other chemicals in wildfire smoke, some never before measured, and it will likely raise\u00a0the EPA estimated annual emission of\nfine particles, or particulate\u00a0matter,\nin the western United States significantly.\nThe previous\nEPA\ndata had been based on plume samples taken in controlled burns ignited by forestry professionals. Measuring naturally occurring plumes so thoroughly, from the sky, directly in the thick of a wildfire had not been possible before this study.\nPlunging into plumes\nUnique research missions deployed planes to plow through the plumes of three major wildfires, including the 2013 Rim Fire,\nthe third-largest wildfire in California history. \u00a0 An ensemble of instruments bristling from the flanks of NASA and U.S. Department of Energy aircraft allowed teams of researchers on board to measure chemicals and particles in real time and cull masses of data, which the new study is based on.\n\u201cWe actually went to measure, right above the fire, what was coming out,\u201d said Huey, a professor in Georgia Tech\u2019s School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences, which he also chairs.\nBob Yokelson, a professor of atmospheric chemistry at the University of Montana\nhas taken a leadership role in many aspects of the research and was in a group of about 20 scientists who selected the instruments to be installed on the large NASA plane. \u201cWe really didn\u2019t have to go without anything we wanted really badly,\u201d he said. Yokelson also helped design the flight paths.\nGeorgia Tech had instruments and scientists on the NASA DC-8 plane. Researchers associated with a total of more than a dozen universities and organizations participated in data collection or analysis. The scientists published their findings on June 14 in the\nJournal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres .\n\u201cThis paper is expected to serve as a basis for the next NASA fire chemical monitoring mission,\u201d Huey said.\nRefinery in flames\nMethanol, benzene, ozone precursors and other noxious emissions collected from wildfire plumes may make it sound like an oil refinery went up in flames. That\u2019s not so far-fetched, as oil and other fossil fuels derive from ancient biomass.\n\u201cYou can see the smoke, and it\u2019s dark for a reason,\u201d Huey said. \u201cWhen you go measuring wildfires, you get everything there is to measure. You start to wonder sometimes what all is in there.\u201d\nThe study found many organic chemicals in the wildfire plumes, and technological advancements allowed them to detect certain nitrates in the smoke for the first time. But burning biomass does not appear to be a dominant source of these chemical pollutants.\nThe major findings of the study involved the fine particles, which are dusty, sooty particles much thinner than a grain of sand or a human hair. They can go airborne, as aerosols, on their own or combined with moisture.\nThen people can inhale them. Some particulate matter contains oxidants that cause genetic damage. They can drift over long distances and pollute populated areas.\nIndustrial sources also expose people to harmful aerosols, but fires produce more aerosol per amount of fuel burned. \u201cCars and power plants with pollution controls burn things much more cleanly,\u201d Huey said.\nVarious aerosols also rise up in the atmosphere, but their net effect on global warming or cooling is still uncertain, as some aerosols reflect sunlight away from the Earth, and others, in contrast, trap warmth in the atmosphere.\nAlso read: Brown carbon from wildfires may boost climate change\nPrescribed burnings\nAs global warming expands wildfires in size and number, the ensuing pollution stands to grow along with them. Stepping up professionally controlled man-made burnings may help cut these emissions, the study suggests.\nSo-called\nprescribed burnings\nprevent or reduce wildfires, and they appear to produce far less pollution per unit area than wildfires.\n\u201cA prescribed fire might burn five tons of biomass fuel per acre, whereas a wildfire might burn 30,\u201d said Yokelson, who has dedicated decades of research to biomass fires. \u201cThis study shows that wildfires also emit three times more aerosol per ton of fuel burned than prescribed fires.\u201d\nWhile still more needs to be known about professional prescribed burnings\u2019 emissions, this new research makes clear that wildfires burn much more and pollute much more. The data will also help improve overall estimates of wildfire emissions.\nFire prevention professionals follow stringent rules to carry out prescribed burns to avoid calamity and sending pollution downwind into populated areas. The researchers do not recommend that inexperienced people burn biomass, as this contributes to air pollution and can trigger tragic blazes, including wildfires.\nDaunting flights\nExperiments like these, in real natural disasters, are uncommon not only because of the challenge of assembling so many great instruments and taking them airborne. The flights are also potentially dangerous. Plumes are not only filled with toxins, but their turbulence tosses planes about, rattling technology and researchers.\n\u201cThe smoke leaks into the cabin and makes you nauseous,\u201d said Yokelson, who started flying plume missions many years ago. \u201cYou\u2019re trying to take notes, run your instrument, look at the fire, talk on the headset, and get pictures. And at the same time, it\u2019s crazy bumpy. Normally, if you\u2019re in a smaller plane, your stomach is not too happy.\u201d\nAlso, wildfires pop up unannounced, so flight schedules must be hammered out on short notice around strict regulations that normally prohibit flights near wildfires. Research aircraft also have to coordinate with regional authorities to avoid crossing paths with fire-fighting planes.\nThe rare data the flights from\nNASA\u2019s SEAC 4 RS mission\nand the\nDepartment of Energy\u2019s BBOP mission\nhave provided stand to greatly increase understanding of the pollutants naturally burning biomass flings into the air.\nCitation:\nFlight projects that collected the data and also tropical storm data were: SEAC 4 RS by NASA and BBOP by the U.S. Department of Energy.
