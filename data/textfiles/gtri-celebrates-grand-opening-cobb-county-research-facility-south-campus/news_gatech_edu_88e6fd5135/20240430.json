Georgia Tech representatives speaking at the event included President G.P. \u201cBud\u201d Peterson, Interim Director of GTRI Lora Weiss, and Executive Director of Real Estate Development Tony Zivalich. Industry partners Rod McLean of Lockheed Martin and Cobb County Commission Chairman Mike Boyce also addressed the gathering.\nLocated on Lockheed Martin\u2019s Marietta campus and adjacent to Dobbins Air Reserve Base, the south campus, named CCRF-South, now houses four newly renovated buildings \u2013 plus 20-acres of undeveloped land \u2013 that have been developed into large testing and research spaces as well as renovated offices.\nThe 52-acre acquisition was approved in November 2017, allowing Georgia Tech to complete a yearlong negotiation process for the property. The estimated $42 million expansion has allowed GTRI \u2013 the only dedicated applied research division of the Institute \u2013 to expand to fit its growing portfolio and staffing needs, doubling its original footprint established in 1978.\n\u201cWhen we moved next door to Lockheed Martin almost 40 years ago, it marked the beginning of a great partnership,\u201d said Peterson. \u201cThis partnership involved researchers, individuals from Lockheed Martin, and people from Georgia Tech and GTRI who were all interested in developing new technologies, new techniques, and new production and manufacturing processes.\u201d These interests will expand and continue to be fulfilled across\u00a0laboratories moving into the new GTRI Cobb County campus.\nCCRF-South will be home to four of the eight GTRI laboratories including the Aerospace, Transportation, and Advanced Systems Laboratory (ATAS); the Cybersecurity, Information Protection, and Hardware Evaluation Research Laboratory (CIPHER); the Electronic Systems Laboratory (ELSYS); and the Sensors and Electromagnetic Applications Laboratory (SEAL). Laboratories on the campus will continue to research solutions and engineer technologies that support national security, economic development, health analytics, and food processing.\nThe 350,000-square-foot research facility includes traditional office spaces, open-area collaborative spaces, an auditorium with open breakout space that doubles as a communal lunch area, multiple coffee bars, and extra space for future expansion to address GTRI\u2019s needs in the years to come.\u00a0A second building, connected to the first through an indoor walkway to provide easy access between office and lab space, contains a large high-bay space, which will allow tractor trailer trucks to drive directly into the building\u2019s lab spaces for assembly.\n\u201cGTRI is excited to move into this renovated, high-end technical, and modern office space with research labs and high-bay facilities on the Cobb County South Campus,\u201d said Weiss.\u00a0\u201cThis expansion will allow GTRI to grow its existing work in Cobb County as well as move work from the overcrowded main campus in midtown.\u00a0The new office building can house up to 600 personnel, enough room to grow for at least five years.\u201d\nFor more than 40 years, GTRI and Lockheed Martin have collaborated on several groundbreaking projects. The expansion of GTRI\u2019s campus facilitates an even closer relationship between the two organizations. GTRI, in partnership with Lockheed Martin, is building a community that will not only change the economic landscape of south Cobb County but also continue to strengthen GTRI\u2019s impact on the nation\u2019s technological advances.\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nGeorgia Tech Research Institute\nContact\nlance.wallace@comm.gatech.edu\nEmail\nlance.wallace@comm.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
