Twelve faculty members have been selected to the inaugural class of fellows with the Brook Byers Institute for Sustainable Systems (BBISS).

They will also help carry the message of sustainability and the vision, mission, values, and objectives of BBISS. Their selection is for three years with the potential for renewal.\u00a0 In late August, the fellows will begin mapping out a strategy for future years.
