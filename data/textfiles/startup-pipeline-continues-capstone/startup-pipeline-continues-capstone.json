His company,\nBetter Walk , sponsored a team at Thursday\u2019s\nCapstone Design Expo , which showcases senior projects that aim to solve industry problems, develop innovative research tools, or launch entrepreneurial ideas. \u201cI decided to sponsor a Capstone team because Georgia Tech students are the brightest,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are focused and hardworking.\u201d Unnava should know. Until recently he was a Georgia Tech student. He withdrew from school to focus on launching Better Walk, which redesigned crutches to minimize underarm pain. The crutches are scheduled to be out in February. The second product \u2013 the redesigned walking cast \u2013 should be available in the next 12 to 18 months, he said While many of the more than 100 Capstone projects reflect work to help industry leaders solve problems or find new ideas, this year\u2019s event includes a couple of teams sponsored by young startups with strong Georgia Tech ties. This work continues the\nstartup ecosystem Georgia Tech is creating\nso students graduate with a strong background in innovation and entrepreneurism. Monsieur , a startup co-founded by Georgia Tech graduates and currently incubating at the\nAdvanced Technology Development Center , sponsored another Capstone team. The company created a \u201crobotic bartender\u201d that allows people to order custom drinks \u2014 from a selection of some 300 popular cocktails \u2014 at the swipe of a screen. Their Capstone team was charged with optimizing the expected profit of the menus according to forecasted demand and creating an inventory policy to minimize associated costs. Gimme Vending , which was part of the inaugural class of Georgia Tech\u2019s\nStartup Summer\nprogram in 2014, sponsored a Capstone team to work on a keyless entry to vending machines. It is designed to retrofit existing vending machines and replace the existing mechanical cylinder lock, said Cory Hewett, the company\u2019s CEO. The company introduced hardware and an app to make vending machine operations more efficient for owners. Gimme Vending won this year\u2019s annual TAG Business Launch Competition, which is sponsored in part by the Technology Association of Georgia. Hewett studied electrical engineering at Tech and attended class with some members of the Capstone team. He was already familiar with their strong work ethic and problem-solving skills \u201cIt\u2019s been great working with them, not just for me, but for our whole team,\u201d Hewett said. \u201cBecause of our size, it is very important that our core team focuses singularly on our current product offering. The Capstone team is a huge help because they can work independently to help Gimme build brand new technology without any split on our focus.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nCapstone Design Expo\nCREATE-X\nContact\nLaura Diamond\u00a0 Georgia Tech Media Relations 404-894-6016\nEmail\nlaura.diamond@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
