This year, some programs plan to return to an in-person setting, while others plan to continue the success that was found in a virtual setting.\nRegardless of whether the program is in-person or virtual, the\nYouth Programs Policy\nstill applies. Below are the requirements for hosting a youth program.\nFor more information and resources on youth programs, visit\nyouthprograms.gatech.edu .
