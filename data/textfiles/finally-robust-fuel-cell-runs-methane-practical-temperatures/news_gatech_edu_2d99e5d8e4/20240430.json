Practical\u00a0to run at cooler temperatures and on cheap fuel: the new fuel cell in the lab of Meilin Liu at Georgia Tech. Credit:\u00a0Georgia Tech / Christopher Moore\nOct 29, 2018\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nFuel cells have not been particularly known for their practicality and affordability, but that may have just changed. There\u2019s a new cell that runs on cheap fuel at temperatures comparable to automobile engines and which slashes materials costs.\nThough the cell is in the lab, it has high potential to someday electrically power homes and perhaps cars, say the researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology who led its development. In a\nnew study in the journal\u00a0 Nature Energy \u00a0 the researchers detailed how they reimagined the entire fuel cell with the help of a newly invented fuel catalyst.\nThe catalyst has dispensed with high-priced hydrogen fuel by making its own out of cheap, readily available methane. And improvements throughout the cell cooled the seething operating temperatures that are customary in methane fuel cells dramatically, a striking engineering accomplishment.\nMethane fuel cells usually require temperatures of 750 to 1,000 degrees Celsius to run. This new one needs only about 500, which is even a notch cooler than automobile combustion engines, which run at around 600 degrees Celsius.\nThat lower temperature could trigger cascading cost savings in the ancillary technology needed to operate a fuel cell, potentially pushing the new cell to commercial viability. The researchers feel confident that engineers can design electric power units around this fuel cell with reasonable effort, something that has eluded previous methane fuel cells.\n\u2018Sensation in our world\u2019\n\u201cOur cell could make for a straightforward, robust overall system that uses cheap stainless steel to make\u00a0 interconnectors ,\u201d said Meilin Liu, who led the study and is a\u00a0 Regents\u00a0Professor in Georgia Tech\u2019s School of Materials Science and Engineering. \u00a0Interconnectors are parts that help bring together many fuel cells into a\u00a0 stack , or functional unit.\n\u201cAbove 750 degrees Celsius, no metal would withstand the temperature without oxidation, so you\u2019d have a lot of trouble getting materials, and they would be extremely expensive and fragile, and contaminate the cell,\u201d Liu said.\n\u201cLowering the temperature to 500 degrees Celsius is a sensation in our world. Very few people have even tried it,\u201d said Ben deGlee, a graduate research assistant in Liu\u2019s lab and one of the first authors of the study. \u201cWhen you get that low, it makes the job of the engineer designing the stack and connected technologies much easier.\u201d\nThe new cell also eliminates the need for a major ancillary device called a\u00a0 steam reformer , which is normally required to convert methane and water into hydrogen fuel.\nLiu, deGlee, co-first author Yu Chen, who is a postdoctoral researcher in Liu\u2019s lab, and co-first author Yu Tang of the University of Kansas,\u00a0 published the results\nof their research on October 29, 2018 . Their work was funded by the Office of Basic Energy Sciences and the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E), both in the U.S. Department of Energy. It was also funded by the National Science Foundation\u2019s Division of Chemistry.\n\u2018Distributed generation\u2019\nThe research was based on a type of fuel cell with high potential for commercial viability, the\u00a0 solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) . SOFCs are known for their versatility in fuels they can use.\nIf it goes to market, though the new cell might not power automobiles for a while, it could land sooner in basements as part of a more decentralized, cleaner, cheaper electrical power grid. The\u00a0 fuel cell stack \u00a0itself would be about the size of a shoebox, plus ancillary technology to make it run.\n\u201cThe hope is you could install this device like a tankless water heater. It would run off of natural gas to power your house,\u201d Liu said. \u201cThat would save society and industry the enormous cost of new power plants and large electrical grid expansions.\u201d\n\u201cIt would make homes and businesses more power independent,\u201d Liu said. \u201cThat kind of system would be called distributed generation, and our sponsors want to develop that.\u201d\nHomemade hydrogen\nHydrogen is the best fuel for powering fuel cells, but its cost is exorbitant. The researchers figured out how to convert methane to hydrogen in the fuel cell itself via the new catalyst, which is made with cerium, nickel and ruthenium and has the chemical formula Ce 0.9 Ni 0.05 Ru 0.05 O 2,\u00a0 abbreviated CNR.\nWhen methane and water molecules come into contact with the catalyst and heat, nickel chemically cleaves the methane molecule. Ruthenium does the same with water. The resulting parts come back together as that very desirable hydrogen (H 2 ) and carbon monoxide (CO), which the researchers surprisingly put to good use.\n\u201cCO causes performance problems in most fuel cells, but here, we\u2019re using it as a fuel,\u201d Chen said.\nMaking electricity\nH 2 \u00a0and CO continue on to further catalyst layers that make up the anode, the part of the fuel cell that yanks off electrons, making the carbon monoxide and hydrogen positively charged ions. The electrons travel via a wire -\u00a0creating the electricity flow -\u00a0toward the cathode.\nThere, oxygen, which is very electron-hungry, sucks up the electrons, closing the electrical circuit and becoming O 2- \u00a0ions. Ionized hydrogen and oxygen meet and exit the system as water condensation; the carbon monoxide and oxygen ions meet to become pure carbon dioxide, which could be captured.\nFor the energy produced, fuel cell technology creates far, far less carbon dioxide than combustion engines.\nIn some fuel cells, the water in the initial reactions must be introduced from the outside. In this new fuel cell, it\u2019s replenished in the last reaction phase, which forms water that cycles back to react with the methane.\nCatalysts converge\nThe new catalyst, CNR, manufactured by research collaborators at the University of Kansas, is the outer layer of the anode side of the cell and doubles as a protectant against decay, extending the life of the cell. CNR has strong cohort catalysts in inner layers and on the other side of the cell, the cathode.\nOn the cathode end, oxygen\u2019s reaction and movement through the system are usually notoriously slow, but Liu\u2019s lab has recently sped it up to raise the electricity output by using what\u2019s called nanofiber cathodes, which Liu\u2019s lab developed in a prior study. ( A tailored double perovskite nanofiber catalyst enables ultrafast oxygen evolution .)\n\u201cThe structures of these various catalysts, as well as the nanofiber cathodes, all together allowed us to drop the operating temperature,\u201d Chen said.\nLike this article?\u00a0 Subscribe to our email newsletter\nAlso read:\u00a0 Turbocharging Fuel Cells with a Multifunctional Catalyst\nThe\u00a0following people coauthored the research: B ote \u00a0Zhao, \u00a0 L ei \u00a0Zhang, \u00a0 S eonyoung\u00a0 Yoo,\u00a0 Kai Pei, Jun Hyuk Kim \u00a0and\u00a0 Yong Ding of Georgia Tech; Yuechang Wei and Franklin\u00a0 F eng \u00a0Tao of the University of Kansas, and Z iyun \u00a0Wang and P . \u00a0Hu of The Queen\u2019s University of Belfast.
