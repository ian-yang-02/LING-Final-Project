Its membership includes Alexander Hamilton as well as the man who played him on Broadway, Lin-Manuel Miranda \u2014 also elected in 2023 with Georgia Tech\u2019s\nRafael L. Bras ,\nMarilyn Brown , and\nSusan Margulies .\nBras is a civil engineer and hydrologist who served for 10 years as Georgia Tech\u2019s provost and executive vice president for Academic Affairs.\n\u201cI have had a wonderful and fulfilling career and enjoyed my share of awards and recognition. Each one has been meaningful and special. But being elected to the American Academy of Arts & Sciences is different,\u201d said Bras, professor and K. Harrison Brown Family Chair in the\nSchool of Civil and Environmental Engineering . \u201cI cannot help wondering how this son of a Puerto Rican civil servant and a home economics teacher got here.\u201d\nBras is a renowned scholar of Earth\u2019s water cycle who, early in his career, helped create the field of hydrologic science by reshaping thinking about water in the environment. He has helped lead significant projects around the world, including efforts to protect Venice, Italy, from flooding. He is a member of the National Academy of Engineering.\n\u201cMy mother never understood what I did for a living. If she were alive, I could mention that Alexander Graham Bell and Darwin were members. Or that Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, and Bob Metcalf, Turing Award winner and inventor of the ethernet, are members. She would not be impressed,\u201d said Bras, who is also a faculty member in the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences.\n\u201cIf I mentioned that my name will be forever in a list with the likes of John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, George Washington, Martin Luther King Jr., Nelson Mandela, Jimmy Carter, Hillary Clinton, Yo-Yo Ma, Pablo Casals, Tom Hanks, Lin-Manuel Miranda, and Sonia Sotomayor, she would be somewhat incredulous \u2014 but impressed and very proud.\u201d\nMost recently, he has been engaged in\nunderstanding the occurrence of landslides and related geohazards\ntriggered by heavy rainfalls, including hurricanes, in his native Puerto Rico. The effort is part of an idea to develop a national center for landslide geohazards research that would be based at Georgia Tech with hubs on the island and elsewhere. He also is\neditor of a newsletter for leaders\nto examine global issues with other research and academic leaders.\nMarilyn Brown, Regents' Professor and Brook Byers Professor of Sustainable Systems\nin the\nSchool of Public Policy , is a national leader in climate change mitigation studies. Her research focuses on the design and impact of policies aimed at accelerating the development and deployment of sustainable energy technologies.\n\u201cI\u2019m grateful and honored to be elected to the company of such esteemed experts,\u201d said Brown. \u201cI look forward to working with them to foster smart and achievable policy solutions to help advance moves toward a new green economy and a more sustainable tomorrow.\u201d\nBrown created and co-leads the\nClimate and Energy Policy Lab oratory\nand the Master of Sustainable Energy and Environmental Management program at Georgia Tech. Leading\nDrawdown Georgia , Brown and her team track greenhouse gas emissions by source across the state to identify solutions to reach carbon neutrality. She is also a member of the National Academy of Sciences and National Academy of Engineering.\n\u201cIn its earliest days, the Academy sought members who would help address issues and opportunities confronting a young nation,\u201d Nancy C. Andrews, chair of the Academy\u2019s board of directors, said in a\nrelease\nannouncing the new members. \u201cWe feel a similar urgency and have elected a class that brings diverse expertise to meet the pressing challenges and possibilities that America and the world face today.\u201d\nAn international leader in clean energy policy, Brown is known for her pioneering work developing economic-engineering models incorporating behavioral and social science principles into policy analysis of energy systems. Her influential research quantified the \u201cenergy-efficiency gap,\u201d which highlights the importance of promoting cost-effective energy conservation improvements as a tool to improve energy security and reduce the impact of climate change.\nIn 2000, she led the Scenarios for a Clean Energy Future project, which at the time was the most detailed carbon-reduction analysis funded by the U.S. Department of Energy and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.\nLater, she contributed to the work of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Working Group that was a co-recipient of the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize.\nThe Academy also elected Susan Margulies, who remains on the Georgia Tech faculty\nas a professor in the\nWallace H. Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering\nwhile leading the National Science Foundation's\u00a0 Directorate for Engineering.\nShe\u2019s a research leader in pediatric traumatic brain injury and lung injury associated with mechanical ventilators. She was elected to both the National Academy of Engineering and the National Academy of Medicine in 2020.\nShe stepped down as chair of the Coulter Department in 2021 to accept the NSF appointment.\nThe Academy\u2019s 2023 class also includes geneticists, historians, economists, and authors. Among them are Ilya Kaminsky, a poet and essayist, and Reginald DesRoches, president of Rice University. Both are former Georgia Tech faculty members.\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nBrown Elected to AAAS\nBras, Margulies Elected to the American Academy of Arts & Sciences\nContact\nKristen Bailey\nInstitute Communications\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
