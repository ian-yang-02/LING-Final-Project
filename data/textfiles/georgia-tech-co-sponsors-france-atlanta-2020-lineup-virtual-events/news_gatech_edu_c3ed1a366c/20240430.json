While this year\u2019s slate of events will be held virtually due to the ongoing pandemic, there is no shortage of excitement to celebrate the values of innovation, excellence, and collaboration in our interconnected world.\nOn October 1, Georgia Tech President \u00c1ngel Cabrera will join a panel to formally launch France-Atlanta 2020, with a discussion on how the United Nation (UN)\u2019s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) have encouraged French-American cooperation. Cabrera will be joined by Jonathan Gilad, counselor for ecology, sustainable development, energy, and transport for the Embassy of France in the U.S . \u00a0 Ambassador of France to the U.S. Philippe Etienne and Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms will provide prerecorded opening remarks. Rickey Bevington, senior anchor/correspondent at Georgia Public Broadcasting, will moderate the discussion.\nThe 17 UN SDGs are integral to Georgia Tech\u2019s new strategic plan, demonstrating Tech\u2019s commitment to advancing these goals. The panel discussion will also address how Georgia Tech is grappling with the SDGs. And it will explore, too, how Tech\u2019s actions will reverberate within the city of Atlanta, the southeast, Tech\u2019s global campuses, and even wider still, and how France has advanced in implementing the SDGs.\nThe opening event will be held at 6:30 p.m. via Zoom, and the Georgia Tech community is encouraged to participate. Register for the virtual launch at\nus02web.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_tOXqV2BITh2TVt_YTWdkjQ\nEvents will be held from October 1 through November 10 and will include a variety of scientific, business, cultural, and humanitarian topics.
