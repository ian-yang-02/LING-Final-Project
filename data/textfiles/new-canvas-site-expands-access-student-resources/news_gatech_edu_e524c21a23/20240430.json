The site brings these important resources to the forefront of where students are interacting with their coursework online.\nThe College of Engineering\u2019s (CoE) Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) Council began building out the site about two years ago. The site amplifies work that was initiated by\nStudent Engagement and Well-Being\nin 2020. A link to the new site, named GT Student Resources, is located on the left side course navigation menu in all Georgia Tech courses.\n\u201cWe wanted to compile this information and make it available where students are online frequently \u2014 in Canvas,\u201d said Mark Losego, associate professor in the School of Materials Science and Engineering, Dean\u2019s Education Innovation Professor in the College of Engineering, and initiative lead for the effort. \u201cCompiling it in Canvas also makes it easier to continuously update and distribute new information.\u201d\nThe Canvas site also includes resources and information related to emergency financial support, the Office of Minority Educational Development, the LGBTQIA Resource Center, the Veterans Resource Center, support for transfer students, undergraduate research, and much more.\nThe developers of the Canvas site, including Alivia Rukmana, an undergraduate student assistant in industrial design, leveraged best practices being implemented by several units, faculty, and student groups across campus who were sharing these resources through syllabuses and other methods.\n\u201cWe first interviewed students, faculty, and staff to identify the most important resources to include,\u201d Rukmana explained. \u201cWe then had the content reviewed by all the appropriate service units on campus.\u201d\nA beta version rolled out last year, mostly in the College of Engineering and the College of Sciences where faculty imported the resource into their own courses through Canvas Commons. While successful, this approach still required an extra step from the faculty and in some instances disrupted course content.\n\u201cOver the summer we worked with the Digital Learning team in the Office of Information Technology to install a link to this site on the course navigation menu in all Georgia Tech courses,\u201d Losego said. \u201cThis way the site is automatically added to all courses and no longer interferes with course content.\u201d\nThe team worked with Student Engagement and Well-Being to put mental health information front and center in the new site.\n\u201cWe believe students are willing to utilize available programs and services if they know they are available and what they will provide,\" said Luoluo Hong, vice president for Student Engagement and Well-Being. \u201cLinking available resources to an academic tool that we know students already regularly access will hopefully facilitate a more effective exchange of information with Yellow Jackets.\u201d\nThe site was also vetted by the OIT Quality Assurance team to improve accessibility for all students.\n\u201cWe are excited to have this roll out to the campus after two years of hard work,\u201d said Iris Tien, associate professor in the School of Civil and Environmental Engineering and chair of the CoE DEI Council. \u201cOur hope is that this Canvas site will help students more easily find the resources they need and that the faculty will encourage their classes to explore this site to discover all of the incredible resources available to our students.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nContact\nVictor Rogers\nInstitute Communications\nEmail\nvictor.rogers@comm.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
