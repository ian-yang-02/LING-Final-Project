Researchers will test their ideas and technologies in Curiosity Lab\u2019s living laboratory in Peachtree Corners.\n\u201cThis is a wonderful example of industry-university-local government coming together to advance innovative solutions to the built environment and mobility,\u201d said Debra Lam, managing director for Smart Cities and Inclusive Innovation at Georgia Tech. \u201cProviding access to such infrastructure will help our researchers test new technologies and further our mission of serving our community through innovation.\u201d\nThe backbone of the partnership is Curiosity Lab\u2019s 1.5-mile autonomous vehicle test track. Owned by the city, it has 5G mobile data connectivity, smart infrastructure like connected traffic lights, a dedicated fiber-optic data network, and an operations center where researchers can track data from all the connected devices and sensors on the track. The track is set in a commercial office park in Peachtree Corners, just northeast of Atlanta, and allows interaction with people and vehicles going about their daily lives.\n\u201cOur 5G-enabled living laboratory will give Georgia Tech researchers the opportunity to push the frontier of emerging technology in a real-world setting that is almost impossible to replicate in a closed lab,\u201d said Betsy Plattenburg, executive director of Curiosity Lab at Peachtree Corners. \u201cCuriosity Lab also will provide those researchers an opportunity to collaborate with other industry leaders and focus their research on immediate challenges and results.\u201d\nWhile it might seem counterintuitive for Delta to be interested in cars, especially the driverless variety, the advances that emerge from this partnership could benefit customers and employees, according to Delta Chief Operating Officer Gil West.\n\u201cDriving the leading edge of emerging technology means Delta can help shape how industry adopts it,\u201d West said. \u201cAutonomous vehicle technology is one of those innovations we see as having the potential to improve employee safety, the customer experience and operational performance, and this partnership will help us explore all of those possibilities.\u201d\nAs autonomous vehicle research advances across the world, Delta sees potential applications for autonomous cars, trucks or buses at airports and beyond. For example, autonomous vehicles could help customers make tight connections across an airport, deliver delayed baggage to customers, or transport aircraft parts to airports.\nWest said this collaboration is an important part of the global airline\u2019s strategy to invest in solutions that empower customers and employees, reduce the stresses of travel, and redefine the future of flying.\nThe collaboration builds on Georgia Tech\u2019s autonomous mobility and infrastructure work, which spans the Georgia Tech Research Institute, the School of Civil and Environmental Engineering, the Institute for Robotics and Intelligent Machines, the Office of Parking and Transportation Services, and Smart Cities and Inclusive Innovation.\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nSmart Cities and Inclusive Innovation Initiative\nCuriosity Lab at Peachtree Corners\nContact\nJoshua Stewart\n404.894.6016\nEmail\njstewart@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
