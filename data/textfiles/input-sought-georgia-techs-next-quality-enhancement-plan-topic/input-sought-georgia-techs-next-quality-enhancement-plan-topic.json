QEP topic selection is a key part of the Institute\u2019s reaffirmation of accreditation with the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges (SACSCOC), scheduled for 2025.\nAs outlined by SACSCOC, the QEP is a carefully designed course of action that addresses a well-defined topic or issue related to enhancing student learning and student success. Georgia Tech\u2019s next QEP topic will be tied closely to the Transformative Teaching and Learning goals identified in the\nInstitute\u2019s strategic plan .\n\u201cThe reaccreditation process ensures academic quality, accountability, and continuous improvement \u2014 areas that align closely with our strategic goals and values,\u201d said Steve McLaughlin, provost and executive vice president for Academic Affairs. \u201cThe QEP is not only a required part of that process, but it is also an incredible opportunity for us to work together to create new ways to serve our students and our community and continue to realize our strategic plan.\u201d\nA QEP topic selection committee was appointed by McLaughlin in October, and is co-chaired by Laurence Jacobs, senior vice provost for Education and Learning, and Steven Girardot, vice provost for Undergraduate Education. The committee will host open town halls to receive input, feedback, and ideas from Georgia Tech faculty, staff, and students.\nTown Hall Schedule\nWednesday, Jan. 11\n9 \u2013 10 a.m.\nPeachtree Room, John Lewis Student Center\nTuesday, Jan. 17\n2 \u2013 3 p.m.\nPeachtree Room, John Lewis Student Center\n\u201cOur transformative teaching and learning strategic goals emerged from more than 5,700 unique perspectives and voices from Georgia Tech students, faculty, staff, and stakeholders who contributed during the visioning phase of the Institute\u2019s strategic plan,\u201d Jacobs said. \u00a0\u201cWe are eager to hear from our community now about how we can build on those goals in our next QEP and create tangible, new outcomes in the educational experiences of our students.\u201d\nThe final QEP topic will be shared widely with the Georgia Tech community in Spring 2023. A QEP development and implementation committee will then be formed to draft the new QEP plan for submission to SACSCOC.\n\u201cOur past QEPs, which created the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program, International Plan, and Serve-Learn-Sustain (SLS), have demonstrated the potential of a QEP to create transformative learning experiences inside and outside of the classroom,\u201d Girardot said. \u201cOur next QEP will build on this successful track record of enhancing student success.\u201d\nGeorgia Tech received a commendation from SACSCOC President Belle S. Wheelan \u201cfor the exceptional execution\u201d of its most recent QEP,\nServe-Learn-Sustain (SLS) , in Fall 2021. SLS, an ongoing, campuswide academic initiative working with all six Colleges, offers students opportunities to collaborate with diverse partners on key sustainability challenges. Wheelan praised SLS as a \u201cmodel of how a QEP can transform an academic culture.\u201d\nMore information on the QEP topic selection process and how members of the Georgia Tech community can share ideas and feedback can be found at\nhttps://provost.gatech.edu/quality-enhancement-plan .\nAdditional Images\nContact\nBrittany Aiello\nFaculty Communications Program Manager\nbrittany.aiello@gatech.edu\nEmail\nbrittany.aiello@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
