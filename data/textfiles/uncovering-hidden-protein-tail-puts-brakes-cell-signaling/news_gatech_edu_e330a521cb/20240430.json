When researchers inactivated the tail, a signaling response that had previously taken 30 minutes to occur happened almost immediately \u2013 with an intensity four times greater than normal.\nThe research took place in yeast, but if a similar process occurs in human G proteins, the discovery could provide a new drug target for controlling important cellular processes \u2013 and potentially offer a new class of biosensors able to more sensitively detect and respond to certain chemical agents. The research, supported by the National Institutes of Health\u2019s\nNational Institute of General Medical Sciences\n(NIGMS), was reported May 1 in the journal\nCell Reports .\n\u201cWe have discovered the mechanism that regulates how quickly a pathway gets turned on by an external stimulus,\u201d said\nMatthew Torres , an associate professor in the\nSchool of Biological Sciences\nat the Georgia Institute of Technology. \u201cBy genetically altering the control mechanism underlying this process, we are able to modulate how much of a signal from outside the cell gets inside the cell and how quickly it gets through. It\u2019s all the more astonishing because this mechanism has been hiding in plain sight for decades.\u201d\nG proteins, also known as guanine nucleotide-binding proteins, are a family of molecules that operate as molecular switches inside cells. They transmit signals acquired from a variety of extracellular stimuli to the interior of a cell \u2013 through the membrane, which otherwise wouldn\u2019t allow communication.\nThe tail found by Torres and Doctoral Candidate Shilpa Choudhury likely escaped attention because it is flexibly attached to the G protein gamma subunit of a closely-collaborating protein team known as G beta/gamma. Protein structures have generally been identified by X-ray crystallography techniques which cannot resolve structures that are in motion.\nPrior to their work, the G gamma subunit has been known primarily as the protein that connects the larger G beta subunit to the cell membrane. Without the work of\nSAPH-ire\n\u2013 an informatics program that maps PTM activity using machine learning \u2013 the role of the tail structure might not have been identified.\n\u201cFor years, people had focused on G beta/gamma as a complete unit, and not as separate components,\u201d said Choudhury, the paper\u2019s first author. \u201cThe gamma is a tiny protein compared to the larger G beta subunit, but we now know that it has a major role in the activity of the signaling system.\u201d\nIn yeast, G beta/gamma subunits activate a signaling pathway in response to pheromones, a process which normally takes about 30 minutes after stimulation of a pheromone receptor at the cell membrane. Torres and Choudhury suspected that protein modifications, PTMs, were somehow causing the delay. Their computer program SAPH-ire \u2013 developed in the Torres lab and announced in 2015 \u2013 pointed the finger straight at the G gamma subunit.\nThe program analyzes existing meta-data repositories of protein sequence and PTM activity to reveal \u201chotspots\u201d of protein alteration. SAPH-ire was designed to accelerate the search for important regulatory targets on protein structures and to provide a better understanding of how proteins communicate with one another inside cells.\nPulling from worldwide PTM databases that use mass spectrometry to identify sequences that are chemically altered, SAPH-ire pointed to a specific location on the G gamma protein. Using genetic mutation techniques, Choudhury modified a section of the protein to render the tail structure inactive.\nBut removing the tail from the process by itself wasn\u2019t enough. To activate the signaling process, structures on the tail had to interact with a separate effector protein. When both were inactivated, the researchers saw a dramatic effect when the receptor was stimulated.\n\u201cYou can think of the signaling pathway like a wheel travelling down a hill where two pads of the bicycle brake are gripping the wheel to slow it down,\u201d said Torres. \u201cActivating the pheromone receptor is like releasing the wheel down the hill. When both brakes are active, the wheel moves very slowly because the two brakes are working together to slow its speed and momentum. This turns out to be how the pathway behaves in normal cells immediately after receptor stimulation.\u201d\n\u201cIf you take away one of the brakes, you get partial braking and the wheel is allowed to move slightly faster, but is still restrained from moving as fast as it can. This is how the pathway behaves in normal cells within the first 20 minutes after receptor stimulation. But if you eliminate both brakes, releasing the wheel down the hill results in very high speed and momentum \u2013 kind of like a golf cart without a governor.\u201d\nThis is exactly what happened when Choudhury prevented PTMs on both G gamma and the effector protein. \u201cWhen we do that, we see a rapid activation of the signaling pathway that occurs six times faster, and is four times more intense than with the normal condition with the pathway brakes intact.\u201d\nBeyond identifying the control mechanism for the pathway, the researchers also learned how it controls the ability of yeast to respond to pheromones in a \u201cswitch-like\u201d manner that is either on or off versus an analog manner that is analogous to a volume knob on a stereo.\nWhile Torres and Choudhury made their discovery in yeast, they believe it will have broad implications because all organisms that have G proteins, including humans, have G gamma tails that are riddled with PTMs. Among the next steps will be to see if the same type of braking system is exhibited by G gamma subunits and G beta/gamma effectors in human cells. If so, that could provide insights that could identify potentially new drug targets.\n\u201cThe tail exists, and it\u2019s important in this process of controlling interactions with G beta/gamma effectors, which are essential for turning on signaling pathways,\u201d Torres said. \u201cWe suspect the importance of G gamma as a regulator G protein signaling will extend beyond any single organism.\u201d\nSAPH-ire Helps Scientists Prioritize Protein Modification Research\nThis research was supported by the National Institutes of Health\u2019s National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) grants R01GM117400 and R00GM094533.
