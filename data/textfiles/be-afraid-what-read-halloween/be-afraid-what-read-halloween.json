The books range from Victorian ghost stories to a supernatural rapper haunting a bookstore.\nThe Scarlet Plague\nBy Jack London, originally published in\nLondon Magazine\n(1912), and published as a book in 1915 by Macmillan; readily available in pdf.\n\u201cAs someone who writes about vampires (an introduction to a new edition of\nDracula\nplus two book chapters during the pandemic), I read or reread a bunch of vampire fiction as well as tried to catch up on Stephen King (who writes faster than I read!). The most terrifying book I read during the pandemic, however, was London\u2019s novella, which I stumbled on this summer.\nThe postapocalyptic story of the scarlet plague (told with hideous detail) that decimated the planet is narrated by James Smith, a classical scholar and one of the few people who remembers pre-plague times. Traveling with his grandsons, who live as hunters, he shares his memory of the plague but realizes he cannot share his knowledge of a lost culture with his primitive and largely illiterate grandsons.\nI recommend London\u2019s novella to people who like horror but also to people who want to reflect on what will happen in a post-Covid-19 world. Smith observes that the survivors in his world \u2018have forgotten everything.\u2019 We have not, so we have much on which to rebuild.\u201d\n\u2014 Carol Senf, professor and director of Undergraduate Studies, LMC\nThe Ghost Stories of M.R. James\nBy M.R. James, London: British Library Publishing (2018)\n\u201cShort stories allow us to read \u2018slices of life\u2019 without having to dedicate entire days or weeks when our hectic schedules only offer half an hour at a time. If you are in the mood to time-travel to some quaint early 20th-century European small town, complete with some gentleman scholar whose discovery of medieval manuscripts or antiquarian objects conjures up threatening supernatural presences, M.R. James\u2019 ghost stories are just what you need. James (1862-1936), a professor of medieval studies and university administrator, is one of the founders of the ghost story genre. His work inspired the likes of H.P. Lovecraft, Ruth Rendell, Kingsley Amis, and Stephen King.\u201d\n\u2014 Richard Utz, associate dean, Faculty Development, Ivan Allen College of Liberal Arts\nThe Bookshop\nBy Penelope Fitzgerald, William Collins & Sons (1978); Alfred A. Knopf (2001)\n\u201cFitzgerald\u2019s novel describes Florence Green, a middle-aged woman who in 1959 sets up a bookshop in Hardborough, where she has lived for 10 years. This small seaside town doesn\u2019t have another bookshop or a library, and the town\u2019s residents\u00a0 have read all the books they can access through the mobile library. Having worked as bookstore assistant, Florence secures Old House, a historic building, to serve as her shop and residence. But her attempts to attract customers are challenged by a powerful society matron who had other plans for Old House and a poltergeist, a supernatural rapper haunting the building.\u201d\n\u2014 Carol Colatrella, professor and co-director, Center for the Study of Women, Science, and Technology\nLet\u2019s Play White\nBy Chesya Burke, Apex Book Company (2011)\n\u201cThis short story collection by Chesya Burke \u2014 whose writing is regularly compared with that of Octavia Butler and Toni Morrison \u2014 revolves around a frightening truth: that life for Black women in the United States is often horrifying. Burke\u2019s stories take back the stereotype of the Black woman as a monstrous threat that needs to be policed, disciplined, and otherwise contained and turns it on its head, allowing her conjure women, demons, and ghosts to speak out and share their terrifying experiences of slavery, genocide, white supremacy, and colonialism. Because yes! There are literal monsters galore in Burke\u2019s stories\u2014but they are so searingly, tenderly wrought that we know they are not really bad people, even if they sometimes do bad things. Indeed, even as Burke\u2019s characters grapple with the harsh realities of their worlds,\u00a0they sometimes manage to connect with each other across time and space in creative, generous, and often surprising ways that can and should inspire us all.\u201d\n\u2014 Lisa Yaszek, Regents Professor of Science Fiction Studies, LMC\nPua's Kiss (Lauele Fractured Folktales Book 1)\nBy Lehua Parker, Makena Press (2020)\n\u201cIn the not-too-spooky but persistently popular horror subgenre of paranormal romance, where vampire-werewolf-human teen love triangles rule the roost, Kanaka Maoli (Native Hawaiian) author Lehua Parker\u00a0draws on Maoli folklore to create this sparky meet-cute between Justin, a newly rejected groom from the U.S. continent, and Pua, the rebellious daughter of ocean god Kanaloa, in the fictional seaside town of Lauele, Hawaii. Blending \u201cThe Little Mermaid\u201d with Hawaiian spiritual storytelling, this breezy comic novel starts when the restless Pua, a shapeshifting shark who hangs out on the beautiful white beaches of Lauele (site of Parker\u2019s other book series such as the Niuhu Shark Saga), is discovered by depressed writer-artist Justin while in her human form, whom he finds sleeping on the sand. Soon the two share a deep connection despite their different origins (and Pua\u2019s natural desire to devour people), as Parker deftly deploys both paranormal romance beats (especially unresolved sexual tension or UST) and her Indigenous sociocultural knowledge to feed this modern YA fairytale. Even grown humans can enjoyably surf the hormonal (but PG-rated) UST wave to the end of the couple\u2019s story \u2014 as well as ride other imaginatively romantic entries in Parker\u2019s \u201cKiss\u201d series of Lauele Fractured Folktales including\nRell\u2019s Kiss\n(Cinderella) and\nNani\u2019s Kiss\n(Beauty and the Beast).\u201d\n\u2014 Ida Yoshinaga, assistant professor, LMC\nThe Cold Embrace and Other Ghost Stories\nBy Mary Elizabeth Braddon, Ash-Tree Press (2000)\n\u201cThere are many dark and uncanny Victorian ghost stories perfect for this season. Mary Elizabeth Braddon, who was a bestselling author of the period, wrote several popular sensational novels and ghost stories. I recommend two pieces by Braddon that address ghostly and vampiric themes. \u201cThe Cold Embrace\u201d is a chilling short story about ghostly revenge in which a young aristocratic man is haunted by his former fianc\u00e9e. \u201cGood Lady Ducayne,\u201d which has vampiric elements, is about an elderly woman who is fixated upon youthfulness and (with the help of her doctor) drains the blood of her young caregiver. Braddon wrote over 100 novels and short stories so there are many to choose from. She is best known for her novels,\nLady Audley\u2019s Secret\nand\nAurora Floyd\n(both are page turners full of plot twists and turns), and I would recommend those as well as her creepier short stories.\u201d\n\u2014 Narin Hassan, associate professor and director of Graduate Studies for MS-Global Media and Cultures\nAdditional Images\nContact\nVictor Rogers\nInstitute Communications\nEmail\nvictor.rogers@comm.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
