You\u2019re going to hear a lot of hollering and screaming about prices until January, when prices will start to fall off a cliff as demand goes down and the supply chain starts to get squared away. But it\u2019s going to be two or three months of things getting worse before they get better and the growth in prices starts to slow.\u201d\nAnother Covid-19 spike could also further inflame inflationary pressures, he warned.\nBelton also said that, while U.S. inflation is high by recent standards \u2014 with the consumer price index hitting a three-decade peak in October \u2014 the annualized rate of 6.2% is not excessively high historically. Several years in the 1970s and 1980s saw inflation in excess of 12%, for instance. And that, he said, points to the importance of perceptions and expectations in creating inflationary conditions.\nFor years, inflation has been tamed by factors such as the global financial crisis of 2007\u20132009, which tamped down demand, and improvements in alternative energy in the United States, which helped keep energy prices low. Sheltered from rising prices on store shelves, at the pump, and in their monthly energy bills, consumers have grown accustomed to low inflation.\nBut when Covid-19 tied knots in the global supply chain and forced significant shifts in consumer purchasing habits, inflationary pressures began rising. They have been further exacerbated by predictions of increased government spending as a result of the Biden administration\u2019s interest in a major infrastructure spending package.\nBelton said the infrastructure package signed into law Monday shouldn\u2019t have any real impact on prices for nearly two years. But when it comes to rising prices, he said, expectations often overshadow reality.\n\u201cWhat governs our markets is not actual inflation. It\u2019s expected inflation; it\u2019s what people think is going to happen,\u201d Belton said.\nThe mere expectation that the infrastructure bill might increase inflation helps make rising prices a reality, Belton said. One reason is that workers \u2014 anticipating a new higher cost of living \u2014 will start to put pressure on employers to increase their wages. Because increased labor costs are, in fact, inflationary, the expectations become a reality as businesses pass along increased salaries to consumers.\nRegardless, barring a major energy shock, Belton predicts inflation will still start to ease next year as supply chain issues dissipate, and the Covid-19 pandemic, hopefully, begins to recede.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not going back to 2%, but it won\u2019t be 10% either,\u201d he said.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nSteven Norris\nInstitute Communications\nEmail\nsnorris@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
