If the approach is ultimately successful in humans, it could allow type 1 diabetes to be treated without the long-term complications of immune system suppression.\nThe technique, reported June 4 in the journal\nNature Materials , uses synthetic hydrogel particles (microgels) to present a protein known as the Fas ligand (FasL) to immune system T-effector cells along with the pancreatic islets being transplanted. The FasL protein \u201ceducates\u201d the effector cells \u2013 which serve as immune system watchdogs \u2013 causing them to accept the graft without rejection for at least 200 days in an animal model.\nThe FasL-presenting particles are simply mixed with the living islets before being transplanted into the mice, which suffer from chemically-induced diabetes. The researchers believe the FasL-presenting hydrogels would not need to be personalized, potentially allowing an \u201coff-the-shelf\u201d therapy for the transplanted islets.\nResearchers from the Georgia Institute of Technology, University of Louisville and University of Michigan collaborated on the work, which was supported by the\nJuvenile Diabetes Research Foundation\nand the\nNational Institutes of Health . A follow up study testing the approach in non-human primates has already begun.\n\u201cWe have been able to demonstrate that we can create a biomaterial that interrupts the body\u2019s desire to reject the transplant, while not requiring the recipient to remain on continuous standard immunosuppression,\u201d said\nHaval Shirwan , the Dr. Michael and Joan Hamilton Endowed Chair in Autoimmune Disease at the\nUniversity of Louisville School of Medicine\nand director of the Molecular Immunomodulation Program at the Institute for Cellular Therapeutics at the university. \u201cWe anticipate that further study will demonstrate potential use for many transplant types, including bone marrow and solid organs.\u201d\nIn the United States, some 1.25 million persons have type 1 diabetes, which is different from the more common type 2 diabetes. Type 1 diabetes is caused by immune system destruction of the pancreatic islet cells that produce insulin in response to blood glucose levels. Treatment involves frequent injection of insulin to replace what the islets no longer produce. There is no long-term cure for the disease, though persons with type 1 diabetes have been treated experimentally with islet cell transplants \u2013 which almost always fail after a few years even with strong suppression of the immune system.\n\u201cDrugs that allow the transplantation of the islet cells are toxic to them,\u201d said\nAndr\u00e9s Garc\u00eda , the Rae S. and Frank H. Neely Chair and Regents' Professor in Georgia Tech\u2019s\nGeorge W. Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering . \u201cClinical trials with transplantation of islets showed effectiveness, but after a few years, the grafts were rejected. There is a lot of hope for this treatment, but we just can\u2019t get consistent improvement.\u201d\nAmong the problems, Garc\u00eda said, is toxicity to the islet cells from the immune system suppression, which also makes patients more susceptible to other adverse effects such as infections and tumors. Other researchers are exploring techniques to protect the islets from attack, but have so far not been successful.\nThe research reported in\nNature Materials\ntakes a totally different approach. By presenting the FasL protein \u2013 which is a central regulator of immune system cells \u2013 the researchers can prevent the immune system from attacking the cells. Once they are educated at the time of transplantation, the cells appear to retain their acceptance of the transplanted islet cells long after the FasL has disappeared.\n\u201cAt the time of transplantation, we take the islets that are harvested from cadavers and simply mix them with our particles in the operating room and deliver them to the animal,\u201d Garc\u00eda explained. \u201cWe do not have to modify the islets or suppress the immune system. After treatment, the animals can function normally and are cured from the diabetes while retaining their full immune system operation.\u201d\nThe hydrogels can be prepared up to two weeks ahead of the transplant, and can be used with any islet cells. \u201cThe key technical advance is the ability to make this material that induces immune acceptance that can simply be mixed with the islets and delivered. We can make the biomaterial in our lab and ship them to where the transplantation will be done, potentially making it an off-the-shelf therapeutic.\u201d\nIn the experimental mice, the islets were implanted into the kidneys and into an abdominal fat pad. If the treatment is ultimately used in humans, the islets and biomaterial would likely be placed laparoscopically into the omentum, a tissue with significant vasculature that is similar to the fat pad in mice. Garcia\u2019s lab has previously shown that it can stimulate blood vessel growth into islet cells transplanted into this tissue in mice.\nIn future work, the researchers want to see if the graft acceptance can be retained in more complex immune systems, and for longer periods of time. By reducing damage to the cadaver islets, the new technique may be able to expand the number of patients that can treated with available donor cells.\nGarc\u00eda\u2019s lab uses polymer hydrogel particles that are about 150 microns in diameter, about the same size as the islet cells. They engineer the particles to capture the FasL \u2013 a novel recombinant protein developed by Shirwan and Esma S. Yolcu, associate professor of microbiology and immunology at the University of Louisville \u2013 on the particle surface, where it can be seen by the effector cells.\nIn addition to those already mentioned, the research team included Devon M.
