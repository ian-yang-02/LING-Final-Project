The results of that battle can be seen in the oddly shaped case, hospitalization, and fatality-count graphs, a new study suggests.\nThe tension between awareness and fatigue can lead to case-count plateaus, shoulder-like dynamics, and oscillations as rising numbers of deaths cause people to become more cautious before they let down their guard to engage once again in behaviors that increase risk for transmission, which, in turn, leads to rising death counts \u2014 and renewed awareness.\n\u201cEpidemics don\u2019t necessarily have a single peak after which the risk subsides,\u201d said\nJoshua Weitz , Patton Distinguished Professor of\nBiological Sciences\nand founding director of the Interdisciplinary Ph.D. in Quantitative Biosciences at the Georgia Institute of Technology. \u201cPeople\u2019s behaviors are both influenced by and influence epidemic dynamics, potentially driving plateaus, and oscillations in incidence.\u201d\nA paper describing the connection between human behavior and viral spread was published this month in the journal\nProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences . It was authored by researchers at Georgia Tech, McMaster University, Princeton University, and Texas A&M.\nIn the early days of the pandemic, many scientists turned to traditional epidemiological studies, which showed epidemic cases could rise to a peak and then fall smoothly as immunity to the infection reached high levels in a population in the absence of large-scale interventions. Public health messages urged the population to \u201cflatten the curve\u201d to prevent disease from overwhelming hospitals.\n\u201cWe were concerned that a focus on \u2018the peak\u2019 was potentially misguided because it implied that the shape was a feature of the disease alone without considering the consequence of behavior,\u201d Weitz said. \u201cIn reality, there does not have to be a single peak during an epidemic.\u201d\n\u201cIf people are aware of the severity of the epidemic, they may change their behavior, and if they change their behavior, there will be fewer severe outcomes,\u201d Weitz said. \u201cBut if awareness is short-term, individuals may tire of public health regulations and the virus will come roaring back. Instead of a single peak in cases, there can be plateaus or oscillations balanced between cautious behavior and relaxation.\u201d\nThe research team analyzed data from the early phase of the epidemic and found evidence that the decrease in fatalities after a peak was slower than the rise toward it. However, in contrast to simple models of awareness-driven behavior, the research team also found evidence that individuals tended to increase their activity \u2014 as measured by mobility indicators \u2014 before epidemic severity waned. This means that individuals may have grown fatigued, worsening the epidemic severity. The study also found that other preventive measures, like mask wearing, have the potential to avert worst-case outcomes in disease transmission even as mobility increases in light of fatigue.\n\u201cThis study underlines the importance of human behavior in driving epidemic outcomes,\u201d said Jonathan Dushoff from the Department of Biology at McMaster University. \u201cTo make good predictions beyond the short term, we need to understand all of the factors driving human responses to the virus \u2014 fear, fatigue, information, misinformation, and so forth. We have a long way to go.\u201d\nWeitz and Dushoff share optimism as well as concerns on the potential effects of anticipation of imminent vaccine distribution on behavior associated with transmission.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to be sure what impacts vaccine distribution will have on behavior,\u201d Dushoff said. \u201cThere is concern in public health circles that people who think the vaccine is just around the corner could relax their guard. Human behavior is complicated.\u201d\nLessons for future public health responses may help focus on the role of human behavior as well as communications that make disease impacts personal, fostering long-term awareness and changes in behavior that can reduce collective transmission.\nWeitz and Dushoff coauthored the study with Sang Woo Park from the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at Princeton University and Professor Ceyhun Eksin from the Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering at Texas A&M.\nThis research was supported by the Simons Foundation (SCOPE Award ID 329108), the Army Research Office (W911NF1910384), National Institutes of Health (1R01AI46592-01), and National Science Foundation (1806606 and 1829636).
