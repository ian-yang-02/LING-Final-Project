Known as the Science, Technology and Engineering Pipeline (STEP), the ambitious program is returning for a second year, having won praise from both participating students and their teachers. All STEP projects directly contribute to ongoing undergraduate- or graduate-level research work. This year, the program is conducted under the auspices of the Georgia Tech Aerospace Systems Design Laboratory (ASDL) and the NASA Georgia Space Grant Consortium (GSGC). The two-month program is free to those who are accepted. The Atlanta-area students work in teams, advised by Georgia Tech research scientists and graduate students who serve as mentors. \u201cInterest in the program has been strong all spring, and applications have come in at a pretty high rate,\u201d said Kelly Griendling, a Georgia Tech research engineer who designed and directed the STEP program. \u201cI've gotten a lot of emails that basically say, \u2018I heard from my friend that this was a great program, and I'd like to do it.\u2019 \u201d Last summer\u2019s two-month program, she explained, dropped a wide range of knotty aerospace and vehicle related problems into the laps of student teams. The teams worked on portions of these real-world projects, and what the students achieved went to advance those projects. The students could ask for help from their mentors when necessary, but most of the time they worked on their own. Kelly Ingle, a teacher at Kennesaw Mountain High School who is familiar with STEP, believes that the students who participated in last summer\u2019s program experienced \u201creal life,\u201d gaining independence, improving problem-solving abilities, and learning to be team players in actual research. \u201cI have two students in my current classes who attended STEP last summer,\u201d Ingle said. \u201cWatching their approach to research this semester, it\u2019s evident to me that the STEP experience was beneficial.\u201d The atmosphere in the STEP research laboratories last summer seemed both highly enthusiastic and very serious. On one late-July afternoon, a visitor to STEP found a 10th grade student working at a computer developing robotic-vision capability software for a U.S. Navy autonomous boat concept. A few feet away, two 10th grade students were using a CAD workstation to explore a NASA project that aims to move an asteroid millions of miles through space to a moon orbit. Nearby, an 11th grader was trouble-shooting a hybrid-electric aircraft engine. At the next desk his colleagues were working on the hybrid engine itself, which had been designed to power an innovative unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) that was being developed by yet another STEP team. Last summer\u2019s youthful researchers seemed to like STEP\u2019s throw-them-in-the-deep-end approach. Nick Tysver, a 10th grader from Lithia Springs High School who was on the autonomous boat/robotics vision team, told a visitor last summer: \"It was really interesting \u2013 on the first day the mentors were like, 'This is your project, get going.\u2019 That isn't at all like high school, where they inch you along \u2013 here they get you going in the right direction, and you know you're going to end up doing fine.\" Projects for the 2015 STEP session haven\u2019t been finalized. They will likely include both established and new research topics. Both new students and some returning students will participate in this summer\u2019s program. \u201cGSGC is thrilled to be working with ASDL to expand the highly effective program to multiple labs in Aerospace Engineering,\u201d said Professor Stephen Ruffin, director of the GSGC. Although summer 2015 applications have recently closed, interested parties can contact Kelly Griendling ( kelly.griendling@asdl.gatech.edu ) to inquire about applications for future semesters. During the 2014 session, most students participated on one of six teams: The Hybrid Electric team worked on an airborne hybrid-electric propulsion system designed by a Georgia Tech graduate student. The UAV Design team was tasked with designing an unmanned aircraft that would be powered by the hybrid electric engine. The Asteroid Capture team worked on a NASA plan to redirect an asteroid to a stable orbit around the moon, where astronauts can later visit it for research purposes. The Quadrotor team was required to assemble and test several kits for quadrotors \u2013 small helicopters propelled by four propellers \u2013 and then design, build and test a custom quadrotor. The Rotor/Propeller Testing team performed a series of wind-tunnel tests on various motor-propeller combinations, to gather data and make performance predictions that can be used to support vehicle design efforts. The Autonomous Boat team focused on developing software code for an autonomous boat design, as part of a Naval Engineering Education Center (NEEC) project.\u00a0 Research News Georgia Institute of Technology 177 North Avenue Atlanta, Georgia 30332-0181 USA Media Relations Contact : John Toon (404-894-6986) ( jtoon@gatech.edu ).
