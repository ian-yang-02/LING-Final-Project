These \u201creproductive tourists\u201d are more likely, compared to Americans, to use egg donors and carriers and genetically screen early embryos.\nThe study is the most detailed picture of cross-border reproductive care (CBRC) in the United States to date. It analyzed more than 1.2 million ART cycles that were submitted to the National ART Surveillance System (NASS) from 2006 to 2013. NASS is the federally mandated reporting system that collects ART procedure information under the Fertility Clinic Success Rate and Certification Act of 1992.\nDuring that time frame, the number of non-residents receiving ART treatment in the United States more than doubled, growing from 1.2 percent of the total number of cases to 2.8 percent (nearly 5,400 in 2013).\n\u201cWhile the number of cycles is relatively small, it is definitely growing,\u201d said Georgia Tech\u2019s Aaron Levine, the associate professor in the School of Public Policy who led the study. \u201cNon-U.S. residents are increasingly coming here for specialized ART treatments that may not be available in their home countries. And they\u2019re using these techniques at greater rates than Americans.\u201d\nNon-resident cycles had a higher use of oocyte (or egg) donation (42.6 percent vs. 10.6 percent of American cycles). They were also nearly eight times more likely (12.4 percent vs. 1.6 percent) to use gestational carriers/surrogates, and almost four times more likely to receive preimplantation genetic diagnosis or screening (19.1 percent vs. 5.3 percent).\nAmerican and non-American patients had similar embryo transfer and multiple birth rates.\nPatients from 147 countries received care in the U.S., with the largest number coming from Canada. Nearly 50 percent of Canadian patients used donated eggs, likely reflecting Canadian legal restrictions on payment for egg donors. Patients from the United Kingdom and Japan, the third and fourth most common source countries, also made frequent use of donated eggs \u2014 more than 50 percent of U.K. patients and more than 90 percent of Japanese patients used this technique. The second largest number of patients came from Mexico, with these patients using specialized techniques at about the same rate as U.S. patients.\nLevine admits the numbers are small but not trivial. Data has been limited, and CBRC hasn\u2019t been well studied in the past.\n\u201cOur results highlight real challenges for patients to access this important medical care,\u201d said Levine. \u201cUnderstanding these challenges is critical to improving access to ART today and to helping ensure patients who travel across borders to receive ART treatment receive high-quality care.\u201d\nLevine also says understanding CBRC ties into other issues, such as treatment for egg donors and carriers, and the health concerns that may be linked to some ART procedures.\nThe paper, \u201cAssessing the use of assisted reproductive technology in the United States by non-United States residents,\u201d was published online in the journal\nFertility and Sterility\nearlier this month.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nJason Maderer\nNational Media Relations\nmaderer@gatech.edu\n404.660.2926\nEmail\nmaderer@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
