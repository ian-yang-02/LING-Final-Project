Retailers are having to ration their supplies, some parents have resorted to shipping in formula from overseas, and social media sites have been used to crowdsource goods to be shipped to parents nervous about where their children\u2019s next meal might come from.\nGeorgia Tech economics expert Tibor Besedes says it has been a perfect storm of issues to create this stress-inducing situation.\n\u201cLike many other industries, the formula producers have faced supply chain issues with respect to ingredients and containers. Waves of Covid-19 infections have affected their workforce and how much formula they can produce,\u201d explained Besedes.\nThe final straw that may have led to this nationwide shortage: an Abbott production shutdown in February 2022 after several babies were sickened and two died from bacterial infections connected to consuming baby formula from the Sturgis, Michigan facility. A recall followed, and that facility is believed to make at least 20% of all formula bought by consumers nationwide.\n\u201cIt is one of a few plants in the U.S. producing formula,\u201d said Besedes. \u201cThat fact itself is a bottleneck as those few plants operating in the U.S. produce 98% of all formula sold in the U.S.\u201d\n\u201cThe formula market has been highly concentrated for a long time,\u201d explained Lindsay Rose Bullinger, Georgia Tech assistant professor of public policy. \u201cNow we\u2019re dealing with a crisis and it\u2019s hard to be proactive.\u201d\nThe overwhelming majority of those formula products are only made by four different companies, explains Wendy White, a nationally known food safety expert.\n\u201cBecause infant formula is the sole source of nutrition and targeted at such a vulnerable population, it has extra regulations in the Infant Formula Act of 1980,\u201d explains White.\nThis includes mandatory registration for any infant formula manufacturers and requirements for all formulation, processing details, and ingredient lists to be filed with the FDA.\nThe regulations are critical, according to Bullinger.\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to make a product comparable to breast milk. Newborn children can\u2019t digest many of the proteins in cow\u2019s milk,\u201d she explained.\nFormula is developed by scientists in highly regulated environments for infants that are incredibly susceptible to sickness as their immune and digestive systems have just begun adapting to nourishment outside of the womb.\nDiluted or homemade options do not provide the right balance of nutrients that infants need at the most critical time of their lives. Manufactured formulas are made in highly sterile environments to avoid harmful additions from getting into these mixtures.\n\u201cIt\u2019s incredibly hard to get that right in a home environment without introducing bacteria,\u201d Bullinger said.\nThose strict regulations also mean that possible scenarios to help alleviate this formula shortage have been complicated. Just shipping some in from another country? Not so fast.\n\u201cForeign manufacturers need to obtain FDA approvals to begin exporting to the U.S. to make up the shortage,\u201d said Besedes. \u201cThe FDA is now looking at manufacturers based in countries with similar regulations to expedite their approvals and increase shipments to the U.S.\u201d\nThe first relief came from overseas within the past week \u2013 a shipment of about 70,000 pounds of formula. More foreign shipments are expected in the coming days, but the supply may only last for about a week as issues continue to compound.\n\u201cOnce there was a recall and parents heard, they started stockpiling formula,\u201d said White. The result is taking already short supplies and stretching them even thinner.\n\u201cThe supply chain has to also deal with the unneeded bullwhip effect due to shortage gaming and hoarding behavior, making the situation even worse than what it should be,\u201d says Operations Management Associate Professor Morvarid Rahmani.\nWhite also says that 50% of the infant formula in America is purchased through government subsidies.\nStates who provide this assistance often sign exclusive contracts with one of these four formula manufacturers. Abbott carries the contract in nearly two-thirds of U.S. states \u2013 complicating the purchases for families with infants in those locations.\n\u201cFamilies in communities that are economically disenfranchised may be disproportionately affected,\u201d explained Bullinger. \u201cBut even if you have the money, if you cannot buy formula how else are you supposed to feed an infant.\u201d\nFamilies who rely on Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, also commonly known as food stamps) or Supplemental Nutrition for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) may not be able to choose which brand of formula they can receive. They can only get the formula their state has a contract with. If it is out, they may just be out of luck.\nSome of the most hard-to-find infant formulas are the specialized products developed for newborns with milk allergies or other digestive issues. There\u2019s a special emphasis on sourcing those products for parents in need.\nSo how much longer could this shortage impact American consumers? At least a few weeks, Georgia Tech\u2019s experts say.\n\u201cAbbott is estimating that it\u2019ll take about two weeks to get production to resume but another 6-8 weeks to get formula back on supermarket shelves,\u201d says White.\nThat means the closed facility should be open in late May with production back up to full speed sometime in August. Limited diversity in the market has left parents in a bind.\n\u201cA shortage could be alleviated by increasing output of other plants and manufacturers, which is being done, but it is difficult to replace an entire plant,\u201d explained Besedes.\n\u201cRamping up production has been difficult because of shortages in labor and ingredients as well as production scheduling challenges,\u201d explained Rahmani.\nSome desperate parents have had to resort to extreme measures. But pediatricians have said infants should only be fed formula or breast milk. Anything else is likely deficient. Using alternative feeding methods could lead to long-term problems.\n\u201cThere is a risk that a shortage will mean babies will not be getting the nutrition they need to develop. That could lead to a range of health problems affecting their physical growth and brain development,\u201d explained Senior Research Engineer Maureen Linden from Georgia Tech\u2019s Center for Inclusive Design and Innovation.\n\u201cConsumers should listen to their pediatricians and other experts and follow their advice. Pediatricians may have available samples they can give out,\u201d said Besedes.\nThey can also offer advice for alternative baby formula (to the one in shortage) which is available. Medical experts are strongly advising against diluting formula or trying to recreate it at home which could cause long-lasting damage.\n\u201cWe may see a rise in the rate of developmental disabilities in the age group that is presently reliant on formula \u2013 those presently six months or less,\u201d says Linden.\nNutrition is the most important thing in an infant\u2019s life. It\u2019s the number one priority \u2013 making sure we are feeding them and they are developing,\u201d explained Bullinger.\nThat\u2019s why infants often get so many checkups \u2013 to make sure they are growing and gaining weight. Proper nutrition is critical for that to happen.\nIn the meantime, consumers can take their own action. White says it\u2019s worth trying to buy online or shopping around at different stores.\nThe federal government has relaxed regulations for SNAP and WIC recipients to be able to get products with increased flexibility.\nThe White House has also invoked the Defense Production Act which is aimed to help manufacturers ramp up output quickly.\n\u201cThose companies will have first dibs at materials and ingredients that are needed to make formula,\u201d said Bullinger.\n\u201cThis shortage should be temporary, as demand settles, and supply is replenished from the reopened Abbott plant and FDA-approved imports,\u201d says White.\nRegardless, Georgia Tech experts have said we should have seen this coming and could have been better prepared and quicker to act \u2013\u00a0particularly for the sake of the youngest among us.\n\u201cThe FDA, Biden\u2019s administration, and baby formula manufacturers have been slow in taking actions during the past few months to prevent that. This crisis could have been prevented by timely actions,\u201d said Rahmani.\n\u201cInfants always get the short end of the stick. They can\u2019t speak for themselves,\u201d said Bullinger.\nExperts in this story:\nTibor Besedes\nWendy White\nLindsay Rose Bullinger\nMaureen Linden\nMorvarid Rahmani , associate professor, Operations Management Scheller College of Business\nAdditional Images\nContact\nSteven Norris\nDirector, Media Relations and Social Media\nGeorgia Tech Institute Communications\nEmail\nsnorris@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
