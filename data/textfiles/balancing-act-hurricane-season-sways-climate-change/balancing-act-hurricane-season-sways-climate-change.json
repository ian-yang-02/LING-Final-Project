While the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is forecasting a \u201cnear-normal\u201d 2023, experts say that climate change paints a more unpredictable picture for the future.\nBehind the 2023 projections is a balancing act of rising oceanic temperatures and the onset of the climate phenomenon El Ni\u00f1o, explains Susan Lozier, dean and Betsy Middleton and John Clark Sutherland Chair in the College of Sciences. The waters of the tropical Atlantic Ocean are currently 1 \u2013 3\u00b0C above average, which would typically signify the potential for more intense activity, but the wind shear associated with El Ni\u00f1o acts as a deterrent for hurricane formation.\nIncreasing Intensity\nBut what could happen when the shield of El Ni\u00f1o isn't present to counteract the rising temperatures in the tropical Atlantic?\n\"Climate change is leading to warmer surface temperatures. We know that will lead to more intense hurricanes, but we don't know if it will necessarily lead to more hurricanes. As climate change progresses, we are interested in understanding how weather patterns will be disrupted, including those related to hurricane formation and pathways,\" said Lozier, who recently served as president of\nthe American Geophysical Union .\nShe further explained that the increased intensity is a result of the warm waters releasing additional energy into the storm as it forms. This consequence of climate change could present problems for the Tech campus and the city of Atlanta due to the risk of torrential rainfall. According to the National Weather Service, flooding\nhas proven to be the deadliest hazard associated with hurricanes over the past decade.\n\"When people think about hurricanes, they generally think about damaging winds. Winds are damaging, but increasingly, the most damaging part of a hurricane is the immense amount of moisture they carry,\" Lozier said, reflecting on the 2017 landfall of Hurricane Harvey. \"An area like Atlanta could be affected by heavy rainfall associated with the path of a hurricane. The winds will have mostly died down by the time a storm reaches Atlanta, but as the climate warms, warmer air holds more moisture, and because of that, the expectation is that there will be more rainfall associated with hurricanes and tropical storms.\u201d\nBeyond Reducing Carbon Emissions\nFueling the rising temperatures in the world's oceans is an increase in carbon emissions, and simply curtailing them may not be a solution.\n\"The private and public sectors are increasingly looking at actively removing carbon from the atmosphere because we are unlikely to limit global warming simply by curtailing emissions. Active carbon drawdown from the atmosphere and the ocean are active areas of research right now,\u201d Lozier said.\nTech researchers are at the forefront of this effort, highlighted by a partnership between the Institute, the Georgia Aquarium, and Ocean Visions\u00ad\u00ad \u2014\nthe Center for Ocean-Climate Solutions . Lozier represents the Institute as a partnership lead at the center, where the primary focus is the design and delivery of scalable and equitable ocean-based solutions to reduce the effects of climate change and build climate-resilient marine ecosystems and coastal communities.\nAssociate Professor\nChris Reinhard\nis exploring how\ncoastal ecosystem restoration\ncan permanently capture carbon dioxide from the atmosphere as it becomes buried in sediments on the seafloor. The overall process of removing carbon from the air can be costly. To combat that, a team of researchers in the School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering is\ndeveloping a traditional direct air capture system\nthat is cheaper to operate and more efficient.

However, don\u2019t wait for a storm\u2019s arrival to start preparing. Here are tips from the National Weather Service on how to get ready for a hurricane:\nPack a\u00a0 basic disaster supplies kit . Check emergency equipment such as flashlights, generators, and storm shutters regularly.\nWrite or review your family emergency plan.\u00a0 Before an emergency happens, sit down with your family or close friends and decide how you will get in contact with each other, where you will go, and what you will do in an emergency. Keep a copy of this plan in your emergency kit or another safe place where you can access it in the event of a disaster. Start at the\u00a0Ready.Gov \u00a0 emergency plan webpage .\nReview your insurance policies \u00a0 to ensure that you have adequate coverage for your home and personal property.\nUnderstand NWS forecast products,\u00a0 especially the meaning of\u00a0 NWS watches and warnings.\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
