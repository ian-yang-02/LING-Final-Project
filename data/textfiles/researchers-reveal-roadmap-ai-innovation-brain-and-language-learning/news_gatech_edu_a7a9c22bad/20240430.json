Tools like ChatGPT and Gemini are widely available at the tap of a button \u2014 but just how\nsmart\nare these AIs?\nA new multidisciplinary research effort co-led by\nAnna (Anya) Ivanova , assistant professor in the\nSchool of Psychology\nat Georgia Tech, alongside\nKyle Mahowald , an assistant professor in the Department of Linguistics at the University of Texas at Austin, is working to uncover just that.\nTheir results could lead to innovative AIs that are more similar to the human brain than ever before \u2014 and also help neuroscientists and psychologists who are unearthing the secrets of our own minds.\nThe study,\n\u201cDissociating Language and Thought in Large Language Models,\u201d\nis published this week in the scientific journal\nTrends in Cognitive Sciences . The work is already making waves in the scientific community: an earlier\npreprint\nof the paper, released in January 2023, has already been cited more than 150 times by fellow researchers.\nThe\nresearch team\nhas continued to refine the research for this final journal publication.\n\u201cChatGPT became available while we were finalizing the preprint,\u201d Ivanova explains. \u201cOver the past year, we've had an opportunity to update our arguments in light of this newer generation of models, now including ChatGPT.\u201d\nForm versus function\nThe study focuses on large language models (LLMs), which include AIs like ChatGPT. LLMs are text prediction models, and create writing by predicting which word comes next in a sentence \u2014 just like how a cell phone or email service like Gmail might suggest what next word you might want to write. However, while this type of language learning is extremely effective at creating coherent sentences, that doesn\u2019t necessarily signify intelligence.\nIvanova\u2019s team argues that\nformal competence\n\u2014 creating a well-structured, grammatically correct sentence \u2014 should be differentiated from\nfunctional competence\n\u2014 answering the right question, communicating the correct information, or appropriately communicating. They also found that while LLMs trained on text prediction are often very good at formal skills, they still struggle with functional skills.\n\u201cWe humans have the\ntendency to conflate language and thought,\u201d Ivanova says. \u201cI think that\u2019s an important thing to keep in mind as we're trying to figure out what these models are capable of, because using that ability to be good at language, to be good at formal competence, leads many people to assume that AIs are also good at thinking \u2014 even when that's not the case.\nIt's a heuristic that we developed when interacting with other humans over thousands of years of evolution, but now in some respects, that heuristic is broken,\u201d Ivanova explains.\nThe distinction between formal and functional competence is also vital in rigorously testing an AI\u2019s capabilities, Ivanova adds. Evaluations often don\u2019t distinguish formal and functional competence, making it difficult to assess what factors are determining a model\u2019s success or failure. The need to develop distinct tests is one of the team\u2019s more widely accepted findings, and one that some researchers in the field have already begun to implement.\nCreating a modular system\nWhile the human tendency to conflate functional and formal competence may have hindered understanding of LLMs in the past, our human brains could also be the key to unlocking more powerful AIs.\nLeveraging the tools of cognitive neuroscience while a postdoctoral associate at\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) , Ivanova and her team studied brain activity in neurotypical individuals via fMRI, and used behavioral assessments of individuals with brain damage to test the causal role of brain regions in language and cognition \u2014 both conducting new research and drawing on previous studies. The team\u2019s results showed that human brains use different regions for functional and formal competence, further supporting this distinction in AIs.\n\u201cOur research shows that in the brain, there is a language processing module and separate modules for reasoning,\u201d Ivanova says. This modularity could also serve as a blueprint for how to develop future AIs.\n\u201cBuilding on insights from human brains \u2014 where the language processing system is sharply distinct from the systems that support our ability to think \u2014 we argue that the language-thought distinction is conceptually important for thinking about, evaluating, and improving large language models, especially given recent efforts to imbue these models with human-like intelligence,\u201d says Ivanova\u2019s former advisor and study co-author\nEvelina Fedorenko , a professor of brain and cognitive sciences at MIT and a member of the McGovern Institute for Brain Research.\nDeveloping AIs in the pattern of the human brain could help create more powerful systems \u2014 while also helping them dovetail more naturally with human users. \u201cGenerally, differences in a mechanism\u2019s internal structure affect behavior,\u201d Ivanova says. \u201cBuilding a system that has a broad macroscopic organization similar to that of the human brain could help ensure that it might be more aligned with humans down the road.\u201d\nIn the rapidly developing world of AI, these systems are ripe for experimentation. After the team\u2019s preprint was published, OpenAI announced their intention to add plug-ins to their GPT models.\n\u201cThat plug-in system is actually very similar to what we suggest,\u201d Ivanova adds. \u201cIt takes a modularity approach where the language model can be an interface to another specialized module within a system.\u201d\nWhile the OpenAI plug-in system will include features like booking flights and ordering food, rather than cognitively inspired features, it demonstrates that \u201cthe approach has a lot of potential,\u201d Ivanova says.\nThe future of AI \u2014 and what it can tell us about ourselves\nWhile our own brains might be the key to unlocking better, more powerful AIs, these AIs might also help us better understand ourselves.\n\u201cWhen researchers try to study the brain and cognition, it's often useful to have some smaller system where you can actually go in and poke around and see what's going on before you get to the immense complexity,\u201d Ivanova explains.\nHowever, since human language is unique, model or animal systems are more difficult to relate. That's where LLMs come in.\n\u201cThere are lots of surprising similarities between how one would approach the study of the brain and the study of an artificial neural network\u201d like a large language model, she adds. \u201cThey are both information processing systems that have biological or artificial neurons to perform computations.\u201d\nIn many ways, the human brain is still a black box, but\nopenly available AIs offer a unique opportunity to see the synthetic system's inner workings and modify variables, and explore these corresponding systems like never before.\n\u201c It's a really wonderful model that we have a lot of control over,\u201d Ivanova says. \u201c N eural networks \u2014 they are amazing.\u201d\nAlong with\u00a0 Anna (Anya) Ivanova, Kyle Mahowald, and Evelina Fedorenko, the\nresearch team also includes\nIdan Blank\n(University of California, Los Angeles), as well as\nNancy Kanwisher\nand\nJoshua Tenenbaum\n(Massachusetts Institute of Technology).\nDOI:\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.tics.2024.01.011\nResearcher Acknowledgements\nFor helpful conversations, we thank Jacob Andreas, Alex Warstadt, Dan Roberts, Kanishka Misra, students in the 2023 UT Austin Linguistics 393 seminar, the attendees of the Harvard LangCog journal club, the attendees of the UT Austin Department of Linguistics SynSem seminar, Gary Lupyan, John Krakauer, members of the Intel Deep Learning group, Yejin Choi and her group members, Allyson Ettinger, Nathan Schneider and his group members, the UT NLL Group, attendees of the KUIS AI Talk Series at Ko\u00e7 University in Istanbul, Tom McCoy, attendees of the NYU Philosophy of Deep Learning conference and his group members, Sydney Levine, organizers and attendees of the ILFC seminar, and others who have engaged with our ideas.
