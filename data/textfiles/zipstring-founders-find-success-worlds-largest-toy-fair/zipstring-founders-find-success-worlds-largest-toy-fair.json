They were one of nearly 3,000 exhibitors and their product was on display for a week as 70,000 industry traders from around the world perused the displays.\nUsing gravity, lift, tension, and drag to keep a standard loop of string airborne, ZipString allows the user to perform tricks, and watching consumers interact with their product is what keeps Fazio and Hillam motivated.\n\"The first time someone uses a ZipString, there is this expression in their face of pure, raw wonderment. Whether they're 3 or 103 years old, it's the same expression. We call it the \u2018smile of wonderment,\u2019\" Hillam said.\nNuremberg Mayor Marcus K\u00f6nig stopped by the tent to check out ZipString during the fair, and after meeting with traders, the business partners left another step closer to their goal of expanding internationally.\nDomestically, an ongoing partnership with internet sensation Dude Perfect has landed their product in Walmart stores nationwide, and a memorable 2022 appearance on ABC\u2019s Shark Tank further solidified ZipString's viral presence.\nThe success they've found so far is something the pair only dreamed of when Hillam returned to Johns Creek after withdrawing from BYU in September 2021, soon after the two met at church. Fazio quickly followed suit, leaving Tech to pursue a dream of succeeding in the toy industry.\n\"We just looked at each other and thought, we're going to totally regret this if we don't try. It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and I knew that Georgia Tech would still be there,\" he said.\nBut as the ZipString founders work to expand their business out of the basement of Hillam's parents\u2019 home, Fazio has returned to Tech to finish his electrical and computer engineering degree. Balancing coursework and the business is difficult, but Fazio says what he's picked up in the classroom has directly contributed to the development of ZipString Luma \u2014 a new, glow-in-the-dark version of the product.\nIn conversations with colleagues and fellow students, Fazio is often reminded that he isn't taking the most traditional path, but he wouldn't have it any other way.\n\"We often get the question, 'How did you get into the toy industry?' Because when you go into electrical engineering, it's as if you\u2019re either going to work for Lockheed or Boeing,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, I'm finding myself with my own business in the toy industry. It's very hard work. You're stressed all the time, but it's just an awesome experience.\"\nThe same sense of wonderment that Fazio and Hillam see on the faces of customers is what drew them to this entrepreneurial endeavor, and through the ups and downs, Hillam says that, sometimes, \"You have to make time to play with the toys.\"\nAdditional Media\nNuremberg Mayor Marcus K\u00f6nig stopped by ZipString's tent at Spielwarenmesse \u2014 the world's largest toy fair.\nContact\nSteven Gagliano\n- Institute Communications\nEmail\nSteven.gagliano@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
