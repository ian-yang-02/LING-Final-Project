Markus Bowling, U.S. Army)\nAug 09, 2019\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nA Ramblin\u2019 Wreck from Georgia Tech is the new\nchief of staff of the U.S. Army.\nGen. James C. McConville\ntook over as the Army\u2019s top officer August 9 . He replaces Gen. Mark A. Milley, who was confirmed in July as the next chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\nMcConville earned a master\u2019s degree in aerospace engineering from Georgia Tech in 1990. A decorated helicopter pilot, McConville is the first aviator to serve as the Army\u2019s chief.\n\u201cArmed with a master\u2019s in engineering to go with decades of flying and maintaining helicopters, he brings a unique understanding of how to operate and support complex weapons and equipment,\u201d said Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy. \u201cIn this respect, no senior officer is better prepared to lead the Army as we undertake what will be a massive and, yes, risky and costly transformation towards more advanced weapons and war-fighting approaches.\u201d\nMcConville has served as the Army vice chief of staff under Milley, where he already has been leading those modernization efforts. It\u2019s work he said he has been well prepared for, in part, thanks to his graduate studies.\n\u201cGeorgia Tech is a tremendous school of higher learning, and it helped me as a leader to think critically, innovate and solve the most difficult problems. Georgia Tech also taught me the power of technology and to challenge the status quo,\u201d McConville said. \u201cThe practical knowledge I gained helped me find tangible ways to overcome challenges while expanding my sense of what is truly possible if we work as a team and don't limit our creativity.\u201d\nMcConville recalled sending his first email \u2014 using a dial-up modem \u2014\u00a0while he was on campus, an interesting inflection point for the man who noted at the change of responsibility ceremony that the Army \u201ccannot be an industrial age Army in the information age. We must transform all our industrial age processes to be more effective, protect our resources, and make better decisions.\u201d\nAt Georgia Tech, McConville played on the club hockey team and celebrated the birth of his first son. (That son and his two siblings are now all Army officers themselves.) McConville praised the professors he studied under in the Daniel Guggenheim School of Aerospace Engineering, especially Daniel Schrage and Dimitri Mavris.\n\u201cThey were great mentors and coaches, and very committed to the development of their students,\u201d he said.\n\u201cEven when Gen. McConville was a master\u2019s student, we knew he would go far,\u201d said Mavris, a Regents Professor and also McConville\u2019s brother-in-law. \u201cThroughout his distinguished career, he has demonstrated an exemplary level of commitment and service to our country. We are confident he is the best man for the job and that he will excel at leading and preparing the Army for the future.\u201d\nMcConville\u2019s career includes stints commanding the 4 th\nBrigade, 1 st\nCavalry Division, where his aviators played a decisive role in the battle of Fallujah in Iraq. Later, he became the longest-serving division commander in Army history when he led the 101 st\nAirborne Division on multiple combat tours over three years.\n\u201cMcConville is one of the most courageous and thoughtful officers I have ever served with,\u201d Milley said. \u201cJim\u2019s blend of battlefield experience, both in the Middle East and in Washington, made him the perfect officer to take over as chief. He has the drive, the background and the vision to make the Army even better.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nMore about Gen.
