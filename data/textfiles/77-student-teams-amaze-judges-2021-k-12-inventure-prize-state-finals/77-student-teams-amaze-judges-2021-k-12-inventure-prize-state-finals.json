The InVenture Prize Competition encourages elementary, middle, and high school students to present projects that identify real-world problems and design unique solutions.\nThis year, 77 teams participated in the competition from all across Georgia and 70 judges participated with live video pitches and a Q&A. On Thursday, Students presented their projects to the judges and the projects were then evaluated based on criteria such as practicality, creativity, marketability and design-based thinking. Each team had their own judging rooms where judges could join in and out of to review all the teams. The synchronous virtual setting allowed for students to receive feedback in real time.\n\u201cThe students and teachers were absolutely thrilled,\u201d said Jasmine Patel, CEISMC Research Associate, \u201cThey loved that they were able to keep the interaction with the judges and to pitch them 'Shark Tank'\u00a0style.\u201d\nOn Wednesday, March 17th, the award ceremony followed the event and included keynote speaker, Marques Colston. Colston is a former NFL Super Bowl Champion, and he is now an Entrepreneur and Venture Capitalist. The keynote incorporated a pre-recorded inspirational message about Colston\u2019s career experience and the hardships he had to overcome. Colton then followed up with a 20-minute live Q&A.\n\u201c[Students] asked amazing questions like: What made you want to become an entrepreneur? What other hardships did you face? Did you encounter racism throughout your career, and how did you overcome that?\u201d said Patel.\nFollowing the keynote, the award ceremony announced the advancement of 38 students to the National Invention Convention & Entrepreneurship Expo (NICEE) Competition that will be held virtually this summer.\nFirst-place winners from this year's K-12 InVenture Prize competition included team \"Yumshies\" from East Side Elementary School, team \"R.E.C.Y.C.L.E.\" from Mount Bethel Elementary School, team \"Tech Blizzard\" from Malcolm Bridge Middle School, and team \u201cOrganization of Students for Innovation\u201d from Alan C.
