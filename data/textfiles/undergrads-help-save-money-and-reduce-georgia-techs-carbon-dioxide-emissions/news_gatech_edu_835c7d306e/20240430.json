Their project, developed over the course of one semester, has received funding from Georgia Tech and will be implemented.\nCarbon dioxide emissions are altering many aspects of the global climate system, posing a variety of risks to society, says\nKim Cobb , a professor in the\nSchool of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences\n(EAS). However, slowing the rate of global CO 2\nemissions has proven difficult. According to recent\ndata from the Environmental Protection agency , the U.S. alone emitted 5.6 billion metric tons of the gas in 2014, about 9 percent more than in 1990. The recent\nParis Agreement \u00a0\u2014 which sets out a plan to limit global warming by controlling greenhouse gas emissions \u2014 was signed by 197 countries but ratified by only 18.\nAccording to Cobb, relatively modest changes in energy demand add up to significant CO 2\nemissions reductions in the long term. In the undergraduate course\nEAS 3110 ,\u00a0entitled \u201cEnergy, the Environment, and Society,\u201d she challenges students to develop projects during the semester that will reduce real-world carbon footprints.\nIn the past seven years, winning projects from the course\u2019s \u201cCarbon Reduction Challenge\u201d have resulted in aggregate reductions of about 2,100 metric tons of CO 2 , according to Cobb. \u201cThat\u2019s roughly equivalent to the annual carbon footprints of 100 Americans,\u201d she says.\nCobb requires that proposed\nprojects offset or avoid at least 20,000 lbs , or about 9 metric tons, of CO 2\nemissions. Projects proving the largest CO 2\nreductions are selected as winners of the challenge.\nThis year\u2019s winning group consisted of Ruchi Aggarwal, Kyle J. Hamilton, Janet L. Ploussard, Max B. Rosenbaum, and Marissa N. Snyder.\u00a0 Their project, called \u201cRays the Roof,\u201d involved retrofitting the roof of the O. Lamar Allen Sustainable Education Building (SEB) with a white, reflective material, which reduces the amount of heat the building absorbs.\nAt a cost of $49,000 to implement, Rays the Roof would reduce the building\u2019s CO 2\nemissions by approximately 453 metric tons over the next 20 years, according to the team. The project will also extend the lifetime of SEB\u2019s roof by 10 years and yield savings of $59,000 on the cost of electricity over 20 years, the team calculated.\nIf the project is successful, similar retrofits may be implemented on other campus buildings, says Mark L. Demyanek, assistant vice president for operations and maintenance at Georgia Tech\u2019s Facilities Management.\nDeveloping a plan to satisfy the requirements took much more time and effort than the group anticipated. The team needed precise calculations on potential energy and money savings, primary sources to support their claims, and exact wording in their final proposal. Group members working on separate portions of the project collaborated throughout the entire semester.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t realize how much time it takes to meet with contractors, Georgia Tech facilities employees, product sales representatives, and all others who were a part of making this project happen,\u201d says Snyder, the third-year biology major who initially proposed the white-roof idea.\nRays the Roof received funding through Georgia Tech\u2019s revolving green fund, which is administered by Facilities Management. According to Demyanek, the fund is devoted to executing energy conservation and sustainability projects developed and vetted by Facilities Management, including projects proposed by Cobb\u2019s students over the past two years.\nDemyanek says the fund was established in 2012 to support projects and construction practices that advance Georgia Tech\u2019s vision for a greener future. To that end, SEB was fitted with multiple energy-monitoring devices upon its completion in 1997. The abundance of data from these monitors made SEB the perfect candidate for the Rays the Roof project.\nFederico Del Risco, a Facilities Management mechanical engineer, assisted the students throughout, ensuring that proper research was completed, calculations were correct, and key language was included in their final proposal.\u00a0 \u201c The Rays team came to us with a really good idea,\u201d he says. \u201cAfter we reviewed their numbers and technical feasibility, it was just a matter\u00a0of providing the proper guidance for them to shape the project into a suitable format\u00a0for requesting funds.\u201d\nAlong with the distinction of having their project funded, each year\u2019s winner of the carbon challenge goes to Washington, D.C., to discuss their projects with staffers who work for Georgia\u2019s congressional representatives.\n\u201cSome of the people we met with were very intrigued by our project because they never realized that something as simple as a white roof could save so much energy in the long run,\u201d says Aggarwal, a first-year mechanical engineering major. \u201cWith the growing emphasis on green initiatives in Washington, and the ease with which our project could be implemented, our idea excited several staffers,\u201d she adds.\n\"The Congressional staffers enjoyed hearing about the winning team\u2019s project,\u201d says Robert Knotts, Georgia Tech's director of federal relations. \u201cMore importantly, the students learned a lot about how science and engineering can influence policy.\u201d\nThat is precisely Cobb\u2019s goal in rewarding the winning groups with trips to Congress. \u201cThe students have shown how much can be achieved through thoughtful individual and collective action, but that is no substitute for meaningful climate policy,\u201d Cobb says. \u201cI hope my students recognize that and feel inspired to identify solutions to our carbon problem, wherever their careers take them.\u201d\nMatt Barr\nScience Communication Intern\nSchool of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences\nAdditional Images\nContact\nA.
