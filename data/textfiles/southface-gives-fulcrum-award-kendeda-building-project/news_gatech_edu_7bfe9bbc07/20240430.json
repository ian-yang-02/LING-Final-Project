The award was presented at the Greenprints conference March 12-14 at Georgia State University.\n\u201cThe Kendeda Building has captured the imagination of the campus, sustainability advocates, design professionals and the construction world,\u201d said Howard Wertheimer, Institute Architect. \u201cIt\u2019s truly an honor to be recognized with a Fulcrum Award at this stage in the project, and we look forward to seeing an even greater impact as we realize the complete vision for this first-of-its kind building in the Southeast.\u201d\nLaunched in November 2017, the Kendeda Building aims to become the first Living Building Challenge 3.1-certified facility of its size and function in the Southeast. It is being funded by a $30 million gift from The Kendeda Fund. The building should be completed in early 2019, with Living Building Challenge 3.1 certification expected in 2020. To be certified under the program, a building must meet all the program requirements over a full 12-month period of continued operations and full occupancy.\nDuring the conference, Southface also presented Fulcrum Awards to Georgia State\u2019s Leafy Green Machine and Live Thrive Atlanta\u2019s Center for Hard to Recycle Materials, and the Len Foote Hike Inn for a Lifetime Achievement Award.\n\u201cThough diverse in scope, each Fulcrum Award recipient exemplifies our vision to promote a regenerative economy, responsible resource use, social equity, and a healthy built environment for all,\u201d Southface president Andrea Pinabell said. \u201cWe are proud to honor these projects that bring us all closer to a better future.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nLiving Building Chronicle\nKendeda Building website\nContact\nlance.wallace@comm.gatech.edu\nEmail\nlance.wallace@comm.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
