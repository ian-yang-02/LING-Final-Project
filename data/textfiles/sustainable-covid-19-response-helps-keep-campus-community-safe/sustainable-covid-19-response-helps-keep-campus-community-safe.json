You are encouraged to read all updated guidance at\nhealth.gatech.edu/coronavirus .\nWe continue to recognize that Covid-19 vaccines and boosters offer safe, effective protection and urge all students, faculty, staff, and visitors to get vaccinated and boosted either on campus or at a local provider. Stamps Health Services continues to conduct vaccine clinics for those who are eligible. You can learn more here:\nhealth.gatech.edu/coronavirus/vaccine .\nAs part of Georgia Tech\u2019s continued monitoring of the overall health of the campus community, we have transitioned from individual surveillance testing to wastewater surveillance testing. Over the past 18 months, Georgia Tech\u2019s Covid-19 testing team has validated the use of wastewater testing for Covid-19 detection and has put in place the infrastructure necessary to conduct broad-based wastewater surveillance. As such, Georgia Tech has created new dashboards to track and report the status of wastewater testing as well as symptomatic positives (students only) from Stamps Health Services. The previous dashboard, that has tracked cases since 2020, will be archived but remain publicly available. Access to the new dashboards can be found here:\nhealth.gatech.edu/coronavirus/monitoring-covid .\n\u201cMany health experts agree that Covid-19 is with us for the foreseeable future, and, while the severity of cases is much less overall, we continue our commitment to track overall trends of the virus in our community,\u201d said Will Smith, director of Emergency Management and Communications for the Georgia Tech Police Department. \u201cWe have been exploring the use of wastewater testing during the pandemic, and it has proven to be an effective and reliable method of tracking the prevalence of Covid-19 in our population.\u201d\nAbout Wastewater Testing:\nWastewater testing, or wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE), is an emerging field used to understand infectious disease transmission and other human health trends evident in sewage or wastewater.\nWhile wastewater testing has existed for more than 40 years, it has rapidly come to the forefront of disease surveillance with the Covid-19 pandemic.\nWastewater testing detects and quantifies the presence in sewage of the genome (RNA genetic material) from the virus that causes Covid-19, SARS-CoV-2.\nThis data helps identify trends of increasing or decreasing community spread of the virus as well as potential \u201chotspots.\u201d\nHigher SARS-CoV-2 genome counts reflect higher rates of Covid-19 infections and, hence, an increased risk to public health.\nBeginning this summer, Georgia Tech deployed eight autosamplers across campus that are programmed to pump small volumes of sewage from a given site at regular time intervals throughout the day, yielding a composite sample of sewage that represents a sample collected over multiple days. Currently, samples are taken for analysis on Monday and Thursday mornings. More information about wastewater testing, including FAQs, may be found here:\nhealth.gatech.edu/coronavirus/monitoring-covid .\n\u201cAs with Georgia Tech\u2019s response to Covid-19 from the beginning, we remain vigilant and will use scientific data to support how we operate to protect the well-being of our community,\u201d added Smith. \u201cAs we move forward, every one of us will need to continue to make informed decisions for the sake of our own health and the health of others.\u201d\nTo help keep yourself and the community safe, there are many actions you can take to help protect yourself and mitigate the spread of Covid-19.\nFollow the\nCovid-19 Daily Self-Screening Checklist . This offers important guidance for those who are experiencing symptoms or have been in close contact with someone who has tested positive for Covid-19.\nIf you test positive or have been diagnosed with Covid-19, you must isolate away from others to avoid spreading the illness to anyone else.\nFollow these steps to get help, stay healthy, and help protect those around you .\nPractice good hygiene by washing your hands frequently.\nWhile not mandatory, the University System of Georgia encourages people to wear masks based on their preference and assessment of personal risk.\nIf you don\u2019t feel well \u2013 even if you don\u2019t think it is Covid-19 \u2013 please stay home and take care of yourself. Employees should reach out to their supervisor or Human Resources Business Partner for more information. Instructors should demonstrate appropriate flexibility with students who need to isolate or quarantine due to Covid-19 in the same way they would have accommodated ill students before the pandemic.\nStay informed, healthy, and well by visiting\nhealth.gatech.edu/coronavirus\nfor the most up-to-date guidance and resources.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nRachael Pocklington\nInstitute Communications\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
