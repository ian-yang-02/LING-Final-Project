This month, the annual\nAtlanta Bike Challenge\noffers a chance to do that on two wheels.\nThe challenge gives participants an opportunity to set up teams, encourage each other to ride, and win prizes for their mileage. Last year, a\nGeorgia Tech team won the citywide challenge .\nIt\u2019s also a chance to learn about or get reacquainted with on-campus cycling resources. That includes a Ride Smart class offered by the Georgia Tech Police Department, Campus Recreation, and Parking and Transportation Services, which is now available online. The 12-minute course highlights bicycle and scooter safety and can be accessed via the Bike Georgia Tech\u00a0 website . At the end of the video, class participants will be directed to complete a short quiz, which will make them eligible to receive a free helmet. The Atlanta Bicycle Coalition\nis also offering virtual classes\nduring the pandemic.\nThis month, Starter Bikes will host a bike tear-down event on Saturday, Oct. 10, from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. in the group\u2019s storage area in the Campus Recreation Center parking deck. Volunteers are sought to help break down bikes for reuse and recycling\u00a0. The event will help keep frames and parts out of landfills, and allow them to be used in new bike builds someday. Volunteers will be spread out, are required to wear masks, and are encouraged to bring their own work gloves. Those interested can email\u00a0 bike.gt@gatech.edu .\nGeorgia Tech\u2019s campus continues to become more bike friendly each year \u2014 with validation from the Bicycle Friendly University program, which gave Tech a gold rating in 2016.
