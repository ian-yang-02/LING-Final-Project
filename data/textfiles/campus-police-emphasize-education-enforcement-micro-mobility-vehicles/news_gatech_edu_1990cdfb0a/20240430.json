It is part of a collaborative partnership between GTPD and the City of Atlanta\u2019s Solicitor\u2019s Office and follows a sustained increase in the number and severity of accidents over the past year.\nGTPD has recently purchased 38 lighted pedestrian crosswalk signs and 14 radar speed detection signs that have been installed in strategic locations around campus. Officers will begin by issuing traffic warnings and collaborating with campus groups, including Starter Bikes and the Bicycle Infrastructure Improvement Committee, to promote safe ridership and even distribute safety equipment such as lights and helmets.\nFollowing the educational campaign, which began this week, GTPD will implement targeted enforcement efforts and begin issuing citations using City of Atlanta ordinances. They will monitor and adapt enforcement efforts to determine if the plan is effective in reducing accidents on campus. GTPD is also working with Planning, Design, and Constriction on long-term infrastructure changes for campus that will continue to improve pedestrian and rider safety.\nGTPD defines micro-mobility vehicles as bicycles, electric bicycles, electric scooters, and electric skateboards. For the safety and concern for those riding micro-mobility vehicles, GTPD asks that everyone wear the appropriate safety gear and follow all traffic laws and safety rules. State of Georgia law considers bicycles and electric scooters to be vehicles while in operation.

Registration is free and allows GTPD to contact owners in the event that a device is recovered after being lost or stolen.\nReviewing the rules of the road:\nBicycles and scooters must obey all traffic laws and sidewalks.\nMotorized vehicles may not be driven or ridden on the sidewalks.\nVehicles must yield to all pedestrians in crosswalks.\nPedestrians must use the crosswalks.\nPark all scooters responsibly.\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nBicycle and Personal Mobility Device Resources\nBicycle and Personal Mobility Devices Use Policy\nProperty and Bicycle Registration\nContact\nKristen Bailey\nInstitute Communications\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
