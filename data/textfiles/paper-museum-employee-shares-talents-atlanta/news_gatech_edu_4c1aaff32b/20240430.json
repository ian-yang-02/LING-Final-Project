Graham, museum coordinator for the\nRobert C. Williams Museum of Papermaking , recently created a digital billboard as part of\nLocal Stories , an initiative that presents lesser-known facts about downtown Atlanta\u2019s rich history.\nGraham\u2019s work honors the leadership and legacy of John Wesley Dobbs, a political activist and the unofficial \u201cmayor\u201d of Atlanta\u2019s Auburn Avenue during the first half of the 20th century, through papercutting and animation.\n\u201cThe graphic quality of papercuts requires a whittling down of visual information to the essential details,\u201d she said. \u201cAfter careful consideration, I settled on directing the viewer\u2019s attention to Dobbs\u2019 role in mobilizing the Black vote because his voter registration efforts made concrete and lasting changes.\u201d\nGraham\u2019s digital billboard, entitled\nLEGACY: John Wesley Dobbs,\nis reminiscent of vintage postcards and posters. The design choice is an intentional nod by Graham to Dobbs\u2019 many years of service as a postal officer. The U.S. Postal Service, one of the few institutions in the U.S. with an integrated workforce at the time, was arguably one of the largest employers of African Americans. Dobbs would ultimately be promoted to a supervisory role over both Black and white employees.\n\u201cAlthough\nLEGACY\nis technically a digital billboard, I personally think of it as a postcard from me to each and every viewer reminding them and myself that our lives leave an impact,\u201d Graham said. \u201cI ask that we invest in one another, engage with the history of Atlanta, and participate in the decisions that govern our lives by voting.\u201d\nLocal Stories are displayed monthly on the digital sign at Margaret Mitchell Square (140 Peachtree St. NW).\nRelated links\nRobert C.
