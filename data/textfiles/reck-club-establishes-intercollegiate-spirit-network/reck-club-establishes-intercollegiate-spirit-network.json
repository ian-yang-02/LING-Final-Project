Since 1930, Reck Club has maintained school traditions and spirit, largely through their presence at athletic events.\nIn figuring out how to handle sports during a pandemic, Reck Club reached out to other schools with similar spirit organizations. They started with a few in the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC), including Clemson, Miami, Duke, and UNC. Together, these spirit groups started meeting and discussing best practices for the upcoming fall. Over the next few months, the network of spirit organizations grew into what is now known as the Collegiate Spirit Organization Network, or CSON. As it stands, CSON includes more than 15 schools spanning five NCAA Division I conferences.\nThroughout the fall, CSON member schools would send one representative to each meeting, where they\u2019d help each other figure out how to handle anything from navigating Covid-19 to getting students out to athletic events. Ranging from brand new to decades old, from large schools to small ones, the spirit organizations were able to draw from each other\u2019s wide range of experiences with ease. While there's no formal parliamentary structure to CSON meetings, Reck Club, as its founder, steps in as the de-facto leader when necessary.\nAdam Lederer, CSON chair within Reck Club, credits the network with helping Reck Club figure out how to make its own internal changes.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a convenient time to be able to take a step back and critically analyze all the systems that we use to engage students with athletics,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s great to be able to take lessons from other schools and apply them at Georgia Tech.\u201d\nWhile the pandemic has made it difficult to implement new initiatives at sporting events right now, Reck Club now has the perspectives of several other schools at its disposal when the opportunity arises. When that time comes, they\u2019ll be able to use the information gained from CSON in discussions with Georgia Tech Athletics. They\u2019ve learned about an incentive system used at UNC for basketball games that involves attendance at non-revenue sports, and about Duke\u2019s \u201cdirt sheets,\u201d which include facts about opposing teams\u2019 players that fans can use to throw them off their rhythm.\nEven once sporting events return to normal, CSON will still be there to help schools across the country maintain school spirit and get students engaged with campus athletics. It will also continue to serve as a way for members to connect and provide tips when visiting each other\u2019s\u2019 campuses for away games.\n\u201cIn the future, I hope that we\u2019ll be able to transition more of our focus toward athletic marketing tactics and cool traditions that other schools have implemented to get their students engaged,\u201d Lederer said.\nClick\nhere\nto learn more about the Ramblin\u2019 Reck Club.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nGrace Wyner\nInstitute Communications\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
