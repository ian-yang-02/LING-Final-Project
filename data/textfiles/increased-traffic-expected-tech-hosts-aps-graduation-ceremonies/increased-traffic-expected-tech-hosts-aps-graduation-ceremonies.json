Tuesday\u2019s closure will last from 2 to\u00a010 p.m., and Wednesday through Friday from 8 a.m. to\u00a010 p.m. Expect the closures to cause congestion on 10th Street throughout the week, so avoid the area or take an alternate route through campus if possible.\nFor those attending any of the ceremonies, parking is available at three locations on campus:\nFamily Housing (ER66)\nNorth Deck (W23)\nDalney (W22)\nAttendees must have a ticket to enter the event, and guests must adhere to McCamish Pavilion\u2019s clear bag policy.

Due to overlapping events, traffic will remain heavily congested around the area.\nParking for the baseball tournament, which runs through Friday, will be available in the Klaus Parking Deck (E40).\nAdditional Images\nContact\nSteven Gagliano\n- Communications Officer\nInstitute Communications\nEmail\nsteven.gagliano@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
