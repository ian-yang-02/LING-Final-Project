This change prevents the risk of burns many doctors and patients face from the device\u2019s exposed tip. It also eliminates the chance of fires in operating rooms because an exposed tip could come into contact with flammable materials.\nThe team won $20,000 plus a free patent filing and a spot in Flashpoint, a Georgia Tech accelerator. They also won the $5,000 People\u2019s Choice Award, which went to the fans\u2019 favorite invention.\n\u201cThis is really incredible,\u201d said Dev Mandavia, a student in Georgia Tech\u2019s Wallace H. Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering. \u201cThis validates all the hard work we\u2019ve put into this device. This will allow us to take it to the next step and bring our product to FDA approval and then eventually start saving the lives of patients and surgeons.\u201d\nThe other team members are: Jack Corelli, Hunter Hatcher and Devin Li.\nThe two-member team of\u00a0InternBlitz earned second\u00a0place, which comes with\u00a0$10,000, a free patent filing and a spot in Flashpoint.\nInternBlitz\nstreamlines the internship application process. It finds internships for students, automatically fills in their personal contact information and resume, and then sends applicants the extra, company-specific questions.\nThe inventors are: Murtaza Bambot, an industrial engineering major, and Nathan Dass, a computer science major.\nThe annual InVenture Prize brings together student innovators from all academic backgrounds across campus in an effort to foster creativity, invention and entrepreneurship.\nCauteryGuard will now represent Georgia Tech at the\nACC InVenture Prize . This competition, which will involve student startups and inventions from each of the 15 universities in the Atlantic Coast Conference, will take place at Georgia Tech March 30 and 31.\n\u201cWe are so excited to represent Georgia Tech,\u201d Mandavia said. \u201cJust seeing the support we\u2019ve received from everyone, especially everyone in the Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering,\u00a0has been incredible.\"\nLearn about the other four finalists here:\nCapable Cane\nis a walking cane that unfolds into a portable, full-sized comfortable seat.\nCPR+\nis a CPR mask that allows an untrained bystander to perform CPR by walking the user through each step of the process.\nGaitway\nare transportable, collapsible parallel bars for physical therapists to use when working with children.\nPickAR\nuses augmented reality technology so warehouses can process orders more efficiently.\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nGeorgia Tech's InVenture Prize\nPhotos from the InVenture Prize Finale\nACC InVenture Prize\nContact\nLaura Diamond\nMedia Relations\n404-894-6016\n@LauraRDiamond\nEmail\nlaura.diamond@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
