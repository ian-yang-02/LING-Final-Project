It will facilitate\u00a0communication and\u00a0collaboration\u00a0with\u00a0applicants, managers, search committee\u00a0members, Faculty Affairs,\u00a0Human Resources,\u00a0and USG colleagues.\nBeginning Oct. 1, any new competitive faculty hiring searches (excluding GTRI research faculty positions) will be required to be posted in Careers. To ensure departments have the tools needed for Phase 2 implementation, the Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) training team has developed\u00a0the MSS:\u00a0Recruiting and Hiring for Faculty (non-GTRI) training, which will cover: how to create job openings, manage applicants and interviews, and create job offers in Careers for academic faculty and non-GTRI research faculty.\u00a0This training is strongly recommended for department HR/Faculty Affairs representatives and hiring managers.\nRegister here\nfor any of the available trainings:\nThursday, Sept. 17 \u2014 9 a.m. to noon\nWednesday, Sept.\u00a023 \u2014 9 a.m. to noon\nThursday, Oct. 8 \u2014 9 a.m. to noon\nTo review previous MSS Recruiting and Hiring for Staff and Tech Temp trainings, view the\nwebinars\non Media Space.\nFor questions about Careers or the recommended training, email\nerp.training@gatech.edu .\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nAbout OneUSG Connect\nContact\nGabrielle D.
