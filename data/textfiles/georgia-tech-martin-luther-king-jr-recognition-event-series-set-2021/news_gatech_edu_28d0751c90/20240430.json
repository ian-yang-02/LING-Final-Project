MLK Day, an American federal holiday, is observed the third Monday in January each year.\nDec 08, 2020\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nThe stage is set for the 2021 Georgia Tech Martin Luther King Jr. celebration and commemorative event series. From Jan. 11 \u2013 26, the campus community and public are invited to a dozen mostly virtual events, including the Institute\u2019s\n10 th\nannual MLK lecture featuring Nikole Hannah-Jones , Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and creator of the\nNew York Times Magazine \u2019s landmark \u201cThe 1619 Project.\u201d\nThe annual series is sponsored by\nInstitute Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion\n(IDEI) and the\nDivision of Student Life . Many of the events are in collaboration with Atlanta\u2019s\nMartin Luther King Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change\n(\u201cThe King Center\u201d), a resource center and community institution established in 1968 by King\u2019s widow, Coretta Scott King, shortly after his assassination.\n\u201c I am thrilled with our longstanding partnership with Georgia Tech,\u201d said Barbara Harrison, director of The King Center\u2019s External Affairs, Strategic Partnerships, and Programs. \u201cTogether, we have established a learning environment at Georgia Tech that is designed to create a better understanding of Dr. King's nonviolence philosophy and methodology for a younger generation of critical thinkers. I look forward to these students making profound advancements as they address social justice concerns and become influential global leaders. This is a testament to our efforts over the years.\u201d\n\u201cAs a result of our collaborations with The King Center, we have given the students at Georgia Tech the rare opportunity to witness and experience, in person, the historic Ebenezer Baptist Church\u2019s Annual Commemorative Service honoring Dr. King,\u201d added Archie Ervin, vice president for IDEI and MLK event series planning committee chair. \u201cWe are thankful that our students are able to witness this and other events that are part of the series each year.\u201d\nOther events include Tech\u2019s annual MLK Day of Service on Jan. 18, the MLK Student Celebration on Jan. 21, and a weekslong exploration of\nHis Truth is Marching On: John Lewis and the Power of Hope , a biography of the late Georgia congressman, civil rights titan, and King advisor and confidant.\n\u201cI am honored to serve as co-chair for the MLK celebration planning committee and am pleased that we have organized a stellar lineup of programs and activities for the Institute and beyond, despite Covid-19 restrictions,\u201d said Stephanie Ray, associate dean of students and director of Student Diversity Programs. \u201cSince many of the events are virtual, I encourage members of the Tech community to participate in as many of the opportunities as possible. The 2021 theme, \u2018The Fierce Urgency of Building the Beloved Community,\u2019 is a timely topic.\u201d\nIn addition to Ervin, Harrison, and Ray, 2021 MLK celebration and commemorative planning committee members include: Tamara Ballou, Etienne Batiste, Sirocus Barnes, Jorge Breton, Jeremy Brown, Donald Bullock (The King Center), Christopher Burke, Courtney Hill, Peyton Kliewer, Keona Lewis, Travis Liggins, Tabitha Lowe, Marina Martin, Stephanie Merrick, S.
