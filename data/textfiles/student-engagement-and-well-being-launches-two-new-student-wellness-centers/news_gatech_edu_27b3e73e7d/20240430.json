Based on continued assessment of Georgia Tech\u2019s student support programs, student feedback from the past year, and in alignment with the\u00a0 Cultivate Well-Being Action and Transformation Roadmap \u00a0for students, these new centers will help improve and expand student wellness programming and mental health support for Yellow Jackets.\nWhen Luoluo Hong started at Georgia Tech in 2021 as the\u00a0 inaugural vice president for Student Engagement and Well-Being , efforts were well underway to augment student mental healthcare services.\n\u201cPieces of the framework for mental health and emotional wellness support had been established in many ways. Georgia Tech\u2019s Mental Health Task Force and the Institute\u2019s A Path Forward \u2013 Together initiative addressed many of the needs and challenges of our campus community,\u201d Hong said. \u201cWe now need to take the next step and adopt a holistic, more proactive approach to\u00a0 all eight dimensions of wellness \u00a0in order to address the needs of our students today and into the future.\u201d\nFormerly known as Health Initiatives, the WE Center aims to educate, encourage, and equip students to prioritize their own health and wellness, as well as become active participants in healthy lifestyle choices. It will provide research-based programs and services that advocate for holistic wellness, with a special emphasis on addressing the unique needs of students with marginalized identities.\nUsing a comprehensive approach, the WE Center will focus its efforts on the eight dimensions of wellness: environmental, emotional, financial, intellectual, occupational, physical, social, and spiritual.\n\u201cWe are expanding our efforts to ensure we are prioritizing prevention and focusing on the whole person and not only certain dimensions, as they all work together and are interdependent. It\u2019s important for undergraduate and graduate students to have the resources and skills to be proactive instead of reactive,\u201d said Joi Alexander, director of the Wellness Empowerment Center, which will engage and empower the Georgia Tech community to pursue optimal health and wellness and maximize their potential where they live, learn, work, and play.\nThe second center to launch this month, the Center for Mental Health Care and Resources, reorganizes the Center for Assessment, Referral, and Education (CARE) and the Counseling\u00a0Center into one unit. It will\u00a0proactively promote mental health and advance a culture of self-care and of shared community responsibility around crisis response and case management.\u00a0And it will include a dotted reporting line from Stamps Psychiatry to ensure that student mental healthcare is purposefully coordinated and integrated.\u00a0With this alignment, students will have greater and quicker access to more case managers, decreased wait times, and increased critical care through referrals and interventions.\u00a0Students will continue to visit CARE as their primary point of access to campus mental health services.\n\u201cWhat we learned from student feedback and from the pandemic is that we need to focus on a proactive approach to mental health and wellness,\u201d said John M. Stein, associate vice president for Student Engagement and Well-Being and Brandt-Fritz Dean of Students Chair. \u201cCounseling and mental health support programs are still very important and will continue to be supported, but even more important is the preventive approach to wellness that these new centers highlight.\u201d\nThe launch of these two new centers complements the dedication to campus culture change and improved well-being for our entire campus community that will be the new focus of the Division of Student Engagement and Well-Being and the Cultivate Well-Being Action and Transformation Roadmap.\nRelated links\nStudent Engagement & Well-Being\nCenter for Mental Health Care & Resources\nWellness Empowerment Center\nContact\nSara Warner sara.warner@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
