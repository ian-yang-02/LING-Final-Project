That has sent fortune-seeking Americans to gas stations and grocery stores in droves to try their luck. Unfortunately, the odds aren\u2019t ever in your favor. The Powerball lottery is hitting a record jackpot of $1.5 billion, but the odds are stacked against you. Professor Lew Lefton from\nGeorgia Tech\u2019s School of Mathematics\ncrunches numbers like these for a living. Saying that your chances are slim to none is a complete understatement. \u201cThere are 292 million possible winning combinations,\u201d Lefton says. That means you have a 1 in 292 million chance of winning. So just how unlikely is that? Imagine you walked into Georgia Tech\u2019s Bobby Dodd Stadium and placed a penny on the field somewhere. Then, you asked a friend to put on a blindfold and walk into the stadium with a penny as well. If they placed the penny in the exact same location, that would be 15 times more likely to happen than winning the Powerball jackpot. Imagine rolling ten dice all at the same time. If all ten landed on the same number the very first time you tried, that\u2019s still five times more likely than winning the $1.5 billion dollar jackpot. Dice aren\u2019t your thing? You\u2019re 500 times more likely to get a royal flush in the first five cards you are dealt than taking home the big prize. \u201cThere isn\u2019t a way to improve your odds,\u201d Lefton explains. So forget what you might have heard. But you can increase the chances of winning the jackpot all by yourself. \u201cPlay numbers higher than 31,\u201d Lefton says. Many people play birthday numbers, so choosing higher, less-popular numbers decreases the chances of sharing the pot. Also, people statistically choose odd numbers more often. Choosing high, even numbers is your best bet, according to Lefton. Lefton says very few mathematicians like himself spring for tickets because they are the first to know the odds are so astronomically against them. Speaking of odds, take this into consideration when March Madness rolls around: You\u2019re 100 times more likely to win the Powerball twice in a row than you are to select a perfect NCAA basketball bracket. The chances of a flawless bracket? 1 in 9.2 quintillion.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nSteven Norris Georgia Tech Social Media Manager\nEmail\nsnorris@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
