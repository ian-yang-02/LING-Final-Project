Bobo is one of the only people to win world championships in two different skydiving disciplines.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nEmail\nNov 11, 2021\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nGeorgia Tech has many longstanding, well-established clubs. However, one club people might not expect is the Sport Parachute Club\u00a0(SPC). Many students have seen great success competing through the\u00a0club. This is especially true for two alumni\u00a0who\u00a0were recently inducted into the\u00a0Skydiving\u00a0Hall of\u00a0Fame.\nChris Gay and Ian Bobo\u00a0took\u00a0very\u00a0different\u00a0paths\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0SPC.\n\u201cWhether it was with an umbrella or cape, I was always trying to fly as a kid,\u201d\u00a0Gay\u00a0said. \u201cI fell in love the instant I saw the club.\u201d\u00a0Bobo built remote control models of planes with his father, an aerospace engineer from Tech.\u00a0After hearing of a drop zone\u00a0in Georgia, he waited\u00a0until\u00a0he was old enough to make his first jump,\u00a0where he instantly got hooked\u00a0\u2014\u00a0so\u00a0SPC seemed like a\u00a0natural next step.\nWhile some might be terrified when they think about skydiving, Gay and Bobo saw it as a stress reliever.\u00a0Whether it was the adrenaline rush or the feeling of freedom, leaving for the drop zone over the weekend was always relaxing to them.\u00a0Additionally, SPC provided them with\u00a0teammates\u00a0and mentors\u00a0who\u00a0fostered\u00a0a sense\u00a0of community.\nTheir achievements have occurred both\u00a0in and beyond the club. Gay has either participated in or helped\u00a0set more than\u00a015 skydiving\u00a0world records. Bobo is one of the only people to win world championships\u00a0in two different skydiving disciplines,\u00a0formation skydiving and canopy piloting. These are\u00a0a few\u00a0of the many reasons that they are now in the hall of fame.\nAnother avenue into the hall of fame is advancing the safety and education of the sport,\u00a0which is something both did. \u201cThere is no end to developmental efforts,\u201d Bobo said. \u201cIt\u00a0intrigues\u00a0engineers since constant education develops newer, safer\u00a0methods.\u201d Both are\u00a0using their engineering degrees to change the way skydiving is taught and how safe it can be.\u00a0This makes the sport more accessible to a larger audience.\u00a0Vertical wind tunnels are\u00a0a\u00a0safer way\u00a0to get beginners involved, but virtual\u00a0reality is\u00a0also allowing people to safely practice the sport.\nAlthough they are both heavily involved in teaching and safety, neither\u00a0one has\u00a0given up their love for skydiving. Gay,\u00a0along with three other skydivers, is\u00a0planning on jumping\u00a0into the football game against Boston College\u00a0this weekend (weather permitting).\u00a0It will be\u00a0a\u00a0must-see\u00a0event for anyone\u00a0looking to celebrate the\u00a0achievements of\u00a0Georgia Tech\u00a0alumni.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nConnor White\nInstitute Communications\nEmail\nstucomm@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
