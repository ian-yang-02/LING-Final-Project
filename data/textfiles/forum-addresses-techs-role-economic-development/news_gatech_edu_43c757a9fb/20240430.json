It\u2019s just in you,\u201d Duncan said. \u201cAs lieutenant governor I want to look for ways to harness and cultivate that potential here in Georgia.\u201d\nHe acknowledged the role of education and thanked Georgia Tech\u2019s leaders for striving\u00a0to make Georgia the technology capital of the East Coast.\nThe first panel,\u00a0The Innovation Center Concept, was moderated by Parmeet Grover, senior partner and managing director with The Boston Consulting Group. He led a discussion with President G.P. \u201cBud\u201d Peterson and Ralph de la Vega, former vice chairman of AT&T Inc. They began by talking about\u00a0Tech Square's origins.\n\u201cIn the late \u201990s the Georgia Tech Foundation was looking at ways to expand the campus,\u201d Peterson said. \u201cA decision was made to come across the connector and put a footprint on this side of the interstate. It was a controversial decision that wasn\u2019t unanimously supported. But they took a chance and located the foundation here, built the Georgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center, the bookstore, and the Scheller College of Business. That turned out to be a hugely important decision that has had a long and very positive impact on Georgia Tech.\u201d\nPeterson came to Georgia Tech in 2009 as Technology Square was evolving. A significant part of Georgia Tech\u2019s strategic planning process was figuring out how the Institute could work with the many corporate headquarters located in Atlanta. One way was through innovation centers, which first appeared in Tech Square in 2012.\n\u201cWhen AT&T opened the third innovation center in Tech Square, that gave credibility to what we were trying to do,\u201d Peterson said. \u201cIt was Ralph de la Vega who helped me understand how an innovation center could add value to the companies that establish them.\u201d\nDe la Vega, who was CEO of AT&T Mobility at the time, said, \u201cWe realized we could no longer wait for people to bring innovation and technology to us. We had to move our people to where innovation was taking place. We were building innovation centers next to academic institutions.\u201d\nHe chose Georgia Tech as the location because he shared the Institute's vision of turning research into an entrepreneurial venture that encourages startups, builds community, and helps to foster an ecosystem.\nThe forum\u2019s second panel, Georgia\u2019s New Economy \u2014 The Startup Ecosystem, was facilitated by Blake Patton, managing partner with Tech Square Ventures and Engage. Panelists included Chris Clark, president and CEO, Georgia Chamber of Commerce; Lara Hodgson, president and CEO, NOW Corp; Paul Judge, cofounder and partner of Tech Square Labs, and cofounder and executive chairman, Pindrop; and Hala Moddelmog, president and CEO, Metro Atlanta Chamber.\nPatton started by asking the panelists about the key ingredients driving change in Atlanta\u2019s startup community over the last decade.\n\u201cThe interest in investing in Atlanta startups has gone from negative to neutral to overwhelmingly positive,\u201d said Judge. \u201cUnderneath it all, Atlanta and Georgia have gained the confidence to dream bigger, and it\u2019s starting to pay off.\u201d\nHodgson sees one of Atlanta\u2019s greatest assets in\u00a0the mindsets of the people who live and work here.\n\u201cAtlanta has grit and determination that I don\u2019t see in Boston or on the West Coast. It\u2019s a skill that serves us very well,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s also a lack of fear of growth. You can\u2019t live in Atlanta and be afraid of growth.\u201d\nGeorgia Tech\u2019s executive vice president for Research, Chaouki Abdallah, gave the closing remarks and cited the Institute\u2019s growth in the last 10 years.\n\u201cIn 2009, Georgia Tech conducted less than $500 million in research. This year that figure is $1 billion, which speaks to the acceleration of change,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThe companies moving into Tech Square appreciate the relationship and teamwork between Georgia Tech, the Metro Atlanta Chamber, and the state of Georgia.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nContact\nVictor Rogers\nInstitute Communications\nEmail\nvictor.rogers@comm.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
