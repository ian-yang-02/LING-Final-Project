This allows\u00a0faculty, students, and collaborators to advance the boundaries\u00a0of robotics research.\nThis installment of the Faces of Research Q&A series is\u00a0with\nKinsey Herrin\nWhat is your field of expertise and why did you choose it?\nI\u2019m a prosthetist/orthotist and conduct research in the field of prosthetics, orthotics/exoskeletons, and rehab robotics. Our goal is to make it easier for people with mobility challenges to live more independent lives by helping them move more easily in the real world. The change we see through our technology sometimes is amazing \u2014\u00a0people with amputations can go upstairs, step-over-step instead of stiff legged, and kids with walking disabilities\u00a0start to have more normal walking patterns. As a kid, I always wanted to help people and this profession is the perfect blend of medicine, science, and art \u2014\u00a0all things that I love plus the added benefit of getting to be around some really incredible people.\nWhat makes Georgia Tech Research institutes unique?\nWe\u2019re trying to advance technology outside of the lab and into the real world where it can make an impact on real users. That means not only assessing how our users perform with the technology \u2014\u00a0does it actually make them walk faster, with\u00a0a more natural and easy gait \u2014\u00a0but also assessing a user\u2019s own perspective on technology and using all of that data to keep improving the end results. Our facilities and resources are incredible. I often feel I have access to a dream playground for a research prosthetist/orthotist. On top of all of that, our faculty and students are not only extremely talented and at the top of their fields, but I think there is a deeper passion for pursuing this goal to make mobility easier for people with physical challenges.\nWhat impact is your research having on the world?\nI see our work as having an impact on all people with mobility challenges. We are trying to make the world a better place for them by challenging the status quo and saying what clinicians can currently provide is still not good enough. We can still do more to return people to a new normal after amputation, stroke, brain, and spinal cord injuries. When people can access their own environment independently, it has overwhelmingly positive impacts on their quality of life. I think our research is making great strides toward making that possible.\nWhat do you like to do in your spare time when you are not working on your research or teaching?\nI enjoy being outdoors with my husband and son any chance we get. We love pretty much everything about being on or near water \u2014\u00a0fishing, kayaking, canoeing, swimming, and camping. I also have nine\u00a0backyard chickens and a dog that are hilarious and fun additions to the Herrin chaos.\nAdditional Images\nEmail\nperalte.paul@comm.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
