Falcomm\u2019s Dual-Drive PA combines ultra-efficient performance with an architecture that lends itself to production at scale.\n\u201cPower amplifiers are the workhorse of the modern electronic era, but improvement to this technology hasn\u2019t kept pace with the rise of the innovation economy,\u201d said Garay, who holds a doctorate in electrical engineering from Georgia Tech\u2019s\nSchool of Electrical and Computer Engineering , where he conducted the research that led to the formation of his startup.\n\u201cFalcomm\u2019s ultra-efficient, silicon-proven technology will bring advances in power and efficiency to the semiconductor industry that help communications manufacturers to realize massive efficiency gains, while lowering costs. With urgent challenges in the environment and supply chain, we can\u2019t wait another 90 years for change.\u201d\nWith simultaneous transmission at each terminal of a transistor, the Dual-Drive PA delivers performance that is 1.8 times more efficient at 2 times higher power, with half of the silicon area requirements of traditional power amplifiers. For manufacturers, these gains will reduce thermal management and energy costs, while easing overall system requirements.\nA patented architectural design allows the product to be manufactured in high volume by semiconductor foundries in the United States. With fabless technology, the company is poised to grow a network of industry partners that catalyzes expansion in the $23 billion power amplifier market.\nBorn in Venezuela, Garay developed a passion for using science and engineering to solve problems while repairing machinery on a farm in his hometown. While pursuing doctoral studies at Georgia Tech, he recognized the opportunity to bring innovation to the power amplifier, which had not changed in decades despite the rapid advance of technology and its critical role in devices.\nGaray\u2019s research resulted in multiple patents, spurring him to spin out the technology and create Falcomm through assistance from Georgia Tech resources, including\u00a0 VentureLab \u00a0 and\u00a0 CREATE-X . Falcomm is the first company to receive investment from the Georgia Tech Foundation.\n\u201cGeorgia Tech is proud to support our academic innovators to help them ensure their inventions have real-world impact,\u201d said Raghupathy Sivakumar, Georgia Tech\u2019s vice president of Commercialization and chief commercialization officer. \u201cThe Office of Commercialization is rapidly expanding our programs and initiatives to build out the largest and most robust entrepreneurial ecosystem at any public university. I am happy to say that Falcomm is the recipient of the first equity investment out of our new Research Impact Fund targeted specifically at\nspinouts based on Georgia Tech \u00a0intellectual property.\"\nThe Falcomm team was recently bolstered by the addition of pioneering industry leaders who have demonstrated a track record of innovation in telecommunications, wireless, and semiconductors:\nThomas Cameron, Ph.D., chief strategy officer, \u00a0 is a 35-year veteran of technology research and development in the wireless industry. During a 12-year stint at Analog Devices, Cameron served as chief technology officer of the Communications Business Unit and was a leading evangelist for the adoption of 5G connectivity. He held leadership and engineering roles in the RF industry at Bell Northern Research, Nortel, Sirenza Microdevices, and WJ Communications. Cameron has seven patents in wireless technology and has authored numerous papers and technical articles.\nNed Cahoon, director of Foundry and Customer Relationships, \u00a0 brings more than 20 years of RF business development experience across the mobile and wireless infrastructure industries. He helped to stand up IBM\u2019s $1 billion RF business before joining GlobalFoundries in 2016, where he served as a fellow in the office of the chief technology officer. A senior design and go-to-market leader, Cahoon brings experience building networks across foundries, academia, and technology companies.\nFor Falcomm, the funding follows quickly on the heels of the company\u2019s selection to the TechCrunch Startup Battlefield 200 in 2023. The company is a graduate of the\u00a0 Berkeley SkyDeck Accelerator \u00a0 and the\u00a0 EvoNexus incubator .\nBringing innovation to the tiny power amplifier can have a massive impact on some of the nation\u2019s most pressing challenges. The energy efficiency gains resulting from an increase in power output come at a time of growing urgency around climate change. The ability to manufacture domestically comes at a time when nearshoring is a priority to address cost and supply chain challenges underscored by the global semiconductor shortage and resulting CHIPS Act.\n\u201cEdgar and his team are just as inspiring as they are hard-working. They have shown that it\u2019s possible to assemble the talent and operations to innovate on a foundational technology that hasn\u2019t seen meaningful advances in decades anywhere in the country,\u201d said Guy Filippelli, Squadra Ventures\u2019 managing partner. \u201cBy boosting efficiency and manufacturing domestically in the critical semiconductor industry, Falcomm\u2019s innovations will bolster American competitiveness.\u201d\nThe funding will be used to accelerate go-to-market activities with satellite companies and wireless infrastructure manufacturers, advance the company\u2019s patented technology, and expand the team. Falcomm is actively hiring for roles in operations, engineering, and design.\u00a0 View job openings .\nAdditional Images\nContact\nFor Falcomm:\nStephen Babcock,\u00a0 stephen@squadra.vc\nFor Georgia Tech:\nP\u00e9ralte C.
