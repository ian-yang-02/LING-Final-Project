(Credit: Georgia Tech)\nAug 24, 2020\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nReduced resilience of plant biomes in North America could be setting the stage for the kind of mass extinctions not seen since the retreat of glaciers and arrival of humans about 13,000 years ago, cautions a new study published August 20 in the journal\nGlobal Change Biology .\nThe warning comes from a study of 14,189 fossil pollen samples taken from 358 locations across the continent. Researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology used data from the samples to determine landscape resilience, including how long specific landscapes such as forests and grasslands existed \u2013 a factor known as residence time \u2014 and how well they rebounded following perturbations such as forest fires \u2014 a factor termed recovery.\n\u201cOur work indicates that landscapes today are once again exhibiting low resilience, foreboding potential extinctions to come,\u201d wrote authors Yue Wang, Benjamin Shipley, Daniel Lauer, Roseann Pineau, and Jenny McGuire. \u201cConservation strategies focused on improving both landscape and ecosystem resilience by increasing local connectivity and targeting regions with high richness and diverse landforms can mitigate these extinction risks.\u201d\nThe research, supported by the National Science Foundation, is believed to be the first to quantify biome residence and recovery time over an extended period. The researchers studied 12 major plant biomes in North America over the past 20,000 years using pollen data from the Neotoma Paleoecology Database.\n\u201cWe find that the retreat of North American glaciers destabilized ecosystems, causing large herbivores \u2014 including mammoths, horses, and camels \u2014 to struggle for food supplies,\u201d said\nMcGuire , an assistant professor in Georgia Tech\u2019s\nSchool of Biological Sciences\nand\nSchool of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences . \u201cThat destabilization combined with the arrival of humans in North America to land a one-two punch that resulted in the extinction of large terrestrial mammals on the continent.\u201d\nThe researchers found that landscapes today are experiencing resilience lower than any seen since the end of the Pleistocene megafauna extinctions.\n\u201cToday, we see a similarly low landscape resilience, and we see a similar one-two punch: humans are expanding our footprint and climates are changing rapidly,\u201d said Wang, a postdoctoral researcher who led the study. \u201cThough we know that strategies exist to mitigate some of these effects, our findings serve as a dire warning about the vulnerability of natural systems to extinction.\u201d\nBy studying the mix of plants represented by pollen samples, the researchers found that over the past 20,000 years, forests persisted for longer than grassland habitats \u2014 averaging 700 years versus about 360 years, though they also took much longer to reestablish after being perturbed \u2014 averaging 360 years versus 260 years. \u201cThese findings were somewhat surprising,\u201d said McGuire. \u201cWe had expected biomes to persist much longer, perhaps for thousands of years rather than hundreds.\u201d\nThe research also found that forests and grasslands transition quickly when temperatures are changing fast, and that they recover most rapidly if the ecosystem contains high plant biodiversity. Yet not all biomes recover; the study found that only 64% regain their original biome type through a process that can take up to three centuries. Arctic systems were least likely to recover, the study found.\nLandscape resilience, the ability of habitats to persist or quickly rebound in response to disturbances, has helped maintain terrestrial biodiversity during periods of climatic and environmental changes, the researchers noted.\n\u201cIdentifying the tempo and mode of landscape transitions and the drivers of landscape resilience is critical to maintaining natural systems and preserving biodiversity given today's rapid climate and land use changes,\u201d the authors wrote. \u201cHowever, resilient landscapes are difficult to recognize on short time scales, as perturbations are challenging to quantify and ecosystem transitions are rare.\u201d\nContrary to prevailing ecological theory, the researchers found that pollen richness \u2014 indicating diversity of species \u2014 did not necessarily correlate with residence time. Ecological theory suggests that biodiversity increases ecosystem resilience by improving \"functional redundancy,\u201d allowing a system to maintain stability even if a single or several species are lost. \u201cBut species richness does not necessarily reflect functional redundancy, and as a result may not be correlated with ecosystem stability,\u201d the researchers wrote.\nThe study used pollen data from five forest types \u2014 forest-tundra, conifer/hardwood, boreal forest, deciduous forest, and coastal forest; five shrub/herb biome types \u2014 Arctic vegetation, desert, mountain vegetation, prairies, and Mediterranean vegetation; and two no-analog biome types \u2014 spruce parkland and mixed parkland.\nThe Neotoma Paleoecology Database contains fossil pollen and spores that are ubiquitous in lake and mire sediments. Collected through core sampling, the samples represent a wide diversity of plant taxa and cover an extended period of time.\nThough the effects of climate change and human environmental impacts don\u2019t bode well for the future of North American plant biomes, there are ways to address it, Wang said. \u201cWe know that strategies exist to mitigate some of these effects, such as prioritizing biodiverse regions that can rebound quickly and increasing the connectivity between natural habitats so that species can move in response to warming.\u201d\nThis work was supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF) Grants DEB 1655898 and SGP 1945013.
