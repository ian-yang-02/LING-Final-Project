A\nnew study\nsuggests that\u00a0doctors can beat\u00a0antibiotic resistance\u00a0using those same antibiotics\u00a0but in a very targeted manner and in combination with other health strategies.\nThe current broad application of antibiotics helps resistant bacterial strains evolve forward. But using data about bacteria\u2019s specific resistances when\u00a0prescribing\u00a0those same drugs more precisely can help put the\u00a0evolution\u00a0of resistant strains in reverse, according to researchers from the Georgia Institute of Technology, Duke University, and Harvard University who conducted the study.\nOne researcher cautioned that time is pressing: New strategies against resistance\u00a0that leverage antibiotics need to be in place\u00a0before bacteria resistant to most every known antibiotic become too widespread. That would render antibiotics nearly useless, and\u00a0it has been widely reported that this could happen by mid-century, making\u00a0bacterial infections much more lethal.\n\u201cOnce you get to that pan-resistant state, it\u2019s over,\u201d said Sam Brown, who co-led the study and is an\nassociate professor in Georgia Tech\u2019s School of Biological Sciences . \u201cTiming is, unfortunately, an issue in tackling antibiotic resistance.\u201d\nThe new study, which was co-led by game theorist David McAdams, a\nprofessor of business administration and economics\u00a0at\u00a0Duke University , delivers a mathematical model to help clinical and public health researchers devise new concrete prescription strategies and those\u00a0supporting health strategies. The measures\u00a0center\u00a0on the analysis of\u00a0bacterial strains to determine what drugs they are resistant to, and which not.\nSome medical labs\nalready scan human genomes for hereditary predispositions to certain medical conditions. Bacterial genomes are far simpler and much\u00a0easier to analyze, and though the analytical\u00a0technology is currently not standard equipment in doctors\u2019 offices or medical labs they routinely work with, the researchers think this could change in a reasonable amount of time. This\u00a0would enable the study\u2019s approach.\nThe researchers published their study\nin the journal\nPLOS Biology\non May 16, 2019. The work was funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Institute of General Medical Sciences, the Simons Foundation, the Human Frontier Science Program, the Wenner-Gren Foundations, and the Royal Physiographic Society of Lund.\nQ&A\nHere are some questions and answers on\u00a0how the study\u2019s counterintuitive\u00a0approach could beat back antibiotic resistance:\nIsn\u2019t prescribing antibiotics the problem? How can it fight resistance?\nThe real\u00a0problem is the\u00a0broad application of antibiotics. They\u00a0treat human infections and farm animals, and in the process are\u00a0killing off a lot of non-resistant bacteria while\u00a0bacteria resistant to those drugs survive. The resistant strains can then reproduce\u00a0and with fewer competitors in their space, then they\u00a0dominate bacterial communities in the host animals and people.\nThe resistant bacteria\u00a0get passed to other hosts and become\nmore prevalent in the world\naltogether. New prescription strategies would outsmart that evolutionary scenario by exposing through genomic (or other) analysis bacteria\u2019s resistance but also their vulnerabilities.\n\u201cRight now, there are rapid tests for the pathogen. If you\u2019ve got strep throat, the clinic swabs the bacteria and does a rapid assay that says yes, that\u2019s streptococcus,\u201d Brown said. \u201cBut it won\u2019t tell you if it\u2019s resistant to the drug usually prescribed against it. In the future, diagnostics at the point-of-care could find out what strain you\u2019ve got and if it\u2019s resistant.\u201d\nThen clinicians would choose the specific\u00a0antibiotics that the bacteria are not resistant to, and kill the bacteria, thus also stopping them from spreading the\u00a0genes behind their resistance to\u00a0other antibiotics. So, identifying an infector\u2019s resistance hits two birds with one stone.\n\u201cIt\u2019s great for fighting antibiotic resistance, but it\u2019s also good for patients because we\u2019ll always use the correct antibiotic,\u201d Brown said.\n[Thinking about grad school?\u00a0 Here's how to apply to Georgia Tech. ]\nAre there enough effective antibiotics left to do this with?\nPlenty. Antibiotics still work as a rule.\nIn addition, searching out and destroying resistant bacteria could help refresh existing antibiotics\u2019 effectiveness.\n\u201cThe idea is prevalent that we will use antibiotics up, and then they\u2019re gone,\u201d Brown said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be that way. This study introduces the concept that antibiotics could become a renewable resource if we act on time.\u201d\nAs mentioned above, prescription strategies by themselves won\u2019t beat resistance, right?\nCorrect. Resistance evolution has some tricky complexities.\n\u201cA lot of bacteria with the potential to make us sick like\nE. coli\nspend most of their time just lurking peacefully in our bodies. These are bystander bacteria, and they are exposed to lots of antibiotics that we take for other things such as\u00a0sore throats or ear aches,\u201d Brown said. \u201cThis frequent exposure is probably the major driver of resistance evolution.\u201d\nThe antibiotic prescription strategy\u00a0needs those\u00a0additional\u00a0health care\u00a0measures to win the\u00a0fight, but those measures\u00a0are pretty straightforward.\nWhat are those additional measures?\nDiagnostics need to apply to bystander bacteria, too.\nE. coli\nin the intestine or, for example,\u00a0 Strep pneumoniae\nliving peacefully in nostrils would be checked for resistance, say, during annual checkups.\n\u201cIf the patient is carrying a resistant strain, you work to beat it back before it can break out,\u201d Brown said. \u201cThere could be non-antibiotic treatments that do this like, perhaps, bacteria replacement.\u201d\nBacteria replacement therapy \u00a0would introduce\u00a0new bacteria into the patient\u2019s body to\u00a0outcompete\u00a0the undesirable antibiotic-resistant bacteria and displace\u00a0it. Also, people would stay home from school and work for a few days so as not to spread the bad bacteria to other people while their immune systems and possibly\u00a0 alternative therapies, such as bacteriophages or non-antibiotic drugs \u00a0battle the bad bacteria.\nThis sounds hopeful, but are there other real-world\u00a0circumstances to consider?\n\u201cThe study\u2019s mathematical models are broad simplifications of real life,\u201d Brown said. \u201cThey don\u2019t take into account that pathogens spend a lot of time in other antibiotic-exposed environments such as farms. Dealing with that is going to\u00a0require\u00a0some more\u00a0research.\u201d\nThe study also purposely leaves out \"polymicrobial infections,\" which are infections by multiple kinds of bacteria at the same time. The researchers believe that the study\u2019s models can\u00a0still be relevant to them.\n\u201cWe expect the logic of combating drug resistance to still hold in these more complex scenarios, but diagnostics and treatment rules will have to be honed for them specifically,\u201d Brown said.\nAlso read:\nWant to beat antibiotic resistance?
