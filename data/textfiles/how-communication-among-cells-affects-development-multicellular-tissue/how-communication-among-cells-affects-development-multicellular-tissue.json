The information could lead to new methods for controlling how multicellular constructs develop, and that could have applications in regenerative medicine, pharmaceutical testing and other research areas.\nThe research resulted from collaboration between the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Gladstone Institutes, and was reported October 5 in the journal\nNature Communications . The National Science Foundation\u2019s (NSF) Emergent Behaviors of Integrated Cellular Systems Science and Technology Center (EBICS) supported the research.\n\u201cThe goal is to control a system of cells like this to direct tissues to take on different phenotypes, to develop into different complex mixtures, and to self-assemble and emerge into very complicated structures,\u201d said\nMelissa Kemp , an associate professor in the\nWallace H. Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering at Georgia Tech and Emory University . \u201cFor developing tissues that could be used as surrogates for screening drugs or as eventual implants for therapeutic purposes, we need to how to control and direct them properly.\u201d\nScientists believe that the patterning of stem cell differentiation affects what kinds of cells will ultimately emerge from the differentiation process.\nDespite the importance of local cell-to-cell interactions in evolving multicellular systems, little has been known about how the overall system regulates its morphological processes. To learn more about this, the paper\u2019s first author, Chad Glen, studied how communication between adjacent mouse cells informs the fate of those cells. Beyond understanding this communication, Glen discovered a potential mechanism for \u201cbraking\u201d the rate of differentiation without affecting the overall patterning of the resulting multicellular tissue.\n\u201cThe amount of coordination among cells that are tightly coupled gives us an idea about how they work as a group,\u201d said\nTodd McDevitt , senior investigator at the\nGladstone Institutes\nand a professor of bioengineering and therapeutic sciences at the University of California, San Francisco. \u201cThis reflects the behavior of a team versus individuals. They really do coordinate activity in a rapid way. This study shows how quickly some important cell behaviors are mediated by gap junction communication.\u201d\nGlen, a recent Ph.D. graduate of Georgia Tech, began the project\u00a0by studying communication between pairs of adjacent cells, which have pores that allow small molecules to enter. By introducing a signaling molecule into a colony containing hundreds of these homogeneous mouse stem cells, the researchers observed that differentiation began with a change in a single cell. That cell triggered a pattern of differentiation that flowed through the cells and eventually led to changes in the entire colony.\nOn a larger scale and in three dimensions, such changes lead to development of bodily organs. Understanding how that happens \u2013 and how it could be controlled \u2013 could be key to directing this transition from individual cells.\nBased on experimental observations, Glen developed a model of the process, which allowed the researchers to study the impact of a series of interrelated variables that would have been impossible to study experimentally. The modeling of several hundred individual cells led to specific predictions that the researchers then tested experimentally.\nTo understand and measure the cell communication process, the researchers used a fluorescent dye to show when signaling molecules had moved from one cell to its neighbors. They then used a laser to bleach the dye from a single cell. Measuring how long it took for the dye to be replaced showed the permeability of the cell membrane \u2013 and how well the cell was communicating with its neighbors.\n\u201cIf you zap a cell and it immediately returns to green, you know there is a lot of fluidity and cross-talk between the cell membranes,\u201d Kemp explained. \u201cIf you zap a cell and it stays dark, the cell is effectively isolated and has no communication with its neighbors.\u201d\nBy partially blocking communication between cells and otherwise perturbing the communications, the researchers slowed the differentiation process \u2013 but didn\u2019t change its pattern. \u201cWe were able to shift the way the cells were behaving to slow things down \u2013 effectively \u2018braking\u2019 the process \u2013 while preserving the spatial information,\u201d said Kemp. \u201cCells that were at 48 hours in the process could look like 24-hour cells.\u201d\nThe combination of computational modeling and experiment allowed the research team to arrive at answers that neither technique by itself could have provided, McDevitt noted.\n\u201cWith modeling, you can study a much larger set of conditions and parameters than we could experimentally,\u201d he said. \u201cThe model could make predictions that we could go back and study experimentally to see how those conditions actually affected the behaviors. The behaviors we measured experimentally matched what the computer predicted, and validated that we had a robust model.\u201d\nMcDevitt and Kemp have been studying this system of embryonic stem cells for several years, and the new study moves them closer to a more complete understanding of the complex system.\n\u201cWe have demonstrated in a series of papers over the past six years that this system\u2019s complexity can be modeled,\u201d he said. \u201cThis paper represents a further step toward the greater goal of integrating information about this system. With each of these steps, we are much closer to taking a bigger leap into potentially controlling these systems.\u201d\nThis research was supported by the National Science Foundation Emergent Behaviors of Integrated Cellular Systems Science and Technology Center (CBET 0939511).
