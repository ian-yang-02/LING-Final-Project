Yet the rock record shows that vast seas covered much of the early Earth under the faint young sun.\nScientists have long debated what kept those seas from freezing. A popular theory is that potent gases such as methane \u2013 with many times more warming power than carbon dioxide \u2013 created a thicker greenhouse atmosphere than required to keep water liquid today.\nIn the absence of oxygen, iron built up in ancient oceans. Under the right chemical and biological processes, this iron rusted out of seawater and cycled many times through a complex loop, or \u201cferrous wheel.\u201d Some microbes could \u201cbreathe\u201d this rust in order to outcompete others, such as those that made methane. When rust was plentiful, an \u201ciron curtain\u201d may have suppressed methane emissions.\n\u201cThe ancestors of modern methane-making and rust-breathing microbes may have long battled for dominance in habitats largely governed by iron chemistry,\u201d said Marcus Bray, a biology Ph.D. candidate in the laboratory of\nJennifer Glass , assistant professor in the Georgia Institute of Technology\u2019s\nSchool of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences\nand principal investigator of the study funded by NASA\u2019s Exobiology and Evolutionary Biology Program. The research was reported in the journal\nGeobiology\non April 17, 2017.\nUsing mud pulled from the bottom of a tropical lake, researchers at Georgia Tech gained a new grasp of how ancient microbes made methane despite this \u201ciron curtain.\u201d\nCollaborator Sean Crowe, an assistant professor at the University of British Columbia, collected mud from the depths of Indonesia\u2019s Lake Matano, an anoxic iron-rich ecosystem that uniquely mimics early oceans. Bray placed the mud into tiny incubators simulating early Earth conditions, and tracked microbial diversity and methane emissions over a period of 500 days. Minimal methane was formed when rust was added; without rust, microbes kept making methane through multiple dilutions.\nExtrapolating these findings to the past, the team concluded that methane production could have persisted in rust-free patches of ancient seas. Unlike the situation in today\u2019s well-aerated oceans, where most natural gas produced on the seafloor is consumed before it can reach the surface, most of this ancient methane would have escaped to the atmosphere to trap heat from the early sun.\nIn addition to those already mentioned, the research team included Georgia Tech professors Frank Stewart and Tom DiChristina, Georgia Tech postdoctoral scholars Jieying Wu and Cecilia Kretz, Georgia Tech Ph.D. candidate Keaton Belli, Georgia Tech M.S. student Ben Reed, University of British Columbia postdoctoral scholar Rachel Simister, Indonesian Institute of Sciences researcher Cynthia Henny, Skidaway Institute of Oceanography professor Jay Brandes, and University of Kansas professor David Fowle.\nThis research was funded by NASA Exobiology grant NNX14AJ87G.
