To save purchasers from finding that out the hard way, researchers from the Georgia Institute of Technology and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill have done security assessments of representative devices, awarding scores ranging from 28 (an F) up to 100.\nTheir site,\nhttps://yourthings.info , shows rankings for 45 devices, though a total of 74 have been evaluated. That\u2019s hardly a complete roundup of the tens of thousands of devices available, but the big idea behind the project is to help consumers understand important issues before connecting a new IoT helper to their home networks.\n\u201cA lot of people who purchase these devices don\u2019t fully understand the risks associated with installing them in their homes,\u201d said Omar Alrawi, a graduate research assistant at Georgia Tech. \u201cWe want to provide insight by providing security ratings for the devices we have tested.\u201d\nVoice-activated personal digital assistants are among the most common home IoT devices, but if not properly installed, they can provide unwanted access to the home networks to which they are connected, warned\nManos Antonakakis , a cybersecurity researcher and associate professor in Georgia Tech\u2019s\nSchool of Electrical and Computer Engineering .\n\u201cIf you have an IoT app that is vulnerable, whoever has access to that app not only has access to your personal information, but could also jump into your home and eavesdrop on your conversations,\u201d he said. \u201cAnything that is connected in the home in proximity to the personal assistant could also interact with it. If there is vulnerable software running on the device, it could be exploited within the home network.\u201d\nOne problem is that most home networks were set up for simple tasks like sharing printers, so they lack the kind of security controls found on enterprise systems at businesses, noted Chaz Lever, a research engineer in Georgia Tech\u2019s School of Electrical and Computer Engineering.\n\u201cThe home network is beginning to look a lot like enterprise networks with a range of services that have to be protected,\u201d Lever said. \u201cBut the average consumer is not going to be equipped to do that. They don\u2019t have an IT staff that is doing audits and securing the devices. If these devices are not secure out of the box and there aren\u2019t easy ways to secure them, they can open the home up to a new vector of attacks.\u201d\nTo give consumers helpful advice, the researchers developed a framework for analyzing the devices\u2019 security components. In what is believed to be the first effort to objectively assess the risks of IoT equipment, they examined the devices themselves, how the devices communicate with cloud servers, the applications running on the devices, and the cloud-based endpoints.\n\u201cThe more services running on the device, the higher the probability that some of them will be vulnerable to attack,\u201d Antonakakis said. \u201cProviding many services may be attractive from a marketing perspective, but if you have multiple services, the risk increases.\u201d\nIn their study of IoT devices, the researchers found wide variations in security depending on the manufacturer. In some cases, equipment made by small and lesser-known companies performed better than devices made by larger companies.\n\u201cThere are some devices that do security really well, and other manufacturers should learn from those exemplary devices,\u201d Alrawi said. \u201cWe saw the full spectrum of good and bad, and sometimes we were surprised at the results of our evaluation.\u201d\nBecause they are designed to be installed by consumers, these IoT devices must be easy to use. But ease of use can be the enemy of security. An example is a service known as UPnP, which makes devices known to the network during installation so communications can be established.\nBut a device announcing itself on the network can attract attackers, Lever noted. \u201cIt\u2019s helpful for the devices to communicate what they do, but that opens up vulnerabilities. The choice of protocols affects not only the device, but also the security of the network on which it is running.\u201d\nInternet-connected light bulbs are unlikely to have a long service life, but that\u2019s not the case with expensive appliances like internet-connected refrigerators. Antonakakis worries that these devices could become security risks without regular updates.\n\u201cIdeally, the consumer shouldn\u2019t have to be aware that their refrigerator needs updates that have to be downloaded to the device,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want that to happen automatically and securely. Why should anyone have to know how to patch their refrigerator?\u201d\nWhile the notion of hacking a slow cooker might seem amusing, the devices have heating elements that could cause a fire if a malicious actor turned up the temperature. Attacks can also affect more than a homeowner. In 2016, the Mirai botnet took advantage of unsecured internet-connected cameras \u2014 many of them baby monitors \u2014 to create a massive distributed denial of service attack that left much of the internet unavailable.\nBeyond educating consumers, the researchers hope to encourage better security by device manufacturers by tracking security trends over time.\n\u201cWe hope to inspire both technical and policy next steps,\u201d said Antonakakis. \u201cThere is a need for establishing policy and standards. We want to raise the security level of all these devices. There is a lot more that could be done.\u201d\nIn addition to those already mentioned, Fabrian Monrose from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill was also a member of the research team.\nThis material is based upon work supported in part by U.S. Department of Commerce grants 2106DEK and 2106DZD, by National Science Foundation grant 2106DGX, and by Air Force Research Laboratory/Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency grants 2106DTX and 2106EHP.
