With the addition of Usselman, Williams, and Graham, nearly 100 Georgia Tech professors have been recognized for their achievements. In total, the AAAS Class of 2022 features 506 individuals following in the footsteps of past honorees including sociologist and civil rights leader W.E.B. Du Bois, astronaut Ellen Ochoa, Nobel laureate Steven Chu, and computer programming pioneer Grace Hopper.\nMarion Usselman\n\u2013 Education\nHonored for distinguished contributions to gender equity in universities and major contributions to curriculum and teacher professional development.\nCEISMC\nMarion Usselman ,\u00a0a\u00a0principal research scientist in the Center for Education Integrating Science, Mathematics, and Computing ( CEISMC ),\u00a0arrived at Georgia Tech in 1996\u00a0with a Ph.D. in Biophysics from The Johns Hopkins University and a passion\u00a0for improving education and access in typically white male-dominated STEM fields. At that time women made up just 28% of the Institute\u2019s undergraduate population. She has spent the last 26 years working diligently to help increase that\u00a0number and give the next generation of women\u00a0and other historically underserved populations\u00a0a true seat at the\u00a0STEM\u00a0table.\nAs part of\u00a0the Integrating Gender Equity and Reform NSF project,\u00a0Usselman and her\u00a0colleagues conducted an\u00a0in-depth Georgia Tech institutional self-study that examined the barriers that women and minorities faced when choosing their career path, as well as the methods used in the classroom that may have influenced their choices.\u00a0 The results of the study, and of many subsequent educational projects,\u00a0showed Usselman that there was plenty of work to be done, particularly in the K-12 arena.\nTo that end, Usselman has spearheaded the effort to reform K-12 STEM education\u00a0in Georgia and nationally, leading up a CEISMC team dedicated to designing and developing educational innovations. She\u2019s co-authored over\u00a060\u00a0refereed\u00a0journal\u00a0and conference papers and\u00a0brought in more than $40\u00a0million in funding as the primary writer on\u00a0over 20 funded\u00a0STEM-education grant proposals.\u00a0\u00a0In addition, her team has\u00a0created\u00a0extensive curriculum materials for\u00a0K-12\u00a0students and teachers, particularly in the engineering and computer science areas, and implemented\u00a0many\u00a0STEM-related professional learning opportunities for K-12 teachers.\n\u201cMy team has spent the last 15 to 20 years designing curricular exemplars, based on well-established research on how people learn and factors that encourage a sense of belonging and identity, so that teachers can try out inclusive methods of instruction and experience success in engaging students who are traditionally underrepresented in STEM fields,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is important to change teachers\u2019 hearts and minds, but we believe that is best done by giving them something to try that works, not by lecturing. Because that is how people learn.\u201d\nLoren Williams \u2013 Biological Sciences\nHonored for distinguished contributions to the fields of biophysics and the origins and evolution of life on Earth, particularly for advancing our understanding of the evolution of the translation system.\nSchool of Chemistry and Biochemistry\nLoren Williams\nwas content in his work as a crystallographer, but when he began studying new ribosome structures at the turn of the century, he found a true passion for uncovering the origins of life on Earth and set out on a path that has now earned him the distinction of becoming an AAAS Fellow.\nWhile its basic function is to produce proteins, Williams noticed that the ribosome could offer a previously unseen look into the past. While he admittedly didn\u2019t know much about evolution at the time, Williams couldn\u2019t shake his curiosity surrounding the similarities in bacterial and archaeal ribosomes across the span of nearly 4 billion years.\n\u201cNinety percent of everything became boring from that point on, because all of a sudden what I was looking at was small. I and I kept going for a couple years, but in my head, I was like, \u2018What am I doing here?\u2019 I just thought, \u2018OK, I don't know what to do.\u2019 I just kept staring at the ribosome,\u201d Williams said.\nContinuing his award-winning and NASA-funded research as \u201ca scientist in a sea of engineers at Georgia Tech,\u201d Williams explained that the translation system unites all living things and predates LUCA \u2014 the last universal common ancestor \u2014 while serving as a molecular time machine.\n\u201cIt's been frozen ever since. So, if we can understand the origins and evolution of the translation system, we are looking back before LUCA, which is really looking back to the origin of life,\u201d he said. \u201cIn my lab over the last 15 years, we have worked out how to understand the evolution of the ribosome, which is kind of like a movie of the origin of life and we're slowly looking at it frame by frame and figuring out how to do that.\u201d\nWilliams' initial interest in the structures superseded his desire to receive grants or publish papers, and at the time, he didn't see the makings of a viable research program. Nevertheless, despite some initial rejection, Williams pressed on, and now, as an AAAS Fellow can now reflect on the gamble he took.\n\"I feel like I've kind of come back from the dead in a way, and it's a nice feeling because I really thought I was finished,\" he said. \"Science is a funny business.\"\nSamuel Graham Jr. \u2013 Engineering\nHonored for developing optical/electrical methods and models to characterize thermal response/properties of wide bandgap electronics including RF and power electronics and for developing chip-embedded cooling for high heat flux operation.\nGeorge W. Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering\nGraham\nis being recognized for his cutting-edge research into the thermal characterization and thermal management of\u00a0gallium nitride-based wide bandgap semiconductors used in radio frequency communications, solid-state lighting, and power electronics.\u00a0His work has been instrumental in numerous Department of Defense and industrial programs in the development of these technologies, and he was recently\u00a0recognized with the 2022 ASME Allan Kraus Thermal Management Medal and the 2022 Hawkins Memorial Lecture in Heat Transfer at Purdue University.\nGraham served as the Eugene C.\u00a0Gwaltney Jr.\u00a0School Chair for the\u00a0 George W.\u00a0Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering\nat Georgia Tech, where he remains a professor, while also serving as dean of the A. James Clark School of Engineering at the University of Maryland. He holds a Ph.D. and a master\u2019s degree in mechanical engineering from Tech, a place that allowed him to fulfill his childhood dream.\n\u201cI am honored\u00a0to be recognized as a\u00a0fellow\u00a0of AAAS.\u00a0Moreover, I am thankful for my students and collaborators throughout my career that have made my work enjoyable and have inspired me to make an impact on technologies that will benefit society.\u00a0I wish to say thank you to AAAS and am happy to support its mission to advance science for the benefit of all,\u201d\u00a0he\u00a0said.\nGraham also serves on several advisory boards to advance science and engineering. This includes serving as\u00a0chair\u00a0of the Emerging Technologies Technical Advisory Committee in the\u00a0U.S.\u00a0Department of Commerce, the Engineering Science Research Foundation of Sandia National Laboratories, the AT SCALE initiative at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, and the Institute for Nuclear Power Operations.\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nLim, Milor, Qureshi Elevated to IEEE Fellows (January 2023)\nCEISMC researcher named 2022 Fellow by the American Association for the Advanc\u2026\nContact\nSteven Gagliano\n- Communications Officer\nInstitute Communications\nEmail\nSteven.gagliano@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
