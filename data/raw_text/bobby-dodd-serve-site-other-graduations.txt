In mid to late May, other schools will be using Tech’s Bobby Dodd Stadium for their graduation celebrations. Spelman College will hold its Commencement ceremonies on Sunday, May 16, at 9:30 a.m. and 3 p.m. Atlanta Public Schools will hold several high school graduations from Monday, May 24, through Thursday, May 27, with ceremonies at noon and 7 p.m. on Monday, and 9 a.m., noon, and 7 p.m. on the other days.
Those on campus can expect to see increased traffic — as well as campus visitors — on the days of the ceremonies. Spelman graduates, their families, and faculty will be able to park in several lots, most of which cover east campus. They include:
E81
E52
ER53
ER66
E65
E40

W22
Coda: Overflow
Area 1 Visitor lot: Spelman staff only
Brittain Drive will also serve as a shuttle route between parking lots and the stadium. See the parking map below for more details.
Georgia Tech’s Commencement ceremonies will be held on May 7 and 8. The next round of classes, including early short, maymester, and full summer classes, begins on Monday, May 17.
