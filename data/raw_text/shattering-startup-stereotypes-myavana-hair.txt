As she tells it, Tech alumna Candace Mitchell would not likely be leading a haircare revolution with the haircare recommendation system  Myavana  had it not been for the intense startup education she received at Georgia Tech while pursuing her undergraduate degree in computer science.
She remembers her experience at Tech as one she wouldn’t “trade for the world” and fondly recalls how coaching from her computing professor, Merrick Furst, propelled her into full-blown entrepreneurship.
“He had a huge impact on my entrepreneurial career.”
“Not only was he my professor — a very tough professor, I have to add — he really opened my eyes to how to start a business and how to fulfill the needs of your customer,” said Mitchell.
“I remember after a conversation we had, I decided to quit my job in corporate America and pursue entrepreneurship full-time.”
