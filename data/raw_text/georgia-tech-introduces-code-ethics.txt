Georgia Tech Introduces Code of Ethics
The Code of Ethics is a living document that is a tool to help employees navigate ethical decisions they may face.

Georgia Tech’s Office of Ethics and Compliance is excited to introduce a
Code of Ethics , a resource to support employees as they navigate decision making at Georgia Tech. The Code of Ethics is aligned with the Institute’s
nine strategic values
and a culture of ethics.
When developing the Code of Ethics, the Office of Ethics and Compliance assembled a working group of faculty and staff stakeholders to share their subject matter expertise and review content. They worked to make the document easy to understand, eliminating legalese whenever possible. The code also includes visuals, such as flowcharts and other graphics, to make it visually appealing and reader friendly.
“The Code of Ethics is not a rule book or a policy. It is a living document that is a tool to help employees navigate ethical decisions they may face,” said Sally Robertson, senior counsel in the Office of Ethics and Compliance. “And while it can't tell you what to do in every situation, it can provide a great starting point.”
Current employees are invited to attend the Code of Ethics Employee Celebration to be held Wednesday, April 13, from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. on Tech Green. Attendees who download or obtain a hard copy of the Code of Ethics will receive a food truck voucher (limited to the first 100 attendees), a free t-shirt, or a free King of Pops popsicle (first come, first served as supplies last).
