Original story:
Georgia Tech will sunset the BlueJeans videoconferencing solution on Monday, May 30. Campus users are encouraged to migrate stored recordings before then.
The BlueJeans decommission is a culmination of a review by the
Video Collaboration Review  (VCR) Committee. The group was established to evaluate new videoconferencing solutions for academic course delivery and collaboration against existing services. Driven by Georgia Tech Professional Education (GTPE) and the Office of Information Technology (OIT), the committee brought in student, faculty, and staff voices from across the Institute to identify video collaboration service offerings. Ultimately, plans to sunset BlueJeans and WebEx (except for the Georgia Tech Research Institute*) were formalized.
The VCR Committee also announced a soft launch of the  Zoom  video collaboration platform.
“Not only did Zoom, to a large extent, meet our committee’s criteria, but it is also one of the most widely used video collaboration tools,” Yakut Gazi, Ph.D., associate dean for Learning Systems at GTPE,
said
earlier this year. “Many of our students, faculty, and staff have participated in Zoom meetings during and even before the pandemic, which we anticipate will facilitate adoption at Georgia Tech.” Since the soft launch, the platform has facilitated over 2,700 meetings and webinars by Tech users.
In preparation for the transition from BlueJeans, students, faculty, and staff are encouraged to migrate stored lecture, meeting, and event recordings to
Kaltura MediaSpace
via the
BlueJeans Video Exporter
tool. The exporter will move a maximum of five videos simultaneously, with each video typically taking a few minutes to upload. Archived videos can take up to five hours, depending on the video’s length.
OIT has published an
11-step illustrated knowledge article
to guide campus users during the recording transfer process. Campus users who need further assistance can also submit a help request via the Services and Support site at
gatech.service-now.com/home .
In addition to Zoom, Georgia Tech will continue to offer and support
Microsoft Teams , which offers videoconferencing, secure file storage, chat, meeting, calling, and file-sharing capabilities.
OIT will work with the Georgia Tech community throughout the rest of the spring semester to prepare for the transition from BlueJeans. Upcoming communications will share additional information.
The BlueJeans Video Exporter tool can be accessed at
mover.bluejeans.gatech.edu.
*The Georgia Tech Research Institute will continue to use its version of WebEx ( gtri.webex.com ).
