The Georgia Manufacturing Extension Partnership at Georgia Tech (GaMEP) is seeking nominations to recognize those Georgians who illustrate the critical role they and the industry play in the state economy.
The Faces of Manufacturing campaign, now in its third year, showcases the importance of a sector that employs more than 365,000 at 10,000 manufacturing companies of all sizes across Georgia. Collectively, the industry has a total manufacturing output of $53 billion per year.
The 2017 Faces campaign, which is run by the GaMEP and is supported in part by the Georgia Department of Economic Development, will feature one person in the industry from each of the Department’s 12 regions.
Nominations for 2017 Faces are open through Friday, Nov. 18, at:

To be eligible, nominees must be employed in manufacturing or have ties to the industry. Those chosen as the Face of Manufacturing will be selected by a committee comprised of Georgia Tech representatives, economic development groups, manufacturing companies, and related associations.
“Over the last two years, we have shared compelling and interesting life stories of our nominees,” said GaMEP Director Karen J. Fite. “Our Faces represent Georgia’s rich tapestry of a workforce that’s talented, dedicated, and committed to the success of their individual companies and the economic vibrancy of manufacturing and the state as a whole.”
