Georgia Tech Unveils New AI Makerspace in Collaboration with NVIDIA
By giving students access to powerful supercomputers, Georgia Tech will teach AI to undergraduates in a way unlike any other university in the nation.
Apr 10, 2024
Georgia Tech’s College of Engineering has established an artificial intelligence supercomputer hub dedicated exclusively to teaching students. The initiative — the AI Makerspace — is launched in collaboration with  NVIDIA . College leaders call it a digital sandbox for students to understand and use AI in the classroom Initially focusing on undergraduate students, the AI Makerspace aims to democratize access to computing resources typically reserved for researchers or technology companies. Students will access the cluster online as part of their coursework, deepening their AI skills through hands-on experience. The Makerspace will also better position students after graduation as they work with AI professionals and help shape the technology’s future applications. “The launch of the AI Makerspace represents another milestone in Georgia Tech’s legacy of innovation and leadership in education,” said  Raheem Beyah , dean of the College and Southern Company Chair. “Thanks to NVIDIA’s advanced technology and expertise, our students at all levels have a path to make significant contributions and lead in the rapidly evolving field of AI.” Get the full story on the College of Engineering website.
