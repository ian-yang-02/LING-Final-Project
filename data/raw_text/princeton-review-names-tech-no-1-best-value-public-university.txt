Georgia Tech continues to earn attention for its impressive return on investment.
The latest validation comes from The Princeton Review, which ranks Tech as the No. 1 best value public university in the country.
In its
“Best Value Colleges for 2023”
report, the educational services company ranked a total of 209 schools, 74 of which were public institutions.
“We are proud to offer our students an exceptional education, and pleased when others recognize the value of a Georgia Tech degree,” said President Ángel Cabrera. “Generous state investment, enrollment growth, innovation, and fiscal prudence have helped us not just maintain but actually reduce tuition and fees over the past four years, which coupled with extraordinary market demand for the talent we produce, explains the ROI recognized by these rankings.”
In addition to the #1 ranking in overall
return on investment ,
Georgia Tech
also
placed
No. 1 in
career placement
and No. 6
for internships
among public universities .
To calculate its return on investment rating, The Princeton Review analyzed more than 40 data points covering academics, costs, financial aid, debt, graduation rates, and career and salary data.
Other recent publications have drawn similar conclusions. In May 2022, Money magazine ranked Georgia Tech the
No. 6 best value
among all universities, public or private.
