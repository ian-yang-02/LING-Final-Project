On Oct. 17, Jennifer Chirico will join Infrastructure and Sustainability (I&S) as the associate vice president of Sustainability.

“I am thrilled to return to Georgia Tech, my alma mater, to share my experiences and expertise in sustainability. In my opinion, the people at Georgia Tech are its foundation and what makes it great,” said Chirico. “I hope to serve as a connector and bridge in helping to lead the university in becoming a world-class sustainability Institute that is known for its advances and innovation in student programs, clean energy, net zero initiatives, zero waste, and climate justice.”
In this inaugural role, Chirico will lead the implementation of the Institute Sustainability Plan and the Climate Action Plan as well as help guide the future of sustainability at Georgia Tech.
