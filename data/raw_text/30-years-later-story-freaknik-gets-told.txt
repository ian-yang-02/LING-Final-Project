30 Years Later, Story of Freaknik Gets Told
Joycelyn Wilson, assistant professor in the School of Literature, Media, and Communication, says the release of 'Freaknik: The Wildest Party Never Told' continues to raise the profile of Atlanta’s role in hip-hop overall, not just in the South.

What started as a picnic for
B lack college students in
1983
turned into a national — even international — party that filled the parks and streets of Atlanta. It turned into
Freaknik , and
it’s
now the subject of a Hulu documentary.
Joycelyn Wilson , assistant professor in the School of Literature, Media, and Communication, says the release of
Freaknik : The Wildest Party Never Told
continues to raise the profile of Atlanta’s role in hip-hop overall, not just in the South.
“It was
B lack college weekend, and it attracted folks from all over. It grew into a big weekend for
B lack youth and
artists
to come together and enjoy the weekend and each other,” she said.
Wilson, who grew up in
Atlanta
and
is
a Black
media
studies and hip-hop scholar, has been familiar with
F reaknik
since she was in middle school
— although, the first time she was there, she
d idn’t
even realize it .
“I was with my cousin, and he told me to sit in the car while he talked to his friends,” she said.
The documentary , produced by Lu ther
Campbell, Jermaine Dupri,
and 21 Savage,  highlights
Freaknik
in 1994, which Wilson says was a
pivotal
year for hip-hop. It brought the release of
OutKast’s
debut album,
Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik ,
along with albums from
Nas
and Biggie Smalls.
“ Freaknik
was a platform for them to perform and really expanded how hip-hop came together,” Wilson said.
As
Freaknik
grew, so did its problems. Amid
reported
sexual assault s , traffic, and safety concerns, Atlanta police
attempted
to shut it down in 1999. Wilson covered the decline of
Freaknik
as a journalist for
Rap Pages
at the time with her article,
“ They Don’t Freak No Mo ’ . ”
“Visitors were welcomed
only
to
the Sweet Auburn Fest, while downtown was filled with nothing more than ghosts of
Freakniks
past,” she wrote
in the August 1999 issue .
Still, the essence of the original
Freaknik
fellowship lives on elsewhere in
Black
culture ,
at HBCU events such as Homecoming and music festivals. Wilson
recalled
the One Music Festival in
Atlanta’s
Piedmont Park last year, where ,
as Kendrick Lamar performed,
she felt a similar feeling
to wh at
Freak nik
once evoked.
Others have
attempted
to revive the event in the past.
Whether the documentary’s release could spur a nother attempt
remains
to be see n — but, as Wilson said, “i t could get a remix ."
