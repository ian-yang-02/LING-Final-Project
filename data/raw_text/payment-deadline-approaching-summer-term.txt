As each new semester begins, students should be mindful of important dates that could affect their registration process.
The Summer 2023 term begins Monday, May 15. In anticipation, students should be aware of the summer term payment deadline on Monday, May 22.
Being mindful of the payment deadline for the semester can help students avoid getting removed from their courses or having a hold placed on their account for non-payment of account balances.
