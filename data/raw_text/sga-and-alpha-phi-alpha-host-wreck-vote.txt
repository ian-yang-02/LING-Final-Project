Each year, the Student Government Association’s (SGA) government relations committee and the Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity team up to host Wreck the Vote, a campuswide voter registration drive. This year, Wreck the Vote will also include helping people request their absentee ballots, check their voter registration, and find their polling place.
Last year, Wreck the Vote helped approximately 150 students register to vote. This year, with the presidential election taking place in November, SGA and Alpha Phi Alpha want to make sure all eligible members of the Georgia Tech community have everything they need to cast their ballots. SGA will be tabling on Tech Walkway from 9 a.m. until 2 p.m. on Wednesday, Sept. 16, to pass out information and answer questions. Meanwhile, Alpha Phi Alpha will be holding
virtual office hours
from 1 to 2 p.m. Sept. 15-17 so that students, faculty, and staff can answer questions without any face-to-face interaction.
Wreck the Vote week will culminate in a debate on Thursday, Sept. 17, between Georgia Tech’s four political student organizations: College Democrats, College Republicans, Young Democratic Socialists of America, and Young Americans for Liberty. The debate will be
streamed over BlueJeans
starting at 6 p.m.
