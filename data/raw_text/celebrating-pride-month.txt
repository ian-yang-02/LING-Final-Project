June is designated Pride Month for the LGBTQIA community to celebrate culture and community. It originated in the early 1970s with daylong and weekend commemorations of the Stonewall riots of 1969.
“Pride Month is an important time for the LGBTQIA community that represents identity, community, and ally solidarity as well as resistance to discrimination and violence,” said Tegra Myanna, director of the LGBTQIA Resource Center. “Each year, June reminds me of the importance of community and the resilience of LGBTQIA people.”
This month, there are several ways to get involved in educational or advocacy efforts, and opportunities to engage with the LGBTQIA Resource Center on campus. A few of those include:
Safe Space Training
Safe Space is Georgia Tech’s LGBTQIA ally training program for faculty, staff, affiliates, graduate students, and postdocs.
