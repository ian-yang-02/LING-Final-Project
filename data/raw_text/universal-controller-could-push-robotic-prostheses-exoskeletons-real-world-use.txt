Universal Controller Could Push Robotic Prostheses, Exoskeletons Into Real-World Use
Aaron Young’s team has developed a wear-and-go approach that requires no calibration or training.

Robotic exoskeletons designed to help humans with walking or physically demanding work have been the stuff of sci-fi lore for decades. Remember
Ellen Ripley in that Power Loader in
Alien ? Or the crazy mobile platform
George McFly wore in 2015 in
Back to the Future, Part II
because he threw his back out?
Researchers are working on real-life robotic assistance that could protect workers from painful injuries and help stroke patients regain their mobility. So far, they have required extensive calibration and context-specific tuning, which keeps them largely limited to research labs.
Mechanical engineers at Georgia Tech may be on the verge of changing that, allowing exoskeleton technology to be deployed in homes, workplaces, and more.
A team of researchers in
Aaron Young’s
lab have developed a universal approach to controlling robotic exoskeletons that requires no training, no calibration, and no adjustments to complicated algorithms. Instead, users can don the “exo” and go.
Their system uses a kind of artificial intelligence called deep learning to autonomously adjust how the exoskeleton provides assistance, and they’ve shown it works seamlessly to support walking, standing, and climbing stairs or ramps.
They described their “unified control framework” March 20 in
Science Robotics .
“The goal was not just to provide control across different activities, but to create a single unified system. You don't have to press buttons to switch between modes or have some classifier algorithm that tries to predict that you're climbing stairs or walking,” said Young, associate professor in the
George W. Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering .
