Emeka Obikwelu has been named as the first 3M Fellow in the Georgia Tech School of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE).
Obikwelu is a new ECE Ph.D. student specializing in power engineering and is currently a GTA for ECE 3040A–Microelectronics/Solid State Devices. He is currently focusing his literature review efforts on the topic of wide area monitoring, control, and protection. Obikwelu is also interested in research aimed at the use of synchronized wide-area measurements to facilitate “smart” wide-area system control and system protection decision-making in response to, or as a means of expediently mitigating the scale of wide-area power system disturbances.
Prior to enrolling in the ECE doctoral program, Obikwelu held engineering positions at Xcel Energy, Pike Energy Solutions/UC Synergistic, Schweitzer Engineering Laboratory, and Consumers Energy. He is a 2005 B.S.E.E. graduate of Wayne State University and a 2008 M.S.E.E. graduate of Michigan Technological University.
By focusing on science, technology, engineering, and math in this fellowship program, 3M encourages student interest and awareness in STEM fields at the K-12 level and works to build high performing and diverse global talent at the college/university level.
