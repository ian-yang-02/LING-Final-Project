A new group of Georgia Tech faculty has been tapped to serve as strategic advisors for the direction of sustainability research at Georgia Tech. Twelve faculty members have been selected to the inaugural class of fellows with the Brook Byers Institute for Sustainable Systems (BBISS). The new group will serve as advisors to BBISS and work to foster the culture and community of sustainability researchers, educators, and students at Georgia Tech. They will also help carry the message of sustainability and the vision, mission, values, and objectives of BBISS. Their selection is for three years with the potential for renewal.  In late August, the fellows will begin mapping out a strategy for future years. The 12 fellows represent all six of Georgia Tech’s colleges, as well as the Georgia Tech Research Institute.  The inaugural BBISS Fellows are: Baabak Ashuri , School of Building Construction, College of Architecture.

Byers has helped build more than 110 companies in the life sciences area and is particularly active in biotechnology incubation.
