This spring, the Georgia Tech community engaged in the 2023 Georgia Tech Culture Survey, enabling faculty and staff to share feedback about their workplace experiences. The results provide valuable insights into our strengths and areas for improvement, as we work to better align our values and our daily practices. The survey elicited responses from 2,099 faculty and staff, with a response rate of 20.4%, a slight increase from 2021.
“All of us, regardless of our level or position, play an instrumental role in building our culture through our day-to-day activities. This year’s Culture Survey results show that we have made significant progress in living our values every day and illustrate that by working together we can co-create the culture to which we aspire,” said Frank Neville, chief of staff and senior vice president of Strategic Initiatives and the executive sponsor of the
L.O.V.E. GT  initiative.

Creating an environment where individuals are encouraged and believe it’s OK to speak up, challenge the status quo, and offer original ideas without fear of judgment or punishment.
Institute-wide workshops on “Psychological Safety” and “Leading Congruently With Values.”
Staff Culture advisory councils have been formed at various organizational levels, along with communications working groups and establishing a leadership competency model.
The survey results were reviewed by Georgia Tech’s senior leaders throughout the summer, and leaders have been equipped with the Culture Improvement Toolkit, providing actionable insights into diverse perspectives, holistic learning, and growth. This toolkit provide provides practical advice on integrating core values into daily work, using best practices and positive communication. Every department will work together with leaders and employees to improve their local workplace culture.
