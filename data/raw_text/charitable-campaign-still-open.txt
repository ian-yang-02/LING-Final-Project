— Atlanta, GA
Whether it provides groceries to a family in need or feeds an animal in a shelter — every dollar donated to the Georgia State Charitable Contributions Program (GASCCP) helps a worthy cause. The GASCCP is a benefit for state of Georgia and University System employees that allows contributions to their charity of choice through payroll deductions or a one-time donation. The campaign is open through Nov. 16.
Since beginning in mid-September, Georgia Tech’s charitable campaign has raised more than $118,477.80 (71.8% of the goal), with 424 participants (59.1% of the goal). Since 2017, an average of 717 Tech employees have participated in the campaign each year.
There are more than 700
local, state, and national nonprofit organizations
to which you can contribute. You can support cancer research, provide food and shelter to the hungry and homeless, or assist children learning to read — along with hundreds of other ways to make a difference.
