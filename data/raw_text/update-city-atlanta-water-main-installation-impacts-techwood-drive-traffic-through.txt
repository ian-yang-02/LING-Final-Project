The City of Atlanta is installing a 12-inch water main along Techwood Drive between North Avenue and 3rd Street/Bobby Dodd Way (adjacent to Bobby Dodd Stadium). The northbound lane will be closed during normal business hours (approximately 9 a.m. - 4 p.m.) Monday through Friday through August 14. The southbound lane will be used to maintain two-way traffic, with traffic controllers, during working hours. Both lanes of Techwood Drive will be open each night.
The access drives to Brittain Dining Hall and those in between Cloudman and Glenn Residence Halls will remain open. On-street parking in ER51 along Techwood Drive may be limited.
Georgia Tech Design & Construction is working closely with the City of Atlanta to ensure campus improvements remain on schedule.
