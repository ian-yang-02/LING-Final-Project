Professors Help Found Multimillion Dollar Math & Biology NSF-Simons Project
The way physics is married to math, a new national project attempts to bring math together with biology.
The National Science Foundation and the Simons Foundation have launched a large collaboration of bioscientists and mathematicians to advance both fields. The project will have a total of three centers funded with $30 million, one of which is headquartered at Georgia Tech and will receive a third of the funding.

A new national project, which includes the Georgia Institute of Technology, aims to convey the benefits of physics’ age-old intertwining with math upon biology, a science historically less connected with it. The National Science Foundation and the Simons Foundation have launched four centers to do this, funded with $40 million, one of which is headquartered at Georgia Tech and will receive a quarter of the funding.
