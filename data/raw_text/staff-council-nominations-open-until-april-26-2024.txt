Georgia Tech Staff Council seeks nominations and applications for new members. Nominations for elected members and committee members will be accepted from April 15 until April 26.
Apr 26, 2024
As a result of Georgia Tech's continued growth, Staff Council has
enacted several bylaw revisions
that impact the elections process. Effective fiscal year 2025, Staff Council will add five new seats, expanding the Council to 28 elected members, and transition to an Institute representative model. The number of the elected members will be reassessed on an annual basis allocating 1 seat per 200 staff to serve as elected representatives for the
four executive groups :
Academic Affairs ,  Administration & Finance ,  President , and  Research .
Staff Council is seeking 12 staff to serve as elected members for a three-year term beginning on July 1, 2024, including:
Academic Affairs: 4 vacant seats
Administration & Finance: 5 vacant seats
President: 0 vacant seats
Research: 3 vacant seats
All staff are welcome to apply for committee membership, which is a one-year term. There is no limit to the number of committee members.
A prospective Staff Council member should be prepared to represent one of the four Institute executive groups, actively contribute to Staff Council initiatives, and serve as a voice of staff to Institute leadership. It is strongly encouraged to review the eligibility criteria, consider the membership expectations and responsibilities, and acquire supervisor approval before accepting a nomination and committing to serve as an elected member or committee member.
