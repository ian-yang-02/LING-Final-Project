For Fiscal Year 2020, Georgia Tech has been selected as a recipient of the Georgia Department of Audits and Accounts (DOAA) “Award of Distinction for Excellent Financial Reporting.” The certificate of achievement encourages colleges and universities to go beyond the minimum requirements of generally accepted accounting principles and recognizes individual organizations that are successful in achieving that goal.
The award was issued to Carol Gibson, Institute Controller, earlier this month. This is the Institute’s seventh time receiving this award since its inception in 2014. Congratulations to Carol and her team for striving for excellence!
