As you get ready for fall break this weekend, the best thing to take with you is the peace of mind that you’re not potentially spreading Covid-19.
With fall break happening Oct. 11-12, students should plan to test this week in order to get their results before leaving campus for the long weekend. Even those staying on campus should test, knowing they might participate in extra social activities during the break.
Covid-19 campus testing continues to be fast and free. The saliva-based test takes about two minutes and all sites are open regular hours this week. And, of course, cookies and other treats await you at test sites.

When you get back to campus, test again as soon as you return. A recent decline in campus cases can only be maintained through regular testing and isolating cases before they become outbreaks.
The best ways to prevent Covid-19 are still through vaccination and wearing face coverings when indoors. Vaccines continue to be distributed on campus at Stamps Health Services, and face coverings are encouraged in all campus facilities. If you have not been vaccinated,
