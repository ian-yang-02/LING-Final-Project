Committees are vital to faculty governance at Georgia Tech, with many initiatives and new programs originating there. Nominations to faculty committees for the Spring 2024 elections are being solicited until Sunday, March 31.
Georgia Tech faculty members are invited to participate in faculty governance by seeking election to the Faculty Standing Committees or the Faculty Executive Board. Nominations (including self-nominations) are now open and can be submitted through
this online form .
All nominees will be contacted to confirm their intent to run for election prior to review of the nomination by the Nominating Committee and posting of the election ballot. The committee will attempt to honor requests for specific committees, but some elections are constrained by requirements associated with particular seats (e.g. tenure versus non-tenure track) and the maintenance of a balance of campus representation on all committees. For a description of each standing committee and its duties and charge, visit the
Georgia Tech Policy Library . Elected members are expected to serve a three-year term, from August 2024 through July 2027.
For any additional information or questions, contact
Rhett Mayor , secretary of the Faculty, or
Elena Garcia
or
Mindy Millard-Stafford , co-chairs of the Nominating Committee.
