The 2021 Annual Compliance Training will help define
Living Our Values
at Georgia Tech, reinforce the University System of Georgia (USG) ethical standards and cybersecurity requirements, and remind us all about the importance of research integrity, reporting external activities, and navigating foreign influence.
New this year, the Annual Compliance Training will take place in the fall to coincide with
Ethics Awareness Week . Faculty, staff (including Tech Temps), and student employees hired prior to Oct. 1, 2021, are required to complete this year’s four training modules:
USG Ethics Training
Information Security/Cybersecurity Training
Georgia Tech Foreign Influence, Research Integrity, and Conflict of Interest Training
Conflict of Interest Attestation
You must complete all four of the Compliance Training modules between Oct. 25 and Nov. 19. Employees who do not fully complete the requirements by midnight on Nov. 19 may receive a formal disciplinary notice from the Institute.
The Annual Compliance Training can be completed on a desktop or laptop. It should take approximately 45 minutes, and it does not have to be completed at one time.
