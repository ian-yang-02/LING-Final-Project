"This top five ranking is a reflection of the outstanding scholarship and clear focus on continual improvement they are dedicated to."

Tech's fifth place ranking follows Massachusetts Institute of Technology; University of California, Berkeley; University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign; and University of California, Los Angeles.
