Georgia Tech Earth Month Events to Mark on Your Calendar
Earth Day is April 22, but Georgia Tech is celebrating Earth Month with events throughout April highlighting sustainability efforts across campus.
Mar 31, 2023
On April 22, communities across the U.S. and countries around the globe will come together in observance of Earth Day. Georgia Tech takes the opportunity to educate and celebrate the importance of protecting the environment a step further with
Earth Month .
Events throughout the month allow students, faculty, and staff to familiarize themselves with sustainability efforts being put forward by the Institute and practices they can incorporate into their daily routines.
The global theme for Earth Day 2023 — the 53rd iteration of the event — and Tech’s month-long rendition is “invest in our planet.”
“The Earth Month lineup highlights the numerous ways that community members can embrace this theme,’” said Abby Bower, sustainability program support coordinator. “Today, the planet faces daunting challenges, but we all have the opportunity to pitch in to solve them. Georgia Tech has many great organizations, departments, and individuals dedicating their time and resources to making a better world, and we are excited to highlight them all month long.”
During Earth Month, you can participate in service opportunities, attend educational events, weigh in on ways Georgia Tech can meet our climate goals, and more.
