Shane Kimbrough (M.S. Operations Research, 1998) will celebrate Christmas with five crewmates aboard the International Space Station. He is the commander of the football-field sized facility, his home since arriving in late October. Kimbrough won't return  until after Valentine's Day.
During an interview with his alma mater from 250 miles above Earth, Kimbrough talks about the mission to date, his upcoming spacewalks, and the two Christmases he'll celebrate while in orbit. See pictures of the mission and watch the interview.
