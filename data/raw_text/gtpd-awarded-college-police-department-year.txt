The Georgia Tech Police Department (GTPD) has been recognized by a national law enforcement publication as the college department of the year for 2021. In its inaugural recognition, LAW Publications is calling attention to departments across the country for efforts in community engagement. In addition to department of the year, the group also gives awards for community spirit, collaboration, and community impact.
LAW Publications recognized several GTPD-led programs, including community coffee gatherings, an adopt-a-cop program with area business and student organizations, and a care package drive for homeless people in neighboring communities.
“I believe giving people the opportunity to engage with officers in their community will give them a chance to see beyond the badge,” said GTPD Sergeant Jessica Howard in the award recognition. “We enjoy the interactions just as much.”
