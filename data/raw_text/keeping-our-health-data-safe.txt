The medical care we receive is changing rapidly, thanks to the information collected through our smartphones, tablets and other devices. While this data has the potential to improve our lives, it also reveals a critical question. How do we keep our health data secure? Georgia Tech’s Scheller College of Business and the School of Interactive Computing are hosting a panel discussion Wednesday afternoon with leading experts to explore the future of health privacy and the pioneering technologies that are changing health care. The event — which is also sponsored by the National Cyber Security Alliance, Alston & Bird, LLP and Merck — is one of several taking place across the country in honor of Data Privacy Day. The Georgia Tech panel will look at how to balance health benefits and innovation while assuring privacy and data security. The panel
will be held at the Academy of Medicine
and will be
livestreamed .
