Spring break (March 21-25) is less than three weeks away. For some students, it could mean heading back home or going on vacation. But Alternative Service Breaks (ASB) will provide students with an opportunity to help communities around the southeastern U.S. through volunteer trips, making great connections along the way. This year, ASB is hosting two trips. The first trip is in Mississippi from March 18 to 25.
“Participants will help clean up beaches and surrounding areas that have been affected by hurricanes,” said Nadia Ahmedin, the president of Alternative Service Breaks. The other goal of the trip is to create connections between Mississippi communities and Tech students and to highlight the effects of climate change on people and their built environment. The cost of the trip is $350.
The other trip takes students through the greater Atlanta area between March 18 and 22 and focuses on several innovative environmental efforts that are taking place in the metro area. The trip costs $100.
“These trips are a great way to connect with Georgia Tech students while also helping those in need in a community,” said Ahmedin. Applications for these trips are accepted on a rolling basis, and they can be found on
ASB’s Engage page.
