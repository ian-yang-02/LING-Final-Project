With elections in progress, Georgia Tech's Office of Ethics and Compliance offers guidance to employees about its policies on political activities.
University System of Georgia (USG) employees are encouraged to fulfill their civic obligations and share their views on political issues; however, in doing so, they may act only in their personal capacities and must not use Institute resources or appear to be speaking on behalf of the Institute.
In addition, USG employees may not hold elective political offices at the state or federal level while employed by the USG. Political campaigning during work hours, or in a way that interferes with Institute responsibilities, is prohibited.
Additional questions may be submitted to the Office of Ethics and Compliance at  gtethics@gatech.edu .
