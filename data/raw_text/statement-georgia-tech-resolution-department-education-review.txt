— Atlanta, GA
Last year, the U.S. Department of Education OCR launched an investigation into an incident involving a Georgia Tech student organization. Georgia Tech is pleased to announce that the parties have reached an agreement and the case is now closed.
Respect is a core value at Georgia Tech, and one that we recognize as critical to cultivating an inclusive, diverse, and dynamic campus community. We are committed to fostering thoughtful interaction, global perspective, and intercultural sensitivity, and we maintain a strong equal opportunity, nondiscrimination, and anti-harassment policy that applies to every member of the Institute community.
Anti-Semitism and any other forms of discrimination are not acceptable. Georgia Tech recognizes that per the Executive Order on Combatting Anti-Semitism dated December 11, 2019, the U.S. Department of Education considers the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance’s working definition of Anti-Semitism and contemporary examples when evaluating the intent in cases of discriminatory harassment. Georgia Tech encourages members of our community to learn about the IHRA working definition and contemporary examples. You can find further information

It is incumbent upon all of us to work together to ensure that unlawful discrimination and harassment are not welcome at Georgia Tech. Georgia Tech is committed to working collaboratively with Hillel and others to provide a campus community that is free from unlawful discrimination.
