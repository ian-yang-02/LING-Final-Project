Georgia Advanced Technology Ventures Inc., an affiliate of the Georgia Institute of Technology, has announced the expansion of
BioSpark Labs
— a collaborative, shared laboratory environment designed to enable life sciences and biotech startups. The $6 million expansion will increase the facility’s usable footprint to 17,000 square feet by adding 11 new private and shared labs, shared scientific equipment spaces, and additional workspaces and offices to attract and support the emerging researchers in the bioscience industry.
BioSpark Labs is already home to several bioscience startups, including Arnav Biotech, Exvade Bioscience, SynthBiome, and Karnelian X, an innovator in cancer treatment with significant expansion plans. Microelectronics startup Saras Micro Devices also occupies space in BioSpark Labs.
“BioSpark Labs is designed to offer fully fitted-out, equipped, and professionally operated laboratory and office space — representing a significant amount of the necessary services and support that early-stage companies need to begin laboratory operations on day one,” said Tony Zivalich, associate vice president for Real Estate Development. “In addition, it offers an intellectually and culturally enhanced environment with a neighborhood of researchers participating in a rich collaborative community environment adjacent to Georgia Tech.”
Located in Science Square, which is designated as a federal opportunity zone, BioSpark Labs helps advance and expand the ecosystem for bioscience research and commercialization in Atlanta. The planned expansion is expected to be completed by mid-2023.
