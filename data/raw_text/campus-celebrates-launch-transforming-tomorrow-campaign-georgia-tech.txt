— Atlanta, GA
The on-campus launch events for Transforming Tomorrow: The Campaign for Georgia Tech took place at the Exhibition Hall on Dec. 9 and 10. Hundreds of attendees from across the Tech community had the opportunity to interact with and hear inspiring stories from students, faculty, administrators, and alumni.
In June, Georgia Tech announced the public phase of Transforming Tomorrow, a more than $2 billion comprehensive campaign that will conclude in 2027 and is designed to secure the resources that will advance the Institute and its impact — on people’s lives, on the way we work together to create innovative solutions, and on our world — for decades to come. It will build a foundation to positively affect the
lives
of our students, advance innovative
ideas , expand opportunities for
learning , and empower
our community and our world .
The involvement and support of the Georgia Tech community will allow the Institute to shape the future for the better. Next up, Tech will take the campaign message on the road to alumni and friends through a series of regional, national, and international events. Learn more about our goals at
