This fall Georgia Tech rolled out a new Learning Assistant Program within Tutoring and Academic Support, a division of the Office of Undergraduate Education. Learning Assistants (LAs) are students who can help facilitate small group collaboration inside the classroom by working alongside faculty during breakout activities. They promote one-on-one and small group discussions to boost comprehension and problem-solving skills during class.
They meet weekly with course instructor to discuss upcoming assignments, activities, labs, and common student difficulties. They also take a 1-credit pedagogy course on interactive educational techniques (CETL 2001) during their first semester as an LA.
Learning Assistants are a hybrid of a PLUS Leader and a Teaching Assistant (TA). They are used more flexibly and may facilitate small group interaction inside the classroom, hold weekly office hours, and assist with grading. LAs also help lower the teacher to student ratio. LAs are not to replace TA duties.
This fall, the LA Program is supporting 10 faculty members in nine courses, with plans to expand in Spring 2022.
Faculty interested in requesting LA Program support for spring semester may
apply here . A faculty information session
will be held virtually
on BlueJeans, Friday, Oct. 29, from 10 to 11 a.m.
Students interested in becoming a Learning Assistant may
