MasterCard, the global payments network, has taken an ownership stake in First Performance Global, a technology startup at the Advanced Technology Development Center (ATDC). Terms of the agreement were not disclosed, but it further expands First Performance’s global extension of a license for MasterCard’s proprietary MasterCard In Control technology. As a result, the two companies will collaborate on growing First Performance’s ability to offer payment card issuers and processors self-service tools for cardholders. First Performance’s technology gives consumers more control with the security surrounding their credit, debit, and other payment cards. Cardholders can define whether or not a card may be used at an ATM, online, via mail order or telephone order, in a bricks and mortar store, or even a specific geographic location, for example. Corporate comptrollers can limit how much and where employees use their company credit cards. “The way people shop and pay is continually changing through new technologies,” said Geoff Iddison, executive vice president, strategic partnerships, MasterCard. “Solutions like these complement platforms like MasterPass and EMV in delivering cardholders both a better shopping experience and peace of mind in the protection of their accounts.” Since 2014, First Performance has used the MasterCard license to design and develop its platform, providing cardholders the ability to personally make decisions about when to “turn on” and “turn off” their credit and debit cards. It also allows them to activate loyalty programs and control where and how their cards can be used through a simple, easy-to-use GogoNogo mobile app. “We have enjoyed a great relationship with MasterCard,” said A. Wayne Johnson, First Performance’s CEO and executive managing director. “The expansion of our intellectual property relationship on a global basis is an exciting opportunity for our company.” First Performance joined ATDC’s highly competitive Select program in 2015.
