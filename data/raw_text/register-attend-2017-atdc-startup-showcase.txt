The Advanced Technology Development Center (ATDC), Georgia’s technology incubator, will present more than 60 of the state’s most innovative and market-disrupting technology companies at the 2017 ATDC Startup Showcase.
The annual event, which attracts nearly 1,000 attendees, is scheduled for May 11 at the Georgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center from 1:30 p.m. to 5:30 p.m. ( REGISTER HERE .)
Showcase is designed to give technology innovators, investors, corporate partners, entrepreneurs, university researchers and students an in-depth, first-hand look at Georgia’s most successful emerging technology companies.
The event, which takes place during Atlanta Startup Week, also celebrates ATDC’s 37-year legacy of helping entrepreneurs learn, launch, scale and succeed in the formation of successful Georgia technology startups. Worldpay US — the global payments technology and services company, and creator of ATDC’s FinTech program — is the Showcase’s premier sponsor.
“Showcase is always an exciting time for us because attendees get to see the dynamic visions of our entrepreneurs from across Georgia,” said Jennifer Bonnett, ATDC’s general manager.
“Our presenting companies have created products — from tools to combat fraud to disease management to clean energy — that solve problems, create meaningful impact in a host of industries and strengthen the Georgia economy.
“What’s more, these companies also exist thanks to the financial support of the state of Georgia, which funds ATDC,” she said.
Startups at ATDC also receive direct support from some of incubator’s partners, such as the Georgia Research Alliance, which provides seed investments. The startup companies also receive direct funding grants from a number of federal sponsors, including the National Science Foundation, Department of Energy, Department of Defense and National Institutes of Health, among others.
Each year, those companies that meet the rigorous growth milestones are selected to graduate from the top-tier ATDC Signature program. Two of those companies have already been acquired.
The 2017 graduating companies are:
First Performance Global:
Provides a market leading card management and customer engagement platform for card issuers worldwide.
Partpic (Acquired):
Its proprietary solution simplifies the search and purchase of replacement parts using visual recognition technology.
StarMobile (Acquired):
