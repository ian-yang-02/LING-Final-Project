Jan 19, 2024
Shantay N. Bolton, executive vice president for Administration and Finance (A&F) and chief business officer, recently announced leadership and organizational changes in A&F to better support the operational and compliance needs of the Institute.
“During this time of exponential growth at Georgia Tech, it is clear that we need to keep a laser focus on supporting the growing operational needs of the Institute as well as the regulatory compliance matters which we must uphold,” said Bolton. “In aligning our expertise to better support the Institute’s academic and research mission, we are able to provide excellence to the entire campus community without exception.”
Effective Feb. 1, Jim Fortner, vice president for Finance and Planning (F&P) and interim chief financial officer, will assume the role of vice president and deputy chief business officer and continue to report directly to Bolton. In this capacity, Fortner will advance how A&F delivers on the operational needs of a growing campus. During this transitional period, Fortner will continue to lead F&P until the next leader is selected.
“I am honored to serve in this role in A&F to support the Institute’s business needs,” said Fortner. “A&F has a depth and breadth of experienced and committed talent, and I look forward to working across the division to build upon on our successes and continue to improve how we support the campus today and in the future.”
In addition, Jarmon DeSadier, senior director of Employee Relations for Georgia Tech Human Resources, will begin his role on Feb. 1 as interim vice president for the Office of Equal Opportunity, Compliance, and Conflict Management and report to Bolton. In alignment with Georgia Tech’s recently announced new approach to diversity, equity, and inclusion, this newly created unit will be responsible for
overseeing and implementing policies, programs, and initiatives related to equal opportunity, compliance with applicable laws and regulations, and effective conflict management within the Institute.
"As I step into the role of interim vice president for this emerging unit at Georgia Tech, I am energized by Georgia Tech’s continued commitment to promoting equal opportunities for all individuals, regardless of race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, age, disability, or any other characteristic.” said DeSadier. “We will aim to be a trusted resource for information, guidance, and support, fostering an environment where individuals can thrive and contribute their best.”
Details about the searches for these permanent leadership roles will be announced in the coming weeks.
