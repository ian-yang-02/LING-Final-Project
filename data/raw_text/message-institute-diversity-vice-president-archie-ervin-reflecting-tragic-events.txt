After reflecting on the tragic events across the nation this week, I wanted to offer heartfelt sympathy to the families of Alton Sterling, Philando Castile, Lorne Ahrens, Michael Krol, Michael Smith, Brent Thompson, and Patrick Zamarripa, and the communities of Baton Rouge, Dallas, and Falcon Heights, Minn. Although these events did not occur in Georgia, they have deeply affected many members of the Georgia Tech community. In the wake of this national tragedy, I would like to reaffirm that Georgia Tech is committed to advancing a culture of inclusive excellence and celebrating diversity in all its forms. Atlanta, a uniquely open and international city, is the birthplace of Martin Luther King, Jr. MLK once observed, “Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.” At Georgia Tech, we condemn injustice and discrimination; embracing different perspectives is critical to the success of our campus community. As we process these feelings of grief, anger, and confusion, it is my hope that we can reflect and heal as a global community, standing together in love, compassion, and justice for all.  With sympathy, Archie W. Ervin Vice President of Institute Diversity, Georgia Institute of Technology President, National Association of Diversity Officers in Higher Education (NADOHE)
