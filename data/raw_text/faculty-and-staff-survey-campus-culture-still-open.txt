As a continuation of Georgia Tech’s focus on
Living Our Values Every Day (L.O.V.E. GT) , the Institute is soliciting feedback on how well we are demonstrating the behaviors and practices set forth by our stated
values . Survey input from faculty and staff will help identify the areas within our culture where we are succeeding as well as where there are opportunities for improvement. Students will be surveyed in mid-January.
The survey will take no more than 10 – 15 minutes, and all responses will remain anonymous. It will be accessible until the close of business on Friday, December 24.
Take the survey .
