Although Covid-19 shifted the look and feel of the fall semester, Georgia Tech’s Fall 2020 enrollment increased to nearly 40,000 students.
Overall enrollment grew to 39,772, a 9% increase over the previous year. Graduate students accounted for most of the increase, with the bulk of those new students enrolled in online master’s degree programs.
Tech’s total graduate enrollment is 23,210, a 14% increase over last year. Of those, 15,664 students are enrolled in online master’s programs: 10,580 in computer science; 4,252 in analytics; and 832 in cybersecurity.
"Georgia Tech's online master's programs in computer science, analytics, and cybersecurity offer our students affordable and accessible options for earning degrees that otherwise might not have been available to them," said Bonnie Ferri, vice provost of Graduate Education and Faculty Development. "These programs continue to grow because they offer high-quality degrees that help students achieve their goals — even in the midst of a pandemic.”
Undergraduate enrollment also climbed slightly to 16,562 students. The Fall 2020 class includes 10,322 undergraduate students from Georgia, which is more than 60% of the undergraduate population. Tech continued to see overall increases in Hispanic or Latino (10.7%), Black (8.4%), and female students (10%). In fact, the first-year class included a record number of Black students — 10% more than 2019.
This year, Georgia Tech also enrolled an Institute record 1,150 new transfer students, 200 more than last year’s fall class. Transfer students hailed from 213 different colleges, including 39 Georgia colleges and 43 community colleges. Through newly created transfer pathway programs ( admission.gatech.edu/transfer/transfer-pathway-programs ), Tech continues to enroll significantly more first-generation students and students from underrepresented backgrounds.
Tech’s fall semester enrollment increase comes at a time when college enrollment across the nation is declining, amid uncertainty during a major health pandemic.
“Despite the numerous challenges Covid-19 has presented, Tech remains incredibly healthy from an enrollment standpoint,” said Rick Clark, director of Undergraduate Admission. “This speaks to the strength of our distinct brand, the long-term value of a Georgia Tech degree, and the immeasurable resilience of our students. At a precarious time for some colleges and universities, Tech continues to thrive in its role as a critical public good for our city, state, and nation.”
