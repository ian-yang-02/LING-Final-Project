We have good news to share in that our footprint is finally beginning to shrink, and hopefully we are less of an inconvenience to you all as detours around the site should all but be eliminated. The northern end of the project site will formally be handed back to Georgia Tech in June.
Arts Plaza and Landscaping Connecting to Tech Green:
*Sidewalk and stairs from the Ferst Center Arts Plaza to Einstein Statue is complete. Fencing will be modified to provide a full pedestrian accessible pathway from Ferst Center to Tech Green -  anticipated by June 4.
Phase II Building Construction:
*Construction fencing is installed around perimeter of the site.  Wayfinding signage is installed. Please see attached logistics plan.
* Exterior and interior construction activities are underway at both the Wenn building and new Stamps Commons
