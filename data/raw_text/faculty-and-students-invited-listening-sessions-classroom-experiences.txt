Beginning February 22, Georgia Tech faculty, graduate teaching assistants (GTA), and students will have the opportunity to participate in a series of listening sessions focusing on their classroom experiences this semester.
The one-hour sessions, hosted by the Academic Restart Task Force, will help inform continuous improvement efforts for spring and will be shared with campus administrators and the Institute Restart Task Forces.
The goal of the series is to provide insight into perceptions of instructional effectiveness, student engagement, the usefulness of technology, and consistency/clarity of communication and expectations. Sessions for faculty will focus on a specific course mode (i.e., hybrid, remote, residential). In all other sessions, participants will discuss topics more broadly, with the format tailored to address questions across all mode types.
Listening sessions will be limited to 15 participants per session to allow everyone's voice to be heard. The schedule of the listening sessions is listed below:
