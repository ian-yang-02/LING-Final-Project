The parade to celebrate the Atlanta Braves winning the World Series is expected to bring thousands of people to downtown and midtown Atlanta on Friday.
The parade begins in Five Points
at Marietta and Peachtree Streets at noon. Parade watchers are expected to line the route along Peachtree to its Atlanta endpoint at 10th Street. From there, the team will head north on the interstate to continue the festivities in Cobb County.
With so many people being in close proximity to campus, the impact on traffic will be significant before, during, and after the lunch hour. Please plan accordingly.
And, congratulations, Braves!
