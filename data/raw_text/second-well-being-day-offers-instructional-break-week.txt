Second Well-being Day Offers Instructional Break This Week
This week, a second well-being day will take place to give students and faculty a break from instruction.
Mar 21, 2021
— Atlanta, GA
This week, a second well-being day will take place to give students and faculty a break from instruction. Though rain inhibited some events from happening on the first well-being day last week, this week holds a second opportunity to rest, recharge, and relax.
Most events are open to all students, faculty, and staff, who are encouraged to get tested through the
campus Covid-19 testing program
before and after they participate in events.
Instructors have been asked to not schedule assignments during or immediately following these wellness days to give students a chance to recharge. And, staff are also being encouraged to prioritize wellness on these days, whether that’s by incorporating exercise into their day or clearing nonessential meetings to allow for more focused mental activity.
Human Resources offers more suggestions for prioritizing well-being .
