If you're like a majority of web users, it's easy to skim or skip the Terms of Service (ToS) agreement. How do we know what we're reading, much less agreeing to? In an attempt to understand the personal effects of Terms of Service (ToS), Amy Bruckman and Ph.D. candidate, Casey Fiesler, from the College of Computing, surveyed ToS on popular websites like Facebook, LinkedIn and others. It turns out, you may be giving away more than you think.  This infographic, created by the
GVU Center at Georgia Tech , will help you understand the full reserach (found
here ) on what you're giving away to online services. To find out more about this research, visit the
2014 CHI Conference
website.
