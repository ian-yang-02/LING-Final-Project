In the high-octane world of motorsports, where speed is king and precision is paramount, individuals like Harbir Dass stand out not only for their skills on the track but also for their dedication to engineering excellence. As a first-year Georgia Tech
mechanical engineering
student with an automotive concentration, Dass’ journey intertwines his passion for racing with his pursuit of engineering.
From a young age, Dass has shown a fascination with creating and designing machines that move. He fondly recalls how in the 8th grade he saved all his money and invested in a Lincoln Electric welder so that he could build his own go-kart. That experience ignited a passion that propelled him toward mechanical engineering.
“I discovered go-kart racing in 8th grade and knew that I had found my type of sport,” Dass said.
Balancing the demands of academia with the rigors of racing is no easy feat. Dass’ schedule is a whirlwind of long racing weekends, with classes sometimes taking a back seat to his passion for motorsports. Despite the challenges, he strives to excel both on the track and in the classroom, juggling coursework with race preparations and commitments.
Dass’ dedication to the sport recently earned him the
2024 Parella Motorsports Holdings Powering Diversity Scholarship
for the Ligier JS Formula 4 series.
In a sport as competitive as racing, recognition of his diverse background was both validating and inspiring.
“I appreciate being recognized as an individual with a diverse background and hope that my presence in motorsports can inspire others to participate in this exciting sport,” Dass explained.
Beyond racing and engineering, Dass enjoys working on his project cars and playing on his electric guitar. These passions serve as outlets for creativity and relaxation,
helping him recharge.
With each lap around the track and every project in the workshop, he embodies the spirit of innovation and the relentless pursuit of excellence. As he continues to carve his path in the world of motorsports, one thing remains certain: Harbir Dass is a force to be reckoned with, both on and off the track.
