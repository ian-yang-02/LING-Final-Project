A virtual workshop on the importance of psychological safety will be held for formal and informal leaders at Georgia Tech on Thursday, March 2, from 9 to 11 a.m. Psychological safety is the understanding that one won’t be punished or retaliated against for speaking up about ideas, questions, concerns, or mistakes, and that a team is a safe place for interpersonal risk taking.
The workshop will be facilitated by Sonia Alvarez-Robinson, assistant vice president for Strategy and Organizational Effectiveness, and co-facilitator Kendra Lewis-Strickland, associate strategy consultant in Georgia Tech's Strategic Consulting office.
“Participants will learn practical strategies they can utilize at work to enhance psychological safety, overall well-being, and team cultures,” said Alvarez-Robinson. The session will include role-playing scenarios to practice applying strategies to potential challenges.
The workshop is part of
Living Our Values Every Day (L.O.V.E. GT) , a campaign to enable the Tech community to bring
nine strategic values
to life in tangible ways that help meet the objectives set forth in the
strategic plan .
The workshop is open to formal and informal leaders among faculty and staff. To participate,
