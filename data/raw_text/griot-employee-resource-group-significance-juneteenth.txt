On June 19, 1865 — more than two years after the Emancipation Proclamation — Union General Gordon Granger issued General Order No. 3, which communicated news of the executive order to Texas and freed the remaining enslaved people in the state. This date became known as Juneteenth.
Each year on Juneteenth, African American, Black, and Indigenous communities hold commemorations to honor those who suffered and survived the bonds of enslavement. It also serves as a reminder of the contributions of these communities to the nation.
Forty-seven of the 50 states, including Georgia, and the District of Columbia observe Juneteenth as a holiday. On June 15, 2021, in a unanimous vote, the U.S. Senate passed a bill recognizing Juneteenth as a federal holiday. On June 17, President Joe Biden signed it into law.
As Juneteenth 2021 approaches, Georgia Tech’s GRIOT employee resource group continues to spearhead support for faculty and staff of African heritage and people of all walks of life. Learn more about GRIOT
