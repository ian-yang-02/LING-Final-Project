— Atlanta, GA
Greg Huey has been selected as the next chair of the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences, within the College of Sciences. Huey has been a part of the Tech community since 1999, where he’s been heavily involved in research in the field of atmospheric and analytical chemistry. With work ranging from Antarctic snow to Arctic halogen and mercury, from the role of aerosols in urban atmospheres to burning plumes over California, Huey has certainly chiseled out his own space in Earth and Atmospheric Sciences (EAS). “I am very excited to be named the chair of
Earth and Atmospheric Sciences ,” shared Huey. “I think we have an outstanding faculty with an excellent and rapidly expanding record of research accomplishments. My primary goal is to retain and continue the development of our young and mid-career faculty. I think that EAS has the potential to truly be one of the best departments of its kind, if we continue on our present trajectory.” “I’m delighted to welcome Greg to the college leadership team,” said Paul Goldbart, dean of the
College of Sciences . “My colleagues and I in the college are excited to be partnering with him as he works to enhance the school’s research activities, strengthen and grow the undergraduate and graduate programs, and develop the school’s future leadership.” Huey will succeed Judith Curry as Chair starting July 1, 2014. “Judy has been an extraordinary leader at Georgia Tech,” said Goldbart. “Under her guidance the school has grown, flourished and moved into important new directions.”   Written by: Drake Lee-Paterson
