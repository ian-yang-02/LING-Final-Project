Many biology lab courses have adopted more innovative teaching techniques and are shifting away from older teaching tools, including specimens preserved in liquid, prepared microscope slides, animal skulls, and anatomical models. As a result, collections of vintage equipment like the one in the Biological Sciences Prep Lab, located in the Clough Undergraduate Learning Commons, are increasingly rare.
