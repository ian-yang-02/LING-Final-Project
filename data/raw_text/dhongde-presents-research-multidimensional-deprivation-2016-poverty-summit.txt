Shatakshee Dhongde, an assistant professor in the Ivan Allen College School of Economics, presented at the second annual Poverty Summit on September 21 and 22, 2016.
The Poverty Summit is a two-day conference held each year in Atlanta that is a collaboration between seven major Metro Atlanta organizations, including Georgia Tech. It is intended to spark a deeper awareness of poverty and to create long-lasting solutions for the poor in our communities.
Dhongde presented her research on multi-dimensional deprivation in the United States during the Great Recession. According to her analysis, about 15 percent of the population experiences multidimensional deprivation, exceeding the prevalence of official income poverty. Some of the dimensions in which Americans were most deprived included lack of education, severe housing burdens, and lack of health insurance.
Additional findings from Dhongde’s analysis can be found in her recently published article in the Social Indicators Research journal.
