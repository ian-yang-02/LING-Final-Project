Georgia Tech will host its second annual  Data Days
conference Oct. 23 – 25. It will include three days of in-person and virtual workshops and sessions, keynotes from industry leaders, interactive poster sessions that showcase the power of data, and live demonstrations that bring the power of data to life.
This year’s conference is all about empowerment and how Georgia Tech students, faculty, researchers, and staff can leverage available tools and knowledge to harness the power of data effectively. Led by experts in data management at Georgia Tech and partnering institutions within the University System of Georgia, sessions will explore how participants can use data to inform decision-making, enhance efficiency, and promote a culture of continuous learning and improvement.
“We are excited to host Data Days for a second year,” said Daren Hubbard, vice president for Information Technology and chief information officer as well as the executive sponsor for Data Days. “This year’s theme, Empowering You, centers around increasing access to tools and education for the data community.”
Introduced in 2022, Data Days was coordinated to bring together voices from across the Institute to discuss best practices in the management, protection, and value of data. The goal of the event is to build and strengthen community of practice around data services offered at Georgia Tech.
Data Days attendance is free and open to the Georgia Tech community. To view a full schedule of events and register to attend, visit
