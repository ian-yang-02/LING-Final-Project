Hold tight for a psychedelic trip to hyperbolic space, where the floor drops out from beneath your feet.
Math just met “warp drive” in a virtual reality headset to transport anyone who dons the visor to a reality twisted by hyperbolic geometry. The program was co-created by Sabetta Matsumoto, a physicist and applied mathematician at the Georgia Institute of Technology as a visual aid to researchers exploring geometries that deviate from the everyday norm.
Splashed in color, the virtual space’s graphics can seduce even the most math-phobic mind to roam, crawl or slither about. But mathematicians and physicists can make great use of it.
