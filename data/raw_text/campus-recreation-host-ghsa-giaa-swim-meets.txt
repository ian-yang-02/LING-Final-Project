Elite high school athletes from across the state will compete at the McAuley Aquatic Center this week as Georgia Tech hosts the Georgia High School Association (GHSA) Swim Meet Feb. 1–4, along with the Georgia Independent Athletic Association (GIAA) Swimming State Championships on Thursday, Feb. 2.
These are two of the largest swim meets held in Georgia annually. The events will attract an influx of visitors to campus, so expect congestion in the area surrounding the Campus Recreation Center, including increased traffic on Tech Parkway and Ferst Drive.
Participant dropoff will take place along Tech Parkway, resulting in intermittent traffic delays and closures for buses and northbound traffic during the following times on meet days: 7 – 9 a.m., noon – 1:30 p.m., 3:30 – 6:30 p.m., and 9 – 10:30 p.m.
Guests will park in the
Campus Recreation deck (W10) and Student Center parking deck (W2) .
Be advised that the morning hours will see the largest crowds due to the number of athletes competing in preliminary races. In addition, other areas of campus may be affected on meet days as guests visit retail and dining locations.
For more information about the events, to purchase tickets, or to watch live, visit the  GHSA Swimming website  or the  GIAA website .
