The O’Keefe Gym Roof Replacement Project will begin on 1/24 and run through the end of April. During the construction period please be aware of the following:
A stair tower will be erected in the Northwest corner of the golf cart parking/charging area (highlighted in blue).  2-3 carts will have to be relocated to the South side of the parking/charging area.
Scaffolding will be erected on the East side of the Gym (highlighted in red).  Pedestrian and cart travel in this area will be restricted during the construction period.
The contractor will erect a safety barricade at the Northwest corner of the Storeroom (highlighted in red).  Access will be provided for daily deliveries to the Storeroom.  A trash dumpster (highlighted in green) will be placed inside the fenced area.  Several I&S (formerly Facilities Management) reserved parking spaces within the barricade will need to be relocated during the construction period.
