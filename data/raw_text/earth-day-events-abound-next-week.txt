Every year, Earth Day is celebrated to raise awareness about the importance of protecting our environment. The Tech community will be celebrating Earth Day this year throughout the week of April 19 – 22. Virtual and in-person events and activities will be held for students, faculty, and staff, promoting actions, ideas, and practices that will drive positive change for the planet.
As part of the weeklong celebration, the Tech community was invited to submit designs that encapsulate this year’s theme, which echoes a central tenet of the new Institute strategic plan: Amplify Impact. Civil Engineering graduate Connor Booth won the contest with a design that features a hand with different ecosystems inside.
In-person events will require face coverings and social distancing, and some events will require time-ticket registration. Students are encouraged to complete a daily symptom check and participate in the Covid-19 testing program before participating in the events.
