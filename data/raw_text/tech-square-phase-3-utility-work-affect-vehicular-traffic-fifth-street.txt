Tech Square Phase 3 Utility Work to Affect Vehicular Traffic on Fifth Street
Both lanes of Fifth Street between West Peachtree Street and Spring Street will be closed to vehicular traffic to ensure safety as utility work continues on Tech Square Phase 3.
Apr 26, 2024
Utility work on Fifth Street is resuming Monday, April 29, and will necessitate the closure of both lanes to vehicular traffic between West Peachtree Street and Spring Street to help ensure the safety of motorists and construction crews as work continues on Tech Square Phase 3.
This closure is expected to last four to five weeks but will be paused Thursday, May 2, through Sunday, May 5, to accommodate heavy traffic anticipated during Tech’s Commencement ceremonies.
Details of the closure:
Fifth Street will be closed between West Peachtree Street and Spring Street Monday through Friday from 7 a.m. to 4 p.m. (Except Thursday, May 2, and Friday, May 3.) Detour signs will be in place to help navigate the change in traffic patterns. Outside of these days and times, metal plates will be in place to allow two-way vehicular traffic.
Sidewalks to the north and south of Fifth Street will remain open to pedestrians for the next four to five weeks. Sidewalk closures are likely in the future.
Bicyclists will be required to walk their bikes on the sidewalks during closure times.
Parallel parking on the south side of Fifth Street will be available outside of the construction hours (Monday through Friday, 7 a.m. to 4 p.m.).
Changes to Stinger transit services will be posted on the
Parking and Transportation website .
Please see the attached diagrams for pedestrian, bike, and traffic flow information.
