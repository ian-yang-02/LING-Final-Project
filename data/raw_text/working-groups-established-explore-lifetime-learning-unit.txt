The Georgia Institute of Technology is announcing its intention to launch a new academic unit dedicated to lifetime learning. The new unit will bring together three entities whose work underpins its mission and vision: Georgia Tech Professional Education (GTPE), the Center for Education Integrating Science, Mathematics, and Computing (CEISMC), and the Center for 21st Century Universities (C21U).
This launch means opportunities for new and expanded research, curricula, students, and professional support for educators at every stage “from K to grey.”
Establishing a new academic unit is a long process, and Tech is at the very beginning. Dean Nelson Baker and Dean Charles Isbell are leading the effort, which currently has three working groups:
Academic vision, research, faculty governance, and strategic planning
Business model and operations
Change management and communications
The Institute has engaged an external consultant, Accenture, to survey the existing state of the lifetime learning market and to provide guidance on possible benchmarks against peers and competitors inside and outside of higher education, market opportunities, and best practices of lifetime education ventures.
In the coming weeks, the working groups will ask members of the Georgia Tech community to contribute their knowledge and creative energy to the process. A series of listening sessions will be offered to members of CEISMC, C21U, and GTPE to provide input starting later this month. More information and a sign-up form will be provided to faculty and staff in those units in the next week. If you are outside of these units and wish to participate in the process, please fill out
this web form
and you will be contacted for events in the spring. The working groups will integrate insights from the community, the consultants, and from earlier working groups into a detailed proposal for the Board of Regents and the University System of Georgia. That proposal will be submitted in early spring next year.
The idea of a lifetime learning unit has been in development for some time. Georgia Tech’s Commission on Creating the Next in Education and its subsequent report led to the formation of an Institute Strategic Plan working group called “GTPE Next,” also chaired by Deans Baker and Isbell. That group made the recommendation to form the new unit.
