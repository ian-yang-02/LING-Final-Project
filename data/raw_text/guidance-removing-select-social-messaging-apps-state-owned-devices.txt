Georgia Governor Brian Kemp recently announced the prohibition of select social messaging apps on state-owned devices. Following that announcement, the University System of Georgia has provided its member institutions, including Georgia Tech, with guidance.

Limited exceptions apply. For full details, see the Office of Information Technology's
