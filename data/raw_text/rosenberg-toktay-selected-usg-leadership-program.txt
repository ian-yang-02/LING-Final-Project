“This is about supporting our own people within the university system,” USG Chancellor Sonny Perdue said. “Many times, the best talent is already among us. We want to give our people the best opportunity to experience this kind of professional development so they can reach their full potential.”
For more than a decade, the USG has hosted ELI for faculty and staff to develop new leaders within the university system and offer professional develop opportunities to help them advance their careers in Georgia.
