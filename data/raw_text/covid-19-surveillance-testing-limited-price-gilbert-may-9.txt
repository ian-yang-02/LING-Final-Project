Hours and locations for Covid-19 surveillance testing
are being reduced as Georgia Tech transitions into summer operations.
Effective Monday, May 9, testing will become limited to the Price Gilbert Library test site. The Price Gilbert location will continue to operate from Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday each week, limiting hours from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. and 2 to 4 p.m.
The decrease in hours and locations comes following a recent decline in surveillance testing numbers as well as past levels of participation on campus during summer semesters.
Travel testing will also be done entirely with campus tests, which are collected at 4 p.m. each day and processed the next day.
Vault kits will no longer be included.
We will continue to provide updates and additional information regarding Covid-19 testing at
