Georgia law requires that all Institute employees disclose business transactions — conducted by themselves or family members — with the state or any state agency.
Public officials and employees are required to disclose all business transactions occurring during the previous calendar year. Reports for 2023 transactions are due Jan. 31.
This requirement applies to transactions by the employee or any business in which the employee, spouse, or dependent has more than a 25% interest. There is an exception for transactions less than $250 where the total of all transactions does not exceed $9,000 in the calendar year.  If an employee has no business transactions to report, it is not necessary for that employee to file the State Business Transaction Disclosure Report.
D isclosure reports are being filed through the Georgia Government Transparency and Campaign Finance Commission’s legacy system, which is no longer accessible on their website. In order to file a report for 2023 business transactions, employees must contact Haley Barrett, director of Communications for the Georgia Government Transparency and Campaign Finance Commission, at
hbarrett@ethics.ga.gov
or 470.355.6003 for assistance in completing the filing process or to answer any questions you may have.
