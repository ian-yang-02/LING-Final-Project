The Advanced Technology Development Center (ATDC), the state of Georgia's technology incubator, is now accepting applications from high-growth technology startups for its 2018 Venture Showcase to Boston on September 12.
The application period is open now through 5 p.m. on July 13. Any Georgia-headquartered technology company raising a Series A round or higher in the next six months is eligible. The companies chosen to go to Boston will be notified July 20 after the selection committee has reviewed all applications.
Because Boston has a number of investors focused on medical and health innovation, this particular showcase will dedicate a segment of the program for companies exclusively from this sector.
All Georgia-based companies interested in being considered should fill out an application form via this

“We continue to build momentum of our previous Venture Showcases in Silicon Valley and New York," Maziar said, noting this is the first such trip to Boston. "Our three previous Venture Showcases resulted in over $25 million in actual investments and millions more in term sheets. Some companies from our April Showcase on the West Coast are still in negotiations for an investment.
“We are very excited about the success of our showcases in terms of venture deals done and in how many investors from these regions now come regularly to Georgia to meet technology companies" said ATDC Interim Director Jane McCracken. “This interest illustrates the caliber of companies in the state, and ATDC is proud to facilitate investor connections through these showcases as well as the direct introductions we provide to our portfolio companies.”
The initiative brings Georgia-based technology companies to the cities that have the most venture capital and is designed to facilitate targeted conversations and connections, she said.
The Venture Showcase is co-sponsored by Morris, Manning & Martin, Silicon Valley Bank, Venture Atlanta, the Metro Atlanta Chamber, Aprio and DLA Piper, which will host the event at its Boston offices.
