Commencement at McCamish Pavilion
Feb 19, 2024
Georgia Tech ’ s unprecedented growth in
student
enrollment
means more graduates — and more graduates attending Commencement.
This semester,
ceremonies will span three days in McCamish Pavilion in order to keep ceremony times consistent and provide a celebratory experience for all graduates.
Tickets will be
required
for all bachelor’s and master’s ceremonies, and each graduate will receive
four tickets.
Additional
tickets may be available at will call the day of the ceremony, depending on the number of students who RSVP to attend.
Tickets are not
required
to attend the Ph.D. ceremony.
Students must RSVP by March 15 to receive guest tickets.
RSVP for Commencement.
Students eligible to graduate this semester were notified at the end of January of the ceremony schedule below.
Graduates
are mixed
by college and degree level to have
approximately the
same
amount
of participants
at each ceremony. This
ensures
the shortest ceremony time for each
event.
All ceremonies will take place at McCamish Pavilion. Commencement moved back to McCamish Pavilion in Fall 2023 after a three-year,
pandemic- induced stint
at
Bobby Dodd Stadium.
Graduates will also have the chance to celebrate their accomplishments during
Grad
Fest Week , Feb. 26 – March 1, as well as at the
President’s Graduation Celebration
on Friday, May 3.
