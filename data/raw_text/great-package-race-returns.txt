— Atlanta, GA
This past holiday season, the Supply Chain and Logistics Institute at Georgia Tech held their annual contest to determine which leading carrier could first deliver a package to a hard-to-reach destination. John Bartholdi, a professor who leads the project, decided to test the system during the busy holiday season by sending packages to Santa Claus Village in Lapland, Finland.
