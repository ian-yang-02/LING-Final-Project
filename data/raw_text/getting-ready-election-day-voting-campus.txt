Election Day, Nov. 8, is just around the corner. Georgia Tech is here to support you as you navigate the voting process. Exercising the right to vote allows individuals the opportunity to engage with their local community, as well as the nation — each and every vote counts.
For Georgia voters, there are several ways to vote, including on Georgia Tech’s campus this week for those who are registered in Fulton County.
Here’s what you should know before you vote:
Voting on Campus

At Georgia polling locations, voters are required to bring a form of ID. Here are the types of accepted identification:
A Georgia driver's license.
A photo ID issued by a state or federal government agency.
A valid U.S. passport.
An employee ID card containing your photograph and issued by any branch, department, agency, or entity of the U.S. government, Georgia, or any county, municipality, board, authority, or other entity of Georgia.
A valid U.S. military ID card.
A valid tribal ID card.
If you do not have one of the above forms of ID, Georgia offers a free Voter Identification Card.

Policies and Campus Resources
Georgia Tech encourages full participation in the electoral process. Per
section 8.2.7.7
of the
USG’s general personnel policies , employees are encouraged to exercise their constitutional right to vote in all federal, state, and local elections. Per
section 4.1.3
of the
USG’s general Student Affairs policy , students are also encouraged to vote in all federal, state, and local elections. A student whose class schedule would otherwise prevent them from voting will be permitted an excused absence for the interval reasonably required for voting. For more information, visit
usg.edu .
In 2020, Georgia Tech’s Faculty Executive Board passed a motion brought forth by representatives from the Student Government Association (SGA) requesting that teaching faculty provide academic consideration for student voters on Election Day. Specifically, the SGA motion requested that, for Election Day, faculty move lectures to an asynchronous format; avoid scheduling in-class quizzes, tests, or assessments; and make lecture recordings available to students unable to attend class that day. The Faculty Executive Board passed the motion, clarifying that, although classes will still be in session, faculty members are strongly encouraged to consider making these modifications in order to give Georgia Tech students ample opportunity to participate in the election.
