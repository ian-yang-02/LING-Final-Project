Georgia Tech's campus will be buzzing with soccer fans this weekend. Two top professional teams from Mexico are bringing their rivalry to Atlanta on Sunday. Bobby Dodd Stadium will play host to CD Chivas de Guadalajara and Club América, in their Súper Clásico
series. This rivalry game has been happening since 1943 and is recognized as one of the premier international matchups. The fan bases for the two squads are among some of the largest in the world.
This event may lead to some congestion around campus, especially before and after the game. The opening kick is set for approximately 4:30 p.m. Expect road closures and heavy foot and vehicle traffic before and after the game.
