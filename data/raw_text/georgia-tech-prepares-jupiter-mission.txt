On July 4, 520 million miles from Atlanta, a spacecraft the size of a basketball court entered the orbit of Jupiter. Juno is now settling into a 20-month orbit of the largest planet in the solar system. The mission will tell us what Jupiter is made of. In turn, it will also reveal clues about the birth of the solar system. Georgia Tech Professor Paul Steffes is a member of the Juno Science Team. He and his students have “cooked up” more than 6,000 recipes on the roof of the Van Leer Building to simulate conditions on Jupiter. Now all they need is data from Juno. Learn more about the mission , which is inspired by Greek and Roman mythology.
