Money
cites Georgia Tech’s quality, affordability, and outcomes in awarding the Institute a 5-star rating.
This year, the personal finance brand and website, formerly a monthly publication, revamped its college ranking system into a
star-tier list , naming Georgia Tech one of 34 institutions nationwide to its new 5-star category. Instead of ranking institutions from highest performing to lowest,
Money
gave colleges and universities a rating between 2 1/2 and 5 stars.
Money
praised the Institute , saying, “Georgia Tech gets results: The school has a graduation rate of 89%, and students go on to earn median salaries of around $96,000 a decade after enrolling, according to the federal College Scorecard.”
To compile the ratings,
Money
evaluated 736 institutions on 26 factors that span three categories: quality, affordability, and outcomes. The new approach is intended to offer a better window into the variety and diversity of high-value colleges and universities across the country.
The rating is a continuation of Georgia Tech’s reputation for being a good return on investment. Last month, The Princeton Review ranked Tech as the No. 1 best value public university in the country. In its
“Best Value Colleges for 2023”
report, the educational services company ranked a total of 209 schools, 74 of which were public institutions.
