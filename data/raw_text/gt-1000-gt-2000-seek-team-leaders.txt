The
GT 1000 and GT 2000 Program
— which organizes seminars for first-year and transfer students — is recruiting
Team Leaders (TLs)
for the upcoming summer and fall semesters.
GT 1000 and GT 2000 introduce new students to campus and support their successful transition to college. The courses meet one hour a week and are taught by faculty and staff volunteers. Tech students who are interested in mentoring and working with these newly accepted Yellow Jackets are encouraged to apply to be a Team Leader. TLs are volunteers, receiving neither pay nor academic credit, but are able to give back to the campus community and have a rewarding experience working with incoming students.
Team Leaders work closely with instructors and serve as an additional contact for first-year and transfer students, offering support to those who may feel overwhelmed by the transition.
“As mentors and leaders on campus, TLs have a rewarding impact on incoming students by helping them adjust to life at Georgia Tech and pursue their path of success here,” said Lacy Hodges, assistant director for Academic Transition Programs. “GT1000/GT2000 could not exist without team leaders. They are an integral part of the program.”
Students value what Team Leaders have to say because the message is peer to peer.
“We can advise students who are struggling to go to tutoring or go to the Counseling Center. It’s easy for them to say that we — as faculty and staff — don’t know what it’s like to be a student. But the TL can say, ‘Yes, I do know,’” Hodges said.
All students are eligible to apply, even if they have not taken GT 1000 or GT 2000. To learn more, attend an information sessino on
Monday, Nov. 29, from 7 – 8 p.m. via Blue Jeans .  RSVP to attend .
