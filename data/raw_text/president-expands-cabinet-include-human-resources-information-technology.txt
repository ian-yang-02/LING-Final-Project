“Our people, our culture, and the information tools at our disposal are critical to our future, and it is, therefore, important to give senior leaders of Human Resources and Information Technology representation on the president’s Cabinet,” said Georgia Tech President Ángel Cabrera. “We are already benefiting from the wealth of experience that Kim Harrington and Daren Hubbard bring, and look forward to working even more closely with them as part of Cabinet.”
Harrington has been at Georgia Tech since 2001, in various leadership roles, and
became associate vice president of Human Resources
in 2015.
Hubbard came to oversee
the Institute's Information Technology group in September.
Prior to this occasion, the last addition made to the Cabinet was in 2019 when the position of director of Athletics, occupied by Todd Stansbury,
was added .
