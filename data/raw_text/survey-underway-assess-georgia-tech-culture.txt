Feedback is sought from faculty and staff.
Apr 11, 2023
The
Living Our Values Every Day (L.O.V.E. GT)
initiative seeks to create a better organizational culture, centered around the behaviors, beliefs, assumptions, priorities and experiences of the campus community.  As a continuation of Georgia Tech’s focus on culture, the Institute is soliciting feedback on how well we are demonstrating the behaviors and practices set forth in our stated
values . The survey provides another opportunity for faculty and staff to share their experiences within the institutional culture and compare them to the 2022 results.
The survey will take no more than 10 to 15 minutes, and all responses will remain anonymous. The survey will be accessible until the close of business on Friday, April 28.
Take the survey .
