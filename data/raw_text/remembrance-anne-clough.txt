Georgia Tech's 10th president .
Dear Friends of Anne Clough:
I am saddened to inform you that my wife, best friend, and companion of 59 years, Anne Robinson Clough, passed away in her sleep on October 30th, 2021. The cause of death was cancer. She died in our home in Big Canoe, Georgia, a place she loved because of its beauty and embrace of nature.
Anne was a remarkable person. She filled her 79 years of life with love and joy. We both agreed that we were among the luckiest people in the world. Including me, her husband, she is survived by her son Matthew Clough and his wife Ann-Marie Clore, her daughter Eliza Clough Pritchett and her husband Blaine Pritchett, and four grandchildren, Madeline Clough, Bridget Clough, Jake Pritchett and Carter Pritchett.
According to her wishes, her body will be cremated. Later, there will be a celebration of life ceremony in Atlanta near the Georgia Tech campus. This will be announced when appropriate.
In lieu of flowers, gifts may be made to the Anne Robinson Clough Promise Scholarship Fund in care of the Georgia Tech Foundation, 760 Spring Street NW, Atlanta, GA 30308
