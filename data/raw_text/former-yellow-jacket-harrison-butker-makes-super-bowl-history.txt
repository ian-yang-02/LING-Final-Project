Former Yellow Jacket and Kansas City Chiefs kicker Harrison Butker etched his name in the NFL record book Sunday night, kicking a 57-yard field goal in Super Bowl 58 – the longest field goal in Super Bowl history.
Butker’s kick sailed through the uprights with just over five minutes remaining in the third quarter, breaking the previous record of 55 yards, set just one quarter earlier by San Francisco 49ers kicker Jake Moody. Before Sunday’s matchup at Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas, Steve Christie’s record of a 54-yard field goal for the Bills had stood since Super Bowl 28.
No stranger to setting records, Butker, now a three-time Super Bowl champion, is the all-time leading scorer in Georgia Tech history and finds himself in elite company on the NFL’s biggest stage. With four field goals and a pair of extra points Sunday, Butker has accounted for 37 points across his four Super Bowl appearances,
trailing only 49ers wide receiver Jerry Rice’s 48 .
With his game-tying kick, the industrial engineering graduate moved past Patriots kickers Adam Vinatieri and Stephen Gostkowski for the most career Super Bowl field goals with nine.
At 89%, Butker is the second all-time in field goal percentage in NFL history, behind Ravens kicker Justin Tucker.
