After being held at Bobby Dodd Stadium since Fall of 2020, Georgia Tech’s Commencement ceremony is moving back to McCamish Pavilion.
One result of steadily increasing enrollment is higher attendance at Commencement, leading to longer ceremonies in which all attending graduates are individually acknowledged. To avoid excessive event times, Tech will host four Commencement ceremonies this fall.
“Dividing the graduating class into four smaller ceremonies allows the event to fit inside McCamish Pavilion,” said Serena Wallace, director of Institute Events. “Previous Commencements also experienced unfavorable weather conditions. Having the ceremony indoors makes the weather less of a factor.”
The Ph.D. ceremony will be held Friday morning, Dec. 15. The Friday afternoon ceremony and the two Saturday ceremonies will be a mix of master’s and bachelor’s graduates. To ensure that each of the four ceremonies is approximately the same length, master's and bachelor's candidates are being paired together.

Bachelor’s and master’s graduates who RSVPed to the ceremony will receive five guest tickets each. No guest tickets are required for the Ph.D. ceremony. No tickets are required to attend the President’s Graduation Celebration, taking place Friday, Dec. 15, or the livestream watch party in O’Keefe Gym during each of the ceremonies. All ceremonies will be livestreamed on the Georgia Tech YouTube page.
