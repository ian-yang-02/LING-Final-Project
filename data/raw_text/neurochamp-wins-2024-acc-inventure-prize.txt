T hree Georgia Tech students who created a pediatric medical device won $15,000 Wednesday night during the
2024 A CC InVenture Prize , an annual undergraduate entrepreneurship competition.
Biomedical
engineering
student
Caitlin van Zyl,
her sister and mechanical engineering
major
Jacqui van Zyl — both Stamps President's Scholars — and Meg Weaver , a biomedical engineering major,
took first place with their invention,
NeuroChamp . The wearable, concealed headband is used to continuously
monitor
pediatric seizures. Half a million
childre n nationwide suffer from epilepsy, and many children experience daily, frequent seizures that cannot be detected by their parents, their teachers, or even themselves.
NeuroChamp
sets itself apart from existing
monitoring
devices because of its concealed design.
Watch their pitch for the competition .
The team was inspired to create the device partly from personal experience.
A child in
Jacqui van Zyl ’s hometown
experienced the “silent seizures” that
NeuroChamp
can help
monitor .
The
team
is
already working with physicians at Emory University and Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta to launch a pilot study of the
medical
device. Their ACC InVenture Prize winnings will help fund continued testing.
Teams from 14 universities competed in this year’s event, which was held at Florida State University.
