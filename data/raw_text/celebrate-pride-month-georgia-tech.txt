Celebrate Pride Month at Georgia Tech
Mark these dates on your calendar and join the LGBTQIA Resource Center in celebrating Pride Month at Tech.
Jun 05, 2023
Each June, through the LGBTQIA Resource Center and campus partners, Georgia Tech celebrates Pride Month. Originating as an annual commemoration of the 1969 Stonewall Uprising, today Pride Month serves as a reminder of the strength and resilience of the LGBTQIA community. Tegra Myanna, director of the LGBTQIA Resource Center, says it’s “an important celebration of community while serving as an opportunity for allies to reconnect to education and advocacy efforts to further LGBTQIA inclusion.”
Throughout the month, the Georgia Tech community is invited to engage in both in-person and online programs. To see a complete listing of events, and to learn more about Pride Month, visit
