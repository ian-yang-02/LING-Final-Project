Corals are foundational for ocean life. Known as the rainforests of the sea, they create habitats for 25% of all marine organisms, despite only covering less than 1% of the ocean’s area.
Coral patches the width and height of basketball arenas used to be common throughout the world’s oceans. But due to numerous human-generated stresses and coral disease, which is known to be associated with ocean sediments, most of the world’s coral is gone.
“It’s like if all the pine trees in Georgia disappeared over a period of 30 to 40 years,” said  Mark Hay , Regents’ Chair and the Harry and Anna Teasley Chair in Environmental Biology in the  School of Biological Sciences  at the Georgia Institute of Technology. “Just imagine how that affects biodiversity and ecosystems of the ocean.”
In first-of-its-kind research, Hay, along with research scientist  Cody Clements , discovered a crucial missing element that plays a profound role in keeping coral healthy — an animal of overlooked importance known as a sea cucumber.
