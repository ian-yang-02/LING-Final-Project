Leaders from around campus came together Wednesday to address graduate student questions about research, the spring academic calendar, student well-being, and more. The online Graduate Student Town Hall, moderated by James Black from the Office of Graduate Studies, began with welcome comments from Georgia Tech and graduate Student Government Association (SGA) leaders.
The town hall reminded graduate students of important dates for spring enrollment and planning, including when registration opens so students can begin planning for next semester. Marla Bruner, director of Graduate Studies, also mentioned extensions for financial support and other resources that were outlined in an email to graduate students Oct. 5. That information will also be posted to grad.gatech.edu.
Other presenters included Bonnie Ferri, vice provost for Graduate Education and Faculty Development; Steven W. McLaughlin, provost and executive vice president for Academic Affairs; Kyla Ross, assistant vice provost for Advocacy and Conflict Resolution; Lea Harris, president of graduate SGA; Tina Rousselot de Saint Céran, director of International Student and Scholar Services; Robert Butera, vice president for Research Development and Operations; Benjamin Holton, senior director of Health Services; and Nazia Zakir, assistant vice president of Environmental Health and Safety.
