George P. Burdell’s legacy lives on as a cherished Georgia Tech tradition. Now, the mythical student is making a mark all the way in South Sudan. The nonprofit Water for South Sudan, which aims to provide clean, safe water and improve hygiene and sanitation practices in areas of need, recently received a gift from an anonymous donor made in honor of George P. Burdell.
The donor described Burdell as “a living dream of all our lives we've yet to live.” When asked about what they would say to people thinking of giving to Water for South Sudan, the donor replied, “Remember a time in your life when someone moved a mountain for you — be it financial, social, relational, or educational — then envision what you could do in a similar fashion for another.”
Burdell’s name is now written in the cement of a well in South Sudan, which will provide clean water to hundreds of community members. With the words, “Atlanta GA #1” under Burdell’s name, it is a symbol of Tech’s far-reaching community as well as its commitment to solving problems and improving the human condition.
