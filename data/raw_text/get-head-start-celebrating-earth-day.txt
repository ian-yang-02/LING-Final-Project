Earth Day 2021 is Thursday, April 22, and there will be several events across campus throughout the week surrounding it. Some participants are already collecting items or have opened registration for those looking to get a head start on celebrating Earth Day.
Students, faculty, and staff are invited to donate new and gently used clothing at any of the campus area housing offices through Friday, April 9. These include the East and West Campus Housing Offices, Graduate Living Center, and North Avenue Housing Office. During the week of Earth Day, people can choose from the donated clothes during the
Clothing Swap , which will take place April 19 to 22. The Earth Day event will also include a
collection for hard to recycle materials .
The Student Government Association’s (SGA) sustainability committee is also hosting its annual Get Wasteless challenge, which will run from April 19 to 23. Members of the Georgia Tech community are invited to participate in a week of radically reducing their waste, or anything that can’t be recycled, composted, upcycled, or reused. Participants will collect their waste from the week in a gallon-sized plastic bag.
Participants can sign up for Get Wasteless either as individuals or as part of a team. Points can be earned by checking in virtually once a day, as well as participating in other sustainability-related activities. The top individuals and teams will win prizes.
