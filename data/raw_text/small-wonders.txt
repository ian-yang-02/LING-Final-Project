Georgia Tech scientists and engineers, in collaboration with Emory University, Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta, and Marcus Autism Center, are tackling one of the biggest challenges in pediatric medicine — the lack of medical devices and technologies designed specifically for children.
Many medical devices used on children were designed for adults. And because the market for children’s medical devices is small, many companies shy away from building medical technologies for children. Georgia Tech is helping to fill that gap in the market. From an app that allows parents to send pictures of their child’s potential ear infection to a doctor, to surgical tools tailored to a child’s physiology, the Institute is leading the push toward improving and saving children’s lives through technology.
