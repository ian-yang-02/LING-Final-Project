A new ranking of world universities places Georgia Tech 34th among 1,258 institutions evaluated on five criteria including teaching, research and the impact of publication citations. The 2019 Times Higher Education World University Rankings also lists Georgia Tech 21st among the 172 U.S. institutions it included.
According to the rankings, research was Georgia Tech’s strongest criteria, where it placed above 90 percent of other world institutions evaluated. Georgia Tech also ranked highly in teaching, citation impact, industry income and international outlook. In the 2018 rankings, Georgia Tech was placed 33rd overall.
The world’s top ten universities in the ranking are the University of Oxford, the University of Cambridge, Stanford University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, California Institute of Technology, Harvard University, Princeton University, Yale University, Imperial College London and the University of Chicago.
Overall, the rankings considered 13 metrics ranging from teaching reputation and research reputation to industry income and percentage of international students. To obtain the overall score, the ranking weighted statistics for teaching, research and citations equally at 30 percent each, with international outlook accounting for 7.5 percent of the total and industry income just 2.5 percent.
The rankings, released September 26, were based on information on more than 1,200 institutions, 67.9 million citations, 14.1 million publications and more than 20,000 academic survey responses. The World University Rankings, produced by the Times Higher Education based in London, are now in their 15th year.
