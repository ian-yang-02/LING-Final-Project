Fast Company magazine named the Georgia Institute of Technology to its annual “World’s Most Innovative Companies” list in the education sector.
“We are a top-ranked institution, but we are absolutely not the typical staid high-ranked educational institution,” said Georgia Tech Provost Rafael Bras, who holds sthe K. Harrison Brown Family Chair. “Just as we innovate in research, we do so in education. We take risks and explore new ideas — that’s what innovation is all about.”
Citing Georgia Tech’s Online Master of Science in Computer Science (OMSCS) degree, Fast Company ranked Georgia Tech number three, just behind Microsoft and Duolingo. Georgia Tech is the only university listed in the education sector.
“We’re honored to be included in this list for offering a high-quality, online graduate degree in computing available at a fraction of the typical cost, thus making higher education both more affordable and more accessible to a much wider audience,” said Zvi Galil, the John P. Imlay Jr. Dean of Computing and professor. “Georgia Tech’s motto is 'Progress and Service,' and the College of Computing simply followed those wise words in creating OMSCS.”
Georgia Tech announced in January it was launching a similar online master’s program in analytics in August.
