Karan Jani , a doctoral researcher at the Center for Relativistic Physics at Georgia Tech, was part of a global team of researchers who helped discover the existence of gravitational waves.
His primary research
focus is understanding the black holes in our universe and testing Albert Einstein’s General Theory of Relativity. Because of his contributions, he was named a recipient of the 2016 Special Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics awarded by Stephen Hawking. Jani was asked to meet with the prime minister of India to discuss the findings and the greater role of expanding science in India. He hails from a small town in India, and says he had never even seen a telescope until his first year of college, and now he has been part of one of the greatest scientific discoveries of the past century.  Jani also serves as vice president of the Graduate Student Government Association at Georgia Tech. http://www.forbes.com/profile/karan-jani/

Sean Warner
earned his degree in construction technology, but developed an idea as a senior at Georgia Tech that has grown into a full-fledged industry. With an idea to use an insect-based food source to close the loophole in agriculture, Warner launched Grubbly Farms. The company has developed a protein-rich food source for aquaculture, livestock animals and pets by collecting food waste from different organizations and feeding it to black soldier fly larvae. As the larvae eat through the food waste, they convert it into a quality fertilizer. Grubbly Farms then processes the larvae into proteins and fats that are manufactured into animal feeds.
Grubbly Farms – named one of the top 50 disruptive startups by Kairos Society – won the 2016 Sustainable Brands Innovation Open and has been featured in
The Guardian.

Patrick Pittaluga
– the business brains behind Grubbly Farms – drives the company’s marketing, business development and sales. He teamed up with his cousin, Sean Warner,
to launch the company after testing with black solider fly larvae in a laundry room.
“The flies have a nutritional profile similar to fish meal,” Pittaluga told
Forbes
magazine.
Grubbly Farms has been developing a commercial facility capable of turning five tons of food waste into 500 pounds of protein a day, and looking to expand that output. As a business administration student at Georgia Tech, Pittaluga founded two companies, Predator PC (a custom computer supplier) and Harbor Point (a luxury apparel company).

As an undergraduate at Tianjin University,
Lu Zhang
took part in Georgia Tech’s Atlanta Summer Program, a summer exchange experience that allows students to sample a variety of course offerings and get a glimpse of American history and culture. One of Zhang’s most memorable experiences during her summer exchange was the World of Coca-Cola just a few steps from Georgia Tech’s campus. She’s only been finished with her undergraduate degree for seven short years, but in that span, Zhang has launched and sold a medical device company and has since launched her own venture capital firm in Silicon Valley. http://www.forbes.com/profile/lu-zhang-1/
