As of this week, the omicron variant makes up the majority of new coronavirus cases in the U.S. Omicron is more contagious than previous variants and has caused a spike in cases across the nation, including locally.
The same prevention measures that have been put in place previously can still help slow the spread of this variant — vaccination, wearing a face covering, physical distancing, and regular surveillance testing. A well-fitting mask with good filtration is a strong defense for when you are out in public, even if you are fully vaccinated.
As the campus community looks toward winter break, Georgia Tech encourages all students, faculty, and staff to get fully vaccinated, including a booster shot.
Campus vaccination clinics
will resume in January; to find a vaccination site before that, visit
vaccines.gov . Vaccines help reduce the risk of severe illness and hospitalization.
Anyone with Covid-19 symptoms — even mild ones — should get tested and wait for a negative result before interacting with others. Testing on campus is closed through winter break and will resume Tuesday, Jan. 4, 2022. Until then, you can
find an alternate testing site .
We recommend all students, faculty, and staff plan to get tested off-campus before returning for the spring semester, and we recommend each person test again on campus upon their return. Campus testing sites will reopen at full capacity on Jan. 4th to accommodate those returning to campus.
