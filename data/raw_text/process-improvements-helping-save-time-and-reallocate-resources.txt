Process Improvements Helping to Save Time and Reallocate Resources
Positive changes in Finance and Planning improve the tools and processes used to support the charge for Administrative Excellence
Jun 15, 2023
Since the launch of
Georgia Tech ’s
s trategic
p lan ,
many positive changes
have occurred
across the Finance and Planning
(F&P)
landscape
and
have led to improvements to the
administrative
tools and
processes
used to support the charge for Administrative Excellence , or
AdminX .
“Departments within Finance and Planning have made a concerted and collective effort to streamline processes that
affe ct the entire Georgia Tech community,” said Jim Fortner, vice president for Finance and Planning and interim chief financial officer. “We are thrilled to see
the commitment to continuous improvement and the way
these departments have
worked to identify and address
these business needs .”
The Office of the Bursar was one of the
first
departments in F&P to adopt process
improvement s
in alignment with
t he
AdminX
initiative .
One recent example is the implementation of
the
Flywire Banner Kit
that
help s
international students
wire
funds
to
Georgia Tech .
This
automate d process of
posting funds to the student’s account
eliminates
the need for
manual
data
entr y
and
has shortened the
processing tim e
by two days
—
saving more than
800 hours
a year .
This
has enabled
staff
to focus
on other student payment support activities ,
including refunding credit balances on
student
accounts
within 24 hours .
Procurement and Business Services
(PBS)
has
also made
substantial changes .
Earlier this year,
in partnership with the Office of Information Technology (OIT),
they deployed Robotic Process Automation
for several processes, including one to help reduce the number of supplier invoices for which payment is held due to missing receipts . This ended up saving
more than
600
hours
per month , and those hours have
now
been
reallocated to
providing
ca m pus services and addressing more complex purchasing is sues .
Additionally, t he PBS team
updat ed the purchasing process by
identify ing
opportunities to
expand the types of items available for purchase
in
Amazon, Staples, and other
authorized
catalogs .
These
purchases
are typically low er -cost and
require fewe r approvals,
which makes
purchasing
easier and faster .
Also
i n partnership with
OIT ,
the
Office of
Institute Budget Planning and Admin istration
is planning to
deploy
Workday Adaptive Planning
in the fall .
Workday is a
reporting ,
forecasting ,
and analytics tool
that
will
enable the Institute to seamlessly compile data from multiple sources to inform business decisions and
further
support the Institute’s new budget model.
Looking ahead, the Georgia Tech community can expect to see continued improvements and innovations to the administrative processes
from F&P
in support of the
AdminX
initiative.
