Fall has officially arrived. With that, many are taking to the great outdoors — often by bike to make the most of the convenience, health benefits, and environmentally friendly aspects of this mode of transportation. Unfortunately, criminals want to make the most of bikes, too.
The Georgia Tech Police Department (GTPD) is currently investigating several thefts involving bicycles and scooters from the East and West Campus Residence Halls. In each of these thefts, officers are seeing the use of inferior equipment being used to secure bikes.
“Although we're operating in unfortunate circumstances, given the pandemic, criminals are still out and we have had several reports of stolen bicycles,” said Sergeant Jessica Howard. “We encourage students to lock bikes using a quality, durable U-lock, use the designated locations to lock your bike, and make sure you register your bike with us. That helps us identify the owner of a stolen bike when it is recovered.”
Bikes can be registered with the GTPD at
police.gatech.edu/crime-prevention/safety-tips/bicycle
— no matter the type. Those who register their bikes with GTPD also receive a free water bottle. Officers will be on campus in the coming weeks doing in-person registration on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 2 to 4 p.m. Find out where to find them by following GTPD on social media ( facebook.com/GaTechPD ,

Here are some additional tips to help prevent a criminal from taking your bike for a ride.
Avoid using lightweight cables or chains, or low-quality U-locks, as these can be cut with relative ease.
The lock should always go through the frame. If possible, attach bicycles to bike racks through the frame and both wheels. If both wheels cannot be attached, be sure to attach the frame and one wheel.
Do not attach the lock to parts of the bicycle that may be easily removed, such as the seat post or only the wheel.
Check the lock before departing to ensure it is secured.
If you have a quick release for the seat or front wheel, take these items with you.
Do not leave any free or easily detachable parts, such as headlights or bags, on the bike.
Avoid leaving bicycles locked outside overnight.
