Sloan Fellowships are among the most prestigious awards for early career faculty

Feb 21, 2024
Four researchers from the Georgia Institute of Technology —
Alex Blumenthal ,
Juan-Pablo Correa-Baena ,
Chunhui Du , and
Daniel Genkin
— have received
2024 Sloan Research Fellowships , one of the highest honors for early-career faculty.
They are among the 126 researchers chosen from more than 1,000 nominations this year.  Fellows receive $75,000 over two years to advance their research.
"Sloan Research Fellowships are extraordinarily competitive awards involving the nominations of the most inventive and impactful early-career scientists across the U.S. and Canada,” said Adam F. Falk, president of the
Alfred P. Sloan Foundation , which has awarded the fellowships since 1955.
Since then, 55 individuals from Georgia Tech have won fellowships, and it has become one of the most prestigious awards for young investigators and a predictor of future research success. For example, 57 Sloan Fellows have received a Nobel Prize and 71 have won the National Medal of Science.
Falk added, “We look forward to seeing how fellows take leading roles shaping the research agenda within their respective fields.”
