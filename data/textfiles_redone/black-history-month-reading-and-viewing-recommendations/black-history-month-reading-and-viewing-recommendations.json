We asked several faculty and staff members for reading and viewing recommendations that explore race, identity, history, and memory. The recommendations range from an analysis of 500 years of Black history to a memoir by acclaimed actress Viola Davis.\nKindred\nBy Octavia Butler, Doubleday & Company (1979). Television adaptation available on FX/Hulu.\n\u201cRemember Marty McFly\u2019s fading photograph, his future existence dependent on his parents\u2019 romance in Zemeckis\u2019s 1985\nBack to the Future?\nNow imagine a more terrifying parallel: A fierce Black heroine is mysteriously, repeatedly catapulted from her 1976 California home to an 1815 Maryland plantation, where, as a suddenly enslaved non-person, she must save her white ancestor to ensure her own future existence. Adapted as a 2017 graphic novel by Kevin Duffy and John Jennings, and now for FX/Hulu by playwright and showrunner Branden Jacobs-Jenkins, Octavia Butler\u2019s 1979\nKindred\nis an ever-relevant, masterful reminder\u00a0that a reckoning with history is always about our present, and that our future always depends on it.\u201d\n\u2014 Nihad Farooq , associate professor, School of Literature, Media, and Communication\nThe African Americans: Many Rivers to Cross\nBy Henry Louis Gates Jr. and Donald Yacovone, Smiley Books (2013)\n\u201cI remember watching the six-hour\ndocumentary series\non TV about 10 years ago, and it has stuck with me ever since. This book is the companion piece.\nIt provides a comprehensive analysis of 500 years of Black history, beginning with the journey of Black people before they were enslaved in Africa and brought to the U.S. and other countries. The book explains how Africans were thriving and that Black women were strong leaders both in their respective tribes in Africa and when they were enslaved in America. It also highlights the ingenuity, resilience, and creativity of enslaved people as they fought with every weapon they had for their freedom.\nThe book also talks about the critical role of white allies, who wanted freedom for the enslaved Africans as much as they did. Many suffered the same fate as disobedient enslaved Africans.\nI went back to watch the series after reading the book, which concludes with the election of the first Black president, Barack Obama. It was a totally new viewing experience because of what I learned and read. If you\u2019ve never seen the documentary, start with the book. Like me, you\u2019ll learn so much.\u201d\n\u2014 Raheem Beyah , dean and Southern Company Chair, College of Engineering\nFinding Me: A Memoir\nBy Viola Davis, HarperOne (2022)\n\u201cMost know Viola Davis is an actress and producer, notably from the award-winning television series\nHow to Get Away With Murder . Davis is the recipient of various accolades, including an Academy Award, a Primetime Emmy Award, and two Tony Awards; she is the sole African American to achieve the triple crown of acting. Her autobiography is an intriguing account of a life well lived, detailing her journey to shape herself into the woman we experience through her work today. She tells her story honestly and authentically. There are moments that everyone can relate to. This book is a fantastic read (and listen, as she narrates the audiobook version). Davis draws us in with her realness. I related to her frankness, which she set the stage with from the opening sentences.\nFinding Me\nis juicy, as she tells her intriguing life story. She holds nothing back. You can feel her passion on every page.\u201d\n\u2014 LaTrese Ferguson , director, Workplace Learning and Professional Development, Georgia Tech Professional Education \u2013 Academic Services\nNational Education Television (forerunner of PBS) hosts a live conversation with Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.\nand four other civil rights leaders before the historic March on Washington (1963). Available on\nYouTube .\n\u201cThis live television broadcast is a discussion focusing on the planned March on Washington, but much more is expounded on throughout the conversation. The discussion includes major issues concerning civil rights and equality, most of which are still an issue today. The content shows the progress that has not completely been reached. The question is why we are still fighting the battle for equality. Quite possibly the answer is best described in a comment by Martin Luther King Jr. during the program: \u2018Well, isn\u2019t it true we\u2019re grappling with a problem that constantly emerges in history that you have a few people who are crusaders in the right direction \u2026 and the vast majority are out there in the middle somewhere with a great deal of apathy and complacency?\u201d We owe it to these men, who put forth great effort to extinguish racial inequality, to be vigilant on our own toward the struggle for equality.\u201d\n\u2014 Valerie Edward , stationary engineer, Infrastructure and Sustainability\nHigh on the Hog: How African American Cuisine Transformed America\nDocuseries by Netflix, released in 2021. Available on Netflix.\n\u201cThis docuseries is full of rich insights about African American culture and history (thus American culture and history) \u2014 all through the lens of food. It follows Stephen Satterfield, a chef and writer, as he explores food traditions from African countries such as Benin to states such as the Carolinas, Virginia, and Texas in the U.S. Through powerful images, stories, and interviews, this four-episode series details a history of innovation, joy, resilience, and community.\u201d\n\u2014 Tiffany D. Johnson , assistant professor, Scheller College of Business\nDawn\n(Book 1 in the trilogy, Lilith\u2019s Brood)\nBy Octavia Butler, Warner Books (1987)\n\u201c Dawn\nis the strange, gorgeous invitation into Butler\u2019s speculative fiction masterwork,\nLilith\u2019s Brood . Lesser known than later novels like\nKindred ,\nDawn\nand the two books that follow it showcase Butler\u2019s genius for exposing the exquisite foibles of humankind. Race and the experience of Black womanhood is critical to the epic trilogy and the interplay of power, reproduction, and survival, but Lilith, the Black protagonist, and her choices are never reducible to a moral or agenda. In\nDawn , readers will find world-building and tropes that have shaped so much of contemporary dystopian fiction, but\nDawn\nis weirder and more beautiful\n\u2014\nin my accounting\n\u2014 \u00a0than any of its \u2018offspring.\u2019\u201d\n\u2014 Ruthie Yow , service learning and partnerships specialist, Center for Serve-Learn-Sustain\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nWhat to Read During Winter Break\nScheller College of Business: Celebrating Black History Month\n2023 Black History Month Lecture\nContact\nVictor Rogers\nInstitute Communications\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
