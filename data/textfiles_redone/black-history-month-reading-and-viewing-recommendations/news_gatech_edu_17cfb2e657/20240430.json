We asked several faculty and staff members for reading and viewing recommendations that explore race, identity, history, and memory. The recommendations range from the personal narrative of a daughter of the South to the story of a Pennsylvania community shared by Black and Jewish residents in the 1920s.\nSouth to America\nBy Imani Perry, Harper Collins (2022)\n\u201cPerry\u2019s presence as a preeminent scholar of African American studies at Princeton is well known, but\nSouth to America\nweaves a personal narrative of her lived experiences both past and present as a daughter of the South (Alabama). The book, a recipient of the National Book Award for nonfiction, recasts historical events state to state and juxtaposes the local culture, language, food, and even music with what we commonly associate as American.\u00a0I loved this book because Perry served as an expert tour guide reframing the way I viewed the South and Black folks\u2019 place in it. Her sharp prose is contemplative and had me reexamining my life experiences as a native northerner, southern transplant, and beneficiary of the groundwork my southern ancestors laid for me to resume advancing.\u201d\n\u2014Chris Burke, executive director, Community Relations\nThe 1619 Project\nHulu miniseries, released in 2023.\n\u201cThis is a miniseries presented by Nikole Hannah-Jones, the Knight Chair in Race and Journalism at Howard University and award-winning journalist who penned a book and the\nNew York Times Magazine\u2019s\nproject (both with the same name). The series is not only deeply informative, but it also offers a beautiful weaving of storytelling and images about the history of the United States. Each episode explores aspects of American culture and life through topics such as democracy, capitalism, music, and fear. Through Hannah-Jones\u2019 exquisite capacity to interview in humanizing and pointed ways, this six-episode series offers insight into how African Americans have contributed to American values and culture.\u201d\n\u2014Tiffany D. Johnson, associate professor, Organizational Behavior, Scheller College of Business\nA Thousand and One\nFeature film released in 2023, available on Prime Video.\n\u201cA.V. Rockwell\u2019s directorial feature-length debut is a defiant love song to a gentrifying Harlem in the Giuliani-Bloomberg decade.\nStrength and terror coexist in Teyana Taylor\u2019s Inez, a mother whose love for son Terry (exquisitely portrayed, chronologically, by Aaron Kingsley Adetola, Aven Courtney, and Josiah Cross) saves them both, buoyed by their villages of care. Taylor\u2019s talent as musician-choreographer-actor shines in this complex, teetering dance about parenting, loving, and living in a New York that may erect \u2018a thousand and one\u2019 roadblocks to building a home, but (in doubling as the family\u2019s address) reminds viewers that home endures, always, in who and how we love.\u201d\n\u2014Nihad Farooq, associate professor, School of Literature, Media, and Communication\nThe Heaven and Earth Grocery Store\nBy\nJames McBride, Penguin Random House (2023)\n\u201cMcBride won the National Book Award for this work for good reason\n\u2014\nand if you start with\nHeaven and Earth\nand let it lead to you to the rest of his jaw-dropping oeuvre then you\u2019ll be well rewarded. The story is set in the 1920s in a community in Pennsylvania shared, ambivalently, by Pottstown\u2019s Black and Jewish residents. The tale\n\u2014\nabout physical and intangible resources, illnesses of the body and the spirit, and homeplaces both real and imagined\n\u2014\nis rendered so carefully and delicately that by the time you are done, your attachment to Nate, Addie, Moshe, Chona, and especially their shared adoptive son, Dodo, is so deep that you simply reopen the novel and begin again.\u201d\n\u2014Ruthie Yow, associate director, Center for Sustainable Communities Research and Education, Brook Byers Institute for Sustainable Systems\nHidden Figures\nFeature film released in 2016, available on Hulu, Disney+, Prime Video, and Apple TV.\n\u201cThe film recounts the true story of Katherine G. Johnson, Dorothy Vaughn, and Mary Jackson \u2014 three brilliant Black mathematicians working at NASA during the space race in the early 1960s.\u00a0These American heroes had to fight segregation in an industry designed to silence them. Their resilience and endurance helped save the space program\u00a0 and\u00a0 the life of astronaut John Glenn.\u201d\n\u2014Joi Alexander, director, Wellness Empowerment Center, Student Engagement and Well-Being\nRelated links\n2023 Black History Month Reading and Viewing Recommendations\n2022 Black History Month Viewing Recommendations\nContact\nVictor Rogers\nInstitute Communications\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
