At bottom, the\u00a0close up table shows Pocillopora corals developing a pattern of death where one individual started dying and then others fell like dominos. This table was a \"monoculture.\" It contained only one species and not a group of species. Tables with groups of species did better than monoculture tables in the same reef area off of Fiji in the Pacific.

When Cody Clements snorkeled down for the first time to check on them, his eyes instantly told him what his data would later reveal.\n\u201cOne of the species had entire plots that got wiped out, and they were overgrown with algae,\u201d Clements said. \u201cRows of corals had tissue that was brown \u2013 that was dead tissue. Other tissue had turned white and was in the process of dying.\u201d\n36 ghastly plots\nClements, a postdoctoral researcher and the study\u2019s first author, also assembled groups of corals with a mixture of species, i.e. biodiverse groups, for comparison. In total, there were 36 single-species plots, or monocultures. Twelve additional plots contained polycultures that mixed three species. (More details below.)\nBy the end of the 16-month experiment, monocultures had faired obviously worse. And the study had shown via the measurably healthier growth in polycultures that science can begin to quantify biodiversity\u2019s contribution to coral survival as well as the effects of biodiversity\u2019s disappearance.\n\u201cThis was a starter experiment to see if we would get an initial result, and we did,\u201d said principal investigator Mark\u00a0Hay, a\u00a0 Regents Professor and Harry and Linda Teasley Chair in Georgia Tech\u2019s School of Biological Sciences . \u201cSo much reef death over the years has reduced coral species variety and made reefs more homogenous, but science still doesn't understand enough about how coral biodiversity helps reefs survive. We want to know more.\u201d\nThe results of the study appear\u00a0 in the February issue of the journal\u00a0 Nature ecology & evolution \u00a0and were made available online in January. The research was funded by the National Science Foundation, by the National Institutes of Health\u2019s Fogarty International Center, and by the Teasley Endowment.\nThe study\u2019s insights could aid ecologists restocking crumbling reefs with corals -- which are animals. Past replenishing efforts have often deployed patches of single species that have had trouble taking hold, and the researchers believe the study should encourage replanting using biodiverse patches.\n[Ready for graduate school?\u00a0 Here's how to apply to Georgia Tech. ]\n40 years\u2019 decimation\nThe decimation of corals Hay has witnessed in over four decades of undersea research underscores this study\u2019s importance.\n\u201cIt\u2019s shocking how quickly the Caribbean reefs crashed. In the 1970s and early 1980s, reefs consisted of about 60 percent live coral cover,\u201d Hay said. \u201cCoral cover declined dramatically through the 1990s and has remained low. It\u2019s now at about 10 percent throughout the Caribbean.\u201d\n\u201cYou used to find living diverse reefs with structurally complex coral stands the size of city blocks. Now, most Caribbean reefs look more like parking lots with a few sparse corals scattered around.\u201d\n84 percent loss\nThe fact that the decimation in the Pacific is less grim is bitter irony. About half of living coral cover disappeared there between the early 1980s and early 2000s with declines accelerating since.\n\u201cFrom 1992 to 2010, the\u00a0 Great Barrier Reef , which is arguably the best-managed reef system on Earth, lost 84 percent,\u201d Clements said. \u201cAll of this doesn\u2019t include the\u00a0 latest bleaching events \u00a0reported so widely in the media, and they killed huge swaths of reef in the Pacific.\u201d\nThe\u00a0 2016 bleaching \u00a0event also sacked reefs off of Fiji where the researchers ran their experiment. The coral deaths have been associated with extended periods of\u00a0 ocean heating , which have become much more common in recent decades.\n10 times more species\nStill, there\u2019s hope. Pacific reefs support ten times as many coral species as Caribbean reefs, and Clements\u2019 and Hay\u2019s new study suggests that this higher biodiversity may help make these reefs more robust than the Caribbean reefs. There, many species have joined the endangered list, or are \u201cfunctionally extinct,\u201d still present but in traces too small to have an ecological impact.\nThe Caribbean\u2019s coral collapse may have been a warning shot on the dangers of species loss. Some coral species protect others from getting eaten or infected, for example.\n\u201cA handful of species may be critical for the survival of many others, and we don\u2019t yet know well enough which are most critical. If key species disappear, the consequences could be enormous,\u201d said Hay, who believes he may have already witnessed this in the Caribbean. \u201cThe decline of key species may drive the decline of others and potentially create a death spiral.\u201d\n864 abrasive animals\nOff Fiji\u2019s shores, Clements transported by kayak, one by one, 48 concrete tables he had built on land. He dove them into place and mounted on top of them 864 jaggy corals in planters he had fashioned from the tops of plastic soda bottles.\n\u201cI scratched a lot of skin off of my fingers screwing those corals onto the tables,\u201d he said, laughing at the memory. \u201cI drank enough saltwater through my snorkel doing it, too.\u201d\nClements laid out 18 corals on each tabletop: Three groups of monocultures filled 36 tables (12 with species A, 12 with species B, 12 with species C). The remaining 12 tabletops held polycultures with balanced A-B-C mixtures. He collected data four months into the experiment and at 16 months.\nThe polycultures all looked great. Only one monoculture species,\u00a0 Acropora \u00a0 millepora , had nice growth at the 16-month mark, but that species is more susceptible to disease, bleaching, predators, and storms. It may have sprinted ahead in growth in the experiment, but long-term it would probably need the help of other species to cope with its own fragility.\n\u201cCorals and humans both may do well on their own in good times,\u201d Hay said. \u201cBut when disaster strikes, friends may become essential.\u201d\nAlso read:\nSwapping cooties may help \"Nemo\" fish cohabitate with fish-killing anemones\nThe research was funded by the National Science Foundation (grant OCE 0929119), and the National Institutes of Health\u2019s Fogarty International Center (grant 2 U19 TW007401-10), and the Teasley Endowment.
