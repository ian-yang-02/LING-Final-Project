Carson Meredith, a professor in Georgia Tech\u2019s School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering. \u201cOur material showed up to a 67 percent reduction in oxygen permeability over some forms of PET, which means it could in theory keep foods fresher longer.\u201d\nCellulose, which comes from plants, is the planet\u2019s most common natural biopolymer, followed next by chitin, which is found in shellfish, insects and fungi.\nThe team devised a method to create a film by suspending cellulose and chitin nanofibers in water and spraying them onto a surface in alternating layers. Once fully dried, the material is flexible, strong, transparent and compostable.\n\u201cWe had been looking at cellulose nanocrystals for several years and exploring ways to improve those for use in lightweight composites as well as food packaging, because of the huge market opportunity for renewable and compostable packaging, and how important food packaging overall is going to be as the population continues to grow,\u201d Meredith said.\nThe research team also included Meisha Shofner, an associate professor in the School of Materials Science and Engineering and the interim executive director of the Renewable Bioproducts Institute, John R. Reynolds, a professor in the schools of Chemistry and Biochemistry and Materials Science and Engineering, and Chinmay Satam, a graduate student at Georgia Tech.\nThe team had been looking into chitin for an unrelated reason when they wondered if it might have use in food packaging.\n\u201cWe recognized that because the chitin nanofibers are positively charged, and the cellulose nanocrystals are negatively charged, they might work well as alternating layers in coatings because they would form a nice interface between them,\u201d Meredith said.\nPackaging meant to preserve food needs to prevent oxygen from passing through. Part of the reason the new material improves upon conventional plastic packaging as a gas barrier is because of the crystalline structure of the film.\n\u201cIt\u2019s difficult for a gas molecule to penetrate a solid crystal, because it has to disrupt the crystal structure,\u201d Meredith said. \u201cSomething like PET on the other hand has a significant amount of amorphous or non-crystalline content, so there are more paths easier for a small gas molecule to find its way through.\u201d\nEnvironmentalists have long looked for renewable ways to replace petroleum-based materials in consumer products. With the amount of cellulose already produced and a ready supply of chitin-rich byproducts left over from the shellfish food industry, there\u2019s likely more than enough material available to make the new films a viable flexible-packaging alternative, Meredith said.\nStill, there\u2019s more work to be done. To make the new material eventually competitive with flexible packaging film on cost, a manufacturing process that maximizes economy of scale will need to be developed. Additionally, while industrial processes to mass produce cellulose are mature, methods to produce chitin are still in their infancy, Meredith said. And, more research is also needed to improve the material\u2019s ability to block water vapor.\nThis work was supported by the Georgia Tech Renewable Bioproducts Institute and the Georgia Research Alliance.
