This new position will help advance Tech\u2019s strategic goal of more deeply integrating the arts into education and research.\nThis position is open to current full-time tenure-track and nontenure- track faculty at Georgia Tech. Leslie Sharp, dean of Libraries, will serve as chair of the search committee.\nReporting to Senior Vice Provost for Education and Learning Laurence Jacobs, the position will sit at the intersection of art and technology, offering students and faculty a new opportunity to innovate.\n\u201cThis new role is so exciting because it will help Georgia Tech develop new and reimagined curricular experiences that nurture different ways of thinking, understanding, and problem-solving,\u201d said Jacobs. \u201cWeaving arts and STEM disciplines together creates a more comprehensive and interdisciplinary learning environment, which benefits our students and\u00a0society as a whole.\u201d\nEmphasizing the curricular components of the arts could ultimately create academic majors, minors, or certificates that would distinguish Georgia Tech students from competitive institutions, Jacobs added. He also noted that students with such qualifications are well placed to make a sizable impact on the state\u2019s already exploding arts and production scene.\nAccording to the Georgia Council for the Arts, the creative industries generate a $62.5 billion economic impact in Georgia. That includes 200,000 employees who earn a combined salary of $12.1 billion. Georgia Tech wants to position itself as an arts-in-technology trailblazer that could fuel an even more significant economic boon for the state.\nAmong other responsibilities, the AVP-A will:\nLiaise with College deans, School chairs, and leadership as well as faculty (e.g., tenure-track, lecturers, research and academic professionals, librarians, and archivists) to design and lead the implementation of innovative programs that develop and incorporate the arts.\nContribute to the Institute\u2019s Arts@Tech and Arts Square strategic planning initiative.\nFacilitate student engagement in arts-based curricular and cocurricular learning experiences, encouraging creative expression and critical thinking across disciplines.\nCollaborate with the associate vice president for Arts, Belonging, and Community in the division of Student Engagement and Well-Being to ensure alignment between curricular and cocurricular efforts and to integrate performing, visual, and all other forms of art into learning, service, and scholarship.\nCandidates should log in to OneUSG Connect ( https://oneusgconnect.usg.edu ), click the Recruiting Self-Service tile, click the Apply for Jobs tile, and search for job ID 264210. Candidates should submit a CV, cover letter, and list of three professional references by Nov. 1.\nFor more information, visit\nhttps://provost.gatech.edu/assistant-vice-provost-arts-search , or contact Susan Gilstrap ( susan.gilstrap@gatech.edu ).\nAdditional Images\nContact\nSusan Gilstrap\nsusan.gilstrap@gatech.edu\nEmail\nsusan.gilstrap@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
