Yellow strands may descend from existing muscle cells and from delivered MuSCs.\nAug 15, 2018\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nA car accident leaves an aging patient with severe muscle injuries that won\u2019t heal. Treatment with muscle stem cells from a donor might restore damaged tissue, but doctors are unable to deliver them effectively.\nA new method \u00a0may help change this.\nResearchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology engineered a molecular matrix, a hydrogel, to deliver muscle stem cells called muscle satellite cells (MuSCs) directly to injured muscle tissue in patients whose muscles don\u2019t regenerate well. In lab experiments on mice, the hydrogel successfully delivered MuSCs to injured, aged muscle tissue to boost\u00a0the healing process while protecting the stem cells from harsh immune reactions.\nThe method was also successful in mice with a muscle tissue deficiency that emulated Duchene muscular dystrophy, and if research progresses, the new hydrogel therapy could one day save the lives of people suffering from the disease.\nInflammatory war zone\nSimply injecting additional muscle satellite cells into damaged, inflamed tissue has proven inefficient, in part because the stem cells encounter an immune system on the warpath.\n\u201cAny muscle injury is going to attract immune cells. Typically, this would help muscle stem cells repair damage. But in aged or dystrophic muscles, immune cells lead to the release a lot of toxic chemicals like cytokines and free radicals that kill the new stem cells,\u201d said Young Jang, an\u00a0 assistant professor in Georgia Tech\u2019s School of Biological Sciences \u00a0and one of the study\u2019s principal investigators.\nOnly between 1 and 20 percent of injected MuSCs make it to damaged tissue, and those that do, arrive there weakened. Also, some tissue damage makes any injection unfeasible, thus the need for new delivery strategies.\n\u201cOur new hydrogel protects the stem cells, which multiply and thrive inside the matrix. The gel is applied to injured muscle, and the cells engraft onto the tissues and help them heal,\u201d said Woojin Han, a postdoctoral researcher in Georgia Tech\u2019s School of Mechanical Engineering and the paper\u2019s first author.\nHan, Jang and Andres Garcia, the study\u2019s other principal investigator,\npublished their results on August 15, 2018, in the journal\u00a0 Science Advances . The National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases of the National Institutes of Health funded the research.\nHydrogel: watery nets\nHydrogels often start out as water-based solutions of molecular components that resemble crosses, and other components that make the ends of the crosses attach to each other. When the components come together, they fuse into molecular nets suspended in water, resulting in a material with the consistency of a gel.\nIf stem cells or a drug are mixed into the solution, when the net, or matrix, forms, it ensnares the treatment for delivery and protects the payload from death or dissipation in the body. Researchers can easily and reliably synthesize hydrogels and also custom-engineer them by tweaking their components, as the Georgia Tech researchers did in this hydrogel.\n\u201cIt physically traps the muscle satellite cells in a net, but the cells also grab onto chemical latches we engineered into the net,\u201d Han said.\nThis hydrogel\u2019s added latches, which bond with proteins protruding from stem cells\u2019 membranes, not only increase the cells\u2019 adhesion to the net but also hinder them from committing suicide. Stem cells tend to kill themselves when they\u2019re detached and free-floating.\nThe chemical components and the cells are mixed in solution then applied to the injured muscle, where the mixture sets to a matrix-gel patch that glues the stem cells in place. The gel is biocompatible and biodegradable.\n\u201cThe stem cells keep multiplying and thriving in the gel after it is applied,\u201d Jang said. \u201cThen the hydrogel degrades and leaves behind the cells engrafted onto muscle tissue the way natural stem cells usually would be.\u201d\nStem cell breakdown\nIn younger, healthier patients, muscle satellite cells are part of the natural healing mechanism.\n\u201cMuscle satellite cells are resident stem cells in your skeletal muscles. They live on muscle strands like specks, and they\u2019re key players in making new muscle tissue,\u201d Han said.\n\u201cAs we age, we lose muscle mass, and the number of satellite cells also decreases. The ones that are left get weaker. It\u2019s a double whammy,\u201d Jang said. \u201cAt a very advanced age, a patient stops regenerating muscle altogether.\u201d\n\u201cWith this system we engineered, we think we can introduce donor cells to enhance the repair mechanism in injured older patients,\u201d Han said. \u201cWe also want to get this to work in patients with Duchene muscular dystrophy.\u201d\n\u201cDuchene muscular dystrophy is surprisingly frequent,\u201d Jang said. \u201cAbout 1 in 3,500 boys get it. They eventually get respiratory defects that lead to death, so we hope to be able to use this to rebuild their diaphragm muscles.\u201d\nIf the method goes to clinical trials, researchers will likely have to work around the potential for donor cell rejection in human patients.\nAlso READ: Punching Cancer with RNA Knuckles Wrapped in Hydrogel\nLike this article?\nSubscribe to our email newsletter here.\nThe following researchers coauthored the paper: Shannon Anderson, Mahir Mohiuddin, Shadi Nakhai, and Eunjung Shin from Georgia Tech; Isabel Freitas Amaral, and Ana Paula P\u00eago from the University of Porto in Portugal, and Daniela Barros from Georgia Tech and the University of Porto.
