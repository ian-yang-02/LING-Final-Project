This year, 16 graduating students were honored at the Lavender Graduation ceremony, which was hosted by the\nLGBTQIA Resource Center , and more than 100 guests were in attendance on April 21. \u201cLavender Graduation rewards graduates for their accomplishments while at Tech and serves as a formal farewell to the community,\u201d explained Aby Parsons, director of the LGBTQIA Resource Center. \u201cThis ceremony also gives students the opportunity to connect with our LGBTQIA alumni and learn how they can stay involved with LGBTQIA life at Tech after graduation.\u201d During the ceremony, Student Life Vice President and Dean of Students John Stein welcomed attendees, and Institute Diversity Vice President Archie Ervin invited each graduate on stage to receive a lavender diploma from the LGBTQIA Resource Center, a gift from the Georgia Tech Pride Alumni, and a letter from Stein. \u201cIt is nice to be honored at Lavender Graduation before Commencement,\u201d said R. Chase Adams, a computer engineering and Applied Languages and Intercultural Studies (ALIS) in Japanese student and Greek Allies facilitator with the LGBTQIA Resource Center. \u201cGraduation is a bittersweet time for me as I have enjoyed my five years at Tech, but I am excited to start working at Intel in Oregon this summer.\u201d Following Lavender Graduation, the LGBTQIA Resource Center presented the Second Annual Lavender Awards to recognize individuals who have made the Institute a safer and more inclusive environment for LGBTQIA students, faculty, staff, and alumni.
