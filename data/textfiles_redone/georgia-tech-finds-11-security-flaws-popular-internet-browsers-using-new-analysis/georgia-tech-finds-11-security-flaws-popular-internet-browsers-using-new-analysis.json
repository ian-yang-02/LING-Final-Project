Their findings were honored with the Internet Defense Prize, an award presented by Facebook in partnership with USENIX this week at the 24 th\nUSENIX Security Symposium. Ph.D. students Byoungyoung Lee and Chengyu Song, with Professors Taesoo Kim and Wenke Lee, of Georgia Tech received $100,000 from Facebook to continue their research and increase its impact to make the Internet safer. Their research, \u201cType Casting Verification: Stopping an Emerging Attack Vector,\u201d explores vulnerabilities in C++ programs (such as Chrome and Firefox) that result from \u201cbad casting\u201d or \u201ctype confusion.\u201d Bad casting enables an attacker to corrupt the memory in a browser so that it follows a malicious logic instead of proper instructions. The researchers developed a new, proprietary detection tool called CAVER to catch them. CAVER is a run-time detection tool with 7.6 percent - 64.6 percent overhead on browser performance (Chrome and Firefox, respectively). The 11 vulnerabilities identified by Georgia Tech have been confirmed and fixed by vendors. \u201cIt is time for the Internet community to start addressing the more difficult, deeper security problems,\u201d says\nWenke Lee , professor in the School of Computer Science and an adviser to the team. \u201cThe security research community has been working on various ways to detect and fix memory safety bugs for decades, and have made progress on \u2018stack overflow\u2019 and \u2018heap overflow\u2019 bugs, but these have now become relatively easy problems. Our work studied the much harder and deeper bugs \u2014 in particular \u2018use-after-free\u2019 and \u2018bad casting\u2019 \u2014 and our tools discovered serious security bugs in widely used software, such as Firefox and libstdc++. We are grateful to Facebook for this recognition.\u201d The work was selected for Facebook's second ever Internet Defense Prize award, which recognizes superior quality research that combines a working prototype with significant contributions to the security of the Internet -- particularly in the areas of protection and defense. The award is meant to recognize the direction of the research and to inspire researchers to focus on high-impact areas. \u201cDesigning defensive security technology has never been more important, and that\u2019s why we are once again offering the Internet Defense Prize to stimulate high quality research in this area,\u201d said Ioannis Papagiannis, security engineering manager at Facebook. \u201cThe Georgia Tech team\u2019s novel technique for detecting bad type casts in C++ programs is the type of standout approach we want to encourage. We look forward to seeing what the team does next to create broader impact and improve security on the Internet.\u201d \u201cGeorgia Tech\u2019s award-winning entry exemplifies the groundbreaking security research that has become a hallmark of the USENIX Security Symposium,\u201d said Casey Henderson, executive director of the USENIX Association. \u201cTheir trailblazing work stood out among the many outstanding submissions judged by the USENIX Security Awards Committee and Facebook. We look forward to their continued progress enabled by the Internet Defense Prize in the coming year.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nContact\nTara La Bouff Communications Manager College of Computing 404-894-7253\nEmail\ntlabouff@cc.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
