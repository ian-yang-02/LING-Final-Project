The result, they said, is \u201cpersistent pay stratification in organizations that otherwise embrace practices intended to increase equity.\u201d The NIH, CDC, EPA, NSF and USDA fell into this category.\n\u201cWhen the findings of this study are shared with members of the scientific community, there is typically surprise that measurable disparities in earnings are persistent between women and men even at federal agencies that use the General Schedule,\u201d said Husbands Fealing, referring to the standardized pay schedule for most federal jobs. \u201cOur study shines a bright light on the persistence of earnings disparities between women and men, even when there is an appearance that the Federal system is designed to avoid these pay gaps.\u201d\nAccording to the research, the overall gender gap fell between 1994 and 2008, apparently as a result of federal hiring practices. Significant disparities remained, however. In 1994, women earned on average 73 cents for every dollar earned by a man at agencies with a masculine focus and 77 cents for every dollar at the other agencies. The data show the gap closed by 2008, with women earning 83 cents per dollar earned by men at life sciences agencies and 90 cents per dollar at interdisciplinary agencies.\nResearchers said the strong pay gap in male-oriented agencies was the result of substantial numbers of employees being paid outside of the General Schedule system in a classification more often held by men than women.\nThe explanations for pay gaps also varied widely among agencies. For instance, hiring women more often into lower-paying jobs accounted for about 84% of the gender pay gap at the NSF but 47% at NOAA. Meanwhile, practices that led to men being paid more than women for the same job accounted for less than 9% of the pay gap at the NSF, but about 33% at the USDA.\nOrganizational culture plays a strong role in perpetuating such pay gaps, said Laurel Smith-Doerr of the University of Massachusetts Amherst, lead author of the research co-authored\u00a0with Husbands Fealing; Sharla Alegria, an assistant professor of sociology at the University of Toronto; Debra Fitzpatrick, co-director of the University of Minnesota Center on Women, Gender and Public Policy; and Donald Tomaskovic-Devey, professor of sociology and director of the Center for Employment Equity at UMass Amherst.\n\u201cIt is very easy for us in the U.S. to think in terms of individuals and to think about people making decisions, but actually it is really important to look at how organizations make decisions, and a lot of times that\u2019s less visible to us,\u201d Smith-Doerr said. \u201cTherefore, you need to have this kind of population-level data and statistical analyses in order to be able to see these trends, and that\u2019s what we have here.\u201d\nThe paper, \u201c Gender Pay Gaps in U.S. Federal Science Agencies: An Organizational Approach ,\u201d is published in the September edition of the American Journal of Sociology.\nThe\nSchool of Public Policy\nis a unit of the\nIvan Allen College of Liberal Arts .\nAdditional Images\nContact\nMichael Pearson\nmichael.pearson@iac.gatech.edu\n404.894.2290\nEmail\nmichael.pearson@iac.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
