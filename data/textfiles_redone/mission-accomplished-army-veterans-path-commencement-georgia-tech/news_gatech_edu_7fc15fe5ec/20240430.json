With a new baby boy at home, he credits his wife\u00a0for stepping up to fill that role.\n\u201cShe serves as a foundation that holds everything together. This degree would not have happened if it wasn't for her, because the diaper changes, the long nights, and the weekends when I needed to play catch-up can all be attributed to her being \u2018super mom\u2019 on the days that I needed to be a good student,\u201d he said.\nPreparing to graduate from Cal State Fullerton in 2006, Benitez \u2014 the son of a 20-year Navy veteran \u2014 knew his dreams of entering the tech field would have to wait. After deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan, Benitez became a civil affairs officer with the 95th Civil Affairs Brigade before transitioning into the reserves while earning his MBA from LSU. But his Silicon Valley dream never left him. Knowing the prestige that Georgia Tech carries as an institution and hearing of its glowing reputation within the veteran community during his service, Benitez\u2019s decision was a no-brainer when it came time to get back in the classroom.\n\u201cEvery single peer or even mentor that I've had was affiliated with Georgia Tech in one way or another, either alumni or professors, and I looked up to them,\u201d he said. \u201cI felt that, based on those interactions and how well Georgia Tech took care of its veterans, it was an easy choice.\u201d\nPraising the Institute for setting veterans up for success, Benitez noted how seamlessly he was able to settle in and focus on his coursework.\u00a0 With a plethora of resources at the ready , Benitez hopes to see other members of a community with so much to offer follow in his footsteps.\n\u201cTo me, the veteran community continues to be underutilized, and I think Georgia Tech hits it out of the park when it comes to trying to recruit the best students and the best leaders,\u201d he said.\nCurrently working in federal consulting, Benitez intends to tap into his entrepreneurial spirit to launch a startup hedge fund using the models and algorithms he learned at Georgia Tech.\nWith three under his belt, Benitez has told his wife that this will be his last degree, so Friday will be a special day on the Flats. \u201cI think it's going to be a lot of overwhelming emotions because it took me three years to knock this degree out. That was a lot of time and effort,\u201d he said.\nWith the mindset instilled in him by his parents and by the Army, coupled with his wife\u2019s support, failure was never an option.\n\u201cOnce you have that foundation set right, all that matters is achieving the mission,\u201d he said. \u201cHaving Georgia Tech on my resume and having that pedigree attached to it was a mission that I wasn't going to fail in.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nGeorgia Tech Commencement\nMaster of Science in Analytics\nFall 2022 Commencement Speakers\nWhat Not to Wear: Commencement Edition\u2026and Other Tips For Your Graduation Day\nBalancing Parenthood and the Pursuit of a Ph.D.\nCommencement Wishes\nBeth Quay: Taking Care of Unfinished Business\nReflection Speakers Highlight Tech Community\nContact\nSteven Gagliano - Communications Officer\nInstitute\u00a0Communications\nEmail\nSteven.gagliano@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
