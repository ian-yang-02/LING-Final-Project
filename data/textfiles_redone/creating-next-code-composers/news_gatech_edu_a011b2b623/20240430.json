A musical app called EarSketch proves to be the ideal learning instrument.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nEmail\nNylah Julmice offering headphones to listen to a code-composed song.\nNov 01, 2017\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\n\u201cIf I hadn\u2019t taken the course, I would have never figured out that I had a passion for this,\u201d says\u00a0Nylah Julmice, a computer science major at Georgia Tech.\nJulmice was an Atlanta high school student and musician when she enrolled in a class called \u201cMusic Tech,\u201d which she thought was a music theory course. She showed up the first day only to find out it was a class in programming, a subject that had always felt inaccessible to her.\n\u201cIt seemed complex, something that was impossible and out of reach. Especially since there aren\u2019t a lot of females in this industry.\u201d\nBut Music Tech was an EarSketch class, so there was plenty of music to be made. The inclusion of music in the curriculum was ultimately what piqued her interest. \u201cIt was something that made sense. It made me really fascinated by the whole idea of computer science.\u201d\nIt turned out that Julmice had a passion for both code and music. She completed her EarSkech class and began to study more coding languages on her own.\nShe signed up for AP Computer Science and began to see the field as a potential career path. \u201cI enjoyed the puzzle, trying to figure out how things worked.\u201d\nRead the Full Story: Creating the Next Code Composers\nAdditional Images\nEmail\nmonet.fort@comm.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
