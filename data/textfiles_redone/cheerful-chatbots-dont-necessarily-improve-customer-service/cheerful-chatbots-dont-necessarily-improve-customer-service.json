Denning Professor of Technology & Management and faculty director, Denning Technology & Management Program\nDec 21, 2022\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nImagine messaging an artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot about a missing package and getting the response that it would be \u201cdelighted\u201d to help. Once the bot creates the new order, they say they are \u201chappy\u201d to resolve the issue. After, you receive a survey about your interaction, but would you be likely to rate it as positive or negative?\nThis scenario isn\u2019t that far from reality, as AI chatbots are already taking over online commerce. By 2025, 95% of companies will have an AI chatbot, according to\nFinance Digest .\nAI might not be sentient yet, but it can be programmed to express emotions.\nHumans displaying positive emotions in customer service interactions have long been known to improve customer experience, but researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology\u2019s\nScheller College of Business\nwanted to see if this also applied to AI. They conducted experimental studies to determine if positive emotional displays improved customer service and found that emotive AI is only appreciated if the customer expects it, and it may not be the best avenue for companies to invest in.\n\u201cIt is commonly believed and repeatedly shown that human employees can express positive emotion to improve customers\u2019 service evaluations,\u201d said\nHan Zhang , the Steven A. Denning Professor in Technology & Management. \u201cOur findings suggest that the likelihood of AI\u2019s expression of positive emotion to benefit or hurt service evaluations depends on the type of relationship that customers expect from the service agent.\u201d\nThe researchers presented their findings in the paper, \u201c Bots With Feelings: Should AI Agents Express Positive Emotion in Customer Service? ,\u201d in\nInformation Systems Research\u00a0 in December.\nStudying AI Emotion\nThe researchers conducted three studies to expand the understanding of emotional AI in customer service transactions. Although they changed the participants and scenario in each study, AI chatbots imbued with emotion used positive emotional adjectives, such as excited, delighted, happy, or glad. They also deployed more exclamation points.\nThe first study focused on whether customers responded more favorably to positive emotion if they knew the customer agent was a bot or person. Participants were told they were seeking help for a missing item in a retail order. The 155 participants were then randomly assigned to four different scenarios: human agents with neutral emotion, human agents with positive emotion, bots with neutral emotion, and bots with positive emotion. Then they asked participants about service quality and overall satisfaction. The results indicated that positive emotion was more beneficial when human agents exhibited it, but it had no effect when bots exhibited it.\nThe second study examined if customers\u2019 personal expectations determined their reaction to the bot. In this scenario, the 88 participants imagined returning a textbook and were randomly assigned to either emotion-positive or emotion-neutral bots. After chatting with the bot, they were asked to rate if they were communal (social) oriented or exchange (transaction) oriented on a scale. If the participant was communal-focused, they were more likely to appreciate the positive emotional bot, but if they expected the exchange as merely transactional, the emotionally positive bot made their experience worse.\n\u201cOur work enables businesses to understand the expectations of customers exposed to AI-provided services before they haphazardly equip AIs with emotion-expressing capabilities,\u201d Zhang said.\nThe final study explored why a bot\u2019s positive emotion influences customer emotions, following 177 undergraduate students randomly assigned to emotive or non-emotive bots. The results explained why positive bots have less of an effect than anticipated. Because customers do not expect machines to have emotions, they can react negatively to emotion in a bot.\nThe results across the studies show that using positive emotion in chatbots is challenging because businesses don\u2019t know a customer\u2019s biases and expectations going into the interaction. A happy chatbot could lead to an unhappy customer.\n\u201cOur findings suggest that the positive effect of expressing positive emotion on service evaluations may not materialize when the source of the emotion is not a human,\u201d Zhang said. \u201cPractitioners should be cautious about the promises of equipping AI agents with emotion-expressing capabilities.\u201d\nCITATION: Han, Elizabeth and Yin, Dezhi and Zhang, Han (2022) Bots with Feelings: Should AI Agents Express Positive Emotion in Customer Service?.
