That\u2019s no problem for most of us, who will simply walk to the table, grab the glass, and enjoy the milk. Triggering all of that limb movement is a complex set of coordinated neuromuscular commands and actions, which are not so simple for that segment of the population with, say, cerebral palsy or spinal cord injury.\nTo help young people struggling with those conditions \u2013 or orthopedic problems like clubfoot, scoliosis, and osteogenesis imperfecta, among other things \u2013 Shriners Hospitals for Children\u00ae and the Georgia Institute of Technology have launched an ambitious collaborative research effort to address these conditions, including the development of devices to facilitate limb movement and function.\nThe new research affiliation brings together the clinical, surgical, and scientific expertise of Shriners Hospitals for Children physicians and researchers with Georgia Tech\u2019s cutting-edge expertise in biomedical engineering, robotics, and device development. The coordinated effort also will leverage the two organizations\u2019 proficiency in big data and artificial intelligence tools for personalized medicine, according to Marc Lalande, Ph.D., vice president of research programs for Shriners Hospitals for Children.\n\u201cOur joint goals, through genetic and genomic data gathered by Shriners Hospitals for Children, are to improve patient therapeutic responses by optimizing individualized treatment regimens and reducing adverse events,\u201d Lalande said.\nSeveral joint projects already are underway.\nJaydev Desai , professor in the\nWallace H. Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering\n(BME) at Georgia Tech and Emory University, is working with Scott Kozin, M.D., chief of staff and hand surgeon at Shriners Hospitals for Children-Philadelphia, on a wearable customized robotic exoskeleton with voice recognition for children with cervical spine injury.\n\u201cThis is a patient specific system for kids with spinal cord injury,\u201d explained Desai, who is director of the\nGeorgia Center for Medical Robotics\nand associate director of Georgia Tech\u2019s\nInstitute for Robotics and Intelligent Machines . \u201cThe system is designed to translate voice commands into actions, meaning the exoskeleton will conform to the proper shape and posture of the fingers, so to speak, depending on the task. The idea is to enhance the child\u2019s ability to perform the activities of daily living.\u201d\nKozin expects his patients with spinal cord injuries will benefit from Georgia Tech\u2019s innovative pediatric prosthesis development \u2013 its utility, actuation, and dexterity. \u201cAlternative pathways for the recovery of sensation will enhance their function and independence. We are excited about this new collaboration combining institutions with similar missions and visions devoted to improving the lives of children,\u201d said Kozin, who also is collaborating with Georgia Tech\u2019s\nFrank Hammond\n(assistant professor in BME and mechanical engineering) on wearable sensory transfer devices for patients with diminished peripheral sensation or amputations, improving their ability to use intuitively powered prostheses and orthoses.\nAdditionally,\nAaron Young , assistant professor in the\nGeorge W. Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering\nat Georgia Tech, is working with David Westberry, M.D., pediatric orthopedic surgeon at Shriners Hospitals for Children-Greenville, on a smart robotic exoskeleton designed to address excessive knee flexion (crouch gait), a condition common in patients with cerebral palsy. The condition can lead to permanent joint deformity if untreated, as well as reduced independence and locomotion capability.\n\u201cThe device is basically a lightweight, wearable robot designed to assist physical therapists working on pediatric mobility \u2013 the idea is to essentially retrain the child\u2019s neuroplasticity,\u201d said Young, who is testing the device with Westberry at Shriners Hospitals for Children-Greenville in South Carolina. \u201cThe exciting thing about Shriners Hospitals for Children-Greenville is that it has an advanced motion analysis center where Shriners\u2019 physicians and researchers are looking at not just the child\u2019s gait, but also at the internal mechanics. It\u2019s very rewarding to collaborate with the Shriners team \u2013 they are very quantitative in their approach to treatment.\u201d\nThat quantitative approach includes the integration of biomedical informatics, data science, and artificial intelligence into the clinical research programs of the Shriners Hospitals for Children network of 14 pediatric motion analysis centers and the healthcare system\u2019s newly launched Genomics Institute. As part of this process, researchers are collaborating with\nDongmei Wang , BME professor at Georgia Tech, where she is director of the Biomedical Informatics and Bioimaging Lab.\n\u201cThis collaboration is extremely important for us because not only have we committed to work on a major national need in youth health, but also because we have been planning to establish a pediatric big data center using advanced IT and AI,\u201d said Wang, whose collaborators at Shriners Hospitals for Children include Gerald Harris (Motion Analysis, Shriners Hospitals for Children-Chicago) and Kamran Shazand (Shriners Hospitals for Children Genomics Institute, Tampa, Florida).\n\u201cOur lab has piloted multiple pediatric projects,\u201d Wang said. \u201cBut this project represents a quantum leap, taking our work to the next level, in a real-world pediatric care setting. Shriners Hospitals for Children is a perfect fit for us.\u201d\nLeanne West, Georgia Tech\u2019s chief engineer of\npediatric technologies , said she\u2019s looking forward to \u201cthe unique research opportunities this relationship with Shriners Hospitals for Children will provide. It will be exciting to see what is possible for us to achieve together.\u201d\nAbout pediatric device research at Georgia Tech\nGeorgia Tech\u2019s wide-ranging efforts in pediatric device development brings the institute\u2019s engineers and scientists together with clinical experts and researchers to develop innovative technological solutions to problems in the health and care of children. The work provides opportunities for interdisciplinary collaboration in pediatrics, creating breakthrough discoveries, enhancing the lives of children and young adults.\nAbout Shriners Hospitals for Children\nShriners Hospitals for Children is changing lives every day through innovative pediatric specialty care, world-class research, and outstanding medical education. Its healthcare system provides care for children with orthopedic conditions, burns, spinal cord injuries, and cleft lip and palate. All care and services are provided regardless of families\u2019 ability to pay. Since opening its first location in 1922, the healthcare system has treated more than 1.4 million children.
