An interim vice president and director will be named for the position.\nDowning, who has served Georgia Tech for 31 years, will leave behind a legacy of leadership in technology-based economic development, university outreach and technical assistance, entrepreneurship and start-up support.\n\u201cI feel very fortunate for such a diverse and challenging career and to have shared so many good years with the Georgia Tech family, and I am very appreciative of the many faculty, staff and students who have made my time at Georgia Tech so interesting and inspiring,\u201d\nDowning\nsaid. \u201cAlthough I am leaving my full-time duties, I look forward to staying connected to Georgia Tech and supporting its mission of progress and service.\u201d\nThe Enterprise Innovation Institute is nation\u2019s largest and most comprehensive university-based program of business and industry assistance, technology commercialization and economic development.\nWith state and federal support, for example, it operates a statewide network of assistance to Georgia manufacturers through the\nManufacturing Extension Partnership , and supports startup companies through the\nAdvanced Technology Development Center . Other EI2 programs help faculty members commercialize technology developed in Georgia Tech labs, serve minority businesses, support economic development activities, and provide a connection to Georgia Tech\u2019s talent and resources.\n\u201cThe Enterprise Innovation Institute is critical component of Georgia Tech\u2019s service to our state,\u201d said\nChaouki Abdallah , Georgia Tech\u2019s executive vice president for research. \u201cDuring his tenure, Chris has expanded our economic development initiatives and increased collaboration among these programs while more closely aligning them with the needs of the state, region and nation.\u201d\nGeorgia Tech President\nG. P. \u201cBud\u201d Peterson\npraised Downing\u2019s long service to Georgia Tech and the state of Georgia.\n\u201cChris has been a tireless champion and supporter of our economic development initiatives, working to maintain strong partnerships across the state while creating new collaborations,\u201d Peterson said. \u201cWe appreciate his leadership role as Georgia Tech partners with the state to strengthen Georgia\u2019s economy.\u201d\nAfter leaving IBM, where he was a mechanical facilities engineer, Downing joined Georgia Tech in 1988 as a senior research engineer with the Georgia Tech Research Institute.\nIn 1996, he joined EI2 \u2014 then called the Economic Development Institute \u2014 as the Griffin regional office manager and provided industrial extension and economic development services to the south metro Atlanta region.\nIn 2005, he was tapped to lead the Industry Services group of the newly-organized Enterprise Innovation Institute. That role included several key outreach programs: the Georgia Manufacturing Extension Partnership, the Energy and Environmental Management Center, the Georgia Tech Procurement Assistance Center (GTPAC), the Southeast Trade Adjustment Assistance Center (SETAAC), and the Georgia Tech Regional Office Network.\nDowning was named EI2\u2019s associate vice president in 2013 and vice president in 2016.\nIn that time, he spearheaded the three-fold expansion of the Advanced Technology Development Center (ATDC) and created the Venture Center space that has helped to attract Fortune 100 corporate innovation centers to Technology Square.\nHis technology-based economic development efforts helped Georgia Tech and the EI2 win the prestigious \u201c2014 Innovation Award\u201d from the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities, and the \u201c2014 Outstanding Research Park Award\u201d from the Association of Research Parks.\nMost recently, Downing led the feasibility study for the expansion of Georgia Tech\u2019s second research park, Technology Enterprise Park, into a broader life sciences and technology innovation district.\nDowning is a graduate of the University of Florida, where he earned his bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees in mechanical engineering.\nThe national search process will be led by the EVPR office, which will also name the interim vice president and director by May 30, 2019.\nResearch News\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\n177 North Avenue\nAtlanta, Georgia\u00a0 30332-0181\u00a0 USA\nMedia Relations Contact : P\u00e9ralte Paul (404-316-1210); (peralte.paul@comm.gatech.edu).\nAdditional Images\nContact\nP\u00e9ralte Paul\n(404-316-1210)\nEmail\nperalte.paul@comm.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
