The tour allows anyone to experience campus from where they are, tour at their own pace, and experience an in-depth look at Tech in an engaging and informative experience.\n\"We are excited to not only showcase our beautiful campus but to also continue to make strides in accomplishing our goals of expanding access and amplifying impact,\u201d said Becky Tankersley, director of communications for Enrollment Management. \u201cThis virtual tour platform enables every unit on campus to provide a glimpse into life at Tech. In addition to helping recruit prospective students to Tech, the new virtual tour will help high school counselors, K-12 partnerships, faculty and staff recruitment, and collaboration with other stakeholders such as alumni, community relations, and corporate partners.\u201d\nWith the new virtual tour technology, it has never been easier for prospective students to explore the Tech campus. The tool adds to existing in-person campus tour options, which can be scheduled\nonline,\nand supplements the\nvirtual information sessions .\nAs part of this YouVisit Virtual Campus Tour, along with the imagery of campus, a tour guide reads essential information about the campus, with interactive icons at each location offering users the option to click and launch videos and photos of associated traditions and campus activities.\n\u201cYouVisit is a great marketing tool for campus to not only highlight our facilities but to immerse students and their families in the various experiences they can have across our community,\u201d said Niccole Coleman, director of Marketing Communications Consulting in Institute Communications.\nWith 360-degree interactive views, the tour allows a visit to the Georgia Tech campus from anywhere in the world. From the iconic Tech Tower to the West Campus residence halls and everywhere in between, visitors can learn more about the campus when an in-person visit isn\u2019t possible or practical.\n\u201cIt takes the whole campus to do something like this,\u201d said Andrew Cohen, associate director for Guest Experience in the Office of Undergraduate Admission. \u201cWe appreciate the support from all of our campus partners who opened their doors to show us their spaces as part of this tour.\u201d\nAccess the tour\nhere .\nAdditional Images\nEmail\nbecky.tankersley@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
