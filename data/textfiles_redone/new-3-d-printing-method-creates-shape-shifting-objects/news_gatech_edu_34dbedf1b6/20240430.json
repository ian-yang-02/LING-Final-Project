Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering\u00a0at Georgia Tech. \u201cThis allows high-resolution 3-D printed components to be designed by computer simulation, 3-D printed, and then directly and rapidly transformed into new permanent configurations by simply heating.\u201d\nThe research was reported April 12 in the journal\u00a0 Science Advances , a publication of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. The work is funded by the U.S. Air Force Office of Scientific Research, the U.S. National Science Foundation and the Singapore National Research Foundation through the SUTD DManD Centre.\nTheir development of the new 3-D printed objects follows earlier work the team had done using smart shape memory polymers (SMPs), which have the ability to remember one shape and change to another programmed shape when uniform heat is applied, to make objects that could fold themselves along hinges.\n\u201cThe approach can achieve printing time and material savings up to 90 percent, while completely eliminating time-consuming mechanical programming from the design and manufacturing workflow,\u201d Qi said.\nTo demonstrate the capabilities of the new process, the team fabricated several objects that could bend or expand quickly when immersed in hot water \u2013 including a model of a flower whose petals bend like a real daisy responding to sunlight and a lattice-shaped object that could expand by nearly eight times its original size.\n\u201cOur composite materials at room temperature have one material that is soft but can be programmed to contain internal stress, while the other material is stiff,\u201d said Zhen Ding,\u00a0a postdoc researcher at Singapore University of Technology and Design.\u00a0 \u201cWe use computational simulations to design composite components where the stiff material has a shape and size that prevents the release of the programmed internal stress from the soft material after 3-D printing. Upon heating the stiff material softens and allows the soft material to release its stress and this results in a change \u2013 often dramatic \u2013 in the product shape.\u201d\nThe new 4-D objects could enable a range of new product features, such as allowing products that could be stacked flat or rolled for shipping and then expanded once in use, the researchers said. Eventually, the technology could enable components that could respond to stimuli such as temperature, moisture or light in a way that is precisely timed to create space structures, deployable medical devices, robots, toys and range of other structures.\n\u201cThe key advance of this work is a 4-D printing method that is dramatically simplified and allows the creation of high-resolution complex 3-D reprogrammable products,\u201d said Martin L. Dunn a professor at Singapore University of Technology and Design who is also the director of the SUTD Digital Manufacturing and Design Centre. \u201cIt promises to enable myriad applications across biomedical devices, 3-D electronics, and consumer products. It even opens the door to a new paradigm in product design, where components are designed from the onset to inhabit multiple configurations during service.\u201d\nThis research was supported by the Air Force Office of Scientific Research under grant 15RT0885, by the National Science Foundation under awards CMMI-1462894, CMMI-1462895, and EFRI-1435452, and by the SUTD Digital Manufacturing and Design Centre, supported by the Singapore National Research Foundation.
