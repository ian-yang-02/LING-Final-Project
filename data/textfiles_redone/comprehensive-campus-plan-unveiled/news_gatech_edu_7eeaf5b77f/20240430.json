Reopening of the Third Street tunnel. A car-free campus core. An on-site water reuse facility. A new thermal energy plant. Additional recreational fields. Two new residence halls. A new performing arts center. Peters Park instead of Peters Parking Deck. These are some of the exciting possibilities proposed in the 2023 Comprehensive Campus Plan (CCP).\nAfter more than two years of preparation and intensive data collection and analysis, the Planning, Design, and Construction department within\nInfrastructure and Sustainability\nhas finalized the new campus plan. Steeped in a rich culture of planning and innovation, the CCP is a living document that will guide how campus space will evolve to support the growing needs of the campus community for the next 10 years and beyond. The plan is flexible, adaptable, and considers estimated future institutional needs as well as projected trends in higher education.\n\u201cOur new Comprehensive Campus Plan outlines a bold future for our campus that supports growth while reaffirming our commitments to students, sustainability, well-being, innovation, and our neighboring communities,\u201d said President \u00c1ngel Cabrera. \u201cI\u2019m excited to see the many ways this plan will enhance the Georgia Tech experience and preserve the beauty of our campus.\u201d\nThe planning department collaborated with a team of consultants to strategize outreach measures, collect and analyze data, and build the foundation for the CCP. Extensive in-person and virtual outreach efforts targeted students, faculty, staff, and alumni as well as external stakeholders such as neighborhood associations, churches, the Atlanta City Council, and Mayor Andre Dickens. Outreach included campus tours, tabling events, focus groups, surveys, town halls, and neighborhood meetings. A\ndedicated website\ntracked the plan\u2019s stages and progress and now houses the final 130-page document, along with an executive summary and a short video.\nIn alignment with the Institute\u2019s strategic plan, the following guiding principles were instrumental in the CCP\u2019s development:\nStudent\u2013First Experience : Enhance the built and urban ecological environment to create a safe, welcoming, enriching, and beautiful campus where every student can thrive.\nTransformative Campus : Radiate influence through transformational and innovative academic, research, living, and workplace environments, and adaptive infrastructure strategies that meet evolving campus needs and growth.\nAccess and Connectivity : Design for an active, well-connected campus that encourages physical movement and discourages car dependency by prioritizing transit, pedestrian, bike, and other modalities to provide universal and equitable access.\nCommunity Well-Being : Promote physical and environmental wellness through intentional design and robust community partnerships to improve and cultivate a safe, healthy, equitable, and adaptable urban fabric.\nStewardship : Foster resiliency and promote stewardship of campus resources through sustainable development and operational strategies in support of Institute sustainability and climate action goals.\nAdditionally, other targeted Institute studies and assessments, such as the campus space utilization plan, the campus historic preservation plan, the facility condition report, the landscape master plan, and the campus stormwater master plan, heavily influence the CCP.\nGeorgia Tech\u2019s previous campus plan, issued almost 20 years ago, guided $2 billion in capital investment and laid the groundwork for several defining campus improvements, including the John Lewis Student Center, the EcoCommons, and the initial development of Tech Square.\nThe newly published CCP addresses current campuswide goals and space need drivers such as:\nA 26% projected increase in on-campus students, faculty, and staff.\nAn additional 2.2 million gross square feet to accommodate growth.\n2,000 new beds for first-year students.\nAdditional indoor recreation and outdoor recreational and athletic fields.\nA car-free campus core.\nIncrease in the campus tree canopy.\nIncrease in alternative mobility options.\nWith these goals and drivers in mind, the 2023 CCP outlines five big ideas:\n1. Harmonize With and Expand EcoCommons\nThe EcoCommons serves as a performance landscape effectively and responsibly managing stormwater while also providing outdoor recreation space. The CCP encourages the EcoCommons remain a key driver in shaping future development on campus.\n2. Densify the Core\nAs the most recent portion of the EcoCommons replaced a surface parking lot in the campus core, there are several other lots that should be the primary locations for future redevelopment. Peters Parking Deck could become campus green space ideal for recreational use and stormwater management. Additionally, vertical density should be considered, rather than large building footprints. The CCP recommends Georgia Tech embrace its urban context to explore building heights surpassing five stories within a car-free campus core.\n3. Heal the Ridge\nA topographical ridge exists on the west side of campus following Marietta Street with stormwater runoff flowing north into the center of campus. The CCP recommends capturing stormwater on top of the ridge with a series of active and passive open spaces, fulfilling athletic and recreation needs. The ridge also physically divides the Georgia Tech campus from its neighbors to the west, a historically underserved area. Activating the ridge can stimulate this area for redevelopment.\n4. Connect Science Square, BioSciences, and Tech Square\nThree distinct areas of innovation on campus \u2014 Science Square in the south, BioSciences in the north, and Tech Square in the east, share faculty, students, and researchers. The CCP recommends improving the connections through physical infrastructure, such as bridges, and enhanced mobility.\n5. Anchor Southwest Community Edge\nThrough thoughtful planned growth, the CCP recommends the development of the campus to the west by healing the ridge and establishing an anchor between campus and the surrounding community.\nNext Steps\nMoving forward, follow-up studies are critical to confirm emerging needs and identify priorities for near- and long-term capital investments. Sector plans, facilities assessments, space utilization studies, and workplace evaluations will inform the future physical changes to campus. Transit and parking feasibility studies will inform campus mobility. Operational evaluations will advise improvements to student housing, dining, and recreation. The Climate Action Plan will assist in the future direction of campus utilities, and additional stormwater research will inform management of the campus landscape.\nTo view the CCP, visit the\nplan\u2019s website .\nRelated links\nA&F Town Hall featuring the Comprehensive Campus Plan\nComprehensive Campus Plan Website\nContact\nCathy Brim\nCommunications Officer II\nInstitute Communications/Infrastructure and Sustainability\nEmail\ncathy.brim@gatech.edu\nAdditional information\nFour additional plans were developed concurrently with the CCP:\nThe Instructional Space Analysis and Master Plan , an assessment of campus classrooms, labs, and informal learning spaces to align with the Institute\u2019s vision for learning into the future.\nThe Student Engagement and Well-Being Programming Study , an analysis of the administrative, operational, and programming space needed to support the physical and mental health of the growing student population.\nThe Sustainability Next Plan , which calls on Georgia Tech to be a global thought leader by catalyzing innovation through education and research and to lead by example in the culture of sustainability.\nThe Campus Climate Action Plan , a carbon neutrality roadmap with objectives and implementation timelines, needed actions, targets, and meaningful mitigation strategies.\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
