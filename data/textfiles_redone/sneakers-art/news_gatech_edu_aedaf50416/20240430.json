She grew up in Queens, New York, with a father as an artist in a home that celebrated creative forms of expression.\nWhile in high school, Peart wanted a different color shoe but couldn\u2019t just buy a new pair \u2013 so she decided to paint them herself. Searching the internet for what she could learn, she discovered a world of people who painted sneakers.\n\u201c I started going back to change old sneakers and wearing them to school and posting them online. I received positive feedback from classmates and the online community, and I decided to turn it into a business,\u201d Peart explains. After creating a logo and business cards, and with support from her family, she founded Kustoms by Ki.\nShe draws inspiration from what she sees online and artists like Takashi Murakami and Keith Haring, but also says that a lot of people come to her with their own ideas. She\u2019s always looking at what new sneakers are coming out to see how they are structured or designed. \u201cIt\u2019s a challenge matching the artistic idea to the right sneaker. It\u2019s really satisfying matching the perfect shoe to the design I had in my head.\u201d\nPeart doesn\u2019t think mechanical engineering and her art business intersect right now, and that\u2019s all right with her but does feel both make her think and use her creativity. \u201cI\u2019ve always had to balance art and engineering. Both involve problem solving and developing creative solutions, and I feel as though they each help me with the other. I keep mechanical engineering and entrepreneurship separate and don\u2019t think I need to force a connection because I love both.\u201d\nThis summer, Peart interned with Procter & Gamble working with robotics, programming, and optimizing processes, which she says solidified her passion for engineering and her career path.\nAlthough engineering may be in her future, she hasn\u2019t shaken the entrepreneurship bug. She\u2019s recently started a vending machine business and helped found a new student organization, The Black Market, a Black entrepreneurship group to help learn about and build businesses while providing a support system.\nPeart\u2019s father is still amazed by the artistic quality of the shoes she creates, while she focuses on getting better and better with each shoe she designs. Not knowing where mechanical engineering, art, or entrepreneurship will take her, one thing is certain: Kiandra Peart is ready for the journey.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nEvan Atkinson , Institute Communications\nEmail\neatkinson6@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
