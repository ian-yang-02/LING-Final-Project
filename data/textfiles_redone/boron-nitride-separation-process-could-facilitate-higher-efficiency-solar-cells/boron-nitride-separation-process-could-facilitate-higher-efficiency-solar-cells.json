Such hybrid structures could theoretically boost solar cell efficiency as high as 30 percent for an InGaN/Si tandem device.\nThe technique is the third major application for the hexagonal boron nitride lift-off technique, which was developed by a team of researchers from the Georgia Institute of Technology, the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS), and Institut Lafayette in Metz, France. Earlier applications targeted sensors and light-emitting diodes (LEDs).\n\u201cBy putting these structures together with photovoltaic cells made of silicon or a III-V material, we can cover the visible spectrum with the silicon and utilize the blue and UV light with indium gallium nitride to gather light more efficiently,\u201d said\nAbdallah Ougazzaden , director of\nGeorgia Tech Lorraine\nin Metz, France and a professor in Georgia Tech\u2019s\nSchool of Electrical and Computer Engineering\n(ECE). \u201cThe boron nitride layer doesn\u2019t impact the quality of the indium gallium nitride grown on it, and we were able to lift off the InGaN solar cells without cracking them.\u201d\nThe research was published August 15 in the journal\nACS Photonics . It was supported by the French National Research Agency under the GANEX Laboratory of Excellence project and the French PIA project \u201cLorraine Universit\u00e9 d\u2019Excellence.\u201d\nThe technique could lead to production of solar cells with improved efficiency and lower cost for a broad range of terrestrial and space applications. \u201cThis demonstration of transferred InGaN-based solar cells on foreign substrates while increasing performance represents a major advance toward lightweight, low cost, and high efficiency photovoltaic applications,\u201d the researchers wrote in their paper.\n\u201cUsing this technique, we can process InGaN solar cells and put a dielectric layer on the bottom that will collect only the short wavelengths,\u201d Ougazzaden explained. \u201cThe longer wavelengths can pass through it into the bottom cell. By using this approach we can optimize each surface separately.\u201d\nThe researchers began the process by growing monolayers of boron nitride on two-inch sapphire wafers using an MOVPE process at approximately 1,300 degrees Celsius. The boron nitride surface coating is only a few nanometers thick, and produces crystalline structures that have strong planar surface connections, but weak vertical connections.\nThe InGaN attaches to the boron nitride with weak van der Waals forces, allowing the solar cells to be grown across the wafer and removed without damage. So far, the cells have been removed from the sapphire manually, but Ougazzaden believes the transfer process could be automated to drive down the cost of the hybrid cells. \u201cWe can certainly do this on a large scale,\u201d he said.\nThe InGaN structures are then placed onto the glass substrate with a backside reflector and enhanced performance is obtained. Beyond demonstrating placement atop an existing PV structure, the researchers hope to increase the amount of indium in their lift-off devices to boost light absorption and increase the number of quantum wells from five to 40 or 50.\n\u201cWe have now demonstrated all the building blocks, but now we need to grow a real structure with more quantum wells,\u201d Ougazzaden said. \u201cWe are just at the beginning of this new technology application, but it is very exciting.\u201d\nIn addition to Ougazzaden, the research team includes Georgia Tech Ph.D. students Taha Ayari, Matthew Jordan, Xin Li and Saiful Alam; Chris Bishop and Simon Gautier from Institut Lafayette; Suresh Sundaram, a researcher at Georgia Tech Lorraine; Walid El Huni and Yacine Halfaya from CNRS; Paul Voss, an associate professor in the Georgia Tech School of ECE; and Jean Paul Salvestrini, a professor at Georgia Tech Lorraine and adjunct professor in the Georgia Tech School of ECE.\nCITATION : Taha Ayari, et al., \u201cHeterogeneous Integration of Thin-Film InGaN-Based Solar Cells on Foreign Substrates with Enhanced Performance,\u201d (ACS Photonics 2018)\nhttps://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acsphotonics.8b00663\nResearch News\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\n177 North Avenue\nAtlanta, Georgia\u00a0 30332-0181\u00a0 USA\nMedia Relations Contact : John Toon (404-894-6986) (jtoon@gatech.edu).\nWriter : John Toon\nAdditional Images\nContact\nJohn Toon\nResearch News\n(404) 894-6986\nEmail\njtoon@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
