There\u2019s not one community. In my experience, there are a lot of different communities that tend to focus around a particular tool or approach,\u201d he said. Often they meet each other at large events like Moogfest or the Ableton Conference, focused on creativity or learning new technical skills.\nThey also come to the Guthman Musical Instrument Competition at Georgia Tech, for demonstrations in performance and technology innovation.\nThis year, Zicarelli will judge the contest as well as cohost the Music, Art, and Technology Fair.\n\u201cI was fortunate enough to attend [the Guthman Competition] a few years ago, and I still remember and am actively inspired by what I saw,\u201d he said, \u201cin terms of this amazing variety of creative approaches.\u201d\nThe Competition does two important things for music technologists, Zicarelli said. One, it shows that the invention of an instrument is a valid form of creative expression. And two, it provides an opportunity to observe emerging technologies.\n\u201cFor example, Roli came and demonstrated the Seaboard a few years ago at Guthman, and now you can buy that product and have it in your house.\u201d\nThe Intersection of Music Technology and \u2026 Everything\nAs an assistant professor for the Georgia Tech School of Music and a researcher in the Center for Music Technology, Grace Leslie\u2019s work often includes human computer interface, electrical engineering, experimental psychology, and acoustics.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of different things that music technology can be,\u201d she said. \u201cWe professors who have labs in the Center are kind of like a Venn diagram. We do work that\u2019s at the intersection of music technology and other things.\u201d Leslie runs the Brain Lab, where she and her graduate students develop brain-music interfaces and other physiological sensor systems.\nThe ways in which this year\u2019s Guthman Competition instruments cross over into other areas of study and design are especially compelling, she said.\n\u201cThis year we have a lot of really exciting instruments that are designed as assistive technologies,\u201d Leslie said, \u201cto help encourage and inspire people to make music, when traditional musical instruments might not be accessible to them physically.\u201d\n\u201cIt really broadens our horizon [as music technologists] in terms of what musical instruments are, and the kind of innovations that they\u2019re able to bring to our lives. Innovation doesn\u2019t just have to be about creativity and newness or novelty. It can also be about helping people.\u201d\nEven the Guthman Competition\u2019s setting \u2014 hosted by a Georgia Tech school with a uniquely rigorous music technology program \u2014 is valuable for music technologists in terms of sharing ideas.\nBecause music technologists are used to sharing ideas in academic settings and in music venues, Leslie strives to teach her students how to communicate their work to a broader community. She fosters concerts that blend technological demonstrations with compelling musical performances. As an electronic music composer and improviser, Leslie maintains a brain-body performance practice.\nInfluencing the Next Generation of Music Technologists\nAs part of the Guthman Competition festivities, this year the School of Music, Cycling \u201974, and the Atlanta Science Festival are teaming up with Georgia Tech\u2019s Center for Education Integrating Science, Mathematics, and Computing (CEISMC)\nfor a GoSTEAM workshop.\nDesigned for the middle school audience, the workshop will take place prior to the Fair. Students will learn how to use Cycling \u201874\u2019s Max/MSP software to create music. Sabrina Grossman, the science education program director for CEISMC, will help run the event.\n\u201cThere\u2019s so many opportunities with this intersection of music technology and art,\u201d Grossman said. \u201cI think a lot of times, students don\u2019t even know this exists.\u201d\n\u201c[My colleague] has a great quote. When people ask her, \u2018How did you become an engineer?\u2019, she says, \u2018Well, my dad told me I couldn\u2019t major in music.\u2019,\u201d Grossman said. \u201cTen, fifteen years ago, there weren\u2019t many music technology programs in schools.\u201d\nBut through increasingly national reach of programs like EarSketch, students with strong music preferences can envision broader career options, Grossman said.\n\u201cI definitely think that it allows them to think outside the box about music and outside the box of what their future could be in music or computer science.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nExplore the Guthman Competition\n2020 Guthman Competition Finalists\nTickets - Guthman Musical Instrument Competition\nGuthman Musical Instrument Competition\nSchool of Music\nContact\nAnn Hoevel\n404.385.0693\nEmail\nann.hoevel@design.gatech.edu\nAdditional information\nTHE GUTHMAN MUSICAL INSTRUMENT COMPETITION Saturday, March 7, 2020\n7 p.m.\nFerst Center for the Arts\n\u2013 Free Admission \u2013 TICKETS\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
