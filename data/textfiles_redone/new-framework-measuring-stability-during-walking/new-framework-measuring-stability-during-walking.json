While there has been extensive research into the biomechanics of falls, most current approaches study how the legs, joints, and muscles act separately to respond, rather than as a system. The ability to measure how these different levels relate to each other could paint a much clearer picture of why someone falls and precisely how their body compensates. Until recently, however, an integrated measuring approach has been elusive.\nIn newly published research, Pawel Golyski and his Ph.D. advisor\nGregory Sawicki , associate professor of\nmechanical engineering\nand\nbiological sciences\nat Georgia Tech, investigate whether mechanical energy can be used as a \u201ccommon currency\u201d to measure how humans use lower limbs to stabilize during walking.\nTheir research , published in the\nJournal of the Royal Society Interface , lays the groundwork for using mechanical energetics to understand the roles of joints and muscles during unsteady locomotion. The paper also contributed to Golyski\u2019s selection as this year\u2019s recipient of the\nAmerican Society of Biomechanics\u2019\n(ASB)\nPre-Doctoral Achievement Award\n\u2014 a prestigious honor that considers a candidate\u2019s entire portfolio of publications.\nGolyski, a graduating member of Sawicki\u2019s\nPhysiology of Wearable Robotics (PoWeR) Lab , previously worked as a research scientist with individuals with lower-limb amputation at\nWalter Reed National Military Medical Center . For his graduate work at Georgia Tech, his aim was to develop an understanding of how devices and the human body work together, specifically at the intersection of three elements: muscle mechanics, wearable exoskeletons, and stability during walking.\nEach of the three elements relates to the others. Exoskeletons affect a person\u2019s stability while also affecting how their muscles work, and vice versa. But to examine how muscles both interact with exoskeletons and affect stability makes for an interesting challenge, Golyski says. Because, while one can observe how muscle dynamics change with the use of an exoskeleton, how those changes relate to stability is not understood. To understand how all three pillars work together to help humans compensate during a fall, Golyski and Sawicki needed to come up with a new framework to measure stability.\nEnergy Accountants\nThe researchers knew that for a person walking at a steady speed on level ground, the net mechanical energy of the person and each leg over one stride \u2014 from the heel strike of one leg to the next heel strike of that same leg \u2014 is zero. They also knew that energy needed to be equal to mechanical energy at all levels of description of the leg, specifically the joints and muscles.\n\"The idea is that if we can relate stability to a demand in energy, then we can become accountants, and track how the energy \u2014 our currency \u2014 changes at the level of the person, muscle, and exoskeleton,\" Golyski said. \u201cThat provides a really powerful framework to relate all three of those areas.\u201d\nGolyski and Sawicki designed an experiment with a person walking on a treadmill. Using a split-belt treadmill, they applied short, quick disturbances, known as perturbations, in the form of increases in belt speed to one leg during walking. The purpose was to inject or extract energy during a stride, so that they could then measure how the person\u2019s leg and joint energies change.\nFor the experiment they used Georgia Tech\u2019s\nCAREN\n(Computer Assisted Rehabilitation Environment) \u2014 an integrated system used to study stability during movement. It features cameras mounted above a treadmill to track a person\u2019s movement using motion capture markers attached to the person. Using an algorithm designed by Golyski, Sawicki, PoWeR lab Ph.D. student Jennifer Leestma, and a high school mentee, Esmeralda Vazquez, the CAREN can execute perturbations based on a person\u2019s movements \u2014 enabling the researchers to initiate perturbations at specific times in the gait cycle. By combining the force of the treadmill with the positional data collected by the CAREN, Golyski and Sawicki can calculate the changes in energy in a person\u2019s individual joints.\nTheir new framework could assist in determining which part of a person\u2019s body manages responses to destabilizing energy, pointing to specific muscles or joints to target with rehabilitation therapy. It could also open doors to advanced exoskeletons and prostheses that target specific joints to restore stabilizing responses in individuals with impaired balance.\n\u201cThe body of research that Pawel completed during his doctoral studies is nothing short of impressive. He broke new ground by developing new experimental techniques and a new hip exoskeleton assistive device, making first-of-a-kind muscle imaging measurements, and ultimately answering the question of how exoskeletons modify joint and muscle dynamics to influence human walking stability,\u201d Sawicki said. \u201cI was thrilled that Pawel\u2019s outstanding contributions as a scientist-engineer were recognized by ASB, and I\u2019m even more thrilled that he will return to Walter Reed \u2014 his dream job \u2014 to apply his new skillset to help people get from here to there.\u201d\nThis summer, as part of this recognition, Golyski will deliver a research talk during an awards session at the\nNorth American Congress on Biomechanics\nin Ottawa, Ontario. He will also be graduating from Georgia Tech and resuming his work with veterans and active service members at Walter Reed.\nCitation : Golyski, Pawel R. and Gregory S.
