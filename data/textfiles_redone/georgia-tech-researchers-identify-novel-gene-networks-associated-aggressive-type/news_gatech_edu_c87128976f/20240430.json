In recent years, breast cancer treatments have improved significantly, thanks to targeted gene therapy and immunotherapy. However, for the small group of patients diagnosed with the most aggressive basal-like type of breast cancer, such approaches are less successful.\nRecently, scientists in the\u00a0 Georgia Tech Integrated Cancer Research Center (ICRC) \u00a0have found that this particular breast cancer displays a unique interactive gene network structure. Using a type of mathematics called \u201cgraph theory,\u201d which models relationships between a pair of objects, the researchers computationally detected changes in gene-gene interactions as\nthis breast\ncancer occurs and develops.\n\u201cThe discovery of novel gene networks associated with basal-like breast cancers has helped us identify potential new gene targets to treat this very aggressive type of breast cancer,\u201d said\nJohn McDonald , ICRC founding director, professor emeritus in the\nSchool of Biological Sciences , and the study\u2019s corresponding author. \u201cWe would not have discovered these possible treatments through analyses of gene expression alone.\u201d\nWhile causing just 10-20% of breast cancer diagnoses, basal-like breast cancer is much more aggressive than other subtypes \u2014 and if not identified early, when it can be treated by surgery and/or radiation therapy, effective anti-cancer drug treatment can be challenging. The basal-like subtype does not respond to traditional hormonal therapies.\nOne theory\nas\nto why, advocated by many cancer researchers, is that individual genes do not function autonomously; as such, changes in how genes interact with one another in cancer may be as important as the cancer-driving genes themselves.\n\u201cThe components of any complex system, like the human genome, are certainly important,\u201d said McDonald. \u201cThe way in which these independent components interact with one another is also critical.\u201d\nFor this study, the researchers analyzed three major subtypes of breast cancer, with particular emphasis on the most aggressive basal-like subtype.\nThe researchers found that gene-gene interactive networks are quite different in the aggressive basal-like subtype, compared to the more prevalent luminal A and luminal B subtypes.\nMany of the genes comprising these unique networks were found to be involved in functions not previously associated with breast cancer.\nStephen Housley , a neurobiology researcher in the School of Biological Sciences and a co-author on the paper, noted that \u201can unexpected and intriguing result from our study is that neural processes appear to play a prominent role in distinguishing the highly aggressive basal-like tumors from the less aggressive luminal A and luminal B subtypes.\u201d\nIn total, the researchers examined more than 300 million pairs of genes, comparing healthy women to those with breast cancer. Study co-author\nZainab Ashard , a computational biologist who recently worked in McDonald\u2019s lab,\nexplained, \u201cDifferences in the gene network structure between healthy individuals and breast cancer patients allowed us to identify changes in patterns of gene-gene interactions within breast cancer development.\u201d [s1]\nThe team\u2019s results are detailed\u00a0in a new paper,\u00a0\u201c Changes in Gene Network Interactions in Breast Cancer Onset and Development ,\u201d which appeared\nin the April 2024 issue of\nGEN Biotechnology . Based on the results of this study and their\npreviously published analyses of eight other types of cancer , the researchers believe they have established the usefulness of network analysis in identifying potential new candidates for the diagnosis of and targeted gene therapy treatment for breast and other types of cancers.\nIn addition to McDonald, Housley, and Ashard,\nKara Keun Lee , a former bioinformatics Ph.D. student who worked in McDonald\u2019s lab, is also a co-author on the paper.\nThe results shown here are in whole or in part based on data generated by the\nTCGA Research Network.\nThe Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) Project was supported by the Common Fund of the Office of the Director of the National Institutes of Health, and by NCI, NHGRI, NHLBI, NIDA, NIMH, and NINDS.\nThis research was supported by the Mark Light Integrated Cancer Research Center Student Fellowship, the Deborah Nash Endowment Fund, Northside Hospital (Atlanta), and the Ovarian Cancer Institute (Atlanta).\nCitation: \u201cChanges in Gene Network Interactions in Breast Cancer Onset and Development,\u201d Zainab\u00a0Arshad,\u00a0Stephen N.\u00a0Housley,\u00a0Kara Keun\u00a0Lee, and\u00a0John F.\u00a0McDonald, GEN Biotechnology, April 2024,\nDOI:\nhttps://doi.org/10.1089/genbio.2024.0002\nContact\nSavannah Williamson\nResearch Communications\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
