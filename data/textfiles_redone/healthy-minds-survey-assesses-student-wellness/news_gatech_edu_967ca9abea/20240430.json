The Institute is administering this survey, last done here in Spring 2018, to get a better understanding of the mental health of Tech students and to address\u00a0specific needs.\nNationally, the survey was first launched in 2007 and has since been fielded at about 300 colleges and universities, with over 300,000 survey respondents. Past surveys conducted at Georgia Tech have shown\u00a0that approximately 30% of students are experiencing at least one significant mental health problem, such as depression, anxiety disorders, suicidal thoughts, self-injury, or symptoms of eating disorders. Having updated results from HMS will increase awareness of student mental health and provide an opportunity to expand programs and services.\nStudents are encouraged to complete the survey to help in these efforts. Check out the link below for a 1-minute HMS video:\nHMS Video\nStudents can also look forward to the release of the National Survey of Student Engagement\u00a0in late February, which will examine the student experience inside and outside the classroom. All surveys administered to our students seek to identify\u00a0areas for\u00a0improvement in Georgia Tech\u2019s practices and policies.\nStudents who received the invitation for participation in the Healthy Minds Study\u00a0have until Feb.\u00a07 to complete it.
