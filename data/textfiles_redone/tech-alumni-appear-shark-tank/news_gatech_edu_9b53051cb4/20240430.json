He was looking for a seamless way to capture detailed workout data without having to write it down, which is how Metric Mate was born.\nMetric Mate makes devices that, when coupled to pin-based and plate-loaded exercise equipment, send data to mobile phones, turning strength training equipment into smart equipment and allowing users to automatically count reps and sets while also tracking caloric burn, force exertion, muscular fatigue, and rep tempo. In addition, it gives healthcare workers the ability to monitor fitness in patients.\nDavis, along with Ecleamus Ricks and their business partner, M.T. Strickland, have been working on Metric Mate ever since 2019. And this week, they will be showcasing their patented Training Accountability Partner (TAP) device and Metric Mate mobile app on the popular television show\nShark Tank .\nBoth Davis and Ricks earned bachelor\u2019s degrees in electrical engineering through the dual degree program at Georgia Tech and Morehouse College. After graduating, Davis went on to get his law degree from Georgia State University with a focus on intellectual property. Ricks moved to Texas to work for National Instruments and earn his master\u2019s in software engineering from the University of Texas at Austin.\nWithin the Metric Mate team, Davis focuses mainly on strategy, intellectual property, and legal. Ricks works on all things technology, and Strickland, the CEO, is responsible for marketing and driving revenue.\n\u201cHandling the hardware and understanding it is one of the benefits of Georgia Tech that we now have \u2014 the ability to draw on those things you learned in college to create something new,\u201d Ricks says.\nNext, they will be exploring ways for their patented technology to help with physical therapy, and they are always working on new features and improving the accuracy of the platform.\nSee\nMetric Mate\nfeatured Friday, Jan. 13, on ABC\u2019s\nShark Tank .\nAdditional Images\nContact\nEvan Atkinson , Institute Social Media Officer\nEmail\neatkinson6@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
