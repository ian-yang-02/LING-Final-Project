The Coalition for Access, Affordability, and Success is committed to making college more affordable and accessible for students from diverse backgrounds and to helping students earn degrees. Over the next few months, the Coalition will develop tools and processes intended to address many of the barriers that prevent students from attending college or successfully earning a degree. The Coalition, which was announced Monday, is developing a free platform of online tools to streamline planning for and applying to college. The first phase of tools will be available to high school freshmen, sophomores and juniors beginning in January 2016. In creating this platform, members hope to motivate a stronger college-going mindset among students of all backgrounds, especially those from low-income families and underrepresented groups who have historically had less access to leading colleges. \"Georgia Tech is committed to promoting college access for all students, and participation in the Coalition for Access, Affordability, and Success\u00a0is a positive step in pursuit of that goal,\" said Rick Clark, director of Undergraduate Admission at Georgia Tech. \"Additionally, we believe this platform will reduce unnecessary stress, help students and their families identify excellent college options, and put their best foot forward in the college admission process.\u201d \u00a0 That stress can create barriers for students, most notably for those who are the first in their families to attend college. The Coalition hopes to address these challenges through its free online tools and increased transparency around admissions and financial aid. Later this year, the Coalition will share details about new college planning and application tools that will streamline admission and financial aid processes, which will allow students to begin planning for college much earlier in their high school years. The online tools \u2013 which will include a digital portfolio, a collaboration platform, and an application portal \u2013 will make students more familiar with the application process and give everyone the same opportunities for college success.
