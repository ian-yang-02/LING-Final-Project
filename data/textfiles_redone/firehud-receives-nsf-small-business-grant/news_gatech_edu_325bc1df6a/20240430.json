Georgia Tech graduates started the company to protect first responders.\nFeb 07, 2018\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nRecent Georgia Tech graduates received a National Science Foundation (NSF) grant to continue working on a device to improve the safety of firefighters.\nTheir device,\nFireHUD , received an NSF Small Business Innovation Research ( SBIR ) grant for $224,143 to conduct research and development work on a biometric Internet of Things system for first responders.\nZack Braun, who graduated in December with a degree in computer engineering, and Tyler Sisk, a fellow December graduate with a degree in electrical engineering, invented FireHUD. The real-time wearable system and heads up display provides biometric and environmental data to firefighters on the job and officials on site. The device measures heart rate, body temperature and external temperatures that can help predict fatigue and prevent injuries.\nFireHUD won the\n2016 InVenture Prize , an annual Georgia Tech innovation competition for undergraduate students. Braun and Sisk also participated in\nCREATE-X , a series of initiatives to enhance and support entrepreneurship programs among Tech students.\nAnother Georgia Tech graduate, Joseph Boettcher, also joined the company. All three are working on the device full-time.\nThe NSF grant will fund the company for a full year, said Braun, FireHUD CEO. Next month they plan to launch pilot studies with local fire departments and hope to deploy about 25 units.\nBraun said the company has three main goals to accomplish with the NSF award, including the\u00a0research and development of a rugged wearable system that will monitor the physiology of firefighters in real-time and the development of a machine learning algorithm to identify key markers that will indicate the exertion and stamina levels of first responders in chaotic environments. They will also work to develop a long-range radio system capable of transmission within large urban structures.\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nGeorgia Tech's InVenture Prize\nCREATE-X\nContact\nLaura Diamond\nMedia Relations\u00a0 laura.diamond@gatech.edu\n404-660-2927\nEmail\nlaura.diamond@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
