The findings could help guide the design of microgel-based applications with unique and useful properties.\n\u201cWe wanted to understand broadly what happens to these particles if you put them together and start compressing them,\u201d said\nAlexander Alexeev , professor and Anderer Faculty Fellow in Georgia Tech\u2019s\nGeorge W. Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering . \u201cUnlike rigid particles that fill the available space and then stop compressing, these particles have multiple processes that can work in parallel inside the suspension. Microgels can change shape, shrink, and penetrate one another. We found that these processes play a varying role when you increase the particle number density and compress them enough.\u201d\nFindings of the study were reported October 19 in the journal\nProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences . The research was supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the MCIU/AEI/FEDER EU, and simulations utilized the NSF\u2019s Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment.\nUsing mesoscale computer simulations, the researchers studied the behavior of compressed suspensions consisting of shape-shifting microgels with different architectures at a variety of packing fractions and solvent conditions. They found that under compression, the \u201cfluffy\u201d microgels \u2014 which resemble microscopic sponges with polymer threads extending from them \u2014 change shape and shrink, with limited interpenetration among particles.\n\u201cYou can use their softness and the fact that they change shape to pack them even more,\u201d said\nAlberto Fernandez-Nieves , ICREA Professor in the Department of Condensed Matter Physics at the University of Barcelona and adjunct professor in Georgia Tech\u2019s\nSchool of Physics . \u201cThere are a variety of mechanisms to pack them into an available volume, and these mechanisms may play a different role depending on the situation. Until this study, we didn\u2019t quite know how the microgels could be packed together beyond random close packing.\u201d\nTheir ability to release solvent allows the microgels to shrink and deform, unlike hard particles in regular colloidal suspensions. In addition, the polymer threads allow them to interpenetrate and overlap to pack more particles into a given space. The microgel particles range in size from 50 nanometers up to as much as 10 microns in diameter. In their simulations, Alexeev, Fernandez-Nieves, and recent Ph.D. graduate Svetoslav Nikolov studied suspensions containing about a hundred microgel particles.\n\u201cTheir compressibility is a new ingredient that is not present in other soft particles, and it can bring about the fascinating and unique aspects of these microgel systems,\u201d said Fernandez-Nieves. \u201cThis study gives us information we need to exploit this softness to achieve things we wouldn\u2019t be able to do otherwise.\u201d\nThe simulations provided information about the effects of variables such as solvent type and degree of compression on the mechanical properties of the microgels in the suspension.\n\u201cIf you look at the mechanical properties of the suspension in different solvents, you see the curves are very different,\u201d Alexeev said. \u201cIf they are swollen, they are fluffy and can move around in the suspension. If they expel solvent, they can become almost dry, so the mechanical properties can change dramatically. What we found is surprising and not at all what people expected.\u201d\nAmong the key fundamental findings is that the mechanical properties of the suspension can be quantified in terms of the single microgel bulk modulus. \u201cIt is how these particles compress that determines the material properties of the whole suspension when it is sufficiently concentrated,\u201d Fernandez-Nieves said.\n\u201cYou can have many different kinds of behavior, but when you scale all the behaviors by the actual compressibility of one microgel, all the behaviors come together,\u201d he added. \u201cThat means this quantity seems to be the important one to consider to understand the macroscopic properties of the suspension.\u201d\nThe researchers used the NSF\u2019s\nExtreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment\nto simulate the microgel systems. While the behavior of ordinary particle-based systems might seem straightforward to study, the compressibility of the microgels coupled with the complexity of the polymer crosslinking made the simulation quite large, Alexeev noted.\n\u201cA single particle is already a quite complicated system,\u201d he said. \u201cThe computational complexity provided findings that we hope will encourage experimentalists to further explore what these unique systems can do.\u201d\nThis research was supported by the NSF Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Award DMR-1255288, the MCIU/AEI/FEDER, EU (Grant PGC2018-336 097842-B-I00), and NSF Graduate Research Fellowship DGE-1650044.
