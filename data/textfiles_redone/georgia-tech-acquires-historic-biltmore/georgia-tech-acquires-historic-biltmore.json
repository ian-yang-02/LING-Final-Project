(GTF) has reached an agreement to purchase the historic Biltmore on West Peachtree Street in Midtown Atlanta from an affiliate of Novare Group for an undisclosed price.\n\u201cThe Biltmore is\u00a0already a vibrant\u00a0component of what the Georgia Tech Foundation, the Institute and its partners have previously built in creating the innovation neighborhood of Technology Square,\u201d said Gary T. Jones, chairman of the Georgia Tech Foundation. \u201cThis simply strengthens what is one of the country\u2019s most energetic technology ecosystems and is a wonderful example of the connections and collaborations between startups, business leaders and Georgia Tech faculty, students and researchers. It\u2019s a great honor for the Georgia Tech Foundation to own this well-known Midtown landmark and to continue to\u00a0be a part of Technology Square\u00a0as it serves as\u00a0a magnet for Georgia\u2019s entrepreneurial community.\u201d\n\u201cFor many years, the Biltmore has served as the historic anchor in Midtown Atlanta,\u201d said G.P. \u201cBud\u201d Peterson, president of the Georgia Institute of Technology. \u201cWhen you cross the Fifth Street bridge connecting\u00a0our\u00a0main campus with Tech Square, it is the first thing you see. We are proud to be able to incorporate it as a part of Georgia Tech.\u00a0The acquisition of the Biltmore, combined with the state\u2019s generous support of\u00a0our business incubator program, the Advanced Technology Development Center (ATDC), positions Georgia Tech to further expand the number of companies we serve. We look forward to integrating this iconic structure into our growing entrepreneurial ecosystem, where it will help us accommodate additional innovation centers and startups that want to take advantage of the energy, expertise and technologies at Georgia Tech, as well as the collaborative spirit in one of the South\u2019s most thriving innovation neighborhoods.\u201d\n\u201cIt has been a privilege to restore and operate this Atlanta icon, and we are proud of the work done in preserving a landmark for the community and creating a premier creative office and elegant event space,\u201d said Jim Borders, president, Novare Group. \u201cWith the building effectively 100 percent occupied, the timing was right to bring The Biltmore to market. We had significant interest from several qualified groups, and we are very pleased that Georgia Tech will carry the flag into the future.\u201d\nWilliam Candler, son of Coca-Cola magnate Asa Candler, was the local financier behind the Biltmore project, purchasing the land for the hotel in 1921 with his proceeds of the sale of the Coca-Cola Company and incorporating the Atlanta Biltmore Hotel Company in conjunction with the New York-based Biltmore hotel chain. The Atlanta Biltmore opened in 1924 and served as the cultural and social center of Atlanta for decades. The Biltmore fell into disrepair in the 1980s when it was closed for a failed conversion into apartments.\u00a0 Novare purchased the property in January of 1998 and adapted the building into loft office space, and the elegant ballrooms that were a part of the original Biltmore were restored to their former glory.\nThe building, which has approximately 290,000 square feet of loft office, retail and ballroom space, is directly across West Peachtree Street from Technology Square, a multi-block part of the Georgia Tech campus that is home to the Scheller College of Business, the Georgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center, the Georgia Tech Global Learning Center, the Advanced Technology Development Center and the to-be-developed High Performance Computing Center, now known as \u201cCoda.\u201d The Georgia Tech Foundation has worked with Georgia Tech over the past 15 years to develop Technology Square.\nThe Biltmore is occupied predominantly by engineering firms, energy companies and late-stage technology startups. The largest tenants are Pindrop, SouthStar Energy Services and Kimley-Horn and Associates. The acquisition does not include the Biltmore Residences, which are privately owned condominiums.\n\u201cThe purchase of this property will not affect the historical status of the building,\u201d said Al Trujillo, president of the GTF. \u201cWe will continue the legacy of appropriate financial and operational stewardship of this remarkable treasure.\u201d\nJay O\u2019Meara of CBRE marketed The Biltmore on behalf of Novare Group.\nUpdate : The sale of The Biltmore to the Georgia Tech Foundation was completed on October 5, 2016.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nLaura Diamond\nMedia Relations, Institute Communications\n404-894-6016\n@LauraRDiamond\nEmail\nlaura.diamond@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
