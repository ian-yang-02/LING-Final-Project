They can perform jaw-dropping feats of life and death. But there's one trick that digital denizens haven\u2019t quite yet mastered: getting dressed and putting their pants on one leg at a time. Research from the Georgia Institute of Technology has produced a systematic tool that allows animators to create realistic motion for virtual humans who are getting dressed. The new algorithm enables virtual characters to intelligently manipulate simulated cloth to achieve the task of dressing with different dressing styles for various types of garment and fabric. The discovery will help today's computer animators create scenes similar to live-action movies with iconic clothing, such as the \u201cjacket on, jacket off\u201d drill in 2010\u2019s \u201cThe Karate Kid\u201d or Spiderman pulling his mask over his head for the first time. Such dressing scenes are noticeably absent in computer animated films due to the difficulty of manipulating simulated cloth.\u00a0 The research team\u2019s long-term goal is to develop assistive technologies that would enable robots of the future\u00a0to help disabled or elderly adults with self care, such as getting dressed. \u201cDressing is one of the activities of daily living that the health care community has identified as being important for independent living,\u201d says Karen Liu, researcher on the paper and associate professor in the School of Interactive Computing. \u201cThe challenge of learning to dress at a young age or for some older adults and those with disabilities is mainly due to the combined difficulty in coordinating different body parts and manipulating soft and deformable objects.\u201d \u201c Animating Human Dressing \u201d is a technical paper at SIGGRAPH 2015, the ACM conference on Computer Graphics and Interactive Techniques, Aug. 9-13 in Los Angeles.\nContact\nJoshua Preston\nCommunications Officer GVU Center 678-231-0787\nEmail\njpreston@cc.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
