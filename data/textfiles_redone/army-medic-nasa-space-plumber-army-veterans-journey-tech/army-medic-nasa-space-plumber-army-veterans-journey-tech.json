In his seven years in the Army, Crisostomo often found himself fiddling with medical devices and thinking about how designs could be improved for the medics to use more effectively.\n\u201cI remember being on medical calls and messing with the equipment,\u201d recalled Crisostomo. \u201cI\u2019d be thinking, who designed this? It doesn\u2019t do what we need it to. This was made by someone who only\u00a0 thinks\u00a0 they know what we do.\u201d\nSo, when his time in the Army ended, Crisostomo was set on pursuing this found interest in engineering. He enrolled at Georgia Southern University to complete his core classes, but Georgia Tech was always his end goal for its reputation in the engineering field.\nAfter a year, he transferred to Tech as a mechanical engineering major via the\u00a0 Veterans Transfer Pathway , a program that assists veterans who have completed active duty within the past five years gain admission into Tech.\nCrisostomo has now been at Tech for two years and rotates between semesters of classes and working as a NASA Pathways intern. In his role at NASA, he works as a cryogenics propulsion specialist on the Artemis Project, a job that others in the unit fondly describe as a \u201cspace plumber.\u201d\n\u201cI make sure that all the valves and pumps involved with fuel delivery work correctly,\u201d Crisostomo explained, \u201cessentially making sure that fuel can get to the rocket\u2019s engines so that it actually gets up into the air.\u201d\nThe position has been enlightening for Crisostomo, especially when it comes to understanding the breadth of the field of engineering and where it can take him.\n\u201cI would love to help Army medics, and the more I think about it, the more I think I might want to follow that path,\u201d he said, \u201cwhether that be with Army Medical Research or companies that interface with those products.\u201d\nAside from attributing the inspiration for his engineering pursuits to his military experience, Crisostomo also credits it with helping him tackle the academic rigor of his Tech coursework.\n\u201cMy time in the Army gave me the ability to know that I can do hard things,\u201d he said. \u201cThe military gives you a lot of soft skills that help you frame problems and have a system for approaching a solution. Also, it teaches you how to operate in nearly any environment.\u201d\nTo learn more about Georgia Tech resources for veterans, visit the\u00a0 Veterans Services page \u00a0and the\u00a0 Veterans Resources Center .\nAdditional Images\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
