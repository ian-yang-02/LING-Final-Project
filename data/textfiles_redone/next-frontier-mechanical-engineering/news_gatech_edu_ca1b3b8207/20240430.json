Also known as unmanned aerial vehicles, drones today have practical applications, like delivering packages for Amazon or allowing realtors to take aerial video to show off a sale property.\nTo date, there is usually a weight limit on how much a drone can carry, restricting its usefulness. But Jonathan Rogers, assistant professor at the George W. Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering, is trying to change that. He is designing, building and programming robotic drones that can link up and carry larger, heavier objects as a unit\n\u201cIn my lab, we are working with multiple drones that lift and fly packages together,\u201d said Rogers. \u201cThis involves distributing heavy lift capabilities into a number of small drone units that can then organize themselves to pick the object up.\u201d\nWith exceptional portability, unobtrusive size and remote control, drones are ideal for situations that are dangerous for humans. Rogers has designed the world\u2019s first heavy lift small drones \u2013 robots that can work together to lift and evacuate wounded soldiers from the battlefield or civilians from a disaster area. Theoretically, three to four man-portable robots fly out together, connect to the person, and lift them 500 yards out of harm\u2019s way.\nEach drone has eight large propellers and can fold up into a backpack for portability. The drone can lift a 65 pound object, and with three or four drones working together, a human can be lifted. Rogers explains that it\u2019s all about thrust density, a term he invented.\n\u201cDetermining how much thrust you can pack into a small area is important when you are using multiple vehicles to lift a specific object,\u201d said Rogers. \u201cWhen you pack a large amount of thrust into a small object, the laws of physics work against you, so you need more power. That\u2019s why we only fly the soldiers about 500 yards away after they are lifted from the battlefield.\u201d\nThe drones Rogers works on are part of a new field called cooperative flight control, where multiple drones connect to an object that they know very little about and move it in a stable way. Rogers has named these drones \u201cmodular vertical lift robots,\u201d and they also have useful implications for package delivery.\nCurrently, Rogers and his team are working on a funded project with the Georgia Tech Research Institute (GTRI) to test multiple vertical lift robots that connect up to deliver supplies. The robots are programed to take into account flexible logistics by connecting to the object (payload) and determining its weight and size and how to move it in a stable way. The small robots work together as a team, known as multi agent control.\n\u201cRight now we are most concerned with ensuring the robots fly in a stable way once they analyze the payload and mass center,\u201d said Rogers. \u201cWe are calling this autonomous flightworthiness determination (AFWD), and it\u2019s a topic in the field that no one else has explored.\u201d\nA major challenge for AFWD and cooperative flight control is determining how the drones are going to attach to the payload. Rogers has developed a docking apparatus, so the robot vehicles can attach to the object. When a flexible payload, like a human, doesn\u2019t have docks, Rogers is looking into using manipulators with soft gripper technology on the robots. Then the robots will have a flexible way of grasping the human.\nIn the next 20 to 30 years, Rogers predicts that mobile robots moving together will be employed in everyday situations. But a key hurdle remains \u2013 normalizing the technology to ensure it is compatible with and trusted by humans.\n\u201cI am really invested in creating new mechanisms and autonomy algorithms that allow robots to serve a beneficial purpose in society,\u201d said Rogers. \u201cThe modular vehicle lift robot that can operate during disaster situations is a great example of the type of technology that can benefit people. Also, the drone docks we are designing will be a key piece of equipment that hundreds of companies can use to do their jobs better. Making an impact on society is really our goal.\u201d\nRogers hopes to start lifting objects this summer.\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nTarzan Robot: The Future of Farming\nJonathan Rogers' Lab\nContact\nGeorgia Parmelee\nCollege of Engineering\n404-385-0181\ngeorgia.parmelee@coe.gatech.edu\nEmail\ngeorgia.parmelee@coe.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
