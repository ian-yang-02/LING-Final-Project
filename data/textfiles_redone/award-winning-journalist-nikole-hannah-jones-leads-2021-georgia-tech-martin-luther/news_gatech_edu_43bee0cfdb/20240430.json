Many of the events are held in collaboration with Atlanta\u2019s\u00a0Martin Luther King Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change,\u00a0a resource center and community institution established in 1968 by King\u2019s widow, Coretta Scott King.\nHannah-Jones covers racial injustice for\u00a0 The New York Times\nand has spent years chronicling the way official policy has created \u2014 and maintains \u2014 racial segregation in housing and schools.\u00a0She has written extensively on the history of racism, school resegregation, and the disarray of hundreds of desegregation orders. She is a 2017 MacArthur fellow and has also won a Peabody Award, two George Polk Awards, and is a three-time National Magazine Award winner.\n\u201cIt's hard for me to ever really say what the true genesis of \u2018The 1619 Project\u2019 was,\u201d Hannah-Jones said during the discussion with IDEI\u2019s Vice President Archie Ervin and Executive Director of Staff Diversity, Inclusion, and Engagement Pearl Alexander. \u201cI feel like my work, and my career, and my academic trajectory had been working towards the moment where I pitched the project. I talk about being a high school student and my Black studies teacher giving me a book about the Mayflower. All those years of my education no one mentioned the White Lion,\u201d the English ship that brought the first African slaves to Virginia in 1619. \u201cI really spent a lot of my career trying to show that the legacy of slavery and anti-Blackness has shaped so many of the institutions we see in this country and we render it invisible. I wanted to show that nothing about American life has been untouched by the legacy of slavery.\u201d\n\u201cThe 1619 Project\u201d is an ongoing initiative that began in August 2019, the 400 th\nanniversary of American slavery. The first edition included 10 essays from Black writers and activists, a photo essay, and a collection of poems and fiction by an additional 16 writers. The project later grew to include live events and a podcast. Essays include \u201cHow False Beliefs in Physical Racial Difference Still Live in Medicine Today,\u201d by Linda Villarosa and \u201cWhat Does a Traffic Jam in Atlanta Have to do With Segregation? Quite A Lot,\u201d by Kevin M. Kruse.\n\u201cWe didn't go and do our own original historical research. We didn't unearth truths that were not known before,\u201d Hannah-Jones said. \u201cWe intentionally said we are going to tell the story of America through the lens of slavery. We are going to shift from the exceptionalism. The role of history in this country has been in service of exceptionality \u2014 in service of the idea that we were the most liberatory country ever created. We were a country of those ideals, but we were also a country of the practice of slavery.\u201d\nGeorgia Tech President \u00c1ngel Cabrera offered closing remarks after Hannah-Jones\u2019 discussion, saying, \u201cAs a new American myself, as an American by choice, I am fascinated by the founding narrative of the American republic.\n\u201cThe leading role that Black Americans have played in this country\u2019s journey has been essential for all of us,\u201d he continued. \u201cI invite every member of our community to go to \u2018The 1619 Project\u2019 website. Dig in, read, and challenge your thinking. Come together as a community, and think about how we can make our community at Georgia Tech better \u2014 and how we can contribute to making true on the American promise.\u201d\nTo learn more about the 2021 Georgia Tech Martin Luther King Jr. commemorative event series, visit:\nhttps://diversity.gatech.edu/mlk-celebration .\nAdditional Images\nContact\nCourtney Hill\nCommunications Manager\nInstitute Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion\ncourtney.hill@gatech.edu\nEmail\ncourtney.hill@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
