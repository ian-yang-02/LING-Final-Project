Much of that information is useful to commercial and academic institutions, which now can usually access this publicly generated data from agency servers at no charge.\nAs the volume of data continues to expand, however, many agencies are considering the use of commercial cloud services to help store and make it available to users. While agencies may have different strategies, these new partnerships could result in user fees levied on downloads and analyses performed on the data while it remains in the cloud.\nWriting in a policy forum article published February 8 in the journal\nScience , a Georgia Institute of Technology space policy researcher who studies such data use urges caution about the design of these commercial cloud partnerships and possible imposition of user fees.\n\u201cUnder the current system, free and open government data is used by scientists to conduct research, by entrepreneurs to create new businesses, and by citizens and other organizations to promote government transparency,\u201d said\nMariel Borowitz , an assistant professor in Georgia Tech\u2019s\nSam Nunn School of International Affairs . \u201cIf users must pay fees to download or analyze the data, this will decrease the ability of these users to access and work with data. Past experience suggest that the impacts of this decrease in data use could be large \u2013 both for individual users and for society as a whole.\u201d\nMoving data to commercial cloud systems would likely provide broader access and more efficient analysis options, but she cautions those advantages could be offset by the cost, particularly for organizations with small budgets.\n\u201cAgencies risk losing some of the benefits of this transition by not budgeting for the costs associated with data downloads and analysis, up to a reasonable level,\u201d Borowitz said. \u201cMany who would be interested in using the data may not be able to pay the associated fees. Researchers, nonprofit organizations and others who do not directly profit from the use of this data are most likely to be affected.\u201d\nBorowitz recently spent two years at NASA and witnessed both the development of systems that will dramatically increase data collection and debates about future data storage. She recently authored a book,\nOpen Space: The Global Effort for Open Access to Environmental Satellite Data , published by MIT Press.\nShe would like to see the agencies that provide data continue to shoulder the costs, up to some \u201creasonable level,\u201d to ensure that the data continues to be readily available to all users. As an alternative to commercial services, some agencies are considering development of their own, custom-built cloud solutions, and will have to weigh the cost of benefits of the different options. There will also be technical, organizational and policy issues to consider.\n\u201cAgencies are taking seriously issues of security and long-term preservation of data,\u201d Borowitz added. \u201cWhen working with commercial providers, some are concerned about the possibility of getting \u2018locked in\u2019 to one provider, due to the large costs of migrating data from one system to another. It is possible that costs and capabilities could change over time. On the other hand, commercial cloud providers have large workforces and extensive infrastructure that allow them to provide services and capabilities well beyond what any one agency would be able to maintain.\u201d\nBorowitz notes that most agencies have not made final decisions about their cloud-based programs, so there should be adequate time to work through these issues.\n\u201cMost agencies that make data publicly available, particularly science agencies, are already discussing and/or beginning to make the transition to cloud systems,\u201d she said. \u201cHowever, these programs \u2013 at agencies like NSF, NIH, NASA and NOAA \u2013 are still in their early phases, and there is still opportunity for feedback to be provided and adjustments to the programs to be made.\u201d\nThe existence of fees for access to government data is not without precedent, but Borowitz argues that past experience suggests that user fees result in significantly less use. Before Landsat data \u2013 satellite imagery of Earth \u2013 was made freely available in 2008, no more than 25,000 images a year were purchased from the collection. \u201cWithin a few years of implementing the free and open data policy, the government was distributing 250,000 images a month,\u201d she said.\nThat number provides a suggestion of what the often cash-strapped agencies are dealing with. According to the paper, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) houses more than 100 petabytes (PB) of data and generates more than 30 PB per year from satellites, radars, computer models and other sources. NASA projects that its archive will grow to 250 PB by 2025. And the amount of genomic data at the National Institutes of Health is growing exponentially.\nA petabyte is 1,024 terabytes, or a million gigabytes. A gigabyte is 1,024 megabtyes. For scale, an average photograph taken by a high-end cell phone camera can be in the neighborhood of 10 megabytes. Laptop computers may be able to store as much as a few terabytes of data.\nBorowitz sees the transition to cloud computing as both an opportunity and a challenge for the future availability of government data. \u201cThe decisions being made right now about the structure of these programs have the potential to significantly impact researchers and society as a whole, so it is important to raise awareness and increase engagement on these issues.\u201d\nCITATION : Mariel Borowitz, \u201cGovernment data, commercial cloud: Will public access suffer?\u201d ( Science , 2019)\u00a0 http://science.sciencemag.org/content/363/6427/588\nResearch News\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\n177 North Avenue\nAtlanta, Georgia\u00a0 30332-0181\u00a0 USA\nMedia Relations Contact : John Toon (404-894-6986) (jtoon@gatech.edu).\nWriter : John Toon\nAdditional Images\nContact\nJohn Toon\nResearch News\n(404) 894-6986\nEmail\njtoon@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
