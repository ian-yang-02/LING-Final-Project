Wayne Johnson is chief executive and executive managing officer of First Perfomance Global, a startup financial technology company in the Select program of Georgia Tech's Advanced Technology Development Center.\nMay 04, 2015\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nMasterCard, the global payments network, has taken an ownership stake in First Performance Global, a technology startup at the Advanced Technology Development Center (ATDC). Terms of the agreement were not disclosed, but it further expands First Performance\u2019s global extension of a license for MasterCard\u2019s proprietary MasterCard In Control technology. As a result, the two companies will collaborate on growing First Performance\u2019s ability to offer payment card issuers and processors self-service tools for cardholders. First Performance\u2019s technology gives consumers more control with the security surrounding their credit, debit, and other payment cards. Cardholders can define whether or not a card may be used at an ATM, online, via mail order or telephone order, in a bricks and mortar store, or even a specific geographic location, for example. Corporate comptrollers can limit how much and where employees use their company credit cards. \u201cThe way people shop and pay is continually changing through new technologies,\u201d said Geoff Iddison, executive vice president, strategic partnerships, MasterCard. \u201cSolutions like these complement platforms like MasterPass and EMV in delivering cardholders both a better shopping experience and peace of mind in the protection of their accounts.\u201d Since 2014, First Performance has used the MasterCard license to design and develop its platform, providing cardholders the ability to personally make decisions about when to \u201cturn on\u201d and \u201cturn off\u201d their credit and debit cards. It also allows them to activate loyalty programs and control where and how their cards can be used through a simple, easy-to-use GogoNogo mobile app. \u201cWe have enjoyed a great relationship with MasterCard,\u201d said A. Wayne Johnson, First Performance\u2019s CEO and executive managing director. \u201cThe expansion of our intellectual property relationship on a global basis is an exciting opportunity for our company.\u201d First Performance joined ATDC\u2019s highly competitive Select program in 2015.
