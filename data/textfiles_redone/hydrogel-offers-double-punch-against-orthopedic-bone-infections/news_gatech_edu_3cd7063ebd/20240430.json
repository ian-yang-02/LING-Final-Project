Now, researchers have a developed a double-duty hydrogel that both attacks the bacteria and encourages bone regrowth with a single application containing two active components.\nThe injectable hydrogel, which is a network of cross-linked polymer chains, contains the enzyme lysostaphin and the bone-regenerating protein BMP-2. In a new study using a small animal model, researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology showed significant reduction in an infection caused by\nStaphylococcus aureus\n\u2013 a common infection in orthopedic surgery \u2013 along with regeneration within large bone defects.\n\u201cTreatment for bone infections now often requires two surgeries to both eliminate the infection and heal the injured bone,\u201d said\nAndr\u00e9s J. Garc\u00eda , executive director of the\nParker H. Petit Institute for Bioengineering & Bioscience\nat the Georgia Institute of Technology. \u201cOur idea was to develop a bifunctional material that does both things in a single step. That would be better for the patient, cost less and reduce hospitalization time. We have shown that we can engineer the hydrogel to control the delivery and release of both the antimicrobial enzyme and the regenerative protein.\u201d\nThe hydrogel-based therapy could be used to treat established bone infections, and as a prophylactic during surgery to prevent infection. The study, funded by the National Institutes of Health, was reported May 17 in the journal\nScience Advances .\nBone infections today are often treated with systemic antibiotics and surgery to clean the injury. If the infection occurs with implants, they often must be removed. Once the infection is gone, additional surgery may be required to implant proteins that stimulate bone regrowth and restore the implant. And the dead bacteria can prompt a harmful inflammatory reaction.\nGarc\u00eda and his collaborators \u2013 including first author Christopher Johnson \u2013 chose lysostaphin, an enzyme that kills the bacteria by cleaving cell walls without generating inflammation. The enzyme keeps working within the hydrogel after it polymerizes.\n\u201cWith this strategy, we can get rid of the bacteria in such a way that the body re-establishes a normal inflammatory environment that allows the bone to heal,\u201d Garc\u00eda said. \u201cUse of lysostaphin has been limited by poor stability inside the body, but in the gel, it can maintain stability for at least two weeks. That allows for controlled release over a longer period of time, which is sufficient for what we are trying to do.\u201d\nBeyond treating infections, the new technique might be used to prevent infection during surgery. For instance, if a screw was being inserted to repair an injury, the hydrogel might be applied to the screw threads. The soft gel would not affect the repair.\nThe next step in the research would be to repeat the study in large animals, after which clinical trials could be considered if the material proves promising.\n\u201cThe mechanisms used\u00a0to fight off infection depends on the species,\u201d Garcia noted. \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s so important to repeat the studies in a large animal after testing in mice or rats. Showing efficacy in a large animal model would be a key step toward human trials.\u201d\nThe hydrogel material has been used in the human body before, and is designed to quickly leave the treatment site. \u201cThe hydrogel breaks down into small building blocks that are excreted in the urine,\u201d Garcia said. \u201cAfter several weeks, there is no synthetic material left in the body and it is replaced by normal healing tissue.\u201d\nIn addition to those already named, co-authors on the paper included Mary Caitlin P.
