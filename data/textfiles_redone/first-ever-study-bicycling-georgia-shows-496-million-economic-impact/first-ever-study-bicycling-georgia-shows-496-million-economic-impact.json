The project\u00a0is the first-ever economic analysis of the industry in the state.\n\"Biking is usually promoted as an environmentally friendly and a healthy means of transport, but this report is putting the focus on the economics of it,\" said\nShatakshee Dhongde , an associate professor\u00a0in the Georgia Tech\u00a0 School of Economics . \"Now we can see this activity is having such a big impact on Georgia's economy that we should be paying more attention to it, giving more dollars for investments into these types of alternative transport modes.\"\nTo complete the study, Dhongde collected data on three economic activities over the last\u00a0five\u00a0years: the sales revenue and employment records of more than 700 bicycling businesses, the construction and maintenance costs of more than 80 bike trails, and the budget, participants, and employees of more than 60 events and 30 bicycling organizations in the state of Georgia.\nHer analysis shows that Georgia\u2019s biking industry has a total annual impact of more than $496 million and employs 4,529 people. Breaking down these numbers reveals that bicycle-related businesses generated $361 million, trail construction created $124 million, and events and organizations accounted for $10 million.\n\u201cGeorgia DOT recognizes the impact the bicycling community has on our state and has worked diligently to support\u00a0cyclist safety programs, the development of multi-use trails and\u00a0partnered with organizations\u00a0such as Georgia Bikes\u00a0and the Atlanta Bicycle Coalition\u00a0in an effort to promote safe cycling,\u201d said Andrew Heath, state\u00a0traffic engineer at Georgia DOT. \u201cWith the impressive economic\u00a0impact\u00a0the biking industry has on Georgia, we anticipate more growth over the coming years and looking forward to supporting it\u00a0as best we can.\u201d\nBicycle-related businesses and trail construction each account for about 2,000 jobs in the state, while events and organizations employ another 455 people. In addition, biking in Georgia generated $34 million in annual tax revenue, netting $12 million for local and state economies.\n\"Even with the limited data and the limited three aspects that we looked into, we could see a significant economic impact,\" said Dhongde. \"But I would say this is a very conservative estimate. If people build on this going forward, we will be able to measure a much larger impact.\"\nDhongde also saw an upward trend in bicycle use and expects the biking industry in Georgia to continue to grow in the coming years.\n\u201cPeople are going to need this information if they want to justify any type of investments or improvements in the bicycle infrastructure in Georgia, so there is definitely a need to conduct a rigorous impact analysis for any new project,\u201d said Dhongde. The detailed analysis in her report will guide others to calculate the costs and return on investment for new biking projects in the state, such as building a bike lane in Atlanta or expanding a trail.\nOverall, the study shows that biking in Georgia has a significant economic impact on the state.\n\u201cIf there are half a billion dollars in output, that says a lot for this industry,\u201d says Dhongde.\nRead\u00a0 'The Economic Impact of Bicycling in Georgia' \u00a0by Georgia Tech economist Shatakshee Dhongde, published by the Georgia Department of Transportation 2021.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nDi Minardi\ndi.minardi@gatech.edu\nEmail\ndminardi3@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
