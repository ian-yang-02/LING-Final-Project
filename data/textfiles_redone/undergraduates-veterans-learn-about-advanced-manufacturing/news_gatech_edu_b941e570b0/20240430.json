He\u2019s tested various formulations of particular polymers to produce a film on materials that is relatively thin, transparent and sufficiently conductive. Through this work he\u2019s gained a general knowledge of conductive polymers and learned about atomic force microscopy and constructing electrochemical cells. He\u2019s done all this as an undergraduate student. Daugherty is one of 10 undergraduate students from across the country spending the summer at Georgia Tech learning about the fundamental principles of advanced manufacturing science and technology. The Georgia Tech Manufacturing Institute runs the program, which targets veterans and underrepresented minorities. Daugherty, who served in the U.S. Army and is now a student at Georgia Perimeter College, is one of five veterans participating in Research Experience for Student Veterans in Advanced Manufacturing and Entrepreneurship (REVAMP). Daugherty, 28, hopes to transfer to Georgia Tech and study materials science and engineering. He\u2019s enjoyed conducting research. \u201cIt probably helps that I\u2019ve had a good deal of success, but that\u2019s really just luck,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes you're lucky, sometimes you're not. If you're not lucky, that doesn't mean it was bad research or a waste of time, it just means that you've learned something that you maybe didn't expect, even if it is only what not to do.\" A three-year grant from the National Science Foundation supports the program, which provides students with a $5,000 stipend, on-campus housing, hands-on manufacturing research, leadership skills and entrepreneurship training. This is the program\u2019s second year and organizers received about 50 applications for the 10 slots, said John Morehouse, director of Manufacturing Programs and Partnerships at GTMI, and co-principal investigator for REVAMP. \u201cThis allows us to leverage what we\u2019re doing on campus to enhance manufacturing education,\u201d Morehouse said. \u201cStudents learn the latest manufacturing techniques and gain hands-on experience to prepare them for the workforce.\u201d Salah Mousa, a chemical engineering major from the University of Arizona, joined REVAMP to learn about current manufacturing techniques. The 31-year-old served in the airborne infantry and was interested in manufacturing research. \u201cThis is the first time in college where being a veteran has given me an edge over the competition,\u201d he said. \u00a0 Some students, like Brittany Robinson, knew little about advanced manufacturing before the program. Robinson, 28, is working toward an associate\u2019s degree from St. Petersburg College in Florida and is interested in orthotics and prosthetics. \u201cLearning about research here is the best thing to happen to me,\u201d she said. She aspires to publish her research, work with veterans and maybe even open her own business. \u201cMy dreams have gotten bigger just by being here,\u201d she said.\nRelated links\nGeorgia Tech Manufacturing Institute\nContact\nLaura Diamond Georgia Institute of Technology 404-894-6016\nEmail\nlaura.diamond@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
