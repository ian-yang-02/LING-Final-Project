Photo by Allison Carter\nMar 09, 2023\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nWith the new Reck Garage, officially unveiled this spring next to the John Lewis Student Center, Georgia Tech's iconic mascot will always have a prime parking spot in the heart of campus.\nThe garage includes a fully functioning repair station with a lift, work benches, plenty of storage for tools, an outdoor car wash station, and dual entrances, making the space as functional as it is stylish. The crowning design piece though is a spinning turntable that allows for 360-degree views of the vintage car. When it's not rambling though campus sounding its distinctive horn, the Ramblin' Wreck can now be enjoyed almost 24/7 by its most loyal fans\u2014students.\n\"In the Reck Club, we always say that the Wreck belongs to the student body; it's a representation of students,\" says Omar Khan, the new 2023 driver. \"But there's always been some distance because we had to keep its location secret. This is a special moment to see it find a permanent home right here in the middle of campus.\"\nRead the full story\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nA Dream Garage Come True\nContact\nJennifer Herseim\nGeorgia Tech Alumni Magazine\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
