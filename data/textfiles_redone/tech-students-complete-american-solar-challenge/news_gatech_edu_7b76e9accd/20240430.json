The team had previously attempted the challenge in 2018, but this was the first time they were able to make it to the finish line off the power of the sun.\n\u201cAlong the way, we had to grapple with unexpected breakdowns, steep mountain passes, city traffic, wildfire haze, and much more,\u201d said Joseph Stein, a mechanical engineering major and president of Solar Racing. \u201cBut we also had a chance to drive a car we built across some truly stunning landscapes, and talk about sustainable technology with people we met on the road.\u201d\nGeorgia Tech Solar Racing is a student organization that designs and builds solar-powered race cars for track and cross-country competitions around the world. Completing the American Solar Challenge took years of work to get their car,\nEndurance , ready for the grueling drive. The group had to qualify for the challenge by driving 350 miles in a track race in Topeka, Kansas, before attempting the five-day drive out west.\nStein hopes the team\u2019s accomplishments will inspire other students to get involved in the many inspiring engineering endeavors taking place on campus.\n\u201cTech students are pushing the limits of hyper-efficient vehicle technology and advancing the Institute's vision of using technological innovation to create a sustainable future,\u201d he said.\nSolar Racing is recruiting new members from all majors and skill levels this semester. The club is holding info sessions on Sept. 1 and Sept. 2 from 4:30 to 6 p.m. iin Room 2405, Manufacturing Related Disciplines Complex (MRDC).
