Many likely did.\nThat\u2019s exactly the kind of scenario the creators of\nFireHUD\nwant to prevent. The Georgia Tech graduates have developed a wearable device that helps commanders keep track of firefighters\u2019 vital signs while they work. It\u2019s an idea with enough merit to have won two new grants this fall,\nincluding a second round of seed funding from the National Science Foundation (NSF).\nThe\nPhase II Small Business Innovation Research grant\nmeans alumni Zack Braun, Tyler Sisk, and Joe Boettcher have $750,000 to continue refining their BioTrac Platform, and it\u2019s a big vote of confidence in the platform\u2019s technical and commercial viability. That brings the total investment from the NSF to nearly a million dollars.\n\u201cWith our Phase I grant from NSF, we learned a lot very quickly,\u201d said Braun, a 2016 computer science graduate and co-founder of FireHUD.\nThose lessons included realizing that their initial concept \u2014 a heads-up display of environmental and biometric data for firefighters \u2014 wasn\u2019t what they actually needed.\n\u201cBased on feedback from the first responders, we learned that firefighters themselves are focused on the job at hand and too busy to use a heads-up display. Really, the commander needs the [biometric] data so that they can best decide how to allocate their resources.\u201d\nBraun said the team learned fire chiefs needed a system that was easy to use, passive, and rugged. As a result, their product has evolved into a\nbody-worn band, a long-range radio transceiver, and a real-time software dashboard . It allows on-scene commanders to make sure their crews aren\u2019t overexerting themselves while they battle a blaze.\nBraun called it the first commercially viable physiological monitoring platform tailored to first responders.\nBraun and Sisk won the\n2016 InVenture Prize\nfor the original FireHUD idea. They also participated in\nCREATE-X , an initiative to support entrepreneurship among Georgia Tech students. Sisk finished his bachelor\u2019s in electrical engineering in 2016, and he and Braun went to work full-time on the concept. They subsequently brought in Boettcher, another electrical engineering graduate from Tech, as chief development officer.\n\u201cUser feedback has been crucial to the evolution of our system,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is something that has been instilled in our company since the beginning of the CREATE-X program at Georgia Tech.\u201d\nMeanwhile, the trio also has received $750,000 to outfit a U.S. Air Force base with the system they developed with the first round of NSF funding.\n\u201cThe platform will be used to monitor the health of all their recruits in real time as well as show the overall fitness trends of the recruits while they are at the Air Force base,\u201d Braun said.\nThrough the NSF seed funding program, Boettcher, Braun, and Sisk will continue to receive mentoring, feedback from experts, and time to scale their product. Braun said they\u2019re already in conversations with a manufacturer in Georgia to produce more of their devices, which they\u2019ll market to first responders, the military, and industrial facilities.\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nFireHUD\nFireHUD's BioTrac Platform\nSmall Business Innovation Research grants\nCREATE-X\nInVenture Prize\nContact\nJoshua Stewart\n404.894.6016\nEmail\njstewart@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
