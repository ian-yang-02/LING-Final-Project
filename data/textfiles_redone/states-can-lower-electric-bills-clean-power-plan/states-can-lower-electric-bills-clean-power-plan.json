Sluggish demand growth and the rise of solar power challenge the ability of utilities to recover their costs. The digital economy requires reliable power quality, and growing cyber threats call for increased investments in grid security. On top of these issues, global climate disruption suggests that energy systems need to be transformed. As a result, most forecasts predict that electricity bills will rise significantly over the next several decades. In response to these issues, researchers from the Georgia Institute of Technology examined options for the power industry\u2019s future. The report released Monday will \u201chelp states define their preferred approach for complying with proposed carbon pollution regulations,\u201d said Marilyn Brown, the project\u2019s lead investigator and the Brook Byers Professor of Sustainable Systems in the School of Public Policy. The report, \u201c Low-Carbon Electricity Pathways for the U.S. and the South ,\u201d examines two key issues: how states can reduce carbon pollution in the most cost-effective way and how different options impact household electricity bills. \u201cTo minimize costs, the South needs to reduce its coal consumption more rapidly, continue to expand its gas-fired power plants, but temper this growth with aggressive policies to increase energy efficiency and renewable energy,\u201d Brown said. The project took a turn when last year, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency proposed the first ever carbon pollution standards for existing power plants (known as the Clean Power Plan). Since states have considerable latitude to define their preferred response, they are vigorously debating the pros and cons of different options. Using state-of-the-art modeling, Georgia Tech identified least-cost clean power pathways that would lower household electricity bills and reduce carbon pollution. This combination may not seem intuitive to some, but it is good news for states across the South and the nation. \u201cThis work provides the type of analytic basis that is needed to inform policymaking and will guide the future of the power industry for decades,\u201d said Tim Lieuwen, director of the Strategic Energy Institute at Georgia Tech. \"Georgia Tech plays an important role as honest broker in national policy discussions, and we will continue to support decision makers through these types of analyses.\"\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nLow-Carbon Electricity Pathways for the U.S. and the South\nContact\nLaura Diamond\u00a0 Georgia Tech Media Relations 404-894-6016\nEmail\nlaura.diamond@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
