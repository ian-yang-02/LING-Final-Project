Others can be masked by processes that consume biosignatures, leading to false negatives.\u201d\nTo overcome these problems, Reinhard and colleagues in the NASA Astrobiology Institute Alternative Earths and Virtual Planetary Laboratory Teams are proposing use of dynamic biosignatures based on seasonal changes in Earth\u2019s atmosphere. The approach \u2013 described recently in\nAstrophysical Journal Letters\n\u2013 uses the seasonal variation of biologically important gases as a way to deal with false positives and false negatives, Reinhard says.\nSeasonality of Atmospheric Gases\nAs Earth orbits the sun, its tilted axis means different regions receive more rays at different times of the year. The most visible signs of this phenomenon are changes in the weather and length of the days, but atmospheric composition is also affected. For example, in the Northern Hemisphere, which contains most the world\u2019s vegetation, plant growth in summer results in noticeably lower levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. The reverse is true for oxygen.\n\u201cAtmospheric seasonality is a promising biosignature because it is biologically modulated on Earth and is likely to occur on other inhabited worlds,\u201d says lead author Stephanie Olson, a graduate student in the\nDepartment of Earth Sciences\nof the University of California, Riverside (UCR). \u201cInferring life based on seasonality wouldn\u2019t require a detailed understanding of alien biochemistry because it arises as a biological response to seasonal changes in the environment, rather than as a consequence of a specific biological activity that might be unique to Earth.\u201d\nIn the study \u2013 funded by the NASA Astrobiology Institute and the National Science Foundation Frontiers in Earth System Dynamics \u2013 the researchers identify the opportunities and pitfalls in monitoring the seasonal ebbs and flows of oxygen, carbon dioxide, methane, and ozone. They also modeled fluctuations of atmospheric oxygen on a life-bearing planet with low oxygen content, just as Earth was billions of years ago. \u201cBased on these evaluations,\u201d Reinhard says, \u201cseasonal variations in ozone could be a sensitive biosignature on planets with undetectable levels of oxygen in their atmospheres.\u201d\nOzone as Indicator of Life\nAt Georgia Tech, the Reinhard research group develops comprehensive models for the production and maintenance of robust atmospheric biosignatures on habitable planets, and it played a key role in developing the concept of ozone seasonality as a fingerprint for life on low-oxygen planets. The idea emerged in part as an answer to the \u201cbiosignature blind spot\u201d problem Reinhard and colleagues posed in the 2017\nAstrobiology\npaper \u201c False Negatives for Remote Life Detection on Ocean-Bearing Planets: Lessons from Early Earth .\u201d\n\u201cWe are particularly excited about the prospect of characterizing oxygen fluctuations at the low levels we would expect to find on an early version of Earth,\u201d says Timothy Lyons, a professor of biogeochemistry in UCR\u2019s Department of Earth Science and director of the\nAlternative Earths Astrobiology Center . \u201cSeasonal variations as revealed by ozone would be most readily detectable on a planet like Earth was billions of years ago, when most life was still microscopic and ocean dwelling.\u201d\n\u201cAlthough we think the conceptual framework for this approach is robust,\u201d Reinhard says, \u201cobserving and quantifying seasonality represents a daunting challenge. Research will need to take into account modulation of seasonal signals by the angle at which we observe a planet and the shape of its orbit, among other factors. Nevertheless, seasonality represents a potentially powerful approach toward finding life beyond our solar system.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nContact\nA.
