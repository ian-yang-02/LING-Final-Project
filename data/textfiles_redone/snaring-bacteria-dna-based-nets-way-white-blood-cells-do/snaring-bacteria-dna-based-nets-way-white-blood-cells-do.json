White blood cells shoot so-called NETs like Spiderman at bacteria. NETs contain hundreds of ingredients, the main one being DNA, but researchers engineered their microweb with just DNA and one other ingredient.

This is how a white blood cell may someday work together with an antibiotic. Today's antibiotics are not particularly engineered to coordinate their fight against bacteria with white blood cells, the body\u2019s own first line of defense against infectors, but a\nnew study\ngives hope that that could change.\nHow white blood cells called neutrophils work has\u00a0not been understood well on a micron level, but researchers have gotten a closer look by chemically modeling one of their combat weapons, a kind of web, and trying it out on bacteria. The researchers then successfully double-teamed the bacteria with\u00a0an antibiotic and their synthetic version of the white blood cell's web.\n\u201cOne of their (the cells') weapons are neutrophil extracellular traps, also called NETs,\u201d said\nJ. Scott VanEpps , assistant professor of emergency medicine at the University of Michigan. VanEpps co-led the study with Shuichi Takayama from the Georgia Institute of Technology.\nShooting DNA webs\nNETs are microscopic networks of fibers made primarily of DNA that neutrophils produce to capture bacteria.\n\u201cIt\u2019s amazing to think that molecular DNA tape, on which our genetic code is recorded, can also be used as a bacteria-lassoing web. White blood cells can act like cellular Spidermen that net bacterial micro-villains to protect our body,\u201d said Takayama, who is a professor in Georgia Tech\u2019s\nPetit Institute for Bioengineering and Biosciences\nand in the\nWallace H Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering at Georgia Tech and Emory University .\nTakayama and VanEpps synthesized a rough chemical imitation\u00a0of the NETs to study how they work by snaring bacteria in the lab\nin vitro . They also found antibiotics killed bacteria more effectively when combined with the synthetic\u00a0web\u00a0than when applied alone. The researchers published their results in\nthe journal\nAdvanced Materials\non January 20, 2018 .\nSnagging, poisoning\nE. coli\n\u201cAlthough there are literally hundreds of different ingredients in natural NETs, we were able to recreate a lot of their structure and function with just two ingredients,\u201d VanEpp said. \u201cThey look and function very similar to NETs produced by those neutrophil white blood cells and the synthesis method is much simpler than isolating them from neutrophils.\u201d\nThe researchers first used their microwebs to snare and kill bacteria in order to better understand how white blood\u00a0NETs work. Then they combined their microwebs\u00a0with antibiotics\u00a0 in vitro\u00a0 to test for increased drug effectiveness.\nTheir results imply that the presence of white blood cell NETs in the body may increase the effectiveness of antibiotics. Also, the synthetic microwebs may have medical potential on their own.\nFighting antibiotic resistance\n\u201cAs bacteria develop resistance even to last-resort antibiotics, there is worry of untreatable infections. We found that microwebs can help antibiotics break through such resistance,\u201d said Takayama, who is also Price Gilbert, Jr. Chair in Regenerative Engineering and Medicine at Georgia Tech.\n\u201cThe knowledge gained in this study could be helpful in the future in designing new and better antibiotics that mimic the body\u2019s natural defense mechanisms, as well as potentially change how we dose antibiotics given the potential synergy between the immune system and certain antibiotics,\u201d VanEpps said.\nThe new microwebs also serve as a foundation for future research on even more functions of DNA ejected outside of cells.\n\u201cThe ability to readily customize the microweb composition opens many opportunities to engineer new DNA materials that mimic biology and increase our understanding of the role of NETs and other types of extracellular DNA in the body,\u201d Takayama said.\nThese authors contributed to this study: Yang Song\u00a0from Georgia Tech; Usha Kadiyala,\u00a0Priyan Weerappuli, Srilakshmi Yalavarthi,\u00a0Cameron Louttit, Jason S.
