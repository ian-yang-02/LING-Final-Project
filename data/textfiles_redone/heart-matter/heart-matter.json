Fenton has been fascinated by the human heart for 30 years.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nEmail\nAbouzar Kaboudian and Flavio Fenton work on data they gathered about heart arrhythmias by studying rabbit hearts.\nFeb 13, 2024\nIt doesn\u2019t have to be Valentine\u2019s Day for Flavio Fenton to have the heart on his mind. Fenton has been fascinated by the human heart for 30 years. The professor in the\nSchool of Physics\nexplores the physics and mathematics behind the heart \u2014 specifically, arrythmias, or abnormal heart rhythms.\n\u201cWhen you think about the physics of a heart, the first thing that comes to mind is the pumping action and the forcing of fluids,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the reason it contracts is an electrical signal. There\u2019s a lot of physiology and biology behind the function of the heart, but underneath it all, there\u2019s so many areas of physics you can apply to it to understand how it works \u2014 and how it fails to work, like in the case of arrhythmias.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a lot to love about Fenton\u2019s work:\nLast year, Fenton and clinicians at Emory University won the Georgia Clinical and Translational Science Alliance's\nTeam Science Award of Distinction for Early Stage Research\nfor their work using live explanted human hearts to better understand arrhythmias.\nIn 2022, Fenton and his collaborators brought a new understanding to complicated heart conditions with the\nfirst high-resolution visualizations of stable spiral waves\nin human ventricles.\nDuring the Covid-19 pandemic,\nhis research\nrevealed the cardiac risks associated with the proposed use of hydroxychloroquine in treatment.\nThe year before , Fenton used graphics processing chips designed for gaming applications and software that runs on ordinary web browsers to move the modeling of deadly heart arrhythmias to less costly computers, and even to high-end smartphones.\nIn 2018, Fenton and a team came up with a\nnew imaging technique\nthat could lead to earlier identification of heart rhythm disorders and the development of better treatments.\nHis current projects involve possible advances in the amount of voltage used to treat fibrillations, and new knowledge about where in the heart to apply that voltage. He maintains collaborations with agencies like the Food and Drug Administration and a wide array of researchers and clinicians, with hopes that hospitals will eventually be able to apply what he has studied over the years to assist in better patient care and health outcomes.\n\u201cThe heart has been a really fun system to study, and there\u2019s so much that we still don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. \u201cOn top of that, it has a main application of directly saving lives if we can find better and safer ways to prevent and terminate arrhythmias.\u201d\nRelated links\nLISTEN: Can Math and Physics Save an Arrhythmic Heart?\nGeorgia Tech and Emory Researchers Win Award for Arrhythmia Research\nWe Heart Physics: Flavio Fenton on Cardiac Rhythms, Chaos, and a Mission to En\u2026\nUsing Smartphones and Laptops to Simulate Deadly Heart Arrhythmias\nMaelstroms in the Heart Confirmed\nContact\nJess Hunt-Ralston\nCollege of Sciences\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
