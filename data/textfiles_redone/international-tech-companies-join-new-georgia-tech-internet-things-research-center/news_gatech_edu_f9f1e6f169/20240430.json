Devices could include the equipment in cars, homes, trucks, cargo, health care, and other everyday objects. This new area of technological innovation is receiving increasing attention around the world because of its potential impact on all sectors of the economy and society. Together with Georgia Tech and GTRI, the founding members will closely monitor and actively participate in the expansion of the rapidly growing IoT industry. Other leading global companies involved in IoT have indicated their interest in getting engaged with CDAIT. \u201cHaving companies of this stature join Georgia Tech in this effort speaks volumes about what we\u2019re trying to accomplish,\u201d said Andrew Gerber, Georgia Tech Senior Vice President and Director of the Georgia Tech Research Institute (GTRI). \u201cWe are proud to be recognized as a trusted collaborator in the Internet-of-Things arena.
