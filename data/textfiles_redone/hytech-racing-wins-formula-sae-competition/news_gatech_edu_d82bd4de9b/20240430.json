The competition challenges students from around the world to engineer the best performing electric formula race car.\nThis was Formula SAE Electric\u2019s most competitive year yet, with 58 collegiate teams. HyTech\u2019s 386-pound vehicle bested teams from other world-renowned engineering universities including McGill University, Carnegie Mellon University, and the University of Pennsylvania.\n\u201cBuilding a fast car requires a tremendous amount of innovation,\u201d said Brendan Bassett, HyTech Racing president. \u201cMembers actively participated in all parts of car construction, including experimental circuitries, material characterization, and computational fluid dynamics.\u201d\nFormula SAE Electric competitions are not just car races. They involve a lengthy review process to ensure complete safety and compliance. Each team competes in two different types of events, static and dynamic. In static events, teams defend their vehicle costs, compete in supply chain and business case scenarios, and present and defend their designs to industry leaders. After passing all static events, team vehicles compete in the dynamic portion of the race. Cars compete for the fastest time on straight-line acceleration, skidpad, autocross (single lap), and endurance lap (22-lap) events.\nThis season, HyTech took on both ambitious design targets and an aggressive project schedule. Students from different disciplines cooperated to find creative solutions on a tight timeline.\n\u201cOur members put in countless long nights debugging and interfacing the vehicle\u2019s subsystems in the Student Competition Center and at the MRDC parking lot,\u201d said Bassett. \u201cIn the end, the team was able to produce a fundamentally competitive vehicle that delivered winning track times consistently.\u201d\nNext year, with the ever-evolving level of competition, the team will pivot to a four-wheel hub motor powertrain architecture, said David Knight, incoming chief engineer for the 2022-23 academic year. \u201cThis quantum leap in design complexity is necessary in order to unlock the full performance envelope of an electric race car.\u201d\nLearn more about HyTech Racing at\nhytechracing.gatech.edu .\nAdditional Images\nContact\nBrendan Bassett\nHyTech Racing\nKristen Bailey\nInstitute Communications\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
