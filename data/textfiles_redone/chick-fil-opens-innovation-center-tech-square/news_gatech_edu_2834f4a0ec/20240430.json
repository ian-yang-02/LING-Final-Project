The Technology Innovation Center, part of the company\u2019s long-standing partnership with the Institute, emphasizes Chick-fil-A\u2019s commitment to innovation.\n\u201cThis new facility will provide a dedicated space for Chick-fil-A to collaborate with the bright minds of Georgia Tech and develop technology solutions that will benefit our customers,\u201d said Chick-fil-A\u2019s Chief Information Officer Mike Erbrick. \u201cOur founder Truett Cathy was a true innovator, and the Technology Innovation Center is one of the ways we\u2019re continuing his legacy.\u201d\nThe 6,000-square-foot space focuses on digital technology, complementing work already taking place at Chick-fil-A\u2019s three existing innovation centers, and is a testament to the company\u2019s desire to enhance the customer experience. Some of the new center\u2019s projects are being tested in restaurants, including the location in Colony Square.\nChick-fil-A will work with faculty and students to explore design, innovation and development projects among various majors and disciplines.\n\u201cWe are very excited that Chick-fil-A is one of our corporate partners in the innovation ecosystem that we are building at Georgia Tech and nearby,\u201d Georgia Tech President G.P. \u201cBud\u201d Peterson said.\nDuring the past five years, corporations have opened more than 20\ninnovation and technology centers in and near Tech Square , all within a several-block area.\n\u201cAlong with Chick-fil-A, companies such as Worldpay, Keysight Technologies and NCR are attracted to Tech Square so that they can access the talent and technologies being developed and collaborate with Georgia Tech faculty, staff and students,\u201d Peterson said. \u201cWhen coupled with the many startups fostered in the innovative, dynamic environment developed by the Advanced Technology Development Center and the Enterprise Innovation Institute, this has dramatically changed the face and culture of Midtown.\u201d\nEight Georgia Tech students work as interns in the Chick-fil-A Technology Innovation Center.\nTiffany Zhou, a third-year computer science major, said working in an innovation center provides access\u00a0to the latest technology and tools.\nChick-fil-A also gives students the freedom to work on different projects, said Abbie Williams, a third-year computer science major.\n\u201cWe started worked on a project on\u00a0day one,\u201d she said. \u201cThey trust us to do what we think is right. We\u2019ve asked would you like us to do this or that and they tell\u00a0us to do what we think is best. It\u2019s empowering.\u201d\nThe innovation centers at Tech Square don\u2019t just benefit their home corporations. The centers interact with startups in Tech Square and across Midtown.\nIn addition, Chick-fil-A is among the founding corporate members contributing to\u00a0 Engage ,\u00a0a new\u00a0national membership-driven accelerator and venture fund targeting high-tech startups.\u00a0Georgia Tech's\u00a0Advanced Technology Development Center provides programming and other services for the\u00a0 Atlanta-based\u00a0Engage .\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nInnovation Centers at Georgia Tech\nContact\nFor media inquiries about the innovation centers in Georgia Tech\u2019s Tech Square, please contact Laura Diamond,\u00a0 laura.diamond@gatech.edu\nFor other information about the innovation centers, please contact Greg King,\u00a0 greg.king@gatech.edu\nFor media inquiries about the Chick-fil-A Technology Innovation Center, please email\u00a0cfapressroom@chick-fil-a.com\nEmail\nlaura.diamond@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
