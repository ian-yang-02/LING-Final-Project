Having that information gives scientists the starting point they need to reconstruct the complex pathway that got life started on Earth.\nDirector of the NSF-NASA\nCenter for Chemical Evolution\nat the Georgia Institute of Technology, Hud says finding molecules in asteroids provides the strongest evidence that such compounds were present on the Earth before life formed. Knowing what molecules were present helps establish the initial conditions that led to the formation of amino acids and related compounds that, in turn, came together to form peptides, small protein-like molecules that may have kicked off life on this planet.\n\u201cWe can look to the asteroids to help us understand what chemistry is possible in the universe,\u201d said Hud. \u201cIt\u2019s important for us to study materials from asteroids and meteorites, the smaller versions of asteroids that fall to Earth, to test the validity of our models for how molecules in them could have helped give rise to life. We also need to catalog the molecules from asteroids and meteorites because there might be compounds there that we had not even considered important for starting life.\u201d\nHud was a panelist at a press briefing \u201cAsteroids for Research, Discovery, and Commerce\u201d February 17 at the 2018 annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) in Austin, Texas.\nNASA scientists have been analyzing compounds found in asteroids and meteorites for decades, and their work provides a solid understanding for what might have been present when the Earth itself was formed, Hud says.\n\u201cIf you model a prebiotic chemical reaction in the laboratory, scientists can argue about whether or not you had the right starting materials,\u201d said Hud. \u201cDetection of a molecule in an asteroid or meteorite is about the only evidence everyone will accept for that molecule being prebiotic. It\u2019s something we can really lean on.\u201d\nThe Miller-Urey experiment, conducted in 1952 to simulate conditions believed to have existed on the early Earth, produced more than 20 different amino acids, organic compounds that are the building blocks for peptides. The experiment was kicked off by sparks inside a flask containing water, methane, ammonia and hydrogen, all materials believed to have existed in the atmosphere when the Earth was very young.\nSince the Miller-Urey experiment, scientists have demonstrated the feasibility of other chemical pathways to amino acids and compounds necessary for life. In Hud\u2019s laboratory, for instance, researchers used cycles of alternating wet and dry conditions to create complex organic molecules over time. Under such conditions, amino acids and hydroxy acids, compounds that differ chemically by just a single atom, could have formed short peptides that led to the formation of larger and more complex molecules \u2013 ultimately exhibiting properties that we now associate with biological molecules.\n\u201cWe now have a really good way to synthesize peptides with amino acids and hydroxy acids working together that could have been common on the early Earth,\u201d he said. \u201cEven today, hydroxy acids are found with amino acids in living organisms \u2013 and in some meteorite samples that have been examined.\u201d\nHud believes there are many possible ways that the molecules of life could have formed. Life could have gotten started with molecules that are less sophisticated and less efficient than what we see today. Like life itself, these molecules could have evolved over time.\n\u201cWhat we find is that these compounds can form molecules that look a lot like modern peptides, except in the backbone that is holding the units together,\u201d said Hud. \u201cThe overall structure can be very similar and would be easier to make, though it doesn\u2019t have the ability to fold into as complex structures as modern proteins. There is a tradeoff between the simplicity of forming these molecules and how close these molecules are to those found in contemporary life.\u201d\nGeologists believe the Earth was very different billions of years ago. Instead of continents, there were islands protruding from the oceans. Even the sun was different, producing less light but more cosmic rays \u2013 which could have helped power the protein-forming chemical reactions.\n\u201cThe islands could have been potential incubators for life, with molecules raining down from the atmosphere,\u201d Hud said. \u201cWe think the key process that would have allowed these molecules to go to the next stage is a wet-dry cycling like what we are doing in the lab. That would have been perfect for an island out in the ocean.\u201d\nRather than a single spark of life, the molecules could have evolved slowly over time in gradual progression that may have taken place at different rates in different locations, perhaps simultaneously. Different components of cells, for example, may have developed separately where conditions favored them before they ultimately came together.\n\u201cThere is something very special about peptides, nucleic acids, polysaccharides and lipids and their ability to work together to do something they couldn\u2019t have done separately,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd there could have been any number of chemical processes on the early Earth that never led to life.\u201d\nKnowing what conditions were like on the early Earth therefore gives scientists a stronger foundation for hypothesizing what could have taken place, and could offer hints to other pathways that may not have been considered yet.\n\u201cThere are probably a lot more clues in the asteroids about what molecules were really there,\u201d said Hud. \u201cWe may not even know what we should be looking for in these asteroids, but by looking at what molecules we find, we can ask different and more questions about how they could have helped get life started.\u201d\nResearch News\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\n177 North Avenue\nAtlanta, Georgia\u00a0 30332-0181\u00a0 USA\nMedia Relations Contact : John Toon (404-894-6986) (jtoon@gatech.edu).\nWriter : John Toon\nAdditional Images\nContact\nJohn Toon\nResearch News\n(404) 894-6986\nEmail\njtoon@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
