Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering at Georgia Tech and Emory.\nSinger shared preliminary results of the feasibility study in October at the American Neurological Association annual meeting. Now she is a corresponding author with Emory neurology researcher\nJames Lah\nof a paper outlining their findings in the journal\nAlzheimer\u2019s & Dementia: Translational Research & Clinical Interventions .\nThe flicker treatment stimulates gamma waves, manipulating neural activity, recruiting the brain\u2019s immune system, and clearing pathogens \u2014 in short, waging a successful fight against a progressive disease that still has no cure.\nPrevious research already had shown that sensory areas in the human brain will entrain to flickering stimuli for seconds to hours. But this was the first time Singer and her team were able to test gamma sensory stimulation over an extended period of time.\nThe study included 10 patients with Alzheimer\u2019s-associated mild cognitive impairment, which required them to wear an experimental visor and headphones that exposed one group to light and sound at 40 hertz for an hour a day over eight weeks, and another group for four weeks after a delayed start.\n\u201cWe were able to tune the devices to a level of light and sound that was not only tolerable, but it also successfully provoked an underlying brain response,\u201d Lah said.\nAs they hoped and expected, Singer said, \u201cthere was widespread entrainment.\u201d That is, brain activity \u2013 in this case, gamma waves \u2013 synchronized to the external stimulation.\nGamma waves are associated with high-level cognitive functions, like perception and memory. Disruptions to these waves have been found in various neurological disorders, not just Alzheimer\u2019s.\nThe human feasibility study showed that the gamma flicker treatment was safe and tolerable. And perhaps most surprising, patients followed the full treatment schedule.\n\u201cAdherence was one of our major concerns,\u201d Singer said. \u201cWhen we sent the device home with the participants, would they use it? Would they use it for a couple of days, and that would be it? We were pleasantly surprised that this wasn\u2019t the case.\u201d\nAdherence rates hovered around 90 percent, with no severe adverse effects reported during the study or the 10-month open label extension (some patients even volunteered to continue being monitored and assessed after the study, though this data wasn\u2019t part of the published research).\nSome participants reported mild discomfort that could have been flicker related \u2014 dizziness, ringing in the ears, and headaches. But overall, Singer said, the device\u2019s safety profile was excellent. She also reported some positive biological outcomes.\n\u201cWe looked at default mode network connectivity, which is basically how different brain regions that are particularly active during wakeful rest and memory, interact with each other,\u201d Singer said. \u201cThere are deficits in this network in Alzheimer\u2019s, but after eight weeks [of treatment], we found strengthening in that connectivity.\u201d This may indicate stronger interactions and therefore better communication between these regions.\nIn previous animal studies, the 40Hz of flicker stimulated mouse gamma waves, significantly reducing some Alzheimer\u2019s pathogenic hallmarks and recruited microglia to the cause \u2013 these are the primary immune cells in the brain. But in the human study, there were no clear changes in the presence of pathogens amyloid beta or p-Tau.\nHowever, as with the mouse studies, \u201cwe are getting immune engagement in humans,\u201d Singer said. The flicker treatment sparked the activity of cytokines, proteins used in cell signaling \u2014 a sign that flicker had engaged the brain\u2019s immune system.\n\u201cThat is something we want to see, because microglia do things like clear out pathogens. Some people think that part of what\u2019s going wrong in Alzheimer\u2019s is a failure of this clearance mechanism,\u201d Singer said.\nShe and Lah have wondered if a longer human trial would make a difference \u2014 would there be reduced amyloid activity, for example.\n\u201cSo far, this is very preliminary, and we\u2019re nowhere close to drawing conclusions about the clinical benefit of this treatment,\u201d Lah said. \u201cBut we now have some very good arguments for a larger, longer study with more people.\u201d\nThe study was funded by the\u00a0National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke at the National Institutes of Health (grant No. R01-NS109226-01S1), by the Packard Foundation, the Friends and Alumni of Georgia Tech, the Lane Family, the Wright Family, and Cognito Therapeutics.
