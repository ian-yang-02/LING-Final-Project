Plasmids are genetic structures of the cell that can reproduce independently, and are responsible for producing the anthrax toxin and other virulence factors.\nThe research found that bacteria strains collected from humans and animals tended to have more copies of the virulence plasmids than those collected from environmental sources. The research, a collaboration between scientists at the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), used CDC\u2019s collection of\nBacillus anthracis\nstrains gathered from around the world beginning in the 1950s.\n\u201cThere is a hypothesis that the copy number \u2013 number of copies of the plasmids \u2013 plays a role in how virulent each strain is,\u201d said\nKostas Konstantinidis , a professor in the\nSchool of Civil and Environmental Engineering\nat the Georgia Institute of Technology. \u201cWe want to understand which are the more virulent strains, which are less virulent and what explains the difference. This study provides the first evidence that there is a significant difference in plasmid copy number that may be related to the virulence. But more research is needed to test this emerging hypothesis.\u201d\nThe research, which was sponsored by the CDC and the National Science Foundation, was reported August 14 in the journal\nmSystems , an open access journal from the American Society for Microbiology. The study involved more than 600 gigabytes of data, which will be shared with other researchers working to understand anthrax.\nIn\nB. anthracis , two plasmids \u2013 known as pXO1 and pXO2 \u2013 are autonomous and independent pieces of DNA that encode the toxin and other virulence factors. In bacteria, plasmids like these tend to move around independently of the organisms\u2019 main chromosomes, and can jump from one strain to another via genetic mechanisms of DNA transfer. Bacterial resistance to antibiotics can also be transferred through plasmid movement, for instance. Interestingly, this study found that the anthrax plasmids show limited genetic exchange between strains; rather, they are inherited from the ancestor, similar to the chromosomes.\n\u201cThis work and additional analyses performed at Georgia Tech and CDC on these genomes from strains of\nB. anthracis\nfrom around the world help further define the global diversity of this health threat,\u201d said Alex Hoffmaster, chief of CDC\u2019s Zoonotic Select Agent Lab and a co-author on the article. \u201cUnderstanding more about the strains and their distribution can help us more easily determine whether anthrax cases were caused by natural or man-made sources so we can respond as needed to protect the public\u2019s health.\u201d\nThe research could also provide information about other organisms, Konstantinidis said. \u201cBeyond\nB. anthracis , this work could help provide a better understanding of the virulence potential of other organisms carrying similar plasmids. Being able to distinguish between more virulent and less virulent strains is a broader challenge for microbiology.\u201d\nThe study began with researchers from the CDC\u2019s Division of High-Consequence Pathogens and Pathology, who used next-generation techniques to sequence diverse strains of\nB. anthracis . The agency provided its data to the Konstantinidis laboratory at Georgia Tech, where Graduate Research Assistant Angela Pena-Gonzalez led the bioinformatics analysis of the data.\n\u201cWe were able to use the sequencing data to calculate the correlation of the copy number with the source of each strain,\u201d she explained. \u201cWe used the whole length of the plasmid to calculate the copy number, and our results were based on the analysis of hundreds of strains obtained from several sources \u2013 humans, animals and the environment \u2013 and not just a couple of them. This was an advantage of our study.\u201d\nAnalytical techniques developed at Georgia Tech allowed the whole genome comparisons to be done on the more than 400 genomes \u2013 a substantial data science challenge. The research revealed that B. anthracis genomes carried, on average, 3.86 and 2.29 copies of the pXO1 and pXO2 plasmids respectively, and that there was a positive linear correlation between the copy numbers of the two plasmids.\n\u201cThe technology to do this whole genome sequencing is available, but the processing of the data and the interpretation is not yet very straightforward,\u201d Konstantinidis said. \u201cThe very magnitude of the data requires a specific process and considerable experience. The way in which we analyzed this data was not even available two years ago when we started the study.\u201d\nBeyond the possible correlation of copy number of virulence, the study also showed the genome of the strains was surprisingly consistent. \u201cThe work shows that these plasmids are relatively stable, though we found a few strains that had different varieties of the plasmids that seem to have attenuated the virulence,\u201d he said.\nA next step would be to investigate further the possible correlation between copy number and virulence in animal studies.\nKonstantinidis hopes to continue collaborating with the CDC to gain a better understanding of virulence and other factors in anthrax and other organisms that have implications for public health.\n\u201cThe CDC has unique resources like this collection of anthrax strains, and we hope to continue this collaboration to further understand what is going on with this and other pathogens,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are a lot of applications to public health and to improving our understanding of the basic biology behind these organisms.\u201d\nIn addition to those already mentioned, the work included Luis M.
