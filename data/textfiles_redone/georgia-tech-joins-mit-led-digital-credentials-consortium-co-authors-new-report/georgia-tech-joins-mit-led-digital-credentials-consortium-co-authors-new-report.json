The group has released a co-authored report that charts a viable path to developing such infrastructure.\nWith contributors from 12 universities across the globe, the Digital Credentials Consortium\u2019s new white paper,\nBuilding the digital credential infrastructure for the future , outlines a trusted, distributed, and shared infrastructure that provides viable standards for issuing, storing, displaying, and verifying digital academic credentials. While the Consortium\u2019s research focuses on verified digital academic credentials in higher education, the group also turns a critical lens to interoperability standards for post-secondary, lifelong learning, and non-formal education providers, which extends to credentials for the workplace.\nGeorgia Tech\u2019s Center for 21st Century Universities (C21U) serves as the Institute\u2019s Digital Credentials Consortium liaison and key collaborating unit. The new report features C21U\u2019s\nMatt Lisle , director of digital learning technologies, and\nStuart Freeman , applications developer, as key contributing authors.\n\u201cC21U and the Commission on Creating the Next in Education have experimented with blockchain-based credentials for the past year and we are enthusiastic about the opportunity to collaborate with world-class researchers and technologists to build something that is interoperable across institutional boundaries,\u201d said\nFreeman . \u201cGeorgia Tech is excited to be part of the Digital Credentials Consortium and to contribute to a report that seeks to define crucial standards for the future of digital credentials.\u201d\nIn\nBuilding the digital credential infrastructure for the future , the authors reiterate the group\u2019s commitment to open source and open standards. The report outlines additional credential standards that the Consortium sees as critical to the development of verifiable digital credentials, including:\nFlexible ways to express the identities of issuers and learners that tie into existing university services\nStronger privacy-by-design and privacy-by-default with attention to regional legal frameworks\nMore reliable revocation mechanisms and credential lifecycle management\nDirect learner agency over one's lifelong learning record\nHigher level of consistency between the machine-readable data of the credential, the human-readable visual representation, and the necessary output formats\u2014paper or digital\n\u201cWe\u2019ve set our sights on the design and governance of a technology infrastructure for academic credentials \u2013 transforming credentials into tokens of social and human capital that can create new opportunities for participation in education and industry,\u201d said\nPhilipp Schmidt , advisor to the Vice President of Open Learning at MIT. \u201cOur report marks the first step in the process.\u201d\nAbout the Digital Credentials Consortium\nThe Digital Credentials Consortium (DCC) was founded in 2018 by leading universities with expertise in the design of verifiable digital academic credentials. Driven by a mission to create a trusted, distributed, and shared infrastructure that becomes the standard for issuing, storing, displaying, and verifying digital academic credentials, the DCC\u2019s goal is to contribute to an education landscape that increases learner agency and promotes more equitable learning and career pathways. While the Consortium is primarily concerned with use-cases in higher education, their work is also part of a broader effort to bridge post-secondary and lifelong learning, connecting traditional institutions of higher education, non-formal education providers, as well as the workplace, through interoperable standards.

As learners of all ages encounter rapidly changing workforce demands and seek to learn in new ways, Georgia Tech is committed to leading the initiatives that will define the next generation of educational practices and technologies.\nC21U functions as a research arm of the Office of the Provost and works in tandem with campus administrators and faculty to identify, develop, and test new educational platforms and methodologies. Now home to the Commission on Creating the Next in Education (CNE) Program Office, C21U fosters projects that will redefine the entire pipeline of learning. This effort requires close collaboration with and integration of K-12 education as a key part of our commitment to lifetime education. Innovation in this area is led by the Center for Education Integrating Science, Mathematics, and Computing (CEISMC).\nLearn more at\nc21u.gatech.edu\nor connect with us on Twitter\n@c21u .
