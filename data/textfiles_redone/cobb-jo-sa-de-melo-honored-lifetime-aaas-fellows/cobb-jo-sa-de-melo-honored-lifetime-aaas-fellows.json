Cobb, Hanjoong Jo, and Carlos A. R. Sa de Melo are among AAAS scientists, engineers, and innovators being recognized for scientifically and socially distinguished achievements.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nEmail\nThe AAAS Fellowship Rosette symbolizes the honor that AAAS bestows upon its members whose efforts on behalf of the advancement of science or its applications in service to society have distinguished them among their peers.\nJan 26, 2022\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nThe American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) has elected three faculty from Georgia Tech and Emory University to the newest class of AAAS Fellows, one of the highest distinctions in the scientific community:\nKim M. Cobb , Georgia Power Chair, director of the\nGlobal Change Program , and ADVANCE Professor in the\nSchool of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences ,\nCollege of Sciences\nHanjoong Jo , Wallace H. Coulter Distinguished Faculty Chair in Biomedical Engineering and the\nCoulter Department of Biomedical Engineering \u2019s associate chair for\nEmory University\nCarlos A. R. Sa de Melo , professor in the\nSchool of Physics , College of Sciences\nThe 2021 class of\nAAAS Fellows\nincludes 564 scientists, engineers, and innovators spanning 24 scientific disciplines who are being recognized for their scientifically and socially distinguished achievements. AAAS is the world\u2019s largest general scientific society and publisher of the\nScience\nfamily of journals.\nTech\u2019s trio of honorees lead a spectrum of global research spanning climate variability and trends to theoretical physics to atherosclerosis.\nKim M. Cobb\nGeology & Geography | For distinguished service to the field of paleoclimatology and in outreach and education to foster a new generation of earth scientists who are engaged with the real world.\n\u201cAs a climate scientist,\u201d Cobb shares, \u201cit\u2019s thrilling to uncover some of Earth\u2019s longest held secrets. In that way, our research has always been its own reward to me. But this honor is special, and a true testament to the outsized contributions of our team\u2019s research faculty, students, and staff.\u201d\nThe mission of\nCobb\u2019s research\nis to uncover the mechanisms of global climate change \u2014 both natural and anthropogenic \u2014 to inform regional projections of future climate change.\nMore recently, her research has included the study of climate extremes in Georgia, with the aim of bolstering community resilience to climate change impacts.\nAs historically marginalized communities are most vulnerable to such impacts, Cobb explains, she works with a large team of colleagues and students that includes social scientists, as well as local officials and community organizations. Her AAAS Fellow citation recognizes her sustained efforts in communicating climate science to policymakers and the general public.\nHanjoong Jo\nBiological Science | For distinguished contributions to atherosclerosis research, especially in discovering the role of blood flow on endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis using novel animal models and cultured cells.\nJo\u2019s research focuses on better understanding atherosclerosis, a buildup of artery-clogging fats and cholesterol that can lead to heart attacks and strokes.\n\u201cI am deeply honored and humbled to be elected as an AAAS Fellow,\u201d\nshares Jo . \u201cThis election recognizes my lifetime contribution to vascular mechanobiology and atherosclerosis by a distinguished group of AAAS Fellows, who are themselves accomplished leaders in broad [science, technology, engineering, and mathematics] fields.\u201d\nCarlos A. R. Sa de Melo\nPhysics | For seminal contributions to superconductivity and superfluidity, particularly the crossover from BCS (Bardeen\u2013Cooper\u2013Schrieffer) superconductivity to Bose-Einstein condensation in ultra-cold atoms, and for communicating these advances to students and the public.\nSa de Melo\u2019s work focuses on theoretical condensed matter and ultra-cold atomic and molecular physics: superconductors, quantum magnets, superfluids, and Bose-Einstein condensates.\n\u201cI strongly encourage my students to be broad, deep and creative,\u201d he shares. \u201cBreadth of knowledge is very important in today's physics job market, as is expert (deep) knowledge in a particular area.\u201d But most of all, he adds, it\u2019s \u201cthe development of new directions, never explored before\u201d comprising the dominant component of his research.\n\u201cI am very thankful to the colleagues that have nominated me for such a recognition \u2014 to my students and postdocs for their collaboration,\u201d Sa de Melo says, \u201cand to the AAAS Council for electing me to the rank of Fellow for contributions to theoretical physics in the fields of superconductivity and superfluidity.\u201d\nA tradition since 1874\n\u201cAAAS is proud to bestow the honor of AAAS Fellow to some of today\u2019s brightest minds who are integral to forging our path into the future,\u201d says Dr. Sudip Parikh, AAAS chief executive officer and\nScience\nexecutive publisher. \u201cWe celebrate these distinguished individuals for their invaluable contributions to the scientific enterprise.\u201d\nThis tradition stretches back to 1874. AAAS Fellows are a \u201cdistinguished cadre of scientists, engineers, and innovators who have been recognized for their achievements across disciplines ranging from research, teaching, and technology, to administration in academia, industry, and government, to excellence in communicating and interpreting science to the public.\u201d\nAAAS members achieve the rank of Fellow through a rigorous annual nomination and selection process. Cobb, Jo, and Sa de Melo join\nmore than 90 faculty\nfrom Georgia Tech faculty elected as Fellows since 1954, including\nKaye Husbands Fealing , dean of the Ivan Allen College of Liberal Arts, who also serves on the AAAS Executive Board \u2014 along with\nseveral fellow Georgia Tech faculty\ninducted as AAAS members, including\nSusan Lozier , dean of the College of Sciences and Betsy Middleton and John Clark Sutherland Chair.\nThe new class of Fellows will receive an official certificate and a gold and blue rosette pin to commemorate their election (representing science and engineering, respectively) and will be celebrated at an AAAS commemoration later this year. The cohort is also featured in the AAAS News & Notes section of\nScience\nfor January 2022.\n***\nThe\nGeorgia Institute of Technology , or Georgia Tech, is a top 10 public research university developing leaders who advance technology and improve the human condition. The Institute offers business, computing, design, engineering, liberal arts, and sciences degrees. Its nearly 44,000 students representing 50 states and 149 countries, study at the main campus in Atlanta, at campuses in France and China, and through distance and online learning. As a leading technological university, Georgia Tech is an engine of economic development for Georgia, the Southeast, and the nation, conducting more than $1 billion in research annually for government, industry, and society.\nThe\nAmerican Association for the Advancement of Science\n(AAAS) is the world\u2019s largest general scientific society and publisher of the journal\nScience , as well as\nScience Translational Medicine ;\nScience Signaling ; a digital, open-access journal,\nScience Advances ;\nScience Immunology;\nand\nScience Robotics . AAAS was founded in 1848 and includes more than 250 affiliated societies and academies of science, serving 10 million individuals. The nonprofit AAAS is open to all and fulfills its mission to \u201cadvance science and serve society\u201d through initiatives in science policy, international programs, science education, public engagement, and more.
