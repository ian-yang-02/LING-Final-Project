Kosal, an associate professor in the\u00a0 Sam Nunn School of International Affairs \u00a0at the Georgia Institute of Technology.\n\u201cDo we need to recognize the value of space as a domain crucial to U.S. national security and our economy? Absolutely,\u201d said\u00a0 Kosal , a former advisor for science and technology in the Office of the Secretary of Defense. \u201cDo we need to better fund basic and applied research? Absolutely. Do we need to have more robust thinking about space as a military and commercial domain? Absolutely. Is a Space Force the best, or second- or third-best way to do that? No.\u201d\nVice President Mike Pence announced \u00a0August\u00a09, 2018 that the United States would seek to establish a U.S. Space Force as a separate branch of the military by 2020. President Donald Trump publicly proposed such a branch in June.\nKosal, an expert in military technology, said it is unclear what a Space Force would do beyond the existing roles handled by other military organizations. She said it also could be a destabilizing influence internationally, inducing other nations, such as China and Russia, to stand up their own versions of a military space force.\n\u201cThat may drive a militarization of space,\u201d she said.\nOne possible benefit of such a service branch, she said, might be greater emphasis on basic and applied research that could help drive new discoveries.\nBut, she said, a better way to do that would be to direct more money to research into space-related technologies, as well as the civilian space program.\n\u201cIf a Space Force brings more attention to the importance of space and space exploration, that could be very good broadly,\u201d she said. \u201cIf it brings more prominence and serious work regarding the role of space-based operations in a security context that could be good. If it takes away from the already good work being done in under-funded programs in the U.S. Air Force and NASA that would not be good.\u201d\nThe Sam Nunn School of International Affairs is\u00a0a unit of the Georgia Tech\u00a0 Ivan Allen College of Liberal Arts .\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nScience, Technology, and the Future of Warfare (blog post)\nContact\nRebecca Keane\nDirector of Communications\nrebecca.keane@iac.gatech.edu\n404.894.1720\nEmail\nrebecca.keane@iac.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
