Now, devices often have embedded web servers. The human-machine interfaces \u2014 think keypads or control panels like this \u2014 are actually mini web browsers rendering a web page with readouts of the current status and digital visualizations of the controls. This web-based architecture is opening the door to a new kind of malware attack that could give bad actors full control of critical infrastructure or other industrial systems.\nFeb 29, 2024\nIn recent years, browser and web-based technology has become a powerful tool for operators of infrastructure and industrial systems. But it also has opened a new pathway for bad actors to seize control of these systems, potentially endangering critical power, water, and other infrastructure. Georgia Tech researchers have found a way to hijack the computers that control these physical systems. Called programmable logic controllers (PLCs), they increasingly have embedded webservers and are accessed on site via web browsers. Attackers can exploit this approach and gain full access to the system. That means they could spin motors out of control, shut off power relays or water pumps, disrupt internet or telephone communication, or steal critical information. They could even launch weapons \u2014 or stop the launch of weapons. \u201cWe think there is an entirely new class of PLC malware that's just waiting to happen. We're calling it web-based PLC malware. And it gives you full device and physical process control,\u201d said Ryan Pickren, a Ph.D. student in the\nSchool of Electrical and Computer Engineering\n(ECE) and the lead author of a new study describing the malware and its implications. The research team will\npresent their findings Feb. 29\nat the\n2024 Network and Distributed Systems Security Symposium .
