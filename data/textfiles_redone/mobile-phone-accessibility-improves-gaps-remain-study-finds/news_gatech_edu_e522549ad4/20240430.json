CACP houses the Wireless RERC.\n\u201cA person without a disability can take it for granted that they can go into a wireless store and leave with a phone that has the features they want,\u201d LaForce said. \u201cThese data show that may not be the case for people with disabilities.\u201d\nFor instance, 84 percent of phones offered under traditional, or Tier One, plans offered by wireless carriers included built-in text-to-speech readers, an important feature for many people with vision disabilities. Among Lifeline phones, 26 percent of phones included that feature, according to the Wireless RERC analysis.\nAlso, the study found that 17 percent of Lifeline phones examined included access to potentially lifesaving WEA alerts, compared to 84 percent of models offered through Tier One plans.\n\u201cThis statistic is particularly troubling because some of the nation\u2019s populations which are most vulnerable to the effects of disasters are not receiving critical access to WEA messages,\u201d the researchers wrote.\nAmong other findings in the report:\nSmartphones are more likely than non-smartphones to include a broad range of accessibility features. According to the report, smartphones were more likely to include accessibility features in 20 of 24 features examined. This is of note because non-smartphones are less expensive than their display-screen oriented counterparts and sometimes preferred by people with lower incomes, older people, or people with specific disabilities for whom durability is a key concern.\nNearly six in ten phones (58 percent) lacked video calling features needed by people who primarily communicate via American Sign Language.\nAn \u201coverwhelming percentage\u201d of mobile phones lack good or excellent hearing aid compatibility ratings.\nThe study included phones from the four major U.S. carriers, one prepaid carrier and five randomly selected Lifeline carriers. The report did not include assessments of individual phone models or operating systems.\nThe Wireless RERC, whose primary mission is to harness wireless technology to empower people with disabilities to live independently, prepared the study for submission to the Federal Communications Commission as part of the agency\u2019s biennial review of the Twenty First Century Communications and Video Accessibility Act of 2010 (CVAA).\nThe law, which is sometimes called the \u201cADA for communications,\u201d governs access to advanced communications technologies such as voice over internet, chat, and video calling.\nThe report calls on FCC regulators to give extra attention to CVAA compliance among Lifeline providers to increase access to the WEA system and other accessibility features.\nThe full report is available on the Wireless RERC website at\nhttps://b.gatech.edu/2RMcM42 .\nThe Wireless RERC and CACP are part of Georgia Tech\u2019s School of Public Policy, a unit of the Ivan Allen College of Liberal Arts.\nWriter : Michael Pearson, Ivan Allen College of Liberal Arts\nAdditional Images\nContact\nJohn Toon\nResearch News\n(404) 894-6986\nEmail\njtoon@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
