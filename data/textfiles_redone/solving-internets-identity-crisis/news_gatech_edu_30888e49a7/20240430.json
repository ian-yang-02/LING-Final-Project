But identity trust is a serious problem for Internet Service Providers (ISPs) who are responsible for routing billions of users to the right destination every day. Researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology are working on a new, multi-year project funded by the National Science Foundation, called \u201cResource Public Key Infrastructure,\u201d to help end Internet trickery. It begins with new tools that allow ISPs to better verify the true owner of a network and legitimate traffic paths. \u201cWe know it\u2019s easy to lie on the Internet,\u201d says primary investigator\u00a0 Russ Clark , a senior research scientist in the School of Computer Science at Georgia Tech. \u201cIt happens because of a weakness in the trust relationship between routing protocols. Those protocols were not designed to recognize imposters and especially not fake ISPs.\u201d Clark, along with\u00a0 Cas D\u2019Angelo \u00a0and\u00a0 Scott Friedrich \u00a0from Georgia Tech\u2019s Office of Information Technology and undergraduate student\u00a0 Sam Norris \u00a0(EIA), will address the Internet identity problem with new protocols such as RPKI, the Resource Public Key Infrastructure. Trust is determined in the router and the server resources alongside. To verify that network owners are legitimate, Georgia Tech will add a new type of server to the routing infrastructure as a first step. Next, it will update the software inside routers, gradually deploying the changes through the Southern Crossroads Internet Exchange (SoX), documenting observations, and creating a recipe for others across the United States to follow. \u201cThis solution has been known for about the past five years, but network operators are reluctant to try it out of fear of slowing down traffic for customers in the interim,\u201d Clark says. \u201cThe NSF tasked Georgia Tech with moving deployment along. We\u2019re going to prove that it\u2019s possible, work through the pains, and show others how to do it.\u201d The deployment will happen in phases. In addition to Georgia Tech researchers and labs, Clark and his team help manage the Southern Crossroads (SoX) regional network where 21 member institutions come together for shared network services. The project team expects to deploy over SoX in the next year. \u201cIn the quest to make the Internet faster, we\u2019ve often tried to find the shortest route to a website. This is making us vulnerable,\u201d Clark says. \u201cNow, we need to find the smartest route.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nContact\nTara La Bouff Communications Manager 404.894.7253\nEmail\ntlabouff@cc.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
