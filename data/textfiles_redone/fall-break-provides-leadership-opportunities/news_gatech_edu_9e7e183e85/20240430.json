In addition to the service work, they will hike, camp, and cook within in the park.\n\u201cJoining an alternative service break expedition to the Great Smoky Mountains is an educational adventure that empowers students to become environmental advocates,\u201d said Jayde Nelson, director of Civic Engagement in the Center for Student Engagement and advisor for the trip. \u201cBy restoring the forest, assisting in ongoing field projects and helping protect and preserve the natural and cultural resources in the park, they not only renew nature\u2019s splendor but also their own sense of purpose and responsibility.\u201d\nAlex Canedo, a first-year industrial engineering major, is one of the trip leaders. \u201c Some of my best memories come from the time spent with my family at national parks observing the natural beauty of America,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I heard about the opportunity to lead a service trip to the Great Smoky Mountains, I thought this would be a fun way to give back to the National Parks Service while also learning about the important work that goes on behind the scenes to maintain these beautiful places.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nAlternative Service Breaks\nFall Break Activities Around Atlanta\nMeet Jayde Nelson\nContact\nVictor Rogers\nInstitute Communications\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
