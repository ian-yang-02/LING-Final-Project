That capability could enable devices based on the origami\u2019s structure to reconfigure to point the arcs in opposite directions on the fly.\nLike any other origami, the pattern starts with a flat sheet of paper, which is then folded along concentric squares. Those folds combine to pull the tips of the paper in opposite directions, forming the opposing arcs of a hyperbolic paraboloid.\nTo understand more about the mechanisms that creates the saddle shapes, the researchers created a theoretical model that could serve to predict the behavior of the origami, and their analysis reinforced the idea that the structure exhibited the same characteristics of its geometric counterpart.\n\u201cOne of the really interesting things we found was that the folds of concentric squares did not have to be uniform in their offsets in order to form the hypar origami,\u201d said Ke Liu, a former graduate student at Georgia Tech and now a postdoctoral fellow at the California Institute of Technology. \u201cSo some squares could be quite close together and others farther apart and still the overall shape would be a hyperbolic paraboloid.\u201d\nHowever, the researchers noted that lack of uniformity in the folds would alter other aspects of the structure, such as how much energy would be needed to push it into its hypar shape.\n\u201cYou could theoretically tune each individual hypar origami structure by changing the scale of these folds, and it would change how that structure responds to pressures pushing against it,\u201d Liu said. \u201cFuture designs for robotics or other electronics could utilize this sort of snapping behavior.\u201d\nThe researchers also folded the origami into an array of squares so that four hypar origami patterns were formed on the same sheet of material.\u00a0A physical model showed that the structure has as many as 32 different stable configurations.\n\u201cThe hypar tessellation with multiple stable states has promising applications as stimulus responsive metasurfaces and switches,\u201d said Tomohiro Tachi, who is an associate professor at the University of Tokyo, Japan.\n\u201cThese types of configurations could lay the groundwork for future metasurfaces with reconfigurable properties and a high level of tunability,\u201d said Paulino, who is also the Raymond Allen Jones Chair of Engineering in the School of Civil and Environmental Engineering.\nThis research was supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF) under grant CMMI-1538830 and by the Raymond Allen Jones Chair at the Georgia Institute of Technology.
