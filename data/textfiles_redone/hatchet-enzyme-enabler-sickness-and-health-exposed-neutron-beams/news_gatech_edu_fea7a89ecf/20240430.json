Credit:\u00a0Genevieve Martin/ORNL\nFeb 06, 2018\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nTucked away inside cell membranes, a molecular butcher does the bidding of healthy cells but also of disease agents. It has been operating out of clear view, but researchers just shined a mighty spotlight on it.\nThe butcher is a common enzyme called presenilin, which chops lengthy protein building blocks down to useable shorter lengths. It resides in membrane spaces that evade ready experimental detection, but\u00a0 in a new study, researchers \u00a0at the Georgia Institute of Technology and Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) have illuminated\u00a0 presenilin \u00a0using a neutron beam produced by the world's most powerful research nuclear reactor.\nPresenilin is one of many mysterious protein structures residing in our cell membranes, where they are essential to life.\n\u201cOne-third of our genome goes to work to encode intramembrane proteins,\u201d said\u00a0 Raquel Lieberman, an associate professor \u00a0in Georgia Tech\u2019s School of Chemistry and Biochemistry. \u201cSome of them are huge and do super complex biochemistry.\u201d\nPresenilin is an enzyme, more particularly an\u00a0 intramembrane protease . There are four classes of these, and they are needed, among other things, for: Alerting to and defending against infectors, and cell differentiation and development.\nIf the latter two go wrong, that can lead to cancer.\nGrainy neutron mugshot\nNow, the researchers have gotten their first figurative mugshot of an intramembrane protein, the presenilin. Technically speaking, the researchers worked with a presenilin cousin found in microbes --\u00a0 M. marisnigri \u00a0intramembrane aspartyl protease or MmIAP -- but here we will use presenilin and MmIAP interchangeably for simplicity\u2019s sake.\nThe measurement was low-resolution but revealed enough to establish that the protein structure is more simply put together than previously believed, and that surprised the scientists.\n\u201cOur sample shows that this is\u00a0 a monomer all by itself,\u201d Lieberman said. \u201cWe were expecting a dimer or a trimer .\u201d That means it was made up of one long strand, mostly coiled up like a spring, instead of doubled-up or tripled-up curly strands.\nPresenilin (MmIAP) is armed with two chemical knives,\u00a0 aspartates , that reliably make cuts on peptides,\u00a0subunits that make up proteins.\u00a0 And a second new study \u00a0by the same researchers illuminated how the cleaving works.\nAnybody\u2019s peptide butcher\nPresenilin can trim peptides into building blocks helpful to its own cells, or whittle bad peptide chunks that end up in amyloid-beta plaque, a suspect in\u00a0 Alzheimer\u2019s disease . Or presenilin can aid and abate\u00a0 hepatitis C \u00a0viruses by carving components it needs to reproduce.\nUnderstanding how presenilin works could one day prove useful to medical research. \u201cIf you could find a way to interfere with it selectively, you could stop the spread of hepatitis C in the body,\u201d Lieberman said.\nThe researchers, led by Lieberman and neutron scattering scientist\u00a0 Volker Urban from ORNL , published the revelations of the neutron scattering\u00a0 on February 6, 2018, in\u00a0 Biophysical Journal . The new insights into presenilin functioning are to officially publish in March\u00a0 in the \u00a0Journal of Biological Chemistry \u00a0but the study is currently available online without embargo . First authors were Swe-Htet Naing of Georgia Tech and Ryan Oliver of Oak Ridge.\nResearch was funded by the National Science Foundation, the National Institutes of Health, and the U.S. Department of Energy.\nHerding hydrophobic hiders\nBy going to the High Flux Isotope Reactor (HFIR), the scientists were reaching for the big gun\u00a0to make presenilin (MmIAP) come out of hiding.\nHFIR\u2019s neutron beams were cooled to minus 253 degrees Celsius (minus 424 degrees Fahrenheit) to slow the neutrons down, so they could probe molecular features of the biological samples.\nPresenilin and other intramembrane proteins warrant such proverbial desperate measures. They live in a lipid environment and hate water about the way cats do, and that\u2019s a problem for researchers studying them.\n\u201cWhen you have proteins that are not soluble in water, you\u2019re in trouble,\u201d Lieberman said. \u201cThe usual techniques to analyze them become very, very difficult, if not impossible. And when you chemically bootstrap these proteins to be able use these water-soluble methods, you have really poor chances of seeing the protein\u2019s actual structure that performs its function.\u201d\nForm follows function\nImages derived from water-based analytical methods in Lieberman\u2019s lab have not completely jibed with presenilin\u2019s function. For one, the enzyme\u2019s cutting surfaces have been too far apart. The neutron beam\u2019s revelations indicated a form that seemed more logical.\n\u201cOur shape was tighter, and made more sense with presenilin\u2019s function in its natural setting in the membrane,\u201d Lieberman said.\nThe presenilin (MmIAP) samples examined at the HFIR were suspended in a solution friendly to the\u00a0 hydrophobic protein . Ironically, presenilin and other intramembrane proteases often\u00a0 hydrolyze\u00a0 peptides, in other words, they add water to them.\n\u201cThese proteases are confined to the lipid cell membrane where there is no water. Since water is required for hydrolysis, it has to come from outside the membrane,\u201d Lieberman said. \u201cHow that happens is yet another mystery that needs uncovering.\u201d\nRobust, reliable cleavers\nThe precision and consistency, with which the presenilin\u00a0 homologue \u00a0MmIAP cleaved peptides, impressed the researchers.\n\u201cWhen we used a model synthetic peptide, it cleaved only at very specific positions on the peptide,\u201d Lieberman said. \u201cWhen we switched to a real biological peptide, it also cleaved very exactly.\u201d\nThe researchers put the presenilin through various mutations, which had little to no effect on its cleaving abilities. That could mean that its baseline functioning is nearly immune to genetic interference.\nOn a chilling note, when the researchers observed the microbial presenilin cousin, MmIAP, cutting amyloid-beta precursor peptides, it always made the chop in a way notorious for amyloid\u2019s association with\u00a0 Alzheimer\u2019s disease .\n\u201cWe never saw the cut that made what is typically viewed as the \u2018good\u2019 amyloid, A-beta-40,\u201d Lieberman said. \u201cWe only saw cuts that led to the \u2018bad\u2019 amyloid, A-beta-42.\u201d\nMore research would be needed to explain why that happened; if the same is true for presenilin in human cell membranes, and also if some regulator prevents the creation or accumulation of so much bad amyloid in healthy cells.\nLike this article?\u00a0 Get our email newsletter here.\nAlso READ:\nAlzheimer's: Killing the Mind First\nKevin Weiss from Oak Ridge National Laboratory coauthored the study in Biophysical Journal.
