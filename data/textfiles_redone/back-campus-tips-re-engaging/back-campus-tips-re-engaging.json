Individuals who are not fully vaccinated are strongly encouraged to wear a face covering while inside campus facilities.\nJul 08, 2021\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nIn the coming weeks, many more students and employees will be physically coming to campus again \u2014 some of them for the first time since last spring. For some, the change won\u2019t be much of a concern. For others, re-engaging in person may cause anxiety or even fear.\n\u201cMany people have concerns about returning to more in-person interactions and the life they had before the pandemic,\u201d said Tiffiny Hughes-Troutman, director of the Center for Assessment, Referral, and Education (CARE). \u201cKeep in mind that we have all become more accustomed to interacting with fewer people. Therefore, some in-person meetings and events could feel extremely overwhelming and anxiety-provoking.\u201d\nOn the other hand, many have experienced video fatigue and will be excited about re-engaging socially and reconnecting with others.\n\u201cMany students experienced loneliness and isolation during the pandemic,\u201d Hughes-Troutman said. \u201cWe are social creatures and need human interaction to survive. Health researchers point out that people who are chronically lacking in social contact are more likely to experience elevated levels of stress.\u201d\nSome employees, like Savannah Torrance, reservations and event coordinator with the Student Center, have been working on campus during most of the pandemic. In the spring of 2020 she worked online for two months before coming back.\n\u201cI was nervous because at the time we were going through the second surge of cases in the country, but more specifically Atlanta,\u201d said Torrance, who works on campus three to four days a week. \u201cI overcame my fear by coming in and following the preventive measures recommended by our campus experts. Even while our department shifted operations from the Student Center to the Exhibition Hall, we upheld and enforced all of Georgia Tech\u2019s Covid-19 health and safety policies.\u201d\nHughes-Troutman believes it is important to recognize the range of post-pandemic responses and understand that every individual will have their own approach.\n\u201cLeaders and managers should carve out time to execute a plan that acknowledges the unique response that employees will have, and not expect things to be exactly as they were before,\u201d she said, noting that living and working through a pandemic have provided an opportunity to closely examine health and well-being in new ways.\n\u201cDespite the challenges of the pandemic, many have benefited from the opportunity to connect with family and friends, to focus on holistic health, and to adopt new routines and rituals,\u201d Hughes-Troutman said. \u201cThe ability to work in comfortable clothes, being at home more with family, and having more time to get some sun or fit in some physical activity between meetings has been an upside for many. As we adjust our schedules for more time on campus, make note of the healthy lifestyle habits and practices that you wish to retain.\u201d\nFor Torrance, whose job includes processing and corresponding with more than 15,000 annual client reservation requests, working remotely forced her to change the way she carries out daily tasks and procedures.\n\u201cWe previously did a lot of our work with tangible items and have now been able to shift a lot of our work to a digital format,\u201d she said. \u201cBut being in person allows me to better explain and convey our spaces and their capabilities. With a brand new space, the Exhibition Hall, it can often be difficult to conceptualize how to host in the space. Being in person can only make event planning go better.\u201d\nTips for Managing Anxiety\nHughes-Troutman; Chris Wiese, assistant professor in the Department of Psychology; and Joi Alexander, director of Health Initiatives, give these tips on managing anxiety and adjusting to the return:\nSelf-soothe and\npractice self-care . Journal or engage in creative, healthy self-expression when you feel worried; practice mindfulness,\nmeditation , and aromatherapy; get adequate sleep and nutrition.\nTake cognitive control. Try to control your thoughts, keep a positive health attitude, and engage in healthy coping behaviors. This pandemic is temporary, even though it may not seem that way to you.\nPractice self-kindness instead of judging and criticizing yourself if you feel anxious and overwhelmed. It\u2019s OK to react negatively to a stressor. Try to recognize and accept that you are feeling a certain way.\nIncorporate physical activity. Engage in physical activity by exercising with friends or family. Get outdoors, use online fitness resources, take a\nvirtual fitness class , and set exercise goals. In addition to physical activity, passive and social activity can help individuals recover from a stressful experience.\nReach out for help. If you find yourself having persistently disturbing or negative thoughts, feeling hopeless, or simply not bouncing back to your usual self after trying some of these techniques, then seek professional help.
