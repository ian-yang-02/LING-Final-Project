The 3D additive/subtractive \u201csculpting\u201d can be done without changing the chemistry of the electron beam deposition chamber, providing the foundation for building a new generation of nanoscale structures.\nBased on focused electron beam-induced processing (FEBID) techniques, the work could allow production of 2D/3D complex nanostructures and functional nanodevices useful in quantum communications, sensing, and other applications. For oxygen-containing materials such as graphene oxide, etching can be done without introducing outside materials, using oxygen from the substrate.\n\u201cBy timing and tuning the energy of the electron beam, we can activate interaction of the beam with oxygen in the graphene oxide to do etching, or interaction with hydrocarbons on the surface to create carbon deposition,\u201d said\nAndrei Fedorov , professor and Rae S. and Frank H. Neely Chair in the\nGeorge W. Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering\nat the Georgia Institute of Technology. \u201cWith atomic-scale control, we can produce complicated patterns using direct write-remove processes. Quantum systems require precise control on an atomic scale, and this could enable a host of potential applications.\u201d\nThe technique was described August 7 in the journal\nACS Applied Materials & Interfaces . The work was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science, Basic Energy Sciences. Coauthors included researchers from Pusan National University in South Korea.\nCreation of nanoscale structures is traditionally done using a multistep process of photoresist coating and patterning by photo- or electron beam lithography, followed by bulk dry/wet etching or deposition. Use of this process limits the range of functionalities and structural topologies that can be achieved, increases the complexity and cost, and risks contamination from the multiple chemical steps, creating barriers to fabrication of new types of devices from sensitive 2D materials.\nFEBIP enables a material chemistry/site-specific, high-resolution multimode atomic scale processing and provides unprecedented opportunities for \u201cdirect-write,\u201d single-step surface patterning of 2D nanomaterials with an in-situ imaging capability. It allows for realizing a rapid multiscale/multimode \u201ctop-down and bottom-up\u201d approach, ranging from an atomic scale manipulation to a large-area surface modification on nano- and microscales.\n\u201cBy tuning the time and the energy of the electrons, you can either remove material or add material,\u201d Fedorov said. \u201cWe did not expect that upon electron exposure of graphene oxide we would start etching patterns.\u201d\nWith graphene oxide, the electron beam introduces atomic scale perturbations into the 2D-arranged carbon atoms and uses embedded oxygen as an etchant to remove carbon atoms in precise patterns without introduction of a material into the reaction chamber. Fedorov said any oxygen-containing material might produce the same effect. \u201cIt\u2019s like the graphene oxide carries its own etchant,\u201d he said. \u201cAll we need to activate it is to \u2018seed\u2019 the reaction with electrons of appropriate energy.\u201d\nFor adding carbon, keeping the electron beam focused on the same spot for a longer time generates an excess of lower-energy electrons by interactions of the beam with the substrate to decompose the hydrocarbon molecules onto the surface of the graphene oxide. In that case, the electrons interact with the hydrocarbons rather than the graphene and oxygen atoms, leaving behind liberated carbon atoms as a 3D deposit.\n\u201cDepending on how many electrons you bring to it, you can grow structures of different heights away from the etched grooves or from the two-dimensional plane,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can think of it almost like holographic writing with excited electrons, substrate and adsorbed molecules combined at the right time and the right place.\u201d\nThe process should be suitable for depositing materials such as metals and semiconductors, though precursors would need to be added to the chamber for their creation. The 3D structures, just nanometers high, could serve as spacers between layers of graphene or as active sensing elements or other devices on the layers.\n\u201cIf you want to use graphene or graphene oxide for quantum mechanical devices, you should be able to position layers of material with a separation on the scale of individual carbon atoms,\u201d Fedorov said. \u201cThe process could also be used with other materials.\u201d\nUsing the technique, high-energy electron beams can produce feature sizes just a few nanometers wide. Trenches etched in surfaces could be filled with metals by introducing metal atoms containing precursors.\nBeyond simple patterns, the process could also be used to grow complex structures. \u201cIn principle, you could grow a structure like a nanoscale Eiffel Tower with all the intricate details,\u201d Fedorov said. \u201cIt would take a long time, but this is the level of control that is possible with electron beam writing.\u201d\nThough systems have been built to use multiple electron beams in parallel, Fedorov doesn\u2019t see them being used in high-volume applications. More likely, he said, is laboratory use to fabricate unique structures useful for research purposes.\n\u201cWe are demonstrating structures that would otherwise be impossible to produce,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to enable the exploitation of new capabilities in areas such as quantum devices. This technique could be an imagination enabler for interesting new physics coming our way with graphene and other interesting materials.\u201d\nIn addition to Fedorov, the research team included Songkil Kim, SungYeb Jung, Jaekwang Lee, and Seokjun Kim from Pusan National University in South Korea.\nThis research was supported primarily by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Basic Energy Sciences, under award no.
