Institute researchers contributed to a NASA-commissioned study that just proposed\u00a0a way to land there and examine surface samples. It would mark the first such serious attempt to look for life in the solar system since the Mars Viking probes of the mid-1970s.\nThat\u2019s according to\nJames Green , director of NASA\u2019s Planetary Sciences Division. Green wowed a standing-room-only crowd on Monday with a guided tour of Europa, Mars, the dwarf planet and former asteroid Ceres, and other celestial bodies that might contain the basic recipes for life.\n\u201cWe\u2019re finding new and exciting places where life might exist,\u201d Green told the audience. \u201cSearching for life is going to take all our efforts \u2013 from biology to chemistry to planetary science and everything in between. And I\u2019m proud to say that Georgia Tech is doing fabulously in this area, and I hope it continues.\u201d\nThat Georgia Tech-NASA connection has yielded findings like the much-heralded\n2015 discovery of flowing water on Mars . The most recent example, however, is the Feb. 8 release of a\nNASA-commissioned science definition team study \u00a0co-authored by\nBritney Schmidt , a planetary scientist in the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences.\nSchmidt, who spends time in Antarctica studying how organisms survive in frozen or near-freezing worlds, is part of a team proposing a 2021 mission to Europa. A lander would set down on the moon\u2019s icy crust and take samples from above and below the surface that might bear proof of current or past organic activity.\n\u201cIf you get past the surface, Europa looks a lot like Earth,\u201d Schmidt said. \u201cIt\u2019s water, it\u2019s interacting with rock, it has a lot of the same chemistry, a lot of the same temperatures. We\u2019re very biased because we stand on rocks, but if you go to the Antarctic where we work, some things there would not be surprised or not be sad if they were living on Europa.\u201d\nThe study includes descriptions of the instrumentation that would be needed not only to find proof of life on Europa, but also to determine whether the moon was ever habitable.\n\u201cWe should be examining places in the solar system that give us the best opportunity to understand what the limits of life really are,\u201d Schmidt said. \u201cRight now the only limits seem to be our own imagination.\u201d\nImages and descriptions from Green \u2013\u00a0all courtesy of the latest findings from deep-space probes, planetary rovers, and orbiting telescopes \u2013\u00a0fired the audience\u2019s imagination. Green\u2019s solar system tour included the sulfuric acid rain and crushing atmospheric pressures of\u00a0Venus; a rover-lowering \u201cskycrane\u201d in the\nMars 2020\nmission, like the one used to put the Curiosity rover on the planet; the soaring geysers on Saturn\u2019s moon Enceladus, which form \u201ca wall of water\u201d on the icy surface; and the vast methane oceans of another Saturn moon, Titan. \u201cIf there\u2019s any type of life that\u2019s very different from our own,\u201d Green said, \u201cit\u2019s got to be on Titan.\"\u00a0\u00a0Green\u2019s slide showed\u00a0Titan accompanied by a photo of\nStar Trek\u2019s\nMr. Spock and the meme, \u201cIt\u2019s life, Jim, but not as we know it.\u201d\nNASA\u2019s latest data, extensively analyzed by government and academic researchers, is giving the agency some new paths to consider as it plots the next phase of unmanned missions to search for life.\n\u201cIn these last 10 years in particular, what we\u2019ve decided to go after is really to follow the water,\u201d Green said. \u201cThe water in our solar system has to be an underlying basis for where we might go and look for life. If a body has water today or in its past, perhaps it had life in its past or maybe even today.\u201d\nAnother key ingredient in the recipe for life \u2013 energy \u2013\u00a0doesn\u2019t have to involve only proximity to the sun. It can be generated internally by a planet\u2019s core\u00a0or, in the case of Europa, externally by Jupiter\u2019s tidal forces, which are constantly squeezing the moon. \u201cThe surface may rise or fall by 30 meters,\u201d Green said. \u201cThat heat has got to go somewhere. It melted this ice and created and maintains what we believe is a global ocean.\u201d\nGreen said the search for life also includes exoplanets, planets that orbit suns in other solar systems outside of our own. Much of the current information about exoplanets comes from the\nKepler space telescope , launched in 2009. Some of those exoplanets may be in habitable zones of distant solar systems.\nBut as NASA announced this week, the\nSpitzer Space Telescope \u00a0has revealed the existence of seven Earth-size exoplanets orbiting a single star in the constellation Andromeda, about 40 light years (235 trillion miles) from Earth.\nThat finding was published today in the journal\nNature . All seven exoplanets may have liquid water, and three may lie within their star\u2019s habitable zone.\nPlanetary exploration and the search for life must involve an interdisciplinary scientific approach, College of Sciences Dean Paul M. Goldbart said. \u201cNone of this could be done without the input of geochemists, geobiologists, and geophysicists;\u00a0everyone working together, and everyone knowledgeable about what everyone is doing. It\u2019s this confluence of expertise that makes the whole thing fly.\u201d\nAs for looking beyond the solar system, \u201cwe\u2019re eager to invest in that space between astrophysics, planetary science, and the early-life research,\u201d Goldbart said. \u201cOne or two additional team members would cement the from-the-planets-to-the-cosmos community here at Georgia Tech.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nContact\nRenay San Miguel\nCommunications Officer II/Science Writer\n404-894-5209\nEmail\nrenay.san@cos.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
