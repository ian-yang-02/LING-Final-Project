The attack used intercepted electromagnetic signals from the phones that could have been analyzed using a small portable device costing less than a thousand dollars. Unlike earlier intercept attempts that required analyzing many logins, the \u201cOne & Done\u201d attack was carried out by eavesdropping on just one decryption cycle.\n\u201cThis is something that could be done at an airport to steal people\u2019s information without arousing suspicion and makes the so-called \u2018coffee shop attack\u2019 much more realistic,\u201d said\nMilos Prvulovic , associate chair of Georgia Tech\u2019s\nSchool of Computer Science . \u201cThe designers of encryption software now have another issue that they need to take into account because continuous snooping over long periods of time would no longer be required to steal this information.\u201d\nThe side channel attack is believed to be the first to retrieve the secret exponent of an encryption key in a modern version of OpenSSL without relying on the cache organization and/or timing. OpenSSL is a popular encryption program used for secure interactions on websites and for signature authentication. The attack showed that a single recording of a cryptography key trace was sufficient to break 2048 bits of a private RSA key.\nResults of the research, which was supported in part by the National Science Foundation, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), and the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) will be presented at the 27th USENIX Security Symposium August 16th in Baltimore.\nAfter successfully attacking the phones and an embedded system board \u2013 which all used ARM processors \u2013 the researchers proposed a fix for the vulnerability, which was adopted in versions of the software made available in May.\nSide channel attacks extract sensitive information from signals created by electronic activity within computing devices during normal operation. The signals include electromagnetic emanations created by current flows within the devices computational and power-delivery circuitry, variation in power consumption, and also sound, temperature and chassis potential variation. These emanations are very different from communications signals the devices are designed to produce.\nIn their demonstration, Prvulovic and collaborator\nAlenka Zajic\nlistened in on two different Android phones using probes located near, but not touching the devices. In a real attack, signals could be received from phones or other mobile devices by antennas located beneath tables or hidden in nearby furniture.\nThe \u201cOne & Done\u201d attack analyzed signals in a relatively narrow (40 MHz wide) band around the phones\u2019 processor clock frequencies, which are close to 1 GHz (1,000 MHz). The researchers took advantage of a uniformity in programming that had been designed to overcome earlier vulnerabilities involving variations in how the programs operate.\n\u201cAny variation is essentially leaking information about what the program is doing, but the constancy allowed us to pinpoint where we needed to look,\u201d said Prvulovic. \u201cOnce we got the attack to work, we were able to suggest a fix for it fairly quickly. Programmers need to understand that portions of the code that are working on secret bits need to be written in a very particular way to avoid having them leak.\u201d\nThe researchers are now looking at other software that may have similar vulnerabilities, and expect to develop a program that would allow automated analysis of security vulnerabilities.\n\u201cOur goal is to automate this process so it can be used on any code,\u201d said Zajic, an associate professor in Georgia Tech\u2019s\nSchool of Electrical and Computer Engineering . \u201cWe\u2019d like to be able to identify portions of code that could be leaky and require a fix. Right now, finding these portions requires considerable expertise and manual examination.\u201d\nSide channel attacks are still relatively rare, but Prvulovic says the success of \u201cOne & Done\u201d demonstrates an unexpected vulnerability. The availability of low-cost signal processing devices small enough to use in coffee shops or airports could make the attacks more practical.\n\u201cWe now have relatively cheap and compact devices \u2013 smaller than a USB drive \u2013 that are capable of analyzing these signals,\u201d said Prvulovic. \u201cTen years ago, the analysis of this signal would have taken days. Now it takes just seconds, and can be done anywhere \u2013 not just in a lab setting.\u201d\nProducers of mobile devices are becoming more aware of the need to protect electromagnetic signals of phones, tablets and laptops from interception by shielding their side channel emissions. Improving the software running on the devices is also important, but Prvulovic suggests that users of mobile devices must also play a security role.\n\u201cThis is something that needs to be addressed at all levels,\u201d he said. \u201cA combination of factors \u2013 better hardware, better software and cautious computer hygiene \u2013 make you safer. You should not be paranoid about using your devices in public locations, but you should be cautious about accessing banking systems or plugging your device into unprotected USB chargers.\u201d\nIn addition to those already mentioned, the research involved Monjur M.
