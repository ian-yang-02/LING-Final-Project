These students \u2013 Jasmine Burton, Rachel Ford and Partha Unnava \u2013 developed their entrepreneurial skills and launched startups while enrolled at Georgia Tech. Here is a closer look at the three young entrepreneurs participating in the Exploring Innovation Frontiers Initiative, launched by the Council on Competitiveness: \u00a0 Jasmine Burton Providing access to hygienic bathrooms is not a typical goal for entrepreneurs, but Jasmine Burton represents how entrepreneurs are finding ways to address global problems. Burton was part of the team that invented an inexpensive mobile toilet to address global sanitation problems. The device, called SafiChoo (Swahili for \u201cclean toilet\u201d), combined innovation with humanitarian efforts. It won first place in 2014\u2019s\nInVenture Prize , an annual Georgia Tech contest that rewards students with cash prizes and free patents for big ideas that solve the world\u2019s problems. While the original team members moved on to other endeavors, Burton continued working on the device and launched a social organization called\nWish for WASH , which stands for water, sanitation and hygiene. The group seeks to bring innovation to the world of sanitation.\u00a0 Burton, who graduated in 2014 with a degree in industrial design, travels to promote the organization\u2019s social impact. She will be in Washington, D.C., on Friday to participate in the National Maker Faire.\u00a0 Then next month she moves to Zambia for a yearlong fellowship with the Society for Family Health. While there, she will continue working on the design and implementation of SafiChoo. \u00a0 Rachel Ford Rachel Ford represents how students can push themselves to become entrepreneurs. The fifth-year biomedical engineering major launched two startups while attending Georgia Tech full time. One startup,\nFIXD , created a diagnostic device that helps people understand what\u2019s going on with their cars. It explains the cause behind an illuminated check engine light, diagnoses the seriousness of the problem and provides repair estimates. FIXD originated during last year\u2019s inaugural\nStartup Lab\ncourse, where students hear from different entrepreneurs and form teams to develop startup ideas. The idea was fine-tuned last summer during Startup Summer, where students assess their ideas, participate in customer discovery, meet with potential investors and prepare to launch startups. Her second startup, Succette, won second place at the 2014 InVenture Prize competition. The team redesigned a baby pacifier to more naturally fit a baby\u2019s growing dental structure. She continued working on the medical device during Startup Summer.\u00a0 Through the program, Sucette emphasizes its \u201csmart\u201d design, which enables a change in color to let parents know when their child is becoming sick. \u00a0 Partha Unnava After spending six weeks hobbling in pain after breaking his ankle, Partha Unnava redesigned crutches to minimize underarm pain. The Better Walk invention landed him in the 2014 InVenture Prize finale. A couple of months later, he demonstrated the device to President Barack Obama during the inaugural White House Maker Faire. Since then Unnava withdrew from Tech to focus on launching the\nBetter Walk company . He was named to Forbes\u2019 30 under 30 list, which featured \u201cgame-changing entrepreneurs.\u201d He continues to support Georgia Tech students by teaching entrepreneurship and customer discovery through\nStartup Semester , an optional 10-week program that shows students they can be entrepreneurs while still in college. \u00a0 Experiences from these students is just part of the information the initiative is collecting from key thought leaders to provide direction for future research in innovation, insights to inform future business models, and foundations for public policies that create a supportive environment for sustained innovation-driven growth.\u00a0 The program is sponsored by the National Science Foundation, and today\u2019s event is co-hosted by the Council on Competitiveness, the Georgia Research Alliance, the Metro Atlanta Chamber and Georgia Tech.\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nCreate at Tech\nCouncil on Competitiveness\nContact\nLaura Diamond\u00a0 Georgia Tech Media Relations 404-894-6016\nEmail\nlaura.diamond@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
