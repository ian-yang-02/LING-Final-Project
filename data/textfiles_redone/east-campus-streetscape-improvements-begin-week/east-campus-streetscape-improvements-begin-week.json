Project work will include paving, new curbing, sidewalks, bicycle infrastructure, ADA improvements, lighting, and realigned access to the parking deck. These improvements will allow for increased pedestrian separation from vehicular traffic.\nTo make these improvements, 18 trees, primarily southern sugar maples and crape myrtles, will be removed. A portion of these trees are diseased and will be disposed of properly. New canopy trees will be planted at the appropriate time as part of Georgia Tech\u2019s\ntree care plan .\nThe project will occur in three phases, with expected completion by December. Improved pedestrian, cyclist, and micro-mobility access supports the Institute\u2019s safety, connectivity, and carbon neutrality goals.\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nView on campus map.\nContact\nJerry Young\nLandscape Project Manager/Planning, Design, and Construction\nInfrastructure and Sustainability\nEmail\njerry.young@facilities.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
