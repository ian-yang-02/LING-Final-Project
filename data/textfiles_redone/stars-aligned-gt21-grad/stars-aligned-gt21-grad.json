The Tech white and gold colors have long been beloved by her family. Both her father and older brother\u00a0 graduated from Georgia Tech, and her twin brother will follow in their footsteps in December.\nDuring her time here, Rowe loved sports, the Yellow Jacket Marching Band, and cherished Tech traditions. Growing up, she\u2019d go to football games and cheer with her family but as a student she stood side by side with the marching band. The tight-knit community provided some of her favorite memories of her college experience.\nOnce elected as the RAT dad of the band, a marching band tradition where the elected members provide assistance to first-years in acclimating to Tech and the band, Rowe was in charge of new students and helped pass on her knowledge. After running for it every year since her first year, she was finally elected last May.\n\u201cKnowing that the band trusted me to take on such an important position has been really nice and it\u2019s been a great time to get to know all of the new members.\u201d\nApart from her extracurricular activities and classes, Emily began dating Matthew Leonard, who is also part of the marching band. She likes to say, \u201cThe stars crossed the day that we met,\u201d because of the eclipse. Their paths didn\u2019t cross during marching band camp, but after meeting that day, their paths aligned. They will be getting married in July.\nWith a job lined up after graduation and a new chapter waiting, Emily\u2019s piece of advice for current students is to seek out internships and co-ops. \u201cThese longer times with a company are valuable,\u201d she said. I ended up spending the pandemic tracking toilet paper production for Georgia-Pacific, something I definitely hadn\u2019t anticipated when I started my internship in January.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nContact\nVanesa Vargas\nInstitute Communications\nEmail\nstucomm@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
