They were the same,\u201c he said. \u201cTerms like innovation, interdisciplinarity, partnership, integration, and collaboration, were front and center among all presentations and responses.\u201d\nPresentations and discussions also identified similar challenges, including funding disparities between the humanities and the STEM fields and a traditional view from both humanities\u00a0and STEM-based scholars that each group is part of a separate academic world.\nDespite such challenges, Paula M.\u00a0Krebs, executive director of the Modern Language Association, noted during her opening address to the symposium how many tech firms and even the Columbia University Medical School, which offers a program in \u201cnarrative medicine,\u201d are embracing the skills provided by a humanities education and applying them to technical and scientific disciplines.\n\u201cIf those graduates are better doctors for studying the humanities, what would a better engineer who is fully engaged in the humanities look like?\u201d Krebs asked.\nAs it happens, they might look something like many\u00a0Georgia Tech students, who study or intern abroad at much higher levels than the national average and half of whom voluntarily choose to study a foreign language, compared to 8 percent nationally.\nThe\nIvan Allen College of Liberal Arts , LMC, and the School of Modern Languages also are leading in the fields of language and cultural studies, as Krebs noted.\n\u201cGeorgia Tech itself is a leader in connecting language and education with career possibilities at the undergraduate and graduate levels,\u201d she said. \u201cThe graduate program in\nGlobal Media and Cultures , for example, is the kind of program that makes clear the career value of language study.\u201d\nThat degree, a joint offering of\nLMC\nand Modern Languages, and also the Master of Science in\nApplied Language and Intercultural Studies\nin the School of Modern Languages, are both meant to give students rigorous training in communication and global leadership, preparing them for careers in international business, non-profits, media, social justice, and education.\nOther initiatives are under way at Georgia Tech to help prepare humanities students for interdisciplinary careers in a changing workforce.\nLMC and Modern Languages also each have post-doctoral programs for recent humanities graduates. LMC\u2019s Brittain Fellows program seeks Ph.D. graduates with an interest in \u201cdigital pedagogy and the cultural studies of science and technology,\u201d while LMC\u2019s Global Languages, Cultures, and Technologies program seeks to foster collaboration across languages, technologies, and global cultures.\nBoth schools, and faculty from across Ivan Allen College, also are actively engaged in a number of Vertically Integrated Research (VIP) research projects, meant to give undergraduate students the opportunity to participate in meaningful, often interdisciplinary, research projects.\nSuch program are the product of a spirit of \u201cradical interdisciplinarity\u201d among humanities scholars at Georgia Tech that has allowed such programs to flourish, said\nAnna Stenport , professor and chair in the School of Modern Languages\n\u201cI am very\u00a0happy and proud to be able to say that there is no crisis of the humanities at the Georgia Institute of Technology,\u201d she told the symposium.\nFor Utz, the symposium was just the beginning.\n\u201cThis symposium can only be a first step toward future additional conversations, and the School of Literature, Media, and Communication, together with our partners, will take a lead role in continuing what we started this year,\u201d he said.\nAnother humanities-related symposium occurred April 25-27.\nThe Atlanta Global Studies Symposium \u00a0focused on global, regional, and international studies and the United Nation\u2019s Sustainable Development Goals. Discussion centered on collaboration among institutions of higher education, the public and the community, and the K-12 sector in the Atlanta region and beyond through education, research, and outreach.\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nIsolation to Integration: Finding multidisciplinary collaboration for humanitie\u2026\nContact\nMichael Pearson\nmichael.pearson@iac.gatech.edu\n404.894.2290\nEmail\nmichael.pearson@iac.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
