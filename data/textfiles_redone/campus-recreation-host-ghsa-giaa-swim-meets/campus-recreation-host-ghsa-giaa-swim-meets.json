The events will attract an influx of visitors to\u00a0campus, so expect congestion in the area surrounding the Campus Recreation Center, including increased traffic on Tech Parkway and Ferst Drive.\nParticipant dropoff will take place along Tech Parkway, resulting in intermittent traffic delays and closures for buses and northbound traffic during the following times on meet days: 7 \u2013 9 a.m., noon \u2013 1:30 p.m., 3:30 \u2013 6:30 p.m., and 9 \u2013 10:30 p.m.\nGuests will park in the\nCampus Recreation deck (W10) and Student Center parking deck (W2) .\nBe advised that the morning hours will see the largest crowds due to the number of athletes competing in preliminary races. In addition, other areas of campus may be affected on meet days as guests visit retail and dining locations.\nFor more information about the events, to purchase tickets, or to watch live, visit the\u00a0 GHSA Swimming website \u00a0or the\u00a0 GIAA website .\nAdditional Images\nContact\nSteven Gagliano\n- Communications Officer\nInstitute Communications\nEmail\nSteven.gagliano@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
