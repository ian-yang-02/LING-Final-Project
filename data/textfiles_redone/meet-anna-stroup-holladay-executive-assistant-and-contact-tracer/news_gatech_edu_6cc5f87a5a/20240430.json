In addition to supporting the chair, she takes meeting minutes, keeps committees running, and coordinates special projects and event planning.\nLike most people though, Holladay\u2019s daily routine has changed during the pandemic.\n\u201cOne of the biggest changes is that a lot of the things we did before went away. For example, in the span of 10 days I had to reschedule 20 in-person interviews and make them all virtual. Making everything online was trial by fire,\u201d she said. For now, the interview process is virtual.\nOver the summer Holladay read an email from the Institute asking for volunteers to help with\ncontact tracing\nwhen students came back to campus.\n\u201cI\u2019ve always been a joiner,\u201d she said. \u201cI knew that a lot of my routine paperwork, such as travel reimbursement, was going away because of the new travel restrictions. So I spoke with my supervisor, and instead of taking more training classes I decided to do volunteer work and help with contact tracing as part of surveillance testing. Where I was filling out travel reimbursement forms before, now I\u2019m calling people and filling out questionnaires.\u201d\nHolladay said it has been a very interesting experience. She is one of about 50 people on campus helping with contact tracing, including volunteers from Georgia Tech Athletics and the Georgia Tech Police Department. It is led by Dr. Benjamin Holton in Stamps Health Services. A couple of team leads disseminate the work to volunteers.\nHolladay calls students, faculty, or staff who have tested positive.\n\u201cAt first we were taking down the information by hand and filling out forms. Now we\u2019re tracking information with the Qualtrics app, and it has become much more streamlined,\u201d she said. \u201cGeorgia Tech is one of the only places in the U.S. doing contact tracing at this level.\u201d\nThe calls are completed within 24 hours after the positive test results are confirmed.\n\u201cBut you can\u2019t just rapid fire questions at them. It\u2019s up to you \u2014 the person calling \u2014 to create a rapport with the student, faculty, or staff person you\u2019re talking with. We have a list of questions and a script to follow to gather the information.\u201d\nHolladay said it\u2019s important for her to keep informed about the latest guidelines so that she is sharing the right information with the people she contacts.\nWorking in the School of Computational Science and Engineering also made Holladay want to volunteer with contact tracing because some of the school\u2019s professors are already working with Covid-19.\n\u201cAditya Prakash is working with the CDC doing Covid-19 tracing. Srijan Kumar is doing some work on how bias and discrimination have increased during the coronavirus pandemic. So, being part of CSE and seeing what they are contributing made me feel that I can contribute in my own small way by doing this,\u201d she said.\nHer Regular Job\nHolladay came to Tech in 2015 after working for a boutique executive search firm. She likes being able to work on a variety of projects.\n\u201cThe most rewarding part of my job is taking the small things that would have fallen through the cracks and making sure that they actually happen,\u201d she said. \u201cI was one of the leaders for helping get our office moved over to the Coda Building and then getting everything set up that makes a building a \u2018home\u2019 for the school. Then, when we had to make Covid-19 changes I came in to measure for social distancing so we can keep our students safe.\n\u201cAnother great part of my job is being able to be the face of this school and the correspondent for faculty searches. Computer Science and Engineering is a growing school so we\u2019re constantly on the search for the best and the brightest in the field, and I am the liaison for all the travel and logistics and welcoming people to Georgia Tech.\u201d\nA few months ago Holladay helped plan the virtual retirement party for the school\u2019s founding chair Regents\u2019 Professor Emeritus Richard Fujimoto.\n\u201cIt was a unique challenge to find an adequate way to celebrate the founder of our school virtually,\u201d she said. \u201cOur new chair, Haesan Park, and I put on our creative hats and pulled out all of the stops. There was a whole committee of faculty and staff who got together to properly honor him. We had musical performances, karaoke, slide shows, and all kinds of stuff. It was a real challenge to make the context fit and show all of the ways he has touched people\u2019s lives. But it was a lot of fun.\u201d\nAway From the Office\nWhen she\u2019s not working for Georgia Tech, Holladay enjoys camping, playing with her puppy, working with the arts community, and running a micro-wedding business.\nShe likes camping in the mountains, especially Georgia\u2019s Tallulah Gorge State Park and Pigeon Mountain.\nDuring the pandemic she got a new puppy, a Maltese named Bonnie.\n\u201cShe is amazing. She\u2019s all teeth and fluff, a little white mop running around that wants to chew on your toes. She\u2019s learning commands, and we do dance party moves.\u201d\nHolladay also is involved with the Burning Man community in Atlanta. Burning Man is an annual event held in the Nevada desert. Since 2013 she has been involved with the Flashpoint Artists Initiative, the organization responsible for overseeing the creation of Georgia\u2019s two Burning Man events. She has helped plan events and served on the board of directors. The Initiative\u2019s events provide access to funds for public arts, and the festivals are a vehicle for that.\nHolladay also plans custom micro weddings with a twist\u00a0\u2014 the couple is completely hands off. She and her husband started Sweet Grass Weddings in 2015 after getting married in their own tiny wedding.\nThe person getting married contacts Holladay and shares information about what kind of wedding they want. Then they show up at the wedding with everything done for them \u2014 d\u00e9cor, cake, officiant, photography, flowers and whatever else is needed.\n\u201cIf you want a dog at your wedding we\u2019ll bring a dog cake and a bandanna for your dog. If you want to have a memorial to your grandmother, bring me a picture of your grandmother. We take what people want in a gigantic wedding and shrink it to a two-hour event but all of the details, personality, and luxury are still there. It\u2019s lot of fun, and we\u2019ve done more than a hundred weddings,\u201d she said.\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nContact Tracing\nSchool of Computational Science and Engineering\nContact\nVictor Rogers\nInsitute Communications\nEmail\nvictor.rogers@comm.gatech.edu\nAdditional information\nGeorgia Tech is recruiting volunteer contact tracers for spring semester.
