One day prior, just days after the U.S. Senate passed a unanimous bill to establish June 19 as Juneteenth National Independence Day, President Joseph Biden Jr. signed it into law, making Juneteenth the country\u2019s twelfth federal holiday.\nJuneteenth is the oldest nationally celebrated commemoration of the ending of slavery in the United States. On June 19, 1865, a Union general rode into Galveston, Texas, to announce that the Civil War had ended -- and Black slaves had been freed. Though the Emancipation Proclamation became law in January 1863, it could not be enforced in places still under Confederate control.\nJuneteenth has been celebrated across Texas and other parts of the country for years. However, following nationwide protests in 2020 over police brutality and the deaths of\u00a0George Floyd,\u00a0Breonna Taylor,\u00a0Ahmaud Arbery, and other Black Americans, there has been a renewed interest in the day that celebrates freedom for the last of\u00a0Black American slaves.\nThe virtual conversation featured a keynote and presentation entitled\u00a0 Juneteenth and the Black Digital\u00a0 by\nAndr\u00e9 Brock , associate professor in the School of Literature, Media, and Communication.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been invited to discuss Juneteenth and its importance on the occasion of its first-ever federal holiday to mark the event,\u201d Brock opened. \u201cToday, using my research on Blackness and digital media, I\u2019d like to offer a way to contextualize where we find ourselves as we begin this double-holiday weekend,\u201d he continued, offering a nod to Father\u2019s Day which followed the day after Juneteenth.\nBrock\u2019s scholarship includes published articles on racial representations in videogames, Blackness, and digital technoculture, as well as groundbreaking research on \u201c Black Twitter .\u201d He recently\nreceived a\u00a0sub-grant\u00a0to further interdisciplinary research\ninto issues of race, difference, and computation.\n\u201cWe should also remember it [Juneteenth] is Black folks making something out of nothing; a moment of rest to mark the dismantling of an apartheid state -- and its love for slave labor -- and we have continued to celebrate that moment, even as our ancestors endured Reconstruction, the nadir\u00a0[considered a particularly brutal period in African American history, spanning the end of\u00a0Reconstruction\u00a0in 1877 through the early\u00a020th century]\u00a0and the piece-by-piece construction of Jim Crow laws.\u201d\nBrock's rousing presentation was followed by a question-answer session between the scholar and his virtual audience.\nLater that afternoon, OMED hosted a celebration on Tech Green complete with food, games, comradery, faculty, staff, and students \u2013 including several Georgia Tech men\u2019s basketball and football team members -\u2013 and tabling by organizations including Delta Sigma Theta and Zeta Phi Beta sororities and Omega Psi Phi and Phi Beta Sigma fraternities.\nThe day was supported by partnership with the African Student Association, the Georgia Tech Caribbean Student Organization, and the\nAfrican American Student Union , the Institute\u2019s oldest Black student organization.\nA full recording of the virtual discussion can be viewed at\nhttps://youtu.be/p8zc4Vzg_vM .\nAdditional Images\nContact\nCourtney Hill\nCommunications Manager\nInstitute Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion\ncourtney.hill@gatech.edu\nEmail\ncourtney.hill@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
