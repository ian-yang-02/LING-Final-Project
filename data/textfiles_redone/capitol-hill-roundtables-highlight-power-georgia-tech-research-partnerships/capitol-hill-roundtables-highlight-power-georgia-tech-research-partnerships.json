Last year, Georgia Tech had 930 research contracts with large and small companies spanning the research spectrum. The Institute also is known for its collaborative work with local and state chambers of commerce and groups like Technology Association of Georgia and Georgia Research Alliance, all strengthened further by partnerships with Georgia\u2019s other research universities and the Technical College System of Georgia.\nOne such partnership, which seeks to improve the tools pediatric health providers use to care for sick children, was recently highlighted for federal policymakers.\u00a0 Georgia Tech hosted a roundtable discussion on driving innovation in pediatric healthcare in Washington D.C. to inform policymakers of challenges and successes in research partnerships. Co-hosted with IBM and Children\u2019s Healthcare of Atlanta, the cornerstone of the discussion was Georgia Tech\u2019s unique $20 million partnership with Children\u2019s Healthcare of Atlanta. The panel included:\n\u2022 Patrick Frias, Chief Physician Officer, Children\u2019s Healthcare of Atlanta\n\u2022 Kevin Maher, Co-Director, Center for Pediatric Innovation and Bioengineering, Georgia Tech, Emory University, and Children\u2019s Healthcare of Atlanta\n\u2022 Beth Mynatt, Professor and Director, Georgia Tech Institute for People and Technology\n\u2022 Harry Reynolds, Director, Health Industry Transformation, IBM\n\u2022 Leanne West, Chief Engineer of Pediatric Technologies\n\u2022 Bill Todd (moderator), Professor of the Practice, Georgia Tech Scheller College of Business\nPanelists shared their perspectives on what it takes to make partnerships like the Georgia Tech \u2013 Children\u2019s Healthcare of Atlanta partnership successful, and urged congressional staffers to refresh their thinking about healthcare delivery.\n\u201cThe saying goes, \u2018It takes a village,\u2019 and the village used to be defined as people,\u201d said Reynolds who oversees the healthcare and life sciences industries for IBM all over the world. \u201cNow the \u2018village\u2019 is defined as an ecosystem of information and capabilities that come in the form of technology.\u201d\nReynolds commended the panelists for being equally innovative and practical, pointing to the \u201cQuick Wins\u201d approach to bring innovative technologies to clinicians within 18 months.

Mynatt, a leading expert in this area, was joined by Sherry Farruggia, Georgia Tech strategic partners officer, Margarita Gonzales, principal investigator for the Georgia Tech-Georgia Department of Community Health research program, and Kim Isett, associate professor in Tech\u2019s School of Public Policy.\n\u201cIn Georgia, we are in a good position to do advance health IT innovation and the industry quickly,\u201d said Georgia Tech executive vice president for research Stephen Cross, who facilitated the discussion. \u201cOur state has been called \u201cthe nation\u2019s health IT capitol,\u201d with over 200 health IT companies. The Metro Atlanta Chamber of Commerce estimates that Georgia\u2019s health IT sector employs nearly 16,000 people, and that the sector\u2019s primary companies are growing rapidly.\u201d\nThe panel described a successful pilot health information exchange for cancer patients in Rome, Ga., which served as a case in point for the powerful model of partnership between state, federal, and university entities. Read about\u00a0 the project .\nPanelists underscored the importance of addressing challenges related to interoperability and access to data. Additionally, the panel encouraged staffers to consider Georgia Tech a partner for decision support, and to think about the format and type of data that would be helpful as they develop new policies.\nThe Washington, D.C. roundtables are part of an ongoing advocacy campaign supporting Georgia Tech\u2019s strategic plan. \u201cOur presence in D.C. has never been greater,\u201d said Georgia Tech director of federal relations Robert Knotts, \u201cIt is important to continue to show our leaders in the federal government that when they ask, \u2018what does Georgia Tech think,\u2019 they will receive information and testimony exactly appropriate to helping them address major issues facing our state and nation.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
