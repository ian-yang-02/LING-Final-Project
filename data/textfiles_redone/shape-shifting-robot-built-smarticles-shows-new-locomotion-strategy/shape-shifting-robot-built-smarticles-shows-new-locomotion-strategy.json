Now, researchers have taken a new approach, building a robot entirely from smaller robots known as \u201csmarticles\u201d to unlock the principles of a potentially new locomotion technique.\nThe 3D-printed smarticles \u2014 short for smart active particles \u2014 can do just one thing: flap their two arms. But when five of these smarticles are confined in a circle, they begin to nudge one another, forming a robophysical system known as a \u201csupersmarticle\u201d that can move by itself. Adding a light or sound sensor allows the supersmarticle to move in response to the stimulus \u2014 and even be controlled well enough to navigate a maze.\nThough rudimentary now, the notion of making robots from smaller robots \u2014 and taking advantage of the group capabilities that arise by combining individuals \u2014 could provide mechanically based control over very small robots. Ultimately, the emergent behavior of the group could provide a new locomotion and control approach for small robots that could potentially change shapes.\n\u201cThese are very rudimentary robots whose behavior is dominated by mechanics and the laws of physics,\u201d said\nDan Goldman , a Dunn Family Professor in the\nSchool of Physics\nat the Georgia Institute of Technology. \u201cWe are not looking to put sophisticated control, sensing, and computation on them all. As robots become smaller and smaller, we\u2019ll have to use mechanics and physics principles to control them because they won\u2019t have the level of computation and sensing we would need for conventional control.\u201d\nThe research, which was supported by the Army Research Office and the National Science Foundation, was reported September 18 in the journal\nScience Robotics . Researchers from Northwestern University also contributed to the project.\nThe foundation for the research came from an unlikely source: a study of construction staples. By pouring these heavy-duty staples into a container with removable sides, former Ph.D. student Nick Gravish \u2014 now a faculty member at the University of California San Diego \u2014 created structures that would stand by themselves after the container\u2019s walls were removed.\nShaking the staple towers eventually caused them to collapse, but the observations led to a realization that simple entangling of mechanical objects could create structures with capabilities well beyond those of the individual components.\n\u201cA robot made of other rudimentary robots became the vision,\u201d Goldman said. \u201cYou could imagine making a robot in which you would tweak its geometric parameters a bit and what emerges is qualitatively new behaviors.\u201d\nTo explore the concept, graduate research assistant Will Savoie used a 3D printer to create battery-powered smarticles, which have motors, simple sensors, and limited computing power. The devices can change their location only when they interact with other devices while enclosed by a ring.\n\u201cEven though no individual robot could move on its own, the cloud composed of multiple robots could move as it pushed itself apart and shrink as it pulled itself together,\u201d Goldman explained. \u201cIf you put a ring around the cloud of little robots, they start kicking each other around, and the larger ring \u2014 what we call a supersmarticle \u2014 moves around randomly.\u201d\nThe researchers noticed that if one small robot stopped moving, perhaps because its battery died, the group of smarticles would begin moving in the direction of that stalled robot. Graduate student Ross Warkentin learned he could control the movement by adding photo sensors to the robots that halt the arm flapping when a strong beam of light hits one of them.\n\u201cIf you angle the flashlight just right, you can highlight the robot you want to be inactive, and that causes the ring to lurch toward or away from it, even though no robots are programmed to move toward the light,\u201d Goldman said. \u201cThat allowed steering of the ensemble in a very rudimentary, stochastic way.\u201d\nSchool of Physics Professor Kurt Wiesenfeld and graduate student Zack Jackson modeled the movement of the these smarticles and supersmarticles to understand how the nudges and mass of the ring affected overall movement. Researchers from Northwestern University studied how the interactions between the smarticles provided directional control.\n\"For many robots, we have electrical current move motors that generate forces on parts that collectively move a robot reliably,\u201d said\nTodd Murphey , a professor of mechanical engineering who worked with Northwestern graduate students Thomas Berrueta and Ana Pervan. \u201cWe learned that although individual smarticles interact with each other through a chaos of wiggling impacts that are each unpredictable, the whole robot composed of those smarticles moves predictably and in a way that we can exploit in software.\"\nIn future work, Goldman envisions more complex interactions that utilize the simple sensing and movement capabilities of the smarticles. \u201cPeople have been interested in making a certain kind of swarm robots that are composed of other robots,\u201d he said. \u201cThese structures could be reconfigured on demand to meet specific needs by tweaking their geometry.\u201d\nThe project is of interest to the U.S. Army because it could lead to new robotic systems capable of changing their shapes, modalities and functions, said Sam Stanton. He is program manager of complex dynamics and systems at the Army Research Office, an element of U.S. Army Combat Capabilities Development Command\u2019s Army Research Laboratory.\n\u201cFuture Army unmanned systems and networks of systems are imagined to be capable of transforming their shape, modality, and function. For example, a robotic swarm may someday be capable of moving to a river and then autonomously forming a structure to span the gap,\u201d Stanton said. \u201cDan Goldman's research is identifying physical principles that may prove essential for engineering emergent behavior in future robot collectives as well as new understanding of fundamental tradeoffs in system performance, responsiveness, uncertainty, resiliency, and adaptivity.\u201d\nIn addition to those already mentioned, the research also included Georgia Tech graduate student Shengkai Li.\nThis material is based upon work supported by the Army Research Office under award W911NF-13-1-0347 and by the National Science Foundation under grants PoLS-0957659, PHY-1205878, DMR-1551095, PHY-1205878.
