They can experience swelling and fluid retention, a condition known as lymphedema that has no cure. But researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology are working to understand the lymph system through a partnership with the\nGlobal Center for Medical Innovation (GCMI).\n\u201cWe want to know: \u2018Why does the lymphatic system fail?\u2019\u201d said\nBrandon Dixon , a professor in the\nSchool of Mechanical Engineering . \u201cWhat are some of the mechanisms that drive its failure? We want a basic understanding of the rules that govern lymphatic remodeling.\u201d\nTo uncover this basic understanding, Dixon and his fellow mechanical engineering investigators\nAlexander Alexeev\nand\nZhanna Nepiyushchikh\nare studying the lymph system in sheep. Sheep make ideal candidates as they have limbs that must transport fluid against gravity and these limbs have a consistent architecture of lymphatic vessels. Previously, the researchers had worked with mice and rats, but there are inherent limitations to this.\n\u201cGravity is a key component of lymphedema, especially in the lower legs or arms, places where the fluid has to travel a long distance against gravity,\u201d he said. \u201cYou just can't recapitulate that in a mouse or a rat, so we wanted a large animal model of lymphatic failure.\u201d\nInitially, the researchers partnered with the\nUniversity of Georgia College of Veterinary Medicine\nto study sheep. Their results won a $3 million National Institutes of Health (NIH) grant for the next four years to build a computational model and framework to understand lymphatic growth and adaptation after injury.\nPart of the grant was moving the research from Athens to Atlanta by partnering with GCMI.\n\u201cThe challenge of the large animal work is it's very expensive, and we could not have done this project without both NIH support and in-kind contributions from GCMI which were made available through support from the Office of the Executive Vice President for Research,\u201d said Dixon, who is also a researcher in the\nPetit Institute for Bioengineering and Bioscience . \u201cGCMI has really created a unique environment that's allowed us to do this work here.\u201d\nStudying the System\nTo conduct the research, the team surgically dissects a section of lymphatic vessel but leaves all the remaining vasculature intact to determine how the remaining lymphatic vessels compensate for this loss of lymphatic vessels over time. As a point of comparison the researchers use the other limb, which does not receive an injury to its lymphatics, as a control, and then employ\nin vivo\nnear-infrared lymphatic imaging (indirect visual imaging that utilizes specialized tracers taken up by the lymphatic system) to determine how the vessels adapt over time.\nFrom here, they develop computational models to understand how the structural changes in the lymphatic vessels alter their ability to pump fluid. Although it\u2019s a biological system, the mechanics plays a very important role in the understanding of its function, according to Alexeev.\n\u201cIn contrast to the circulatory system where we have a centralized pump, or the heart, that pumps the fluid and drives the flow, in lymphatics we have a distributed system of pumps that contract periodically, and there are also numerous elastic valves that open and close to create a unidirectional lymph flow,\u201d he said.\nThe modeling of a lymphatic system presents an extra challenge because the researchers need to consider how the fluid flow interacts with elastic valves and contracting vessel walls. Yet an advantage of computational modeling is that it provides detailed insights into how the system should work and helps to rationalize the observations from the sheep studies.\n\u201cThe problem we are addressing is the gap in understanding what triggers lymphatics to fail and why one patient develops lymphedema while another does not,\u201d said Nepiyushchikh. \u201cIt is very exciting to work with a team where everybody brings a high level of expertise and experience towards understanding such a complex disease as lymphedema. It will be tremendous for the lymphedema field to be able to predict lymphatic failure and find the best preventative options, as well as narrow the treatment possibilities in already existing conditions.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nContact\nTess Malone\nEmail\ntess.malone@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
