And enough skeptical members of the population will have to be persuaded to receive the vaccine to slow virus transmission.\nBeyond those challenges, the distribution effort will have to adapt to unexpected and uneven demand; accommodate recipients who may not return on time for a second dose; train hundreds of thousands of staff from clinics, pharmacies, doctor\u2019s offices, and hospitals; prioritize serving high-risk groups first while encouraging others to wait \u2014 all while under tremendous pressure to get the much-anticipated vaccines into use as case counts and the death toll continue rising.\n\u201cTime is of the essence because the virus is already so widespread,\u201d said\nPinar Keskinocak , the William W. George Chair and professor in the\nH. Milton Stewart School of Industrial and Systems Engineering\n(ISyE) and director of the\nCenter for Health and Humanitarian Systems\nat the Georgia Institute of Technology. \u201cWith the pressure on our timeline, knowledge of how quickly the disease is spreading, and the broad U.S. and global need, I can\u2019t think of a comparable public health initiative that has ever been undertaken.\u201d\nShipping and Keeping Hundreds of Millions of Doses Cold\nThree vaccines, produced by Moderna, Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech, and Oxford-AstraZeneca, are expected to be available first. The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine will need to be kept ultra-cold \u2014 minus 94 degrees Fahrenheit \u2014 on its journey to individual Americans. The Moderna drug won\u2019t have such demanding conditions, but both it and the Pfizer vaccine will tax the existing \u201ccold chain\u201d that keeps vaccines and other temperature-sensitive products in a narrow range of conditions during transport and storage.\nThe Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine will have much less stringent requirements and faster ramp-up in capacity, though early testing suggests its efficacy may be lower than the others. That will create tradeoffs between efficacy versus access and speed in distribution.\nPlans already exist to get the vaccines from manufacturers to the states, each of which has developed its own distribution plan. Keskinocak worries mostly about \u201clast mile\u201d plans \u2014 getting the vaccines to where they will be injected \u2014 and getting individuals to those locations.\n\u201cAccess is going to be a challenge,\u201d she said. \u201cYou may be able to get it to locations where it can be distributed, but you have to make sure the people who really need the vaccine can easily access those locations.\u201d\nCold chain transportation, tracking, tracing, and storage already exist in most areas, but refrigeration could be challenging for rural areas that may be at the end of the chain, especially for the vaccine requiring very cold temperatures beyond the capability of freezers found in most doctor\u2019s offices and clinics. And cold can sometimes be too cold, Keskinocak said.\n\u201cWe often think about keeping it cold, but sometimes it may be too cold, which is not good. It\u2019s not just whether the temperature exceeded the required level, but also whether it went below that. It is important to keep the vaccine exactly at the required temperature level.\u201d\nPfizer has developed a shipping container that includes a temperature tracking device \u2014 and 50 pounds of dry ice to maintain the right temperature during transit. Because it is contained in small vials and the liquid vaccine is diluted for use, the overall volume being shipped will be relatively small, limiting the number of packages that will be moved and stored, Keskinocak noted.\nUltimately, the cold chain may play a significant role in vaccine effectiveness. Currently, the vaccines being produced by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna are reported to have a higher efficacy than the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine \u2014 but only if they can be maintained at the proper temperatures. The timing, magnitude, and duration of temperature fluctuations during transport and before administration could affect that in ways that may be difficult to assess.\n\u201cOur current modeling shows that a vaccine that is less effective but that can be distributed more quickly and more widely might work better in some settings than a more effective vaccine, thereby reducing the total number of infections in the population,\u201d Keskinocak said.\nIf You Build It, Will They Come?\nExpectations are that the nation is hungry for a vaccine to escape the horrors of Covid-19. But a recent Gallup survey shows that only 58% of respondents said they planned to receive the vaccine when it becomes available. Boosting that percentage will require a massive communications effort to overcome vaccine reluctance and concerns fueled by the uneven nature of the U.S. pandemic response.\n\u201cIf we can get the vaccine to locations where people can access it, and we have the necessary syringes, supplies, and PPE, as well as the healthcare staff to administer the injections, it\u2019s not clear that people will come to receive it in large enough numbers,\u201d Keskinocak said. \u201cThat\u2019s one major component missing from a lot of the plans that I see at the state level.\u201d\nThe communications program will have to run in parallel to the vaccine distribution, and they have to be coordinated so that supply meets demand.\n\u201cPublic health communication and dissemination of information at the right time and in the right language is going to be at least as important and challenging as the logistics of distributing the vaccine,\u201d Keskinocak said. \u201cCommunication is going to shape demand to a large extent. If one is more effective than the other, we will have a mismatch between demand and supply.\u201d\nDifferent demographic populations have different levels of trust for medicine in general and vaccines in particular, she said, so communications campaigns will have to focus on issues of concern to those groups. Unexpected variations in vaccine demand caused by these concerns could also create logistical uncertainties.\n\u201cWe can try to forecast demand, and ship supplies to those locations,\u201d she said. \u201cBut historically, we have seen that demand can exceed supply in one location while inventory builds up in another location. We need to avoid this situation of unmet demand and unused vaccine.\u201d\nAnother issue will be the two doses necessary for the vaccine. The second dose must be received within a narrow range of time for the two-dose vaccine to be effective. Should a second dose be reserved for every person receiving a first dose, or should the goal be to get as many doses out as possible?\n\u201cSome people may never show up to be vaccinated, while others will receive the first dose, but may not come back for the second dose,\u201d she said.\nGetting the Program Started\nThe first available doses will likely go to healthcare workers and first responders who are on the front lines of battling Covid-19. That is expected to be the easier part of vaccination logistics, and the lessons learned there should help with the much more massive vaccination campaign for high-risk individuals and the general public.\nAs vaccine production and distribution capacity ramp up, other groups will be next in line. While distributing small batches as manufacturers produce it can create some supply challenges, that also allows the system to more easily adjust to unexpected demand.\nEven though distributing and administering vaccines is something the U.S. healthcare system does routinely, the size and timeline of this project are unprecedented, Keskinocak noted.\nBeyond the logistical and communications needs, the vaccination program will also have a strong information technology component. Administration will likely be by appointment, and each injection will have to be reported to a vaccine registry to provide a record of which vaccines people have received and when.\nVaccinating People Who May Already Be Immune\nIt\u2019s estimated that the number of reported Covid-19 cases may be just 10% of the actual number of infections in the U.S. Assuming recovery from the virus confers immunity for some period of time means there may be quite a few people who don\u2019t actually need the vaccine right away to be protected. But there are currently no plans to determine whether recipients are already immune before they receive the vaccine.\n\u201cThere are a lot of people out there who have some level of immunity to the coronavirus,\u201d Keskinocak said. \u201cThe plans I\u2019ve seen don\u2019t include the serological testing that would be needed to identify people with some level of immunity, which could be around 30% of the population by the time the vaccine gets out to the general public.\u201d\nTesting for immune antibodies could be done ahead of the vaccination program, but that would create an extra step in a process that is already quite complicated. Healthcare systems such as the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs or certain private insurance plans could include that step, especially if vaccine supplies lag behind demand.\n\u201cThe big complexity is timing,\u201d she said. \u201cOnce vaccines become available, you\u2019ll want to deliver them as quickly as possible to as many people as possible in a very short time frame.\u201d\nAnnual vaccination campaigns for the seasonal flu set ambitious goals for the population levels they want to reach, but the time challenges will be much greater for the coronavirus vaccine.\n\u201cThe seasonal flu vaccine becomes available months before the virus spreads broadly, so we have quite a bit of time to administer it before we get into the peak of the flu season,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have been in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic for several months now. We are really late in the game, so we don\u2019t have the luxury of time.\u201d\nKeskinocak is cautiously optimistic that the challenges will ultimately be addressed.\n\u201cThere are certainly still lots of unknowns,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the state plans I have seen look reasonable from a supply chain standpoint. Some of the decisions will be made once the states receive the vaccine, and exactly how they do it will be somewhat up to the local jurisdictions. There are still many things that need to be decided to make this unprecedented initiative live up to its goals.\u201d\nResearch News\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\n177 North Avenue\nAtlanta, Georgia\u00a0 30332-0181\u00a0 USA\nMedia Relations Contact : John Toon (404-894-6986) (jtoon@gatech.edu)\nWriter : John Toon\nAdditional Images\nContact\nJohn Toon\nResearch News\n(404-894-6986)\nEmail\njtoon@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
