It provides students facing academic, social, and personal concerns with a way to receive support from fellow students. Students wanting help from the program are matched with a Tech peer who has been extensively trained to navigate mental health conversations in a personal and private manner, and who is knowledgeable about campus resources at Georgia Tech.\n\u201cBecoming a peer coach not only allows you to help coach students through issues they are facing at Georgia Tech, but it gives you the skills to be a more effective listener and friend in everyday situations,\u201d said Ben Nickel, a fifth-year industrial and systems engineering major and former peer coach who graduates this semester. \u201cI was an active peer coach for two years and have since retired to focus on graduation. In addition, I wanted to give younger coaches the chance to coach more students and gain experience.\u201d\nNickel said it has been great to see new coaches grow into the role and to also see the program expand.\n\u201cAs a peer coach, sometimes you see the benefit of what you do right away, and make an immediate, visible impact on the students you coach. Other times, it may take months to see progress in those you coach,\u201d Nickel said. \u201cIt really takes being dedicated to giving all the students you work with your full energy day in and day out. Either way, peer coaching has taught me how to be more patient and to work consistently with those I coach.\u201d\nAll students currently enrolled at Georgia Tech \u2014 graduate and undergraduate\u00a0\u2014are eligible to participate in peer coaching. Students serving as peer coaches are trained to create a supportive and understanding environment in which students can identify and work through specific academic, social, and other personal goals.\u00a0Services provided by peer coaches are considered consultation services, as opposed to counseling or therapy. Peer coaches are not trained counselors or therapists, and students meeting with a peer coach are not considered clients of the Counseling Center.\nCommon concerns peer coaching may help to address include:\nAdjustment to college/Tech culture\nAcademic struggles (e.g. study skills, time management, motivation)\nRelationship concerns (e.g. roommates, friendships, dates/partner relationships, family)\nGrief and loss\nStress and time management\nThis semester, the\nCounseling Center\nhas added an online self-referral option.\u00a0Interested students can complete a Peer Coaching Screening Form online at\npeercoaching.gatech.edu , linked from the Connect with a Coach page.\nThe program was developed as part of recommendations from a Mental Health Task Force convened by President G.P. \u201cBud\u201d Peterson in 2013.\u00a0The idea came from students involved in the task force, who suggested that some students may be reluctant to speak with professors or professional staff about their struggles, but would value and be more likely to talk to a peer.\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nCounseling Center\nContact\nIrene Daboin\nPeer Coaching Coordinator irene.daboin@studentlife.gatech.edu\nEmail\nirene.daboin@studentlife.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
