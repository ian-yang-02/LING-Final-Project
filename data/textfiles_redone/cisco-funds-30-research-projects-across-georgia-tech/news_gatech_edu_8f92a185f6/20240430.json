Begun last year, the funded projects are by design short term, lasting an average of 12 to 14 months \u2015 enough time to assess the technology and its potential for Cisco to warrant further investment.\nEach project undergoes quarterly reviews by Cisco, with a Georgia Tech faculty member serving as the principal investigator, and Ph.D. or postdoc students occasionally leading a team of students.\n\u201cCisco Research conducts and fosters research in emerging areas of technology that are of strategic interest to Cisco. Georgia Tech is one of the first universities to have signed a longer-term master research agreement through which we have funded several projects over the past year. The vast breadth of research activities within GT makes it an ideal partner for us to collaborate and fund research longer-term\u201d said Ramana Kompella, head of research at Cisco. \u201cWe have already achieved quite a bit of success through these collaborations over the last year, and we have started renewing some of these projects for the next phase of research based on the results and impact already achieved.\u201d\n\u201cAs an R1 research facility, our job is to engage in research and train the next researchers coming up. Partnerships like Cisco are critical to our mission,\u201d said Jeffrey Davis, director of Corporate Relations at Georgia Tech, who oversees the Cisco partnership. \u201cCisco\u2019s program supports our students, our faculty, and the Institute overall. A lot of this research could benefit not only Georgia, but also people worldwide.\u201d\nDavis said Cisco evaluators challenge Georgia Tech students on their findings, with some of the brightest students recruited to join Cisco upon graduation.\nPitching Projects: Cisco\u2019s Version of \u2018Shark Tank\u2019\nBeing selected for a research project is akin to pitching investors on the popular reality show, \u201cShark Tank.\u201d According to Davis, professors have 15 minutes to present their research project to Cisco. A Cisco tech leader evaluates each proposal to determine which ideas will move on to a \u201cdeep dive,\u201d or one-hour detailed presentation to include a Q&A discussion between the professor and subject-matter experts at Cisco, and a decision quickly follows.\nThe funded projects support one of Cisco\u2019s strategic pillars that include secure, agile networks; hybrid work; optimized application experiences; end-to-end security; internet for the future; and capabilities at the edge.\nGeorgia Tech\u2019s\nInstitute of People and Technology\n(IPaT), an early funding recipient, was awarded projects to develop augmented reality (AR) tools to improve healthcare worker productivity, research technologies that reduce workplace stress, and develop contact-less inventory management solutions that could lead to more efficient contactless supply chains, noted a recent Georgia Tech\nstory .\n\u201cAs the world is grappling to deal with the one-in-a-century pandemic, a key aspect of remote work that was particularly of grave concern is remote worker wellness and productivity, (and) one of the key themes along with Georgia Tech researchers we are conducting cutting edge research in,\u201d Kompella added.\nHealth-monitoring Wearables\nOmer Inan, associate professor in\nElectrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) , is six months into a project to test how well his knee brace, a wearable with sensors that measure arthritis inflammation inside joints, works in patients with arthritis. His 2020\nresearch paper\non the topic was recently named the runner-up best paper by\nIEEE Sensors Journal .\n\u201cWe are taking the hardware that we previously developed in our group and understanding how well it performs in a clinical population,\u201d said Inan, who is collaborating with a team of clinicians at Emory School of Medicine led by Sampath Prahalad, that will assess the wearable joint monitoring technology in as many as 30 patients.\n\u201cCisco is very interested in telehealth and IoT-related research, and our project encompasses both,\u201d said Inan.\nHe noted that arthritis sufferers today must go to a doctor's office and undergo blood tests and imaging to monitor their condition, which is both cumbersome and too infrequent given how rapidly the disease changes. \u201cOnly being able to get data at the doctor's office makes it hard to really understand what's going on and to manage the condition properly,\u201d he said.\nInan anticipates that his wearable sensor could one day help remotely manage rheumatoid arthritis, especially in rural areas that are medically underserved. \u00a0Cisco, he added, could be a key partner in making that happen.\n\u201cCisco understands connectivity and the overall ecosystem of telehealth so well that they could be a great partner to help us understand how to move this technology toward translation to start benefitting patients,\u201d said Inan, noting that Cisco also brings invaluable expertise in the internet of things,, privacy and security of interconnected devices.\n\u201cWhile health is top-of-mind for everyone in the world, we at Cisco Research are exploring how technology can improve healthcare outcomes for everyone by leveraging Cisco\u2019s core tech prowess in areas such as IoT and cybersecurity,\u201d said Kompella.\nComputing at the Edge\nAnother Cisco-funded project focuses on the next wave of computing \u201cat the edge.\u201d The increasing presence of cameras in our environment, coupled with advances in computer vision and machine learning, has enabled several novel applications, including space-time tracking of suspicious vehicles and smart traffic lights.\n\u201cEdge (computing) is an emerging disruptive technology, and more and more applications require it. Companies like Cisco, Microsoft, and Google are already starting to pay attention to edge computing, and it could be a huge opportunity for academia,\u201d said Umakishore Ramachandran, professor in Georgia Tech\u2019s\nSchool of Computer Science . \u201cWe are seeing a perfect storm of technology and applications coming together at the edge to support multiple camera applications.\u201d\nOne reality of moving to edge computing, explained Ramachandran, is its resource limitation compared to a cloud data center owing to the smaller footprint of the edge. His team has developed techniques to allocate the scarce resources intelligently. Specifically, they are looking at how to dynamically assign resources using multiple, nearby edge sites, while meeting the latency requirements of the services.\n\u201cCisco is a pioneer in edge computing. Now they are seeing that there's an opportunity to look at it from a sensor processing in a geo-distributed fashion,\u201d he said.\nPartnering with Cisco gives Ramachandran\u2019s team assurance that they are on the pulse of what\u2019s next in tech.\n\u201cWe can vet the new technology and ensure our research is not already happening in the industry. We want to be sure that what we're developing is not just used for publishing papers but also can be applied in the commercial world. That's where the Cisco partnership is so important,\u201d he said.\n\u201cEdge computing is the next generation paradigm that\u2019s still in its infancy, and there are a lot of things that need to be researched to shape the future of edge computing. This area is super exciting and important for Cisco, and we had an exciting collaboration with Prof. Ramachandran\u2019s research group on some of the key technological advances required to make edge computing a success,\u201d said Kompella.\nWriter : Anne Wainscott-Sargent\nMedia Relations Contact:\nGeorgia Parmelee | georgia.parmelee@gatech.edu\nAdditional Images\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
