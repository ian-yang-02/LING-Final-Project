Metacognition can be as complex as pondering your own thoughts or as simple as knowing you feel itchy, or that you just saw something.\nThe two regions of the PFC that the researchers studied were the\ndorsolateral prefrontal cortex\n(DLPFC) and the anterior prefrontal cortex (aPFC). The aPFC is about two inches above the eyebrow, near the top of the forehead and DLPFC is about a few inches directly behind aPFC.\nThe upper area collects visual sensory input, according to the study, and when it has strong inputs, it signals down to the aPFC, which usually correctly and confidently registers \u2013 yes, I\u2019m aware I see that.\n\u201cThe aPFC takes the evidence from the DLPFC and matches it to a level of confidence of what is being seen,\u201d said graduate research assistant Medha Shekhar.\nRahnev and Shekhar\npublished their study in May in the Journal of Neuroscience .\nTwo-stage signoff\nThough they have separate roles, neither region appears to lay claim to being the chief confidence maker of having seen something.\n\u201cI would say that it\u2019s both parts together,\u201d Rahnev said. \u201cThe whole process of generating a confidence rating can be thought of as metacognition, so both the DLPFC and aPFC contribute to the process.\u201d\nThe DLPFC collects all the inputs. Then it nudges the aPFC to put the stamp on the final confidence rating, according to the psychologists\u2019 model.\nTo do that, the aPFC probably pulls in additional data from elsewhere in the brain.\n\u201cThere is research that suggests that we take into account other, non-perceptual factors when making our confidence judgment,\u201d Shekhar said. \u201cOur previous confidence about past things we\u2019ve seen influences current confidence about what we\u2019re seeing now. We hypothesize that there are other things like attention and arousal that the aPFC is taking into account.\u201d\nRunning brain interference\nResearchers currently can\u2019t directly see the processes that interested them, since neurological imaging technologies are not yet that far along, so the psychologists had to come up with creative ways of observing the mechanisms. They used\ntranscranial magnetic stimulation\n(TMS), which some people know from its application to treat depression, to interfere with activity in one brain region then separately in the other.\n\u201cBy dissociating the contributions made by the two regions, we could discern some mechanisms in these processes we were interested in,\u201d Shekhar said.\nTo track the effects of the dissociation caused by the magnetism, the psychologists had volunteers look at two faint patterns on a drab, gray background that appeared in sequence, and then indicate what they saw. It was nothing fancy, just a series of lined patterns like this one \\\\\\\\ or this one ////.\n\u201cThese are very standard visual inputs for an experiment like this,\u201d Rahnev said. \u201cThey\u2019re the most boring stimuli one can imagine. They\u2019re called\nGabor patches . We use them because we want to minimize interfering neurological activity by not encouraging the brain to do a lot of additional things.\u201d\nThe volunteers pressed buttons to say that the respective line patterns that they saw pointed up to the left \\\\\\\\ or up to the right //// and how sure they were about what they saw.\nConfidence up and down\nWhile the volunteers did this, the researchers used TMS to run interference in the volunteers\u2019 DLPFC and then their aPFC. The TMS affected whether subjects got the line direction right or wrong and how sure subjects felt about what they were seeing.\nApplying TMS to the DLPFC caused the subjects\u2019 confidence levels to sink, presumably because that interfered with it gathering or passing on enough data to trigger confidence. TMS to the aPFC, which had to be applied for a longer period to have relevant effect, actually increased visual metacognitive ability.\nThe two effects were strong evidence that the two brain regions were carrying out separate roles in visual metacognition. The researchers also computationally modeled the brain processes, and their simulation concurred with the experimental results.\nPeeking at consciousness\nDid the researchers observe a piece of what makes consciousness work?\n\u201cConsciousness is tricky because so many processes feed it and help generate it, so we stay agnostic about this and stick with the immediate phenomenon we observe,\u201d Rahnev said.\nBut he did think it may be fair to say that this kind of metacognition stands in the threshold of what we humans like to think of as consciousness.\nLike this article?\u00a0 Get our email newsletter here.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nWriter &\u00a0Media Representative : Ben Brumfield (404-660-1408)\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\n177 North Avenue\nAtlanta, Georgia \u00a030332-0181 \u00a0USA\nEmail\nben.brumfield@comm.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
