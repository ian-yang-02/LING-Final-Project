Bill Nesper, executive director of the League of American Bicyclists, commended the 38 institutions \u2014 including Georgia Tech \u2014 that won a distinction award: \u201cThese colleges and universities are leading by example, building healthy environments where people can safely and easily get around by bike, thereby improving the well-being of their community by enabling access to sustainable transportation options.\u201d\nTech was awarded a Gold level BFU designation, which it also received in\n2016 .\n\u201cThe feedback from 2016 encouraged us to continue expanding our bike network and connectivity,\u201d said Lisa Safstrom, campus transportation planner at Parking and Transportation Services (PTS), \u201cby offering a diversity of infrastructure, which we have implemented \u2014 particularly working with non-campus entities to improve access getting to campus.\u201d\nThe application process is rigorous and seeks to find not only areas of strength but also areas for improvement. On top of that, applicants have the opportunity to recognize different departments and people on campus that contributed to the enhancement of the bike programs.\nWith the help of social media and Institute Communications, PTS' bike programs have garnered more attention over the years, and their partnership with the Georgia Tech Police Department and Bike GT has added an online option for bicycle and scooter safety classes. Starter Bikes, a campus group that helps people repair their bikes and sells used ones, also moved its bike sale events to Facebook. These implementations have allowed for sustainable transportation options to be more accessible to students and faculty. PTS has also collaborated with student groups and non-campus entities to improve accessibility on campus. In response to widespread demand, PTS has opened two secure bike rooms within the Dalney and Tech Square Hotel parking decks as well. More secure parking is planned for the future.\nRecent changes at the intersection of Ferst Drive and Sixth Street improved interactions among bicycles, cars, and pedestrians in a busy area of West Campus. Exciting upcoming developments near campus\u00a0 include a Spring Street cycle track and the Fifth Street Complete Streets Project. The Bike League offers feedback to applicants, offering suggestions for improvement on future projects.\nIn the eight years Safstrom has worked with PTS, she\u2019s seen a change in students\u2019 attitudes toward bike riding as a transportation option.\n\u201cThe number of students biking to campus has increased steadily over the years, but what might be more significant is that the students have gotten more knowledgeable about what makes good infrastructure and have been more communicative about what programs we should be offering on campus,\u201d she said.\nWith more improvements aiming to make campus as bike friendly as possible, PTS hopes to reach platinum level BFU distinction in the next round of applications for 2024.\nLearn more about bicycle resources on campus at\nbike.hwb.gatech.edu , the BFU program at\nbikeleague.org/university , and the PTS bike page at\npts.gatech.edu/bicycling-georgia-tech\nAdditional Images\nContact\nVanesa Vargas\nInstitute Communications\nEmail\nstucomm@gatech.edu\nAdditional information\nFor More Information Contact\nLisa Safstrom\nParking and Transportation Services\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
