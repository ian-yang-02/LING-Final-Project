Incredibly, the light from the most distant black holes (or quasars) has been traveling to us for more than 13 billion light years. However, we do not know how these monster black holes formed.\nNew research led by researchers from Georgia Institute of Technology,\nDublin City University ,\nMichigan State University , the\nUniversity of California at San Diego , the\nSan Diego Supercomputer Center\nand IBM provides a new and extremely promising avenue for solving this cosmic riddle. The team showed that when galaxies assemble extremely rapidly \u2013 and sometimes violently \u2013 that can lead to the formation of very massive black holes. In these rare galaxies, normal star formation is disrupted and black hole formation takes over.\nThe new study finds that massive black holes form in dense starless regions that are growing rapidly, turning upside down the long-accepted belief that massive black hole formation was limited to regions bombarded by the powerful radiation of nearby galaxies. Conclusions of the simulation-based study, reported January 23\u00a0in the journal\nNature\nand supported by funding from the National Science Foundation, the European Union and NASA, also finds that massive black holes are much more common in the universe than previously thought.\nThe key criteria for determining where massive black holes formed during the universe\u2019s infancy relates to the rapid growth of pre-galactic gas clouds that are the forerunners of all present-day galaxies, meaning that most supermassive black holes have a common origin forming in this newly discovered scenario, said\nJohn Wise , an associate professor in the\nCenter for Relativistic Astrophysics\nin Georgia Tech\u2019s School of Physics and the paper\u2019s corresponding author. Dark matter collapses into halos that are the gravitational glue for all galaxies. Early rapid growth of these halos prevented the formation of stars that would have competed with black holes for gaseous matter flowing into the area.\n\u201cIn this study, we have uncovered a totally new mechanism that sparks the formation of massive black holes in particular dark matter halos,\u201d Wise said. \u201cInstead of just considering radiation, we need to look at how quickly the halos grow. We don\u2019t need that much physics to understand it \u2013 just how the dark matter is distributed and how gravity will affect that. Forming a massive black hole requires being in a rare region with an intense convergence of matter.\u201d\nWhen the research team found these black hole formation sites in the simulation they were at first stumped, said John Regan, research fellow in the Centre for Astrophysics and Relativity in Dublin City University. The previously accepted paradigm was that massive black holes could only form when exposed to high levels of nearby radiation.\n\u201cPrevious theories suggested this should only happen when the sites were exposed to high levels of star-formation killing radiation,\u201d he said. \u201cAs we delved deeper, we saw that these sites were undergoing a period of extremely rapid growth. That was the key. The violent and turbulent nature of the rapid assembly, the violent crashing together of the galaxy\u2019s foundations during the galaxy\u2019s birth prevented normal star formation and led to perfect conditions for black hole formation instead. This research shifts the previous paradigm and opens up a whole new area of research.\u201d\nThe earlier theory relied on intense ultraviolet radiation from a nearby galaxy to inhibit the formation of stars in the black hole-forming halo, said Michael Norman, director of the San Diego Supercomputer Center at UC San Diego and one of the work\u2019s authors. \u201cWhile UV radiation is still a factor, our work has shown that it is not the dominant factor, at least in our simulations,\u201d he explained.\nThe research was based on the Renaissance Simulation suite, a 70-terabyte data set created on the Blue Waters supercomputer between 2011 and 2014 to help scientists understand how the universe evolved during its early years. To learn more about specific regions where massive black holes were likely to develop, the researchers examined the simulation data and found ten specific dark matter halos that should have formed stars given their masses but only contained a dense gas cloud. Using the Stampede2 supercomputer, they then re-simulated two of those halos \u2013 each about 2,400 light-years across \u2013 at much higher resolution to understand details of what was happening in them 270 million years after the Big Bang.\n\u201cIt was only in these overly-dense regions of the universe that we saw these black holes forming,\u201d Wise said. \u201cThe dark matter creates most of the gravity, and then the gas falls into that gravitational potential, where it can form stars or a massive black hole.\u201d\nThe Renaissance Simulations are the most comprehensive simulations of the earliest stages of the gravitational assembly of the pristine gas composed of hydrogen and helium and cold dark matter leading to the formation of the first stars and galaxies. They use a technique known as adaptive mesh refinement to zoom in on dense clumps forming stars or black holes. In addition, they cover a large enough region of the early universe to form thousands of objects\u2014a requirement if one is interested in rare objects, as is the case here. \u201cThe high resolution, rich physics and large sample of collapsing halos were all needed to achieve this result,\u201d said Norman.\nThe improved resolution of the simulation done for two candidate regions allowed the scientists to see turbulence and the inflow of gas and clumps of matter forming as the black hole precursors began to condense and spin. Their growth rate was dramatic.\n\u201cAstronomers observe supermassive black holes that have grown to a billion solar masses in 800 million years,\u201d Wise said. \u201cDoing that required an intense convergence of mass in that region. You would expect that in regions where galaxies were forming at very early times.\u201d\nAnother aspect of the research is that the halos that give birth to black holes may be more common than previously believed.\n\u201cAn exciting component of this work is the discovery that these types of halos, though rare, may be common enough,\u201d said Brian O\u2019Shea, a professor at Michigan State University.\u00a0 \u201cWe predict that this scenario would happen enough to be the origin of the most massive black holes that are observed, both early in the universe and in galaxies at the present day.\u201d\nFuture work with these simulations will look at the lifecycle of these massive black hole formation galaxies, studying the formation, growth and evolution of the first massive black holes across time. \u201cOur next goal is to probe the further evolution of these exotic objects. Where are these black holes today? Can we detect evidence of them in the local Universe or with gravitational waves?\u201d Regan asked.\nFor these new answers, the research team \u2013 and others \u2013 may return to the simulations.\n\u201cThe Renaissance Simulations are sufficiently rich that other discoveries can be made using data already computed,\u201d said Norman. \u201cFor this reason we have created a public archive at SDSC containing called the Renaissance Simulations Laboratory where others can pursue questions of their own.\u201d\nThis research was supported by the National Science Foundation through grants PHY-1430152, AST-1514700, AST-161433 and OAC-1835213, by NASA grants NNX12AC98G, 147 NNX15AP39G, and NNX17AG23G, and by Hubble theory grants HST-AR-13261.01, HST-AR-14315.001, and HST-AR-14326.
