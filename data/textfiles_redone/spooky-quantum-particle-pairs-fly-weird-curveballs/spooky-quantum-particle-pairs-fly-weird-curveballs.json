The image does not show anything done in the study at Georgia Tech but serves to illustrate to the reader how intersecting lasers are used to trap atoms. Combined with other methods, the lasers also slow the atoms\u00a0to a near stop, cooling them to temperatures near absolute zero, the coldest possible temperature in the universe. That cold, matter's\u00a0wave characteristics become very visible.\nJun 01, 2018\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nCurvy baseball pitches have surprising things in common with quantum particles described in a\nnew physics study , though the latter fly much more weirdly.\nIn fact, ultracold paired particles called\nfermions\nmust behave even weirder than physicists previously thought, according to theoretical physicists from the Georgia Institute of Technology, who mathematically studied their flight patterns. The researchers even predicted that the particles can\u00a0act like different quantum balls called bosons to mimic the manner that photons, or particles of light, fly.\nAlready, flying quantum particles were renowned for their weirdness. To understand why, start with\u00a0similarities to a baseball then add significant differences.\nA pitcher imparts spin, momentum, and energy to a baseball when throwing a curveball, a change-up, or a slider. Fermions\u2019 funny flights are likewise carved by spins, momenta, and energies, but also by powerful quantum eccentricities like entanglement, which Albert Einstein once called \u201cspooky action at a distance\u201d between quantum particles.\nA simplified explanation of these ultracold paired particles and their odd flights is below.\nLight-matter modeling\nThose influences all combine\u00a0to give fermions a trajectory repertoire much odder than that of any master baseball pitcher, and the new study maps it out and opens new ways to observe it experimentally. The Georgia Tech team took the offbeat approach of adding quantum optical -- or light-like \u2013 ideas to their predictive calculations of these specks of matter and arrived at eyebrow-raising, insightful results.\n\u201cThe particle behavior we predicted is just schizophrenic,\u201d said\nUzi Landman, Regents\u2019 and Institute Professor and F.E. Callaway Endowed Chair\nin Georgia Tech\u2019s School of Physics.\nMathematical and theoretical details can be found in the study\u00a0 in the journal\nPhysical Review A ,\u00a0which Landman, first author Benedikt Brandt, who is a graduate research assistant, and senior scientist Constantine Yannouleas published on May 4, 2018. Their research was\nfunded by the Air Force Office of Scientific Research .\nFlying fermions explained\nTracing quantum curveballs is counterintuitive by nature with concepts like\u00a0fermions, bosons, spins, spooky entanglement, and particle-wave duality. So, let\u2019s go step-by-step to understand them and\u00a0the study\u2019s insights.\nThis\u00a0ballgame revolves around fermion pairs. Fermions can be subatomic particles or whole atoms. In this case, the physicists modeled using atoms.\nThe term fermion refers to quantum-statistical\u00a0properties that the particle has as opposed the properties of\u00a0its counterpart particle called a boson, in particular, the particle\u2019s spin, which is called half-integer for fermions and full-integer for bosons. (These spins aren\u2019t exactly like those on a ball. For more, see:\nFermions and Bosons for Dummies .)\n\"Photons and Higgs bosons are examples of bosons,\" Landman said. \"Bosons are gregarious: Two or more bosons can share the exact same space. This allows many of them to be superimposed onto each other on the same tiny spot.\"\n\"Fermions, on the other hand, are standoffish. They lay\u00a0claim to their own space, and don't share it with other particles. Fermions can be stacked upon each other but do not occupy the same space.\"\nElectrons, protons, neutrons, and many atoms are common examples of fermions.\nLaser-tweezing baseballs\nThe theoretical study envisions two fermionic atoms starting out carefully held next to each other by two pairs of \u201ctweezers\u201d made of intersecting laser beams, as is\u00a0actually done in applicable physics experiments. In the study's theoretical setup, lasers and special magnetic fields would also be used to slow the fermions to a near halt, making them \u201cultracold\u201d at 0.000000001 degrees Kelvin, or -273.15 degrees Celsius (-459.67 degrees Fahrenheit).\nThat\u2019s a sliver above absolute zero, the lowest possible temperature in the universe, and particles that cold do strange things.\n\u201cA particle\u2019s motion is usually frantic, but the cooling slows it down almost to a stand-still,\u201d said Landman, who is also director of the\nGeorgia Tech Center for Computational Materials Science . \u201cAnd these particles also have wave properties, and at that temperature, the wavelength grows enormously long.\u201d\n\u201cThe waves become microns in size. That would be like a pebble growing to be a third of the size of this country. When that happens, the atom actually becomes visible under an optical microscope.\u201d\nThe inflated size makes it easier for researchers to know the two particles\u2019 starting locations. When they turn the laser tweezers off, the fermions fly away. The particles\u2019 wave properties also have a lot to do with their weird flights.\n\u201cA particle in motion will act as a projectile under certain circumstances. But in others, it will behave like a wave,\u201d Landman said. \u201cWe call it the quantum world duality.\u201d\nTogether or apart\n\u201cIf you set up two detectors at different positions but the same distance from the particle pair, how often the two fly into the same detector or how often they fly into separate ones says a lot about those particles,\u201d Landman said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s where our weird findings come in.\u201d\nFermions are expected to fly differently from\u00a0bosons, but the theoretical physicists\u2019 study on fermions revises this idea. Depending on the degree of quantum entanglement between the two fermions before they\u2019re released and depending on their energy level, they can act like fermions\nor\nact like bosons.\n\u201cThis adds new weirdness to the already established schizophrenic particle-wave duality,\u201d Landman said.\n\u201cA pair of photons (which are bosons) fly to the same place. They stay as a pair,\u201d Landman said. \u201cThey\u2019re social animals, and you find them either both in the one detector or both in the other. We call this phenomenon \u2018bunching.\u2019\u201d\nWeirdo flight paths\nFermions are often expected to do the opposite, referred to as anti-bunching, but according to the study, how they fly depends on whether or not they have spooky interaction and, if so, whether the interaction is attractive or repulsive.\n\u201cIf they\u2019re interacting, and depending on the starting energy level, we predict that they may do strange things when they fly,\u201d Landman said. \u201cThat\u2019s new.\u201d\n\u201cAt the base energy level, called ground state, our two fermions that interact with ultra-strong repulsion behave fermionically, meaning they avoid each other. Now, if they interact with strong attraction, they aggregate the way bosons do,\u201d Landman said. \u201cSo far, all as expected.\u201d\nBut bumping up the trapped particles\u2019 level of energy, or excitation, via an additional laser or a magnetic field, would appear to heighten the particles\u2019 weirdness. The excitation levels can twist the rules of what interactions do to a fermion\u2019s flight, according to the theoretical study.\nFor example, the above mentioned fermionic behavior usually connected with strong repulsive interaction could turn bosonic, according to the physicists\u2019 calculations. In other words, the two particles would fly to the same detector the way bosons do.\nOrderly quantum schizophrenia\n\u201cAs crazy as all this looks, there appears to be strong reliability in these behaviors that could even be predictably and practically manipulated,\u201d Landman said.\nAs with a pitcher who finesses a screwball\u2019s path,\u00a0physicists could determine a fermion\u2019s weird flight using\u00a0 quantum mechanical formulation ,\u00a0advanced computational simulation, and experimentation, the study said.\n\u201cIt looks like you may even be able to engineer what this quantum weirdness does,\u201d Landman said. \"If you know particle states reliably, you may be able to use them as a resource for quantum computations and information storage and retrieval.\"\nLike this article?\u00a0 Get our email newsletter here.\nThe research was funded by the Air Force Office of Scientific Research (award # FA9550-418 15-1-0519).
