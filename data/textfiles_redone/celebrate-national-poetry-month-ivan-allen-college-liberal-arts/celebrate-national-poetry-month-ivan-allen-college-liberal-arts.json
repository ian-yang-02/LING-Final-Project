And we\u2019re here for it.\nAll month long, Poetry@Tech, a unit of the\nSchool of Literature, Media, and Communication , and the\nIvan Allen College of Liberal Arts\nwill be celebrating verse in all its forms with exhibitions, poetry readings, and more.\n\u201cPoetry has been around for thousands of years and there\u2019s a reason why,\u201d said Victoria Chang, the Margaret T. and Henry C. Bourne Jr. Chair in Poetry, and director of Poetry@Tech. \u201cPoems can get at our emotions in different ways from other art forms. Plus, poetry writing is really fun \u2014 sometimes it feels like solving a puzzle that is ultimately unsolvable, but fun to try solving.\u201d\nIn addition to teaching poetry to students across campus,\nChang\nand her colleagues at Poetry@Tech put on poetry readings, publish the\nTerminus\nliterary magazine, and promote the value of poetry to the community. Poetry@Tech was founded in 2001 by luminary poet\nThomas Lux .\nThis month\u2019s celebration begins with something you've probably already noticed, if you've been out and about on campus: yard signs bearing snippets of poems and quotes from writers such as Ada Lim\u00f3n, Audre Lorde, Lucille Clifton, and\nChang .\nStarting Monday, you can also swing by the Library to check out readings of poems by some of Poetry@Tech\u2019s guest readers this year \u2014 Chang, Jessica Tanck, Sam Sax, James Davis May, Sasha Stiles, and others \u2014 on the\nMedia Bridge . The Library also will display a curated selection of poetry books near the Library\u2019s Popular Reading area on the first floor of Price Gilbert.\nWe\u2019ll also celebrate throughout the month on\nX\n(formerly Twitter),\nInstagram , and other social media channels with posts featuring students discussing some of their favorite poems and what poetry means.\nOn Thursday evening, you can attend \u201cPoetry@Tech: Then and Now,\u201d hosted by former Georgia Tech President G. Wayne Clough and Bruce McEver, a businessperson and poet whose generous donations to Poetry@Tech have helped the program thrive over its 24 years of existence.\nWe round out the celebration on April 18 with two events. First, join Sax for a\npoetry performance workshop , part of the Arts@Tech Festival, from 11 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. in the lobby of the Fest Center for the Arts.\nThat evening, Sax, Tanck, and Pulitzer Prize-winning poet Carl Philips will read selections from their work during our National Poetry Month Poetry Reading. The\nevent\nstarts at 6 p.m. with a reception featuring light snacks and drinks, followed by the reading at 7 p.m. The event is free and open to the public.\n\u201cI hope our students walking around campus will see the yard signs with these lines of verse, and it gives them a moment to pause, not thinking about this test or that project, and reflect on their own creative impulse,\u201d said Travis Denton, associate director of Poetry@Tech.\n\u201cWe hope, too, that celebrating National Poetry Month at Georgia Tech will raise awareness of Poetry@Tech across campus and let students, faculty, and staff know a world-class poetry reading series is available to them, as well as poetry and poetry writing classes, and that everyone is welcome to take part,\u201d\nDenton\nsaid.\nYou can find details on these happenings and more on the\nPoetry@Tech National Poetry Month page.\nNow, get your National Poetry Month off to a great start and go\nwrite a poem .
