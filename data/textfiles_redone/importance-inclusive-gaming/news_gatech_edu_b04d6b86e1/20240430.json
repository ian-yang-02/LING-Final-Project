A growing gamer base spurs discussion about why inclusive gaming is important and how it can help people claim space in the real world.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nEmail\nOct 26, 2023\n\"By nature, humans are storytellers,\" says\u00a0 Lee Hibbard , a Marion L. Brittain Postdoctoral Fellow in the\u00a0 School of Literature, Media, and Communication . \"And since people have been people, we have found ways to entertain ourselves.\"\nHibbard studies how people talk about their identities and share them with others. Much of this comes down to storytelling, he explains. Humans love to share stories because it's how we relate to each other and find common ground. In video games, role-playing, and tabletop games such as Dungeons & Dragons (D&D), storytelling comes to life in an interactive way that movies, TV shows, and books just don't match.\n\"Games are such a huge marker of identity formation, especially for young people, because they give you the chance to pick up and play with things and try stuff out for fun,\" Hibbard says. \"It's a lower stakes opportunity to experiment with yourself and with other people, and it's a cool way to learn about yourself.\"\nInterest in these kinds of games has exploded since the Covid-19 pandemic, with\u00a0 one study \u00a0reporting that online searches for D&D have increased by 85% since 2020. Beyond playing the games themselves, fans spend millions of hours a year on Twitch and YouTube watching players adventure in these fantasy worlds. Rising interest and a growing gamer base spur discussion about the importance of inclusion in such spaces, Hibbard says.\nIn the following Q&A, Hibbard discusses why inclusive gaming is so important and how it can help people in marginalized communities claim space in the real world.\nRead the full article on the Ivan Allen College website.\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nThe Importance of Inclusive Gaming\nContact\nMichael Pearson\nIvan Allen College of Liberal Arts\nEmail\nmichael.pearson@iac.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
