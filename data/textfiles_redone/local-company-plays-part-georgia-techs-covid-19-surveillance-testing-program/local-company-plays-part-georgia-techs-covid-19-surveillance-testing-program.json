The privately held enterprise, with fewer than 100 employees, works with research labs at universities and governments, and private industry. Its products are sold globally.\n\u201cUnderstanding the gravity of the Covid-19 pandemic, how it affected us personally, and witnessing the unprecedented effort that was mobilized to help detect and stop the virus, the team at Omni was eager to help do our part,\u201d Tortorelli said.\nUtilizing Omni International\u2019s technology, Tech has administered tens of thousands of tests to students, faculty, and staff since it was launched in August (coinciding with the start of the fall semester), has averaged more than 7,500 tests per week, and has identified 700 individuals who have tested positive for Covid-19. By identifying and isolating those infected early \u2014 before they suspect they are ill \u2014 the program helps break the chain of transmission that could otherwise fuel exponential growth of the highly contagious virus.\n\u201cThe performance of our saliva-based test employing the Omni products is excellent, and our collaboration with a local Georgia business made it very easy to obtain the data and validation we needed for our test development efforts,\u201d said Mike Shannon, a principal research engineer at the Georgia Tech Research Institute, and project lead on Tech\u2019s surveillance testing program.\nSpecifically, Omni International\u2019s homogenizing technology is used to separate the virus collected from the saliva or mucous samples collected from Tech individuals. The homogenizer shakes saliva samples at a high rate of speed in multiple directions, similar to the way machines mix paint at home improvement stores.\n\u201cImagine a gelatin mold with chunks of fruit,\u201d said Zachary Morehouse, a research consultant and project scientist at Omni International. \u201cThe gelatin is the saliva, and the fruit pieces are the coronavirus.\u00a0What the homogenizer does is separate the two, so you get enough bits of virus to extract and test the RNA.\u201d\nThis process lyses or ruptures the virus membranes, releasing ribonucleic acid (RNA) into the saliva, said Rodney Nash, Omni International\u2019s chief science officer, who led the four-person team tasked to work with Georgia Tech.\nAt this point in the process, Tech researchers use extraction kits from Omega Bio-tek, a Norcross, Georgia-based manufacturer of nucleic acid purification kits for clinical, biotechnology, and agricultural research, to extricate the RNA from the saliva.\n\u201cWe have been working in partnership with Omega Bio-tek on numerous Covid-19 analytical workflows since April. These initial efforts were focused on Tech\u2019s support to the state of Georgia and deployed Omega\u2019s Mag-Bind Viral DNA/RNA extraction kit for use in large-scale Covid-19 testing across Georgia,\u201d Shannon said. \u201cThe Omega kit contains reagents and specially formulated magnetic beads, which isolate viral DNA and RNA. We have fully implemented the Omega kit into our automated workflows.\u201d\nThis purified RNA is then used in what\u2019s called a polymerase chain reaction (PCR), a process that amplifies or increases the number of copies of the RNA. PCR is the gold standard approach, since it directly targets RNA from the coronavirus.\nAn added benefit of this protocol is that there are built-in positive and negative controls, meaning every time an extraction is run, and the subsequent PCR process enacted, the findings are being tested against samples known to be positive and negative.\nIndeed, developing a testing protocol that could help contain the spread of the virus on a college campus was challenging. At the onset, the goal, as laid out by Georgia Tech researchers, was to develop a less intrusive testing alternative to the-then prevailing testing method of the long cotton swab sticks inserted deep into the nasal cavity to collect mucous samples for testing. Aside from being uncomfortable for the person being tested, there was a risk of the people performing the tests not doing it properly to extract enough mucous to conduct the test for an accurate result.\nTech researchers developed the saliva-based protocol to identify asymptomatic carriers of Covid-19 in its own community.\n\u201cSince April, our team has been working on the development of the saliva-based test. From laboratory experiments to field clinical trials, we explored all of the areas needed to qualify a diagnostic test,\u201d Shannon said. \u201cThe final hurdle was specimen preparation. We considered three distinct approaches, and quickly the Omni approach emerged as the best option. After contacting Omni and beginning our collaboration, it was clear to us that we hit a homerun.\u201d\nThe saliva-based method was preferred, in part, to mitigate the risk of supply chain shortages with the nasal swabs. The researchers also chose the saliva method \u201cbecause we knew it was easy to administer, the supply chain was stable, and people would not be reluctant to get tested often,\u201d Shannon said.\nEven so, saliva presented some challenges.\n\u201cSaliva has a substantial mucous component and is composed of proteins such as mucins, and enzymes, and electrolytes,\u201d Shannon said, explaining he and his team evaluated various testing protocols to address the mucous issues.\n\u201cThe mucous tends to be highly elastic, sticky, and express significant adhesive characteristics, which all lead to differences in the components of the specimen being tested. These differences or discontinuities create issues in the laboratory workflow such as\u00a0\u200bclogging of pipettes and liquid-handling robots.\u201d\nBut he said the approach Tech researchers developed with Omni, including specialized specimen collection tubes and integrated ceramic beads for RNA extraction, \u201ccompletely eliminated all concerns and issues we had related to saliva analysis.\u201d\nDeveloping and rolling out an effective testing program in a global pandemic required strong teamwork, an innovative approach, and willingness to try some new things, Nash said, adding Omni International is supplying Tech with collection tubes to support 1,500 tests a day.\n\u201cWe have the resources and the ability to do this and a real obligation,\u201d he said. \u201cThe owner of our company is big on community involvement, and we ran to it when the opportunity presented itself.\u201d\nTech\u2019s Shannon agreed, adding that building a strong public-private partnership, and finding the right external partner was critical in finding a Georgia solution to a Georgia problem.\n\u201cIt\u2019s good to work with people who are willing to be innovative and, really, in this pandemic, the whole world had to be innovative,\u201d said Morehouse. \u201cIt\u2019s been beneficial to work with a group at Georgia Tech that\u2019s been willing to look at problems so differently.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nRead More: Broad-Based Asymptomatic Testing Program Helps Control Covid-19\nContact\nP\u00e9ralte C.
