It\u2019s the result of a grant from the National Science Foundation, which was looking for ways to learn from Harvey.\nLed by Frederick Law Olmsted Professor John E. Taylor, one of the interesting results of the team\u2019s work over the last year was that a lack of activity can be just as instructive as people asking for help.\n\u201cObviously, where people who are in trouble have explicitly said, \u2018I'm in trouble,\u2019 that's critical to respond to,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cBut an important secondary predictor is, what about areas where people are saying nothing where they were before?\u201d\n\u201cHow do we hear the silence?\u201d asked Taylor\u2019s Ph.D. student Rachel Samuels, who presented the work at a big disaster conference this week. \u201cHow do we turn silence into sound?\u201d\nSamuels collected building-level damage assessments from the Federal Emergency Management Agency and compared that to the Twitter activity, breaking the city into 10-kilometer areas. Her idea was to map real-time damage using tweets.\nUsing posts on the micro-blogging site has been done before by researchers who match spikes of activity to infrastructure damage, Samuels said.\n\u201cWhat we found that it missed are these data shadows, where areas that don't have any Twitter activity at all are also being damaged. So, how can we shed some light on those data shadows?\u201d\nThat\u2019s where the team\u2019s new software tool will come in. Using tweets from users that have tagged their posts with their location, their system can assess the sentiments people express, identify trending topics in localized areas, and also note where activity has dropped off significantly from normal \u2014 all in the service of helping emergency workers better identify where they need to deploy their resources.\n\u201cWe're using unsupervised machine learning techniques to extract what we call \u2018geo topics,\u2019\u201d Taylor said. \u201cA topic that is associated with negativity that's in a certain geographic space comes to the list, and the first responders will see a list of, for example, the five leading geo topics that are occurring right now somewhere in the city.\u201d\nUniquely, users don\u2019t have to tell the system anything about what to look for\u00a0\u2014\u00a0a key advance, Taylor said.\n\u201cThat is actually the key innovation to the backend system. You don't have to,\na priori , know what you're looking for.\u201d\nThe backend programming for the system is operational, thanks to the work of Taylor\u2019s now-graduated Ph.D. student Yan Wang, but Samuels is still working on the front-end design for the software. Taylor said they plan to meet with five to 10 emergency response agencies throughout the summer to collect feedback and improve the system. But they also hope to offer a beta version of the system to responders so they can use it this hurricane season.\nThere\u2019s one other piece to the software that Samuels is especially excited about: the ability to link professional disaster responders and people who just want to help coordinate their efforts. That grew out of Samuels\u2019 respect for that Cajun Navy that cruised from Baton Rouge to Houston last August to help people in need and the Cajun Army that put boots on the ground after floodwaters receded.\n\u201cPart of why I really wanted to do this was to also provide a platform with which citizen responders, who I would really like to be able to enable, can also work with emergency response professionals,\u201d she said.\n\u201cI'm very impressed with the Cajun Army. I would love to be able to make it easier for them to also be able to coordinate with the people whose job it is to respond to these disasters.\u201d\nTaylor said the system will be useful for large disasters other than hurricanes, too, like an earthquake, where problems develop in the immediate aftermath of the initial event.\n\u201cThis is about identifying smaller crises happening within a much larger crisis. There are dangers within this larger, monolithic thing like an earthquake or a hurricane. We need to take advantage of emerging data streams to find those in danger and get help to where help is needed.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nNew Research May Improve Communications During Natural Disasters\nContact\nJoshua Stewart\nCommunications\nSchool of Civil and Environmental Engineering\n404.385.3171\nEmail\njoshua.stewart@ce.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
