The exhibit showcased more than 20 years of research and commercial efforts that helped bring wearable\u00a0computing technology into people's daily lives.\nThe project featured more than 50 displays. They included electronic textiles, advances in battery life and on-body interfaces. Several head-mounted displays, including interactive demos with Google's Project Glass, were also featured. School of Interactive Computing Professor Thad Starner, a technical lead on Glass, helped plan the project. Several wearable prototypes that he developed or has used since 1993 were also on display.\nStarner worked with School of Industrial Design Asssitant Professor Kevin Shankwiler, School of Industrial Design Research Scientist Clint Zeagler and graduate researcher Yoni Kaplan to plan the exhibit. Discussions are now underway to take it on tour this summer.\nClick here\nto see the virtual exhibit.\nCHI 2014\nis the premier international conference on human-computer interaction.\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nVirtual Tour\nGeorgia Tech Wearable Computing Center\nGeorgia Tech at SIGCHI\nContact\nJoshua PrestonCollege of Computing404-385-3845 jpreston@cc.gatech.edu\nEmail\njpreston@cc.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
