Credit: Mobilizing Opportunities for Volunteer Experiences\nNov 16, 2020\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nStudent organizations have had to find new ways to operate this semester, from holding virtual meetings to changing the formatting of their events. Mobilizing Opportunities for Volunteer Experiences, or MOVE, is one such organization; this fall, they\u2019ve been working to find safe ways to connect students to volunteer and community service opportunities.\nThat\u2019s why they recently launched\nMOVEments , a podcast where students, student organizations, and local nonprofits can talk about the work they do in getting people involved in their communities. Episodes range from approximately 35 minutes to an hour in length and are released biweekly. MOVE decided on a podcast for this project because it allows\u00a0them to go\u00a0in-depth with\u00a0their interviews, and allows listeners to hear these stories at any time.\nEach episode of MOVEments focuses on a topic covered by one of MOVE\u2019s six committees: animal welfare, STEM and education, hunger and homelessness, sustainability, medical assistance, and special projects. Past guests have included representatives from the\nStudents\u2019 Temporary Assistance and Resources\n(STAR) program,\nBooks Not Bombs , and\nHands On Atlanta . Any organization whose work fits into one of those categories can apply to appear on the podcast\nhere . Interviews for MOVEments are conducted virtually.\nMOVE believes that community service and civic engagement are especially important right now, because they allow people to stay engaged with their communities when regular interactions can be hard to come by.\n\u201cCovid-19 has affected a lot of lives this year, and there are so many organizations and projects designed to help them,\u201d said Sydney Blakeney, logistics director of MOVE and the host of MOVEments. \u201cWhether it\u2019s donating clothes or money to a center fighting to end homelessness or writing a thank you note to essential workers, those actions can make a huge difference in someone\u2019s life.\u201d\nStudents can get involved with MOVE at any point in the semester. Visit their\nEngage page\nfor a list of upcoming events (none of which requires MOVE membership to attend) and rolling committee member application. Organizations looking for funding for their own service projects can also apply for the MOVE Service Grant there, but they must do so at least three weeks in advance.\n\u201cThere are a lot more forms of civic engagement and service than people realize, and I hope we can introduce people to them,\u201d Blakeney said.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nGrace Wyner\nInstitute Communications\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
