Georgia Tech\u2019s approach does the job using a novel pen-size device that requires no batteries and can be mass produced at low cost.\nThe team\u2019s\nfindings\nare reported in the Oct. 20 issue of the\nProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\nThe Aha Moment\nThe inspiration for their breakthrough came from an everyday device that people use to start a grill: the electronic barbecue lighter.\n\u201cMy lab figured out that you could use something all of us are familiar with on the Fourth of July when we do a barbecue \u2014 a barbecue lighter,\u201d recalled Saad Bhamla, assistant professor in the School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, explaining that every time one clicks the lighter, it generates a brief pulse of electricity to ignite the flame.\nHis team took the innards of a lighter and reengineered them into a tiny spring-latch mechanism. \u00a0The device creates the same electric field in the skin as the large bulky electroporation machines already in use, but using widely available, low-cost components that require no battery to operate.\n\u201cOur aha moment was the fact that it doesn't have a battery or plug into the wall, unlike conventional electroporation equipment,\u201d he explained. \u201cAnd these lighter components cost just pennies, while currently available electroporators cost thousands of dollars each.\u201d\nPairing the reimagined lighter device with microneedle technology from Georgia Tech\u2019s Laboratory for Drug Delivery has resulted in a new ultra-low-cost electroporation system, or \u201cePatch.\u201d\nCloser Electrode Spacing, Lower Voltages\nBesides the lighter, a key innovation involved tightly spacing the electrodes and using extremely short microneedles. While commonly used in cosmetics to rejuvenate skin and for potential medical applications, microneedles are not generally used as electrodes. Coupling the tiny electroporation pulser with microneedle electrodes made an effective electrical interface with the skin and further reduced the ePatch\u2019s cost and complexity.\nAccording to Mark Prausnitz, Regents' Professor and the J. Erskine Love Jr. Chair in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, their microneedle-based system uses voltages similar to conventional electroporation but with pulses that are 10,000 times shorter and using electrodes that penetrate just .01 inch into the skin surface.\n\u201cThe close spacing of the microneedles allows us to use microsecond pulses rather than the millisecond pulses applied in conventional electroporation. This shorter pulse, plus the shallow location of the microneedle electrodes, minimizes nerve and muscle stimulation, which can avoid pain and twitching, both common side effects of conventional electroporation,\u201d he said.\n\u201cOur goal was to design a method for Covid-19 vaccination that\u00a0uses a device that is simple, low-cost and manufacturable,\u201d said Dengning Xia, lead author on the study while working as a research scientist at Georgia Tech and currently an associate professor at Sun Yat-sen University in China.\n\u201cThe ePatch is a handheld device the size of a pen, weighing less than two ounces, and requiring no battery or power sources. It operates by simply pushing a button, which makes it very simple to use,\u201d he said.\nTesting for an Immune Response\nBut could their system be used with a vaccine to generate an immune response?\nTo find out, the researchers teamed with Chinglai Yang, associate professor in the Department of Microbiology and Immunology at Emory University School of Medicine, to test the delivery system first using a florescent protein to ensure it worked, and to deliver an actual Covid-19 vaccine. They selected an experimental DNA vaccine for Covid-19 as their model.\n\u201cIn the beginning, I wasn't sure that it would be successful when Georgia Tech asked me to collaborate on this project,\u201d Yang said. \u201cSurprisingly, even in the first try, it went far beyond my expectations. Using this method with the same amount of vaccine, the ePatch induced an almost tenfold improved immune response over intramuscular immunization or intradermal injection without electroporation. It also showed no lasting effects to the mice\u2019s skin. What this means is that it is easier to achieve protection,\u201d he said.\nSimplifying Electroporation\nThe researchers say the ePatch should also work for mRNA vaccination, which they are currently studying.\nBut devising a simpler, cost-effective electroporator that works with the DNA vaccine could dramatically reduce the cost and complexity of vaccinations since it doesn\u2019t require deep-freeze storage of mRNA vaccines, which need frigid temperatures because they contain lipid nanoparticles.\n\u201cWe think the key to making DNA vaccination work is to make electroporation simple, low-cost, and scalable,\u201d Prausnitz said.\nThe ePatch is generating excitement among health experts, including Nadine Rouphael, professor of medicine and executive director of the Hope Clinic at the Emory Vaccine Center. She notes that today\u2019s genetic vaccines, whether mRNA or DNA, remain expensive as a global solution because they either require a complicated cold chain and costly manufacturing due to the formulation of lipid nanoparticles for mRNA delivery or they need a sophisticated electroporation device for DNA vaccine delivery.\nA Vaccine Delivery Breakthrough\n\u201cThe Georgia Tech portable and affordable electroporation ePatch can overcome these limitations and can be a potential game changer in the vaccine delivery arena,\u201d Rouphael predicted.\nThe researchers are already looking at ways to refine their system, examining how to optimize the immune response on the skin site and integrating the device into one unit.\n\u201cThat would revolutionize the vaccination process,\u201d Yang said.\nThe team must meet multiple milestones before human trials. Prausnitz anticipates it will be more than five years before their invention could complete clinical study and be ready for widespread use. He envisioned the ePatch following a more traditional device approval process than the accelerated vaccine approvals that happened during the pandemic.\nAll four researchers echo Rouphael\u2019s enthusiasm for the potential of their ePatch to democratize access to vaccinations. Bhamla explained that vaccines work for those who can afford them and have access to healthcare resources, but that is not feasible for large segments of the developing world.\n\u201cWe know that Covid-19 won\u2019t be the last pandemic,\u201d Bhamla said. \u201cWe need to think from a cost as well as design perspective about how to simplify and scale up our hardware so these modern interventions can be more equitably dispersed \u2014 to reach more underserved and more under-resourced areas of the world.\u201d\nThe research team also included Gaurav Byagathvalli, Huan Yu, and Chao-Yi Lu from Georgia Tech and Rui Jin and Ling Ye from Emory University.\nMark Prausnitz is an inventor of patents licensed to companies, is a paid advisor to companies, and is a founder/shareholder of companies developing microneedle-based products.
