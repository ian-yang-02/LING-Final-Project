It was slightly modified for the College of Sciences website.\nFall is yellow jacket season. Not football or basketball, but the time of year when colonies of yellow jackets \u2014 the insects \u2014 reach their maximum size. It\u2019s also when Professor Michael Goodisman and the Goodisman Research Group collect their nests.\n\u201cWe typically collect nests for a month or so beginning in late October, which is prime time for collecting. The colonies usually die off around Thanksgiving, and are completely dead by Christmas \u2014 although climate change may be moving the dates,\u201d said\nGoodisman , associate professor and associate chair for Undergraduate Education in the\nSchool of Biological Sciences .\nHumans usually cross paths with the yellow jackets\u2019 underground nests a couple of times a year. The first is between April and June, when people tend to mow their lawns frequently. The second is fall, when it\u2019s time to rake leaves.\n\u201cYellow jackets are particularly aggressive this time of year,\u201d said Goodisman, whose team collects the insects alive, albeit somewhat sedated. The underground nests typically have a single hole, about the size of a silver dollar, for entering and exiting.\n\u201cWe pour a little bit of anesthetic into the hole. It does the same thing to them that it does to us \u2014 it knocks them out,\u201d Goodisman said. \u201cThen we try to dig up the nest very quickly before they come to. We pull the nest out and bring it back to the lab.\u201d\nWhen collecting nests, Goodisman and the team wear beekeepers\u2019 uniforms with long pants underneath for additional protection. Yellow jackets are aggressive and will push their way through air holes in the pith helmets, so the researchers cover them with tape to keep the insects out.\n\u201cI have had that happen to me, and it\u2019s no fun at all!\u201d said Goodisman. \u201cIf there\u2019s an opening, they will find it and get in.\u201d\nStudying Yellow Jacket Behavior\nThe\nGoodisman Research Group\nis studying yellow jackets to learn about highly social behavior.\n\u201cYellow jackets are an example of some of the most extreme and impressive social behavior that you will see in any animal, even more so than in humans,\u201d Goodisman said. \u201cTheir social structure is similar to honeybees in that they typically have a single queen, though not always. She produces a bunch of selfless workers that work until the colony succeeds.\u201d\nThe researchers are also interested in studying multiyear super colonies. Nests usually last only one season, from May to December. But when temperatures are mild, a colony can survive the winter and become massive the next year.\n\u201cWe have seen this in New Zealand, Australia, and South Africa. We\u2019re starting to see it in Florida, South Alabama, and California \u2014 super colonies the size of a car,\u201d Goodisman said.\nThese changes bring up other questions, such as, are yellow jackets facing the same environmental threats as honeybees?\n\u201cThe short answer is we don\u2019t know. There\u2019s no one studying yellow jackets the same way they\u2019re studying honeybees,\u201d Goodisman said. \u201cBut not all of the things that affect honeybees will affect yellow jackets.\u201d\nHoneybees have been partially domesticated and bred for successful pollination, reduced aggression, and increased honey production. Unfortunately, domestication often has unwanted side effects. For example, domesticated honeybees may display fewer behavioral defenses against parasites than feral honeybees as a consequence of the domestication process.\n\u201cYellow jackets don\u2019t really have that. We don\u2019t associate yellow jackets with having a lot of diseases. They still could be subjected to pesticides, but it\u2019s not really known,\u201d Goodisman said.\nIt\u2019s hard to tell if there has been a decrease in the yellow jacket population based on the calls the Goodisman Research Group receives.\n\u201cThere has been no systematic survey that I know of,\u201d he said. \u201cI think a widespread survey over many years would be interesting.\u201d\nGo (Yellow) Jackets!\nGoodisman\u2019s interest in insects began when he was a child in Syracuse, New York.\n\u201cThere are yellow jackets in Syracuse and all across North America, from Mexico to Alaska,\u201d he said \u2014 indeed, they can be found all across the northern hemisphere. They are one of the most common and successful social insects.\n\u201cThey\u2019re great fun, as you might imagine. They have a lot of personality,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s exhilarating when you\u2019re trying to pull them out of the ground or get them out of the house.\u201d\nHis undergraduate research at Cornell University included work with insects, and he did his doctoral thesis at the University of Georgia on fire ants.\nWhile at UGA he saw fire ants in a tray in the lab, and he thought it was \u201cso cool.\u201d But his work with yellow jackets didn\u2019t start until he did postdoctoral work in Australia.\n\u201cThere was some interesting research being done on invasive yellow jackets in Australia and New Zealand. I\u2019ve been working on yellow jackets well before I came to Georgia Tech.\u201d\nIt was purely coincidental that Goodisman became a professor at Georgia Tech, home of the Yellow Jackets. But it still causes the occasional raised eyebrow when he tells people about his research.\n\u201cPeople do a double take and ask if I\u2019m at Tech because of my yellow jacket research. They ask if I have a yellow jacket professorship, or if I\u2019m the \u2018Chair of Yellow Jacket Research.\u2019 It\u2019s always a fun conversation, especially with Georgia Tech alumni.\u201d\nNOTE: Free yellow jacket nest removal.
