And although her uncle is an alumnus who spoke highly of the Institute, she didn\u2019t see herself attending Tech initially. Now she\u2019s graduating with a bachelor\u2019s degree in industrial and systems engineering.\n\u201cI think I was overlooking it just because it\u2019s close to home,\u201d O\u2019Neal said. \u201cBut when I visited, I thought, \u2018This campus is awesome.\u2019 The students I met were cool and doing really great things. Then I realized I could see myself wanting to be like that one day.\u201d\nHer uncle, Vernon O\u2019Neal, graduated in 1979 with a degree in economics. Over the years he has been active on the advisory boards of the School of Economics and the Ivan Allen College of Liberal Arts. Margaret took a different path.\n\u201cI chose industrial engineering because it\u2019s very versatile and you can go into any direction career wise. It teaches you how to think critically and logically and how to solve problems,\u201d said O\u2019Neal, whose concentration is economics and financial systems. She studied supply chains and logistics and finds it interesting that supply chains are now a popular topic of conversation.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think people really thought about supply chains until the store shelves were empty or they couldn\u2019t get their package at their door in two days,\u201d she said. \u201cBut after they were inconvenienced, they became curious about the factors that go into product delivery. I think it will boost awareness of the field.\u201d\nThe day before graduation, O\u2019Neal is commissioning into the Army as a second lieutenant in the first brigade combat team in the 82nd Airborne Division at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. \u201cMy job is supply chain/logistics oriented, so I\u2019ll be using my major. And I\u2019ll get to jump out of airplanes.\u201d\nWhat she will miss most about Georgia Tech includes football games, proximity to friends, and her sorority, Alpha Delta Pi, where she was on the executive board for a year.\n\u201cI joined the sorority in my first year and it was nice to be immediately surrounded by a bunch of girls who were like-minded and wanted to do well at Georgia Tech,\u201d she said.\nHer advice to current students is, \u201cDo not compare yourself to others. Do the best you can. And find out how to do what you love every day.\u201d\nJoining her to celebrate Commencement will be her parents, grandmother, two older brothers, and her sister-in-law.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nVictor Rogers\nInstitute Communications\nEmail\nvictor.rogers@comm.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
