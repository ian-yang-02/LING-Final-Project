Pyle\nOct 03, 2017\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nThe 2017 Nobel Prize in Physics has been awarded to Rainer Weiss, Kip Thorne and Barry Barish \u00a0\u201c for decisive contributions to the LIGO detector and the observation of gravitational waves .\u201d Weiss proposed the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) as a means to detect gravitational waves. Thorne supplied the astrophysical theory that ultimately led to their confirmation in September of 2015.\nGravitational waves were detected by the LIGO Scientific Collaboration (LSC), which was founded by Barish. The LSC is a group of more than 1,000 scientists around the world that includes 17 Georgia Tech faculty, postdoctoral researchers and students.\nGravitational waves are ripples in the fabric of space-time caused by cataclysmic events in the universe. Their existence was a major prediction of Albert Einstein\u2019s 1915 general theory of relativity. Because gravitational waves carry information about their dramatic origins that cannot otherwise be obtained, their detection opened an unprecedented new window onto the cosmos.\nSince 2015, LIGO has announced four gravitational wave detections,\nincluding one last week . Each was caused by violent collisions of binary black holes.\nBelow are reactions from Georgia Tech, including\nSchool of Physics Professor Laura Cadonati, who serves as deputy spokesperson for the LSC.\n\u201cThis year\u2019s Nobel award honors three scientists whose vision and dedication have made it possible to discover gravitational waves, explore answers to questions in fundamental physics and unlock a new window on the universe,\u201d Cadonati says. \u201cI am grateful for the opportunity to work with them in the realization of this vision, together with the hundreds of colleagues in the LIGO Scientific Collaboration. Today\u2019s prize is also a celebration of collaboration and collegiality in science; we all feel honored.\u201d \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Deirdre Shoemaker\nLSC member and director of Georgia Tech\u2019s\nCenter for Relativistic Astrophysics\n\u201cThe Nobel Committee honored three people who made astronomy with gravitational waves possible,\u201d Shoemaker says. \u201cThey laid down the theoretical foundations of gravitational-wave sources and paved the way in the design of the instruments to detect these sources. They also motivated generations of scientists to answer the call to gravitational-wave astronomy and provided the political courage to undertake the task. It is a great privilege to join in honoring their work and that of all of my colleagues in gravitational-wave physics.\u201d\nPablo Laguna\nLSC member and chair of the\nSchool of Physics\n\u201cThis year\u2019s Physics Nobel Prize recognizes three scientists that led in establishing the foundations for the monumental achievement of building an instrument (LIGO) to learn about the cosmos from observations of changes in the fabric of space-time (gravitational waves).\"\nPaul M. Goldbart\nDean of the\nCollege of Sciences , Betsy Middleton and John Clark Sutherland Chair and professor in the School of Physics\n\u201cIt is a joy to add my acknowledgement of these pioneers of gravitational radiation. Their tenacity has paved the way for our colleagues to participate in this extraordinary scientific adventure that heralds the dawn of a new era in astronomy.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nGravitational Waves Observed for First Time\nLaura Cadonati Named LIGO Deputy Spokesperson\nContact\nJason Maderer\nNational Media Relations\nmaderer@gatech.edu\n404-660-2926\nEmail\nmaderer@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
