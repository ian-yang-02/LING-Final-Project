The findings are part of a new Georgia Tech cybersecurity study that examines the current state of password policies across the internet.\nUsing a first-of-its-kind automated tool that can assess a website\u2019s password creation policies, researchers also discovered that 12% of websites completely lacked password length requirements.\nAssistant Professor\u00a0 Frank Li \u00a0and Ph.D. student\u00a0 Suood Al Roomi \u00a0in Georgia Tech\u2019s\u00a0 School of Cybersecurity and Privacy \u00a0created the automated assessment tool to explore all sites in the\u00a0 Google Chrome User Experience Report \u00a0(CrUX), a database of one million websites and pages.\nLi and Al Roomi's method of inferring password policies succeeded on over\u00a020,000 sites in the database and showed that many sites:\nPermit very short passwords\nDo not block common passwords\nUse outdated requirements like complex characters\nThe researchers also discovered that only a few sites fully follow standard guidelines, while most stick to outdated guidelines from 2004. The project was 135 times larger than previous works that relied on manual methods and smaller sample sizes.\nMore than half of the websites in the study accepted passwords with six characters or less, with 75% failing to require the recommended eight-character minimum. Around 12% of had no length requirements, and 30% did not support spaces or special characters.\nOnly 28% of the websites studied enforced a password block list, which means thousands of sites are vulnerable to cyber criminals who might try to use common passwords to break into a user\u2019s account, also known as a password spraying attack.\n\u201cBoth Professor Li and I were excited to take on the challenge,\u201d said Al Roomi. \u201cWith his guidance and our continuous work on both algorithm design and the measurement technique, we were able to fully develop an automated measurement of password creation policy and apply it at scale.\u201d\nAl Roomi and Li designed an algorithm that automatically determines a website\u2019s password policy. With the help of machine learning, the pair could see the consistency of length requirements and restrictions for numbers, upper- and lower-case letters, special symbols, combinations, and starting letters. They could also see if sites permitted dictionary words or known breached passwords.\n\u201cAs a security community, we've identified and developed various solutions and best practices for improving internet and web security,\u201d said Li. \u201cIt's crucial that we investigate whether those solutions or guidelines are actually adopted in practice to understand whether security is improving in reality.\u201d\nThe project began during the height of the pandemic when Al Roomi found a gap in the research literature surrounding website password policies. Through his reading, he discovered that a consensus of his peers did not think a large-scale survey of password policies was possible due to the variety of web design.\n\u201cIt was exciting to see an identified challenge in the literature and to develop and apply a vision we turned into the measurement tool,\u201d said Al Roomi. \u201cThis research was my first in my Ph.D. program at Georgia Tech and SCP. It is one of the most challenging yet rewarding endeavors I've worked on.\u201d\nThe full report will be presented at the\u00a0 ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS) \u00a0in Copenhagen, Denmark, later this month.\u00a0 A Large-Scale Measurement of Website Login Policies \u00a0was also accepted to the 32nd USENIX Security Symposium earlier this year.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nJP Popham\nCommunications Officer\nSchool of Cybersecurity and Privacy\njohn.popham@cc.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
