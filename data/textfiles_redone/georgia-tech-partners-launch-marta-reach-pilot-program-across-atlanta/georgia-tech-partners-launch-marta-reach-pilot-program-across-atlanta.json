This pilot is meant to test how on-demand shuttles can be used to make it easier and faster for riders to get to and from their destinations using MARTA.\nFeb 28, 2022\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nGreat solutions often start with a simple idea.\nFor Georgia Tech industrial engineering professor\nPascal Van Hentenryck , it started four years ago: an idea to tackle one of the biggest challenges for America\u2019s eight largest rapid transit systems.\n\u201cOne of the big issues is connecting to and from the system. First and last mile,\u201d Van Hentenryck said.\nSo, during the pandemic, Van Hentenryck decided to contact MARTA officials directly, and, with his team of student researchers at Georgia Tech,\nhe developed a system to make MARTA more efficient\nand able to better serve communities that have a vital need for reliable transit.\nThat\u2019s how MARTA Reach was born.\n\u201cWe were contacted by Pascal in late 2020 about the possibility of an on-demand network,\u201d said MARTA Interim General Manager and CEO\u00a0Collie\u00a0Greenwood.\nVan Hentenryck describes MARTA Reach as an on-demand multimodal transportation solution \u2014 smartphones and shuttles outfitted with tablets connected to an app that helps riders find a quick route to their nearest MARTA station. Think ridesharing platforms like Lyft or Uber \u2014 except this ride is a flat, low-cost fee. MARTA says this program is meant to work with the city of Atlanta\u2019s existing transportation services and will help minimize waiting and walking, eliminating the inconvenience of users having to walk a mile or more to their nearest MARTA station.\n\u201cPublic transit is the most cost-effective way to move people,\u201d said Van Hentenryck ,\nA. Russell Chandler III Chair and Professor in\u00a0the\nH. Milton Stewart School of Industrial and Systems Engineering .\n\u201cBut in Atlanta, some people may face challenges getting to the MARTA station.\u201d Thanks to this new pilot program, they can download the smartphone app and request a ride.\nOn March 1, MARTA and Georgia Tech will begin pilot testing this program in three strategic neighborhoods: West Atlanta, Belvedere Park, and Fort Gillem. Van Hentenryck says there\u2019s never been a piloted on-demand public transit system like this in a major U.S. metropolitan area like Atlanta.\nThe chosen neighborhoods were selected not only because they are lacking in transportation options but because of the different communities they serve. Fort Gillem is an area with a high number of distribution centers with employees who could use more efficient transportation. West Atlanta is highly residential, with roads often too narrow for MARTA\u2019s full-sized buses. And Belvedere Park is a mixed-use neighborhood that combines business and residential zoning.\nDuring the pilot test, folks in these areas can use the MARTA Reach app to call for a shuttle to pick them up and take them to the nearest MARTA transportation hub.\nWhen users call for a pickup, their requests will be routed through a server at Georgia Tech that connects to the drivers on MARTA\u2019s new fleet of Reach vehicles.\n\u201cWe developed the cloud computing platform, connected riders and drivers, and we\u2019re making sure the whole system is synchronized,\u201d said Van Hentenryck.\n\u201cWe couldn\u2019t be happier they are willing to study our ridership to see what the needs are and tailor a solution,\u201d said Greenwood.\nFor the Georgia Tech researchers, it\u2019s a perfect partnership as well.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been thinking about transportation for years. It connects people to everything from jobs and education to groceries,\u201d explained Van Hentenryck. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing that a large agency like MARTA would allow us to come in and test this.\u201d\nThe pilot has been funded by a grant from the National Science Foundation, and from March until August, the service will be available from 6 a.m. to 7 p.m. every weekday.\n\u201cGeorgia Tech\u2019s mission calls us to develop leaders who advance technology and improve the human condition.\u00a0To\u00a0use our research and\u00a0expertise\u00a0to\u00a0improve lives\u00a0and\u00a0livelihoods.\u00a0That\u2019s why we\u2019re here,\" said Georgia Tech president \u00c1ngel Cabrera.\u00a0 \"We\u2019re grateful for\u00a0the opportunity, for the support of MARTA and the National Science Foundation, and for the great work\u00a0by Professor Van\u00a0Hentenryck\u2019s\u00a0team.\"\nMARTA officials will be looking to see how many users take advantage of this new first-and-last-mile option. Georgia Tech\u2019s researchers will be watching closely, too, analyzing data including how long it takes to fulfill riders\u2019 requests.\nMARTA officials say if the data shows positive impacts, the pilot could expand to other parts of the city. Georgia Tech researchers say this on-demand project could also serve as a model for more major metropolitan areas to follow.\n\u201cWe can take on projects that are not just technologically cool and exciting, but at the same time they also have a big impact on society,\u201d \u00a0\u00a0said Van Hentenryck.\nLearn more about the MARTA Reach program and download the app here.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nSteven Norris\nDirector, Media Relations & Social Media\nEmail\nsnorris@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
