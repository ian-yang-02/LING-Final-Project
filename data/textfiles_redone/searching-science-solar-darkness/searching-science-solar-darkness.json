When the moon blocks the sun\u2019s rays, a window opens for scientists to study the heavens in ways they usually can\u2019t.\nIn the 21st century, science is no longer limited by the rarity of total eclipses. These events can now be simulated in computers. The instruments of the orbiting\nSolar Dynamics Observatory\nand the\nSolar and Heliospheric Observatory\nare constantly trained on our life-giving star.\nWith all this technology, can eclipses still serve as old-school windows into scientific discoveries? They can, says\nMorris Cohen , assistant professor in the\nSchool of Electrical and Computer Engineering\nand a member of the\nCenter for Space Technology and Research (C-STAR ).\nEclipses allow experiments to take place in natural daylight and darkness at the same time. Simultaneous light and dark is what Cohen needs to study how the sun affects radio waves in Earth\u2019s ionosphere. \u201cWe are using the unique properties of the eclipse to get a window into the physics of the upper atmosphere,\u201d he says.\nIn the weeks leading to the Aug. 21, 2017, total solar eclipse, Cohen\u2019s team will deploy 30 receivers on either side of the path of totality. As the eclipse occurs, a patch of nighttime (shadow) surrounded by daytime will move cross-country.\n\u201cBecause the sun dominates the electrical properties of the upper atmosphere, this moving patch affects radio communications,\u201d Cohen says. The ionosphere is tough to study because it\u2019s too high for balloons and too low for satellites. A better understanding of\u00a0this part of the atmosphere can improve satellite-based navigation and airline communications, which depend on radio waves in this region.\nTo monitor the sun\u2019s impact on the upper atmosphere, Cohen\u2019s team will look at radio waves in this frequency band and examine how they are affected by the rapid shifts between light and dark that an eclipse enables. \u201cWe\u2019ve never had a controlled experiment where we can shut off the sun so rapidly in a defined area,\u201d Cohen says.\nCohen is part of a long tradition \u2013 since 1223 B.C., the\nfirst record of a solar eclipse\n\u2013 of scientists and historians using the rare phenomenon to record observations, test theories, and conduct experiments. Earlier eclipses helped establish the existence of the solar corona, prominences (those loops of gas that shoot from the sun\u2019s surface), and the element helium.\nWild west eclipse\nStill reeling from the Civil War, America decided in 1878 to use a solar eclipse to establish its scientific credibility to the rest of the world.\n\u201cI was fascinated by how this country pulled together and intentionally wanted to prove that we weren\u2019t just this backward country that was strong economically and good at industrial production, but frankly wasn\u2019t that intellectual,\u201d says\nDavid Baron , science journalist and author of \u201c American Eclipse .\u201d\nThe book is about the July 29, 1878 event and how it galvanized the country\u2019s scientific community. \u201cThis eclipse inspired this nation to come together,\u201d Baron says.\nScientists traveled by train to Wyoming and Colorado to investigate the 1878 total solar eclipse. They included a young Thomas Edison, eager to try\u00a0his new solar heat measurement device, a tasimeter; Maria Mitchell, one of the few women U.S. scientists at the time; and James Craig Watson, a noted astronomer and discoverer of asteroids.\nMitchell and Watson risked attacks from bandits and warring Indian tribes to search for Vulcan, a planet believed to exist between Mercury and the sun. They hoped to find it during the eclipse\u2019s totality. They didn\u2019t.\nEdison\u2019s tasimeter, meanwhile, \u201cwas a terrible flop,\u201d Baron says, although it could be viewed as the first step in the development of detectors used in infrared astronomy.\n\u201cFrom a scientific standpoint, the 1878 eclipse didn\u2019t amount to anything,\u201d he says. Yet from a cultural and intellectual perspective, it lit the way for future breakthroughs. \u201cIt made a huge difference,\u201d Baron says. \u201cIt rallied the country to get behind its scientists.\u201d\nEinstein was right\nIf the statue of Albert Einstein near Tech Green could talk, it would remind everyone that a total solar eclipse helped confirm the\ntheory of general relativity .\nEinstein\u2019s 1915 theory challenged\u00a0Isaac Newton\u2019s long-established theory of\u00a0gravity. According to Einstein, space and time form a fabric, which would bend and twist around the gravity of massive objects. The theory predicted that light passing near the warped fabric would curve rather than move in a straight line. The prediction was difficult to prove with early 20th-century technologies.\nBritish astronomers saw an opportunity in the May 29, 1919, total solar eclipse. On that day, the sun would pass in front of a large cluster of stars, the Hyades. The eclipse would temporarily extinguish the sun\u2019s overpowering brightness, making visible any Hyades starlight skewed by the sun\u2019s gravity.\nAstronomers noted the stars\u2019 positions in the months before the eclipse. During the solar eclipse on May 29, 1919, they photographed the same stars\u2019 positions.\nThe photographs showed the stars in slightly different places, proving Einstein\u2019s theory of general relativity. For this reason, the European Space Agency calls the 1919 event\n\u201cprobably the most important eclipse in the history of science.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nHow to Watch the Solar Eclipse at Georgia Tech\nContact\nRenay San Miguel\nCommunications Officer/Science Writer\nCollege of Sciences\n404-894-5209\nEmail\nrenay.san@cos.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
