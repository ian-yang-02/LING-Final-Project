Georgia Tech has left its mark in many movies, documentaries, TV series, and still photography. With the help of the newly developed Film Logistics Committee, there is a greater focus on capturing the beauty and history of the campus in film. The Division of\nStudent Engagement and Well-Being \u2019s Auxiliary Services is proud of its partnership with several representatives to support film projects on campus.\nThe Film Logistics Committee includes members from Institute Communications, Facilities, Fire Safety, Georgia Tech Police Department, Risk Management, Parking & Transportation Services, Legal, Georgia Tech Athletic Association, and the Student & Campus Events Centers. When filming and photography occur, the Committee works to ensure that the structural integrity of the campus is protected, the Institute\u2019s brand is well-represented, and appropriate logistical support and security is provided. The Committee is also responsible for pre-planning each project, including reviewing license agreements, reserving campus spaces, aligning with the campus calendar, and ensuring all fire safety measures are in place.\nThe Committee is led by Julie Birchfield, Georgia Tech\u2019s recently appointed assistant director for Film Logistics and Business Development in Auxiliary Services. Julie is no stranger to the task, having worked in commercial film management, developing a diverse portfolio of commercials, TV shows, and major motion pictures.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an exciting time to work with film and live in Atlanta,\u201d said Julie. \u201cThere are so many productions in and around the Atlanta area, and since we have such a beautiful campus, with gorgeous architecture and landscaping, it\u2019s not surprising that the interest from the film community has already been overwhelming.\u201d\n\u201cIt takes a village to pull off these big projects and the film logistics committee has been great to work with.\u00a0The team makes it look easy when it\u2019s not entirely easy\u2026but isn\u2019t that part of the movie magic?\u201d\nJulie Birchfield manages all aspects of film production on Georgia Tech\u2019s campus from logistical planning to campus communication. Since September 2022, she has managed 12 commercial film/photography projects and six internal projects. So, the next time you walk around and see a camera crew on campus, you will know that Julie and her team are behind the effort!\nUnder Julie\u2019s leadership, the Film Logistics Committee is committed to opening doors for Georgia Tech to thrive in film and for Georgia Tech to continue its mission to\namplify impact\nbeyond our campus.
