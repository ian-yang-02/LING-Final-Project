Graduates and their families and friends will gather in Bobby Dodd Stadium. They\u2019ll be wearing face coverings and minding their distance.\nBut some things will remain untouched by the pandemic \u2014 the joy, the tears, the collective pat on the back for this singular accomplishment, and the traditions, including a select group of graduates who, each semester, are tasked with putting years of memories, observations, and feelings into words that will inspire their classmates and everyone in the seats. This semester\u2019s student reflection speakers are more than up to the challenge. They\u2019re preparing to knock it out of the proverbial park.\nIsabella Sanders\nis receiving a Ph.D. in industrial engineering (as well as an MBA from Scheller College), and she has already begun teaching in the Department of Systems Engineering at the U.S. Military Academy in West Point, New York.\nHer motivation for serving as a reflection speaker had a lot to do with recognizing the support network behind every graduate, especially at the Ph.D. level. \u201cI think a lot of ceremonies focus on the people who are graduating, but there isn\u2019t enough focus on the people who support the graduates,\u201d she said. \u201cSo my speech is about thanking those people. It isn\u2019t a trip that you take by yourself, and I feel like it's good to thank everyone who got you to where you are.\u201d\nFor Sanders, a New York native who did her undergraduate work at MIT, these are not her first Tech graduate degrees. She also holds a master\u2019s in operations research and another in geographic information science and technology. In her remarks, she\u2019s not planning to spend too much time on the upheavals of the past 14 months. \u201cMost people who have supported our Ph.D. journeys have been in our lives long before the coronavirus hit, so my reflections were not largely affected by the pandemic.\u201d\nThe reflection speaker at Friday\u2019s master\u2019s ceremony will be computer science graduate\nSheryl Ratnam\nfrom Santa Clara, California. She, like Sanders, finished her degree in December but is returning to campus for this special day. Two months ago, she began working as a software development engineer at Amazon.\n\u201cI really wanted to take this as an opportunity to celebrate a remarkable group of people who have inspired me in more ways than one,\u201d Ratnam said. \u201cI\u2019m grateful to have met lifelong friends at Georgia Tech, and am honored to have learned alongside the best and brightest.\u201d She\u00a0 thinks of her reflection speech as a thank you and a gesture of appreciation \u201cfor Georgia Tech, and the Class of 2020, both of which have paved the path toward my future . \u201d\nFor Ratnam, how \u2014 and how much \u2014 she will talk about the pandemic is a balancing act. Not mentioning it at all would be to ignore \u201ca monumental historical event that has no doubt shaped our academic and personal journeys.\u201d She instead will focus on the ways that Covid-19 has brought into sharp relief, for many people, an awareness of \u201call that we can accomplish despite the obstacles that may stand in our way.\u201d\nSaturday, May 8, will feature two bachelor\u2019s ceremonies, one in the morning and one in the afternoon. Morning speaker\nSidartha Rakuram\nis a computer science graduate from Petaling Jaya, Malaysia. The first time he set foot in the U.S., in 2017, he was on his way to Atlanta for FASET. Now, he is \u201cexcited at the opportunity to reflect on all the memories we have made over the past few years. Commencement is also such a joyous celebration, and I am so honored.\u201d\nRakuram\u2019s emphasis will be on gratitude. He plans to \u201creflect on the love and kindness we experienced that has helped all of us through our time at Tech \u2014 whether it was family, friends, or the faculty and staff here \u2014 and I will be thanking them all in the address.\u201d\nLater this month, he will return to Malaysia to begin working at Astro, a leading entertainment and content provider. While he looks forward to being back home with his family, he knows this goodbye is going to be tough. Still, he has \u201ctold all my friends that they have an open invitation to visit.\u201d\nAbigail Burke \u2019s journey to Tech was considerably shorter, originating in nearby Peachtree City. The economics and international affairs major will be delivering the reflection speech at the final Commencement ceremony of Spring 2021. She was motivated to apply, in part, because all four of her grandparents will be sitting in the audience.\nFor Burke, the pandemic \u201cwas at the forefront of my mind as I was brainstorming what to talk about. It's been a difficult time for everyone, and graduating this year is an immense accomplishment for the Class of 2021,\u201d she said. \u201cWith most of my extraneous activities gone, I had the chance to focus on my close friendships and get involved at Georgia Tech in ways I didn't expect.\u201d That included working as the assistant manager for the McCamish Pavilion voting precinct in November, and as an intern for a voter education startup. These experiences helped shape the reflection speech she ended up writing.\nAfter graduation she will take some time for herself \u2014 by working on a ranch in Colorado \u2014 before heading to the University of Oxford to pursue a master\u2019s degree in social science of the internet.\nBut not until she\u2019s had her moment on the stage, reflecting on \u201cwhat has ultimately made my time at Georgia Tech meaningful.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nCommencement Information\nContact\nStacy Braukman\nInstitute Communications\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
