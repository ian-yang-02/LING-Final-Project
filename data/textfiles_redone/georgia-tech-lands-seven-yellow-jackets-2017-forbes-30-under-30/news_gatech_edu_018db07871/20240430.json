With an idea to use an insect-based food source to close the loophole in agriculture, Warner launched Grubbly Farms. The company has developed a protein-rich food source for aquaculture, livestock animals and pets by collecting food waste from different organizations and feeding it to black soldier fly larvae. As the larvae eat through the food waste, they convert it into a quality fertilizer. Grubbly Farms then processes the larvae into proteins and fats that are manufactured into animal feeds.\nGrubbly Farms \u2013 named one of the top 50 disruptive startups by Kairos Society \u2013 won the 2016 Sustainable Brands Innovation Open and has been featured in\nThe Guardian.\nhttp://www.forbes.com/profile/grubbly-farms/\nPatrick Pittaluga\n\u2013 the business brains behind Grubbly Farms \u2013 drives the company\u2019s marketing, business development and sales. He teamed up with his cousin, Sean Warner,\nto launch the company after testing with black solider fly larvae in a laundry room.\n\u201cThe flies have a nutritional profile similar to fish meal,\u201d Pittaluga told\nForbes\nmagazine.\nGrubbly Farms has been developing a commercial facility capable of turning five tons of food waste into 500 pounds of protein a day, and looking to expand that output. As a business administration student at Georgia Tech, Pittaluga founded two companies, Predator PC (a custom computer supplier) and Harbor Point (a luxury apparel company).\nhttp://www.forbes.com/profile/grubbly-farms/\nMichael Roytman\nearned his master\u2019s in operations research at Georgia Tech. In 2015 he co-founded Dharma Platform, a company that uses its SaaS platform to collect everything from logistics to food security data for users in the field without requiring Wi-Fi or cell service. A drag-and-drop interface, makes creating data collection and analysis easy for users with varying skill levels as well. Dharma has partnered with the World Health Organization and Doctors Without Borders and has received $1.6 million in funding.\nhttp://www.forbes.com/profile/michael-roytman/\nAs an undergraduate at Tianjin University,\nLu Zhang\ntook part in Georgia Tech\u2019s Atlanta Summer Program, a summer exchange experience that allows students to sample a variety of course offerings and get a glimpse of American history and culture. One of Zhang\u2019s most memorable experiences during her summer exchange was the World of Coca-Cola just a few steps from Georgia Tech\u2019s campus.
