The pilot has received bipartisan support from Congress and the White House, and is driven by the National Cancer Institute\u2019s Small Business Innovation Research Development Center, with oversight by Director Michael Weingarten and Andrew Kurtz, the center\u2019s program director and team leader. I-Corps @NIH is a unit of the National Science Foundation Innovation Corps (I-Corps), a boot camp of sorts that trains scientists in the same lean startup methods that other industries use to get products from the research phase to market. I-Corps has so far trained 400 teams of scientists from the NSF, DOE, and ARPA-E. Keith McGreggor, director of VentureLab at Georgia Tech\u2019s Enterprise Innovation Institute (EI2), was picked to be one of the professors in I-Corps @NIH. McGreggor, a successful entrepreneur who has co-founded or founded six software companies, was a perfect choice to be one of the program teachers, said startup expert Steve Blank, architect of the I-Corps @NIH curriculum and one of the program\u2019s lead instructors. The I-Corps curriculum is modeled after the Lean LaunchPad class Blank developed at Stanford University. \u201cKeith is probably the best model of someone who gets technology and shares the passion of how we do commercialization,\u201d Blank said. Indeed, VentureLab\u2019s sole mission is to help Georgia Tech researchers, faculty, staff and students build and create startup companies based on their research. And Tech was one of the original universities selected by the National Science Foundation in 2012 as a founding network node for the I-Corps program, which trains scientific researchers on how product opportunities can spin out of their academic findings. With this new pilot course at NIH, which launched Oct. 6 and runs through December in Bethesda, Maryland, the goal is to do the same in the life sciences sector as in other science-related research disciplines. A total of 21 teams are participating in this pilot, which specifically targets life science startups in therapeutics, diagnostics and medical devices. \u201cThere is a big difference between making the science ready and whether or not you have a good business,\u201d Blank said. This makes Tech a critical component, because it has an established record of programs that successfully spin out companies from research. \u201cThis is the language of how to build a company,\u201d he said. \u201cGeorgia Tech\u2019s contribution in training and commercialization of the life sciences is enormous.\u201d The key goals of the course are to have the scientists learn how to:\n\u2022 Assess intellectual property rights needs and regulatory risk before the design and build phase. \u2022 Define clinical utility before spending huge sums of capital.\n\u2022 Understand who their primary and tertiary customers are and the sales and marketing requirements needed for eventual commercialization.\n\u2022 Identify different financing vehicles before they are needed. One change under the NIH adoption of I-Corps, McGreggor said, is that teams can apply for direct NSF-funding if they complete I-Corps training through one of the NSF nodes \u2013 Tech\u2019s included \u2014 that provide training in Georgia and across the Southeast. \u201cIf a team goes through our regional training \u2014 even if that team has never had any NSF backing \u2014 because they\u2019ve gone through our regional training, they can use our node-NSF to let them apply for the NSF I-Corps program itself,\u201d McGreggor said. \u201cIt\u2019s actually a big deal because it lets students from Auburn, for example, go through a regional training, or a team from a school that doesn\u2019t have a lot of NSF funding go through a regional training and then be able to apply for funding.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nGT VentureLab\nI-Corps@NIH\nContact\nPeralte Paul -\nperalte.paul@comm.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
