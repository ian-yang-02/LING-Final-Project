She is the first student to ever graduate with a Ph.D.\u00a0in\u00a0ocean\u00a0sciences and\u00a0engineering\u00a0from Georgia Tech. This program was\u00a0established in\u00a02014\u00a0as\u00a0an interdisciplinary study\u00a0integrating biology,\u00a0civil\u00a0engineering, and\u00a0earth\u00a0and\u00a0atmospheric\u00a0sciences.\u00a0Monteagudo was approached due to her\u00a0interest in\u00a0climate change and how it affects the ocean.\n\u201cIt is a home\u00a0that brings together people who work on ocean science,\u201d Monteagudo said.\u00a0There are\u00a0many\u00a0events\u00a0with students in the program that\u00a0have made\u00a0it feel like a home\u00a0for Monteagudo\u00a0on campus that extends\u00a0beyond\u00a0the\u00a0classroom.\u00a0She has found\u00a0close friends\u00a0during her time in the program while receiving\u00a0support from her faculty mentors.\n\u201cTech was defined by the people in my department,\u201d\u00a0she\u00a0said.\u00a0That is why she is\u00a0excited to see what\u00a0future cohorts will accomplish. Next year will be the first full group of students graduating, and many are already\u00a0writing their\u00a0dissertations.\u00a0Monteagudo recently finished hers\u00a0on\u00a0fossil shells in ocean sediment. She used chemistry\u00a0to reconstruct ocean temperatures from the geological past.\u00a0These findings can be used to bolster\u00a0current\u00a0models of future temperature changes\u00a0by seeing if they match\u00a0past records.\u00a0During Monteagudo\u2019s time\u00a0at Tech, she\u00a0was\u00a0a teaching assistant for\u00a0EAS 2600,\u00a0which enabled her\u00a0to\u00a0use her love\u00a0of\u00a0teaching while interacting with undergraduate students.\n\u201cStudents saw connections from\u00a0earth and atmospheric sciences\u00a0to their own majors, so I was able to learn many things from\u00a0their\u00a0personal experiences,\u201d Monteagudo said.\u00a0She was\u00a0also\u00a0asked to join a task force for racial equality with\u00a012\u00a0other students. This was a rare\u00a0opportunity that she did not take lightly.\u00a0Over her short few years at Tech,\u00a0Minda\u00a0Monteagudo has\u00a0blazed many trails and helped shape a better future for all students.\u00a0Currently, she\u00a0is\u00a0seeking jobs and will likely\u00a0start\u00a0working in the coming months.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nConnor White\nInstitute Communications\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
