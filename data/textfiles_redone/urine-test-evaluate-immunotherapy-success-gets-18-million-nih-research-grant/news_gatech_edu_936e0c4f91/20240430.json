But more often, cancer evades them, and doctors need to know quickly when that happens, so they can adjust treatment. An experimental urine test to detect immunotherapy effectiveness very early has received a major funding boost.\nThe National Institutes of Health has granted $1.8 million to a research project at the Georgia Institute of Technology, where\nthe lab of Gabe Kwong\nhas already established a platform to detect complex disease and immune activity. Kwong will use the new funding from the NIH\u2019s National Cancer Institute to advance the platform to evaluate immunotherapy progress.\nThe platform uses an intravenous injection of \u201cactivity sensors,\u201d nanoparticles that detect early enzyme activity of immune cells attacking cancer. The sensor confirms the attack with a fluorescent signal in the urine.\nShifty resistance\nCancer\u2019s defenses are crafty and can thwart treatment from the start or disrupt initially successful treatment later on, so progress must be continually monitored, which Kwong\u2019s lab is engineering the particle to do. Early resistance to therapy looks very different from later resistance.\n\u201cWe need to be able to classify different forms of resistance, so we can combat them better,\u201d said Kwong, an\u00a0 assistant professor in the Wallace H. Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering at Georgia Tech and Emory University .\nHe plans to adapt the sensing technology to profile those subtleties. It is already engineered to have advantages over other tests that have recently entered the market, which look for signals that come later, such as dead cancer cells shedding their DNA into the bloodstream.\n\u201cThese tests can be quite effective, but some issues limit them, particularly in early detection: You have five liters of blood. Whatever the cells shed gets diluted significantly in your bloodstream,\u201d Kwong said.\nThat makes these signals harder to detect in blood tests.\nEnriched signals\n\u201cOur sensors\u2019 signals get concentrated in the urine, so, not only are they not diluted in the blood, but we usually see a hundred- to thousandfold signal enrichment.\u201d\nKwong\u2019s lab has already developed the sensors, which are biocompatible nanoparticles, refined them as a reliable platform, and engineered variations that experimentally sense blood clots, liver fibrosis,\norgan transplant rejection , and cancer. Kwong has\npublished multiple papers\non activity sensor urine test successes.\nKwong\u2019s endgame ambitions: \u201cIn five to ten years, we want to expand the platform to detect most all major complex diseases and progress in treating them.\u201d\nQ & A\nWhat is the activity sensor and how does the urine test work?\nThe sensors are nanoscale balls with bristles made of short amino acid strands that have fluorescent \u201creporter\u201d molecules attached to their tips. The sensors tend to accumulate in compromised tissue like cancer.\nWhen immunotherapy -- which can be engineered T cells or the body\u2019s own T cells aided by medication -- attack cancer cells, the T cells secrete an enzyme called granzyme that severs\ntarget amino acid strands\nin the cancer cells, triggering their death. The activity sensor\u2019s bristles mimic those strands, so granzymes cut the bristles at the same time.\n\u201cThat releases the reporter molecules, which are so small that they easily make it through the kidney\u2019s filtration and go into the urine,\u201d said Kwong who directs the Laboratory for Synthetic Immunity in the Coulter Department.\nThen the urine turns a fluorescent color that can be analyzed to determine the intensity of the immunotherapy\u2019s attack on cancer.\n[Thinking about grad school?\u00a0 Here's how to apply to Georgia Tech. ]\nIs there a need for this kind of test?\n\u201cMany patients, especially those with solid tumors, are not responding to this treatment,\u201d Kwong said. \u201cThe non-responders need to be detected very quickly.\u201d\nThere are also diagnostic pitfalls the experimental sensor is devised to overcome: For example, a current measure of treatment success is tumor shrinkage, but when T cells initially cram into a tumor, it can swell. That sometimes leads doctors to believe that a therapy that is actually very effective is not working, and they may discontinue it.\n\u201cThis test does not measure size; it measures activity,\u201d Kwong. \u201cIf those swelling tumors are very high in granzyme activity, that\u2019s a great sign, and we will be able to pick that up.\u201d\nHow is the dream of detecting most known complex diseases even feasible?\nQuite conveniently, the human genome produces \u201conly\u201d 550 proteases, a particular type of enzyme relevant to detecting and combating disease. Kwong believes researchers can adapt this platform to detect any of them and that there\u2019s a need for that.\n\u201cGranzymes are also activated by other things like an infection, so detecting granzyme alone risks getting interference when you\u2019re looking at cancer treatment effectiveness. We\u2019re developing a panel of sensors that gives us the specificity of T cell activity in tumors over the possible activity of T cells fighting, say, a cold,\u201d Kwong said.\n\u201cWe want to build 550 different protease-detecting probes, and depending on what disease you have, they would expose a profile of the proteases in varying ratios.\u201d\nThe probes could be combined into a cocktail to detect budding cancer, immunotherapy effectiveness or infections, and machine learning would analyze their respective fingerprints in the urine signals.\nAlso READ:\nMending a Broken Heart - 6 cardiac solutions currently in testing\nThe grant was provided by the National Cancer Institute at the National Institutes of Health.
