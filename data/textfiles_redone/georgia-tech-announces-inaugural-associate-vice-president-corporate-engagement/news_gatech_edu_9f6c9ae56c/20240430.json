Mark Nolan as associate vice president of corporate engagement, effective Jan. 1, 2022.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nEmail\nMark Nolan\nOct 18, 2021\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nThe Georgia Institute of Technology has named J. Mark Nolan as associate vice president of corporate engagement, effective Jan. 1, 2022.\nNolan is currently the associate vice president of business engagement and strategy at Carnegie Mellon University. His appointment follows a national search and is part of a larger Institute effort for more strategic and complementary initiatives between its corporate relations and industry collaboration units. Under this structure, Nolan will jointly report to the executive vice president for Research and the vice president for Development.\nAs associate vice president, Nolan will lead a newly created office that will serve as the nexus for the Institute\u2019s entire partner relationship and activity portfolios. The office is also tasked with facilitating\u00a0collaboration efforts across various partner units within Georgia Tech, including the Enterprise Innovation Institute, Technology Licensing, Economic Development, Institute Relations,\u00a0and Corporate Contracting, among others.\n\u201cUnder Mark\u2019s leadership, this new office will enhance our engagement with industry and corporate partners, showcasing the comprehensive breadth and scope of our capabilities and the various ways we connect with industry,\u201d said\u00a0Chaouki\u00a0T. Abdallah, executive vice president for Research at Georgia Tech. \u201cWe are thrilled for him to come on board as we begin to set a new standard for managing and maintaining our existing relationships while expanding upon new partnerships.\u201d\nNolan agrees that enhancing and further developing corporate connections helps drive successful outcomes for external partners as well as the Institute.\n\u201cI\u2019m honored to take on this new role as we look to strategically shape corporate engagement at Tech for maximum impact,\u201d he said. \u201cCorporate engagement is not only a pathway for greater research funding but an expansion of opportunities that could lead to greater technology transfer and licensing flow, more connections for professional education and development, and greater startup connectivity to major corporations.\u201d\nNolan added that shaping those engagements and leveraging them correctly will allow the Institute\u00a0to have a greater economic impact in metro Atlanta, and across Georgia, while creating greater opportunities for students, faculty, and staff.\nNolan comes to Georgia Tech with more than 20 years of higher education expertise in economic development and corporate relations engagement.\nAt Carnegie Mellon, Nolan nearly doubled the university\u2019s industry sponsored research spending between 2016 and 2020.\u00a0 During his tenure, the university\u2019s executive education revenue increased by nearly 190% and several of its corporate partners, including Facebook, Honeywell Robotics, and Philips, opened new facilities near the campus.\nPrior to Carnegie Mellon, Nolan spent nearly 15 years at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where he was appointed assistant director of economic development/private sector partners program at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications in 2001 and then\u00a0associate director of information technology and economic development in 2006 for the UIUC campus. He was named director in 2013. In those roles, he authored\u00a0the economic development and industry engagement portion of a National Science Foundation (NSF) proposal for the Blue Waters\u00a0Petascale\u00a0Supercomputer, bringing in a $208 million award.\nIn 2013, he co-founded\u00a0WayMark\u00a0Analytics, which helps organizations and communities in the U.S. and abroad identify opportunities for clients to overcome the challenges that often arise when diverse stakeholders with competing interests are brought together. Developed from and founded on NSF-funded research, Nolan was the company\u2019s chief operations officer until 2020.\n\u201cMark brings a balanced understanding of how universities can best serve their corporate partners and maximize those engagements,\u201d said Barrett H. Carson, vice president for Development at Georgia Tech. \u201cHis private sector experience and successful record of collaboration and expansion of corporate partnerships and relationships will give us a foundation for even more robust outcomes for our partners and the Institute. We are delighted to have him join us at Tech.\u201d\nWritten By: P\u00e9ralte Paul\nAdditional Images\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
