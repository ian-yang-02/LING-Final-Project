The first year, we featured a mix of global and local experts, but our audience was inherently limited to the Tech community. When we went virtual last year, we reached attendees from 20 different countries.\u201d\nFree and open to all, each day of the symposium will run from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. and focus on a specific aspect of the climate challenges ahead (see inset). Each session features a keynote speaker, a panel discussion, \u201cLightning Talks\u201d by students and organizations, and a Masterclass. Experts include engineers, scientists, business and policy leaders, students, and artists.\n\u201cWe have an amazing lineup of speakers, including five student speakers,\u201d Langner says. \u201cWe\u2019ve also just added a Lightning Talk from 9-year-old activist Faatiha Aayat, from Bangladesh, who has spoken about climate on the international stage.\u201d Other highlights include a smoothie tutorial from Concrete Jungle and the student art contest, which this year features submissions from Nigeria, the U.S., Switzerland, and South Africa.\n\u201cThere\u2019s never been a more important time to talk about climate solutions, and our faculty, students, and staff want to be a part of the conversation,\u201d says Kim Cobb, Georgia Power Chair and ADVANCE Professor in the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences and director of the Global Change Program. \u201cWe\u2019re thrilled to showcase some of the many partners that make Georgia Tech the research and education hub that it is.\u201d\nSymposium content will be made available to the general public on YouTube after the fact for those who aren\u2019t able to watch the proceedings in real time as they unfold, Langner says, but she strongly encourages preregistration at\u00a0 bit.ly/GCAS2021 .\n\u201cRegistering in advance makes it really easy for anyone who\u2019s interested,\u201d she notes. \u201cWe have additional resources our panelists will be sharing early, we can send all the links by email, and we can share all of the Q&A and chat transcripts \u2013 we\u2019ll even be sending out smoothie recipes.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nContact\nWriter:\nMargaret Tate\nEvent Contact:\nSelena Langner\nAdditional information\nGlobal Climate Action Symposium\nOnline, 9 a.m. \u2013 1\u00a0p.m.\nSept. 27 : Sustainable Food\nSept. 28 : Climate and Health\nSept. 29 : U.N.
