The question was how to transform their ideas into startups.\nThe answer is\nStartup Launch , a two-semester program to help teams of students form startups based on their ideas, inventions and prototypes. The program is part of\nCREATE-X , a Georgia Tech initiative to enhance and support entrepreneurship programs for undergraduate students\nThe 27 teams participating in this year\u2019s\nStartup Launch will demonstrate\ntheir products and services Wednesday starting at 4:30 p.m. at the Fox Theatre.\nCREATE-X has helped launch nearly 70 startups since 2014. Graduates have completed prestigious nationally recognized accelerators and incubators and have been recognized among the country\u2019s\ntop entrepreneurs under the age of 30 . These companies employ dozens of Georgians and hire Georgia Tech students as interns.\nHere\u2019s a look at four CREATE-X alumni.\nFIXD\nWhen John Gattuso arrived at Georgia Tech his post-graduation goal was to work for a car manufacturer in Detroit. Instead he co-founded\nFIXD , a startup that allows drivers to better understand and maintain their vehicles.\nFIXD was part of the 2014 inaugural class of Startup Summer, which later became Startup Launch. Today the company has 23 employees and has sold more than 200,000 units this year.\n\u201cIt has been a wild ride,\u201d said Gattuso, who graduated in 2015 with a degree in mechanical engineering. \u201cI think when I was a freshman, my wildest dream was to pass Calc II.\u201d\nThe company\u2019s other founders are Frederick Grimm, an industrial engineering major who graduated in 2014, and Julian Knight, who graduated in 2015 with a degree in electrical engineering.\nBesides CREATE-X, the company went through VentureLab, the Institute\u2019s technology commercialization incubator. FIXD is now part of Georgia Tech\u2019s Advanced Technology Development Center ( ATDC ), which is the state\u2019s technology incubator.\nThe company\u2019s distribution allows it to work with parts retailers and car dealerships to help drivers get needed parts and services.\nFIXD includes a sensor that is plugged into a car\u2019s diagnostic port. It relays problems to an app via Bluetooth. It provides a simple definition of what is wrong, explains the severity of the issue and warns of the consequences of driving without repairs. The device will also keep track of the vehicle\u2019s diagnostics and let owners know when their car is due for maintenance.\nGattuso said the company is still using the lessons it learned from CREATE-X. They are hoping to launch a new product and completing the customer discovery process.\nFireHUD\nZack Braun and Tyler Sisk weren\u2019t looking to launch a startup when they signed up for CREATE-X. The two friends just wanted to develop their idea to help keep firefighters safe.\nThey signed up for Idea 2 Prototype, which is part of CREATE-X. The for-credit class provides students with up to $1,500 and mentorship to transform their idea into a working prototype.\nThey developed\nFireHUD , a real-time wearable system and heads up display that provides biometric and environmental data to firefighters on the job and officials on site. The device measure heart rate, body temperature and external temperatures that can help predict fatigue and prevent injuries.\nThe class led them to 2016\u2019s Startup Summer. They\u2019ll graduate in December and are currently running the company out of Sisk\u2019s basement.\nBraun, a computer engineering major, and Sisk, an electrical engineering major, brought on board Chris Ward, who earned an MBA from Georgia Tech. They are finalizing a first production run of 30 units and will conduct pilot tests at four metro Atlanta fire departments.\nBefore launching the startup, Braun and Sisk entered the 2016\nInVenture Prize , Georgia Tech\u2019s annual innovation competition for undergraduate students.\nFireHUD won first place\nand $20,000.\nThat exposure has led other Georgia Tech students to ask them if it\u2019s worth signing up for CREATE-X over other classes, clubs or internships.\n\u201cWe tell them that it is because the chance to bring their ideas into the world and truly leave their mark is an incredible opportunity,\u201d Braun said. \u201cAnyone can do CREATE-X -- all they need is an idea.\u201d\nTEQ Charging\nDorrier Coleman and Isaac Wittenstein solved a main source of frustration for drivers of electric vehicles. Their startup,\nTEQ Charging , makes charging easier by allowing multiple drivers to plug their cars into a charging queue.\nThe company connects electric vehicle charging stations to the cloud at low cost. This allows for affordability and profitability for property owners and guarantees availability of charging stations for drivers. Seven hotels in Florida and Georgia are piloting the product.\nColeman, a computer engineering major who graduated in 2015, and Wittenstein, a mechanical engineering major who graduated in August, completed Startup Summer in 2015.\n\u201cCREATE-X introduced us to the world of startups and a new path that wasn\u2019t on our radar at Georgia Tech,\u201d Wittenstein said.\nThe company\u2019s name is short for The Electric Queue and pays tribute to Georgia Tech.\nToday the company is part of ATDC and has three full-time employees and three Georgia Tech interns.\nColeman and Wittenstein also completed the Techstars IoT (Internet of Things) Accelerator in New York City.\nWittenstein said there are a few lessons from CREATE-X the company still follows.\n\u201cNever be afraid to ask others for help,\u201d he said. \u201cAlways be open to advice and input from others, but know that you ultimately have to make the final decision. And continually listen to your customers and what their needs are.\u201d\nGimme Vending\nGimme Vending has come a long way since 2014\u2019s Startup Summer program.\nIn just three years, the company has become a funded startup with 10 employees. More than 10,000 vending machines use the company\u2019s products and thousands more are in the process of coming online, said Cory Hewett, CEO and one of the company\u2019s founders.\nGimme Vending \u00a0builds hardware and software mobility tools that allows companies to easily monitor the status of their cash and inventory in real-time. The company\u2019s technology replaces cumbersome handheld devices and allows for better unattended retail management.\nHewett, an electrical engineering major, left Georgia Tech in 2014 to focus on the company full-time. Evan Jarecki, the company\u2019s chief technology officer, graduated in 2014 with a degree in electrical engineering.\nLarger vending companies have noticed Gimme and formed partnerships to work with the young startup.\nIn March, Gimme partnered with Cantaloupe Systems, the vending industry\u2019s premier provider of cloud-based mobile technologies. And in April the company announced an alliance agreement with USA Technologies, a payment technology provider of cashless and mobile transactions in self-serve retail.\nHewett said one key lesson from CREATE-X still resonates with the company today.\n\u201cGOOTB \u2013 \u2018get out of the building\u2019 \u2013 and talk to real people to find out their pains before you start building anything,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s trendy to say \u2018customer discovery\u2019 but that really means getting outside of your normal area, your normal social group, to challenge your understanding of the problem and learn what real people really think.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nCREATE-X\nContact\nLaura Diamond\nMedia Relations\n404-894-6016\n@LauraRDiamond\nEmail\nlaura.diamond@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
