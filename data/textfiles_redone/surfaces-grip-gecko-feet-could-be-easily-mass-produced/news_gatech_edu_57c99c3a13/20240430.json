Engineers can already emulate\u00a0the secrets of gecko stickiness to make\u00a0strips of rubbery materials that can pick\u00a0up and release\u00a0objects, but simple mass production for everyday use has been out of reach until now.\nResearchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology have developed,\u00a0 in a new study , a method of making gecko-inspired adhesive materials that is much more cost-effective than current methods. It could enable mass production and the spread of the versatile gripping strips to manufacturing and homes.\nPolymers with \u201cgecko adhesion\u201d surfaces could be used to make extremely versatile grippers to pick up very different objects even on the same assembly line. They could make picture hanging easy by adhering to both the picture and the wall at the same time. Vacuum cleaner robots with gecko adhesion could someday scoot up tall buildings to clean facades.\n\u201cWith the exception of things like Teflon, it will adhere to anything. This is a clear advantage in manufacturing because we don\u2019t have to prepare the gripper for specific surfaces we want to lift. Gecko-inspired adhesives can lift flat objects like boxes then turn around and lift curved objects like eggs and vegetables,\u201d said Michael Varenberg, the study\u2019s principal investigator and an\u00a0 assistant professor in Georgia Tech\u2019s George W. Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering .\nCurrent grippers on assembly lines, such as clamps, magnets, and suction cups, can each lift limited ranges of objects. Grippers based on gecko-inspired surfaces, which are dry and contain no glue or goo, could replace many grippers or just fill in capability gaps left by other gripping mechanisms.\nDrawing out razors\nThe adhesion comes from protrusions a few hundred microns in size that often look like sections of short, floppy walls running parallel to each other across the material\u2019s surface. How they work by mimicking geckos\u2019 feet is explained below.\nUp to now, molding has produced these mesoscale walls by pouring ingredients onto a template, letting the mixture react and set to a flexible polymer then removing it from the mold. But the method is inconvenient.\n\u201cMolding techniques are expensive and time-consuming processes. And there are issues with getting the gecko-like material to release from the template, which can disturb the quality of the attachment surface,\u201d Varenberg said.\nThe researchers\u2019 new method formed those walls by pouring ingredients onto a smooth surface instead of a mold, letting the polymer partially set then dipping rows of laboratory razor blades into it. The material set a little more around the blades, which were then drawn out, leaving behind micron-scale indentations surrounded by the desired walls.\nVarenberg and first author Jae-Kang Kim published details of their new method\u00a0 in the journal\u00a0 ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces \u00a0on April 6, 2020.\nForget about perfection\nThough the new method is easier than molding, developing it took a year of dipping, drawing, and readjusting while surveying finicky details under an electron microscope.\n\u201cThere are many parameters to control: Viscosity and temperature of the liquid; timing, speed, and distance of withdrawing the blades. We needed enough plasticity of the setting polymer to the blades to stretch the walls up, and not so much rigidity that would lead the walls to rip up,\u201d Varenberg said.\nGecko-inspired surfaces have a fine topography on a micron-scale and sometimes even on a nanoscale, and surfaces made via molding are usually the most precise. But such perfection is unnecessary; the materials made with the new method did the job well and were also markedly robust.\n\u201cMany researchers demonstrating gecko adhesion have to do it in a cleanroom in clean gear. Our system just plain works in normal settings. It is robust and simple, and I think it has good potential for use in industry and homes,\u201d said Varenberg, who studies surfaces in nature to mimic their advantageous qualities in human-made materials.\n[Ready for graduate school with social distancing?\u00a0 Here's how to apply to Georgia Tech. ]\nGecko foot fluff\nBehold the gecko\u2019s foot. It has ridges on its toes, and this has led some in the past to think their feet stick by suction or some kind of clutching by the skin.\nBut electron microscopes reveal a deeper structure \u2013 spatula-shaped bristly fibrils protrude a few dozen microns long off those ridges. The fibrils make such thorough contact with surfaces down to the nanoscale that weak attractions between atoms on both sides appear to add up enormously to create overall strong adhesion.\nIn place of fluff, engineers have developed rows of shapes covering materials that produce the effect. A common shape makes a material\u2019s surface look like a field of mushrooms that are a few hundred microns in size; another is rows of short walls like those in this study.\n\u201cThe mushroom patterns touch a surface, and they are attached straightaway, but detaching requires applying forces that can be disadvantageous. The wall-shaped projections require minor shear force like a tug or a gentle grab to generate adherence, but that is easy, and letting go of the object is uncomplicated, too,\u201d Varenberg said.\nVarenberg\u2019s research team used the drawing method to make walls with U-shaped spaces in between them and walls with V-shaped spaces in between. They worked with polyvinylsiloxane (PVS) and polyurethane (PU). The V-shape made in PVS worked best, but polyurethane is the better material for industry, so Vanenberg\u2019s group will now work toward achieving the V-shape gecko gripping pattern in PU for the best possible combination.\nAlso read:\nLung-heart super sensor on a chi p tinier than a ladybug\nHere's how to\u00a0 subscribe to our free science and technology email\u00a0newsletter\nWriter &\u00a0Media Representative : Ben Brumfield (404-272-2780), email:\u00a0 ben.brumfield@comm.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nAdditional Images\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
