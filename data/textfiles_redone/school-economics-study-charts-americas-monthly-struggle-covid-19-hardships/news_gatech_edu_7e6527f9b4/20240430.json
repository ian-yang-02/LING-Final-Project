It peaked in December 2020, just ahead of the pandemic\u2019s second major spike in cases and deaths. It began to fall until April 2021, a month after the third round of economic stimulus payments from the U.S. government. The index remained steady until December 2021 \u2014 amid the pandemic\u2019s third major peak in cases and deaths.\nThe study found that individual concerns about job insecurity peaked very early in the pandemic, in April 2020, as many states were imposing lockdowns and other measures to slow the virus\u2019 spread. Housing insecurity reached its apex in July 2020, while food insecurity and mental health issues topped out in December 2020.\nDhongde\u2019s study also reinforces previous findings that hardships during the pandemic affected minorities more than white people. For instance, the study found that Black and Latino adults faced more food insufficiency than white adults.\nThe researchers also examined the disparate geographic impact of the pandemic, determining that residents of southern and western states were hit hardest by multiple hardships.\nData for the study came from the Census Bureau\u2019s\nHousehold Pulse Survey , created to gather information on the well-being of U.S. residents during the pandemic.\nDhongde has become a champion for considering the combined effects of financial and non-financial measures of well-being to understand the impact of economic conditions and crises such as the pandemic.\nFor instance, her\nprevious research\nhas shown that people with less education are more likely to have health issues, suggesting literacy education as a way to help people make better health choices \u2014 and to hold down the cost of health care.\n\u201cCrises such as the pandemic are never solely health issues. They are also employment and food issues, among other things,\u201d she said. \u201cWe can really only understand the full extent of their impact by looking at all of these measures at once.\u201d\nThe article, \u201cMultidimensional Hardships in the U.S. During the Covid-19 Pandemic,\u201d was published online in the journal\nSocial Indicators Research\non July 16, 2023.
