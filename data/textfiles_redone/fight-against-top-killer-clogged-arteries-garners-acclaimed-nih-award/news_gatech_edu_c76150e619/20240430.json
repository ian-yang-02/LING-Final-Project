Credit: National Institutes of Health\nOct 05, 2017\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nVery many lives may someday depend on the work of researchers like Tony Kim. He\u2019s fighting atherosclerosis, the foremost cause of coronary artery disease, which is\u00a0 America\u2019s single greatest killer .\nThe National Institutes of Health has awarded Kim over $2.3 million in funding to boost his innovative research using\u00a0 life-mimicking laboratory chips \u00a0to explore the treatment of atherosclerosis. No other health hazard appears to be deadlier, as the condition is also behind\u00a0stroke, some chronic kidney diseases, peripheral artery disease, and carotid artery disease.\nKnown for its high prestige, the\u00a0 NIH Director\u2019s New Innovator Award\u00a0 is\u00a0one of four\u00a0 High-Risk, High-Reward awards \u00a0given annually, which recognize promising new projects that address challenges in biomedical research of pressing importance to human health.\nEveryone is at risk\nWe are all at risk for clogged arteries or hardening of the arteries, common terms for\u00a0 atherosclerosis .\nIf atherosclerosis is detected in time, bypass surgery,\u00a0 drugs that lower bad cholesterol , and lifestyle changes can save lives. But many patients\u2019 conditions worsen in spite of these, and there is a strong need for better treatment options.\nFailures in clinical trials of new potential treatments that raise levels of \u201cgood cholesterol\u201d \u00a0have underscored the need for better understanding of the therapeutic role of good cholesterols known as\u00a0 high-density lipoprotein (HDL) . They are the focus of the research for which Kim\u2019s grant was awarded.\nBad \u00a0 \u2018good cholesterol\u2019\nRecently, researchers have uncovered that good cholesterols are not always good. There are thousands of different HDLs, and, take together, they don\u2019t work as they should in patients with coronary artery disease. Some HDLs even do bad things.\n\u201cResearchers tried raising HDL\u00a0levels in patients\u2019 bloodstreams thinking patients\u2019 conditions might improve, but the coronary artery disease did not get better,\u201d said\u00a0 Kim, an assistant professor in the George W. Woodruff School of\u00a0Mechanical Engineering \u00a0at the\nGeorgia Institute of Technology . \u201cAlso, high levels of HDLs in the bloodstream don\u2019t always protect people from atherosclerosis.\u201d\nKim is interested in HDLs\u2019 hit-or-miss qualities in atherosclerosis patients, and in how inflammation leads to HDLs\u2019 diminished effectiveness.\u00a0 Proinflammatory proteins in the bloodstream junk up good HDL s. \u201cHDLs remake themselves all the time, and they can incorporate proinflammatory proteins, which disturb the traditional good cholesterol functions that HDL is known for,\u201d Kim said.\nThe Kim group could better understand the mechanisms behind that, and also find ways to leverage these for treatments. His team may be able to identify some HDL cocktails that reduce atherosclerosis despite raised proinflammatory proteins levels in the bloodstream of patients with coronary artery disease or chronic kidney disease.\nArtery-on-a-chip\nKim\u2019s proposed research that won the\u00a0 NIH \u00a0award illuminates HDL interactions with proinflammatory proteins and with vascular tissues by mimicking some of them in the lab. Kim makes aspects of these interactions observable via a special slide called a\u00a0 human-coronary-artery-on-a-chip .\nIt\u2019s a clear\u00a0 plastic chip with microfluidic passages \u00a0lined with living arterial cells to form an artificial coronary artery. Inside the artificial arteries,\u00a0 Kim\u2019s research group \u00a0experiments with what are called engineered high-density lipoproteins (eHDLs), nanoparticles synthesized to be near faultless samples of specific HDLs.\nNatural HDLs are often not as uniform in composition and size because of interactions with other proteins. On the other hand, Kim\u2019s group can produce eHDLs with uniform properties, allowing for reliable experimental parameters. The eHDLs are\u00a0 highly reproducible, as are the experiments, the latter of which is essential in research \u00a0for cementing trustworthy results.\nInnovative\u00a0 microfluidic technology \u00a0allows for the robust production of\nmulticomponent nanomaterials , in this case, the eHDLs and inflammatory proteins, in large quantities and varieties. As a result, Kim\u2019s team can compile a comprehensive eHDL library with various functional proteins to see how they affect the artificial artery the way actual HDLs might in combination with inflammatory proteins affect real arteries in the body.\nOnce the\u00a0 in vitro \u00a0chip experiments yield results, Kim\u2019s research group will work to corroborate them\u00a0 in vivo \u00a0in experiments on a mouse model of atherosclerosis in collaboration with cardiology engineering researcher\u00a0 Hanjoong Jo at Emory University School of Medicine .\nAtherosclerosis\u00a0brief description\nThe old explanation about how cholesterol gunk coats blood vessels like lard is not quite correct, but animal fats are involved in atherosclerosis. Here\u2019s a brief description of how the disease clogs arteries.\nOil and water don\u2019t mix.\nSo, lipoproteins, which are large collections of particular protein molecules, wrap around lipids, which include\u00a0 oily fats called triglycerides , to transport them through the bloodstream, which is water-based. Some lipoproteins, like the infamous\u00a0 low-density lipoproteins (LDLs) , deliver lipids to cells, but HDLs pick them up from cells when it\u2019s time for them to leave and take them to the liver for breakdown, a process called\u00a0 reverse cholesterol transport .\nIf there aren\u2019t enough well-functioning HDLs in the bloodstream, reverse cholesterol transport can slow down, and the lipids amass in artery walls behind\u00a0 endothelial cells, which make up the lining inside of arteries .\nA healthy body maintains a balance between anti-inflammatory and proinflammatory proteins, so normally not too many HDLs are corrupted too badly. But when levels of proinflammatory proteins in the bloodstream rise, more HDLs get corrupted.\nAs a result, lipids congregate in the arterial wall, along with immune cells that get stuck there, together forming plaque, which causes the arteries to narrow and constrict blood flow. The plaque can burst into the artery, clogging it even more.\nA heart attack or stroke can result.\nAlso READ: Alzheimer's research, its vexing past, its future hopes\nHigh-Risk, High-Reward\nThe name of the category of the NIH grant Kim received is High-Risk, High-Reward for a reason. The risk refers to a bold move into uncharted territory, according to the NIH.\nThe potential reward, in this case, could mean discovering new effective treatments against what appears to be the single deadliest killer of our times.\nKim sees high reward potential in the unique possibilities combining the human- organ-on-a-chip technology \u00a0and the bioinspired nanotechnology provides. \u201cYou can\u2019t do this type of work\u00a0 in vivo ,\u201d Kim said. \u201cAnd the high reproducibility is very valuable to sort out truly good candidates for treatment trials.\u201d\nShould the experiments result in nailing down a drug candidate, Kim\u2019s lab will leverage its high-throughput manufacturing method to produce ample substances with high consistency for drug testing.\nAnd the high risk in his view?\n\u201cEven if we find HDLs with specific functions, they may not work in the same way in our bodies because of HDLs\u2019 compositional and functional complexity. The body can still introduce unidentified proteins into the HDLs,\u201d Kim said. \u201cIt\u2019s always like that in human trials. Things we still don\u2019t know about the body\u2019s enormous biochemistry can get in the way.\u201d\n\u201cEven so, the experiments may provide unprecedented insights into these complex nanoparticles and still move research forward toward better treatments. I think that, combined with all the engineering and scientific possibilities the work taps into, the high rewards dampen the potential risk.\u201d\nThe NIH Director\u2019s New Innovator Award covers five years of research funding and is given to a principal investigator who is in an early career stage and has never received a large-category NIH grant before.\nTony Kim is also affiliated with Georgia Tech\u2019s\u00a0 Wallace H.
