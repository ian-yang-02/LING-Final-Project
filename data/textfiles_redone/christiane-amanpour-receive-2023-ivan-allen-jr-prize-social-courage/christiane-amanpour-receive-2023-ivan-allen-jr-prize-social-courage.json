She was outspoken, calling out the human rights abuses, massacres, and genocide committed against the Bosnian Muslims, later saying, \u201cThere are some situations one simply cannot be neutral about, because when you are neutral you are an accomplice.\u201d\nShe has reported from the aftermath of many humanitarian crises including the devastating 2010 earthquake in Haiti, the 1992 famine in Somalia, the 2004 tsunami in Southeast Asia, the 2011 Japanese tsunami, Hurricane Katrina in 2005, and the current war in Ukraine.\nIn addition to her work as an anchor and reporter, Amanpour is an active rights campaigner.
