The technology is not very far off, and a massive national effort, led in part by Georgia Tech researchers, is charting the course.\nLast year, the\nSemiconductor Research Corporation (SRC)\nand the\nDefense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)\nannounced a new program to improve the nation\u2019s information and technology infrastructure. With a global chip shortage, supply chain issues, and other challenges in play, a group of Georgia Tech faculty members jumped at the opportunity to participate.\nTheir landing was perfect. Two new research centers, representing an investment of about $65.7 million, have been awarded to Georgia Tech through the SRC-administrated Joint University Microelectronics Program 2.0, or\nJUMP 2.0 .\nJUMP 2.0 will support the work of dozens of inter-disciplinary researchers from multiple universities, tackling the technological issues of an increasingly connected world. The goal is to improve the nation\u2019s performance, efficiency, and capabilities for both commercial and military applications.\n\u201cGeorgia Tech won two of the seven centers, which is not only fantastic, but also speaks highly about the breadth and depth of our research enterprise,\u201d said Professor\nArijit Raychowdhury , the Steve W. Chaddick Chair of the\nSchool of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Georgia Tech\nand will direct one of the new centers.\nThe JUMP 2.0 announcement represents the latest round of significant support advancing AI-related research at Georgia Tech. Last July, Tech received\ntwo National Science Foundation Artificial Intelligence Research awards totaling $40 million.\nIn September, the U.S. Economic Development Administration awarded Georgia Tech\n$65 million to support a statewide initiative\ncombining AI and manufacturing innovations with workforce and outreach programs.\nA New Collaborative Chapter\nLaunching in 2023, JUMP 2.0 is the next chapter of an SRC-led alliance that formed in 2018 \u2013 the original JUMP, with its broad focus on nano-electronic computing.\nJUMP 2.0 is a collaboration between SRC indust\u00ad\u00adrial participants (IBM, Intel, Raytheon, TSMC and Samsung, to name a few) and the Department of Defense. The program asked researchers from U.S. universities to solicit proposals for collaborative, multidisciplinary, multi-institute research in seven theme areas: cognition; communications and connectivity; intelligent sensing to action; systems and architectures for distributed computing; intelligent memory and storage; advanced monolithic and heterogenous integration; and high-performance energy efficient devices.\nThe two new research centers Georgia Tech, both headquartered within the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) are:\n\u2022 CoCoSys: Center for the Co-Design of Cognitive Systems (theme area: cognition), under the direction of Raychowdhury;\n\u2022 CogniSense: Center on Cognitive Multispectral Sensors (theme area: intelligent sensing to action), under the direction of\nSaibal Mukhopadhyay , Joseph M. Pettit Professor in ECE.\nSemiconductors, or microchips, are basically tiny silicon slices packed with millions of transistors that control electron activity. These chips enable all our electronic devices to work. So, a shortage of semiconductors \u2013 or a shortcoming in terms of quality and efficiency \u2013 spells trouble for sectors and industries that depend on these little bits of hardware, for example: computing, healthcare, telecommunication, security, transportation, or manufacturing.\nBuilding a Digital Human\nThe goals for the JUMP 2.0 centers are lofty and wide-ranging, addressing current and future needs.\n\u201cIn some sense, the question we\u2019re addressing is, \u2018how do you build a perfect digital human,\u2019\u201d Raychowdhury said of the Team CoCoSys mission. \u201cWe want to learn how to build systems which are aware \u2013 capable of interacting as human agents with us. For example, we want AI that can listen to a conversation between two human beings and learn from that and seamlessly merge into society.\u201d\nCurrent AI, Raychowdhury said, may be able to perform relatively narrow tasks better than a human, but one area that it is much less effective is\u00a0human-intelligent machine collaboration. This concept has been increasingly researched in recent years as automated virtual assistants and the metaverse have entered the mainstream. As cognitive systems research moves toward creation of a digital human, it will have far-reaching impact in industry and healthcare testing, disaster relief, fully autonomous and collaborative systems, immersive training and gaming experiences, and more.\n\u201cContinuous learning through interactions with humans is missing,\u201d Raychowdhury said. \u201cThe next generation of AI needs to comprehend nuances of human interaction, explain, and interpret visual cues and language, and be able to do that in real-time with high energy-efficiency. That\u2019s what we want to address. That\u2019s the meta goal of this center.\u201d\nThree other Georgia Tech faculty researchers, all from ECE, are part of Team CoCoSys:\nLarry Heck ,\nAzad Naeemi , and\nTushar Krishna .\n\u201cThis is a diverse team in all possible ways with expertise across the board,\u201d Raychowdhury said.\nSensors with a Brain\nThe ability to sense is fundamental and probably the most critical component for building an intelligent machine. \u201cIt is fundamental to nature,\u201d said Mukhopadhyay. \u201cWe have eyes, ears, a nose, and skin to sense the environment around us.\u201d\nThe CogniSense Center research team wants to develop sensors that can effectively \u201cperceive\u201d everything around them and, like humans, efficiently attend to the information that really matters.\nToday\u2019s electronics sensors samples everything they \u201csee\u201d and generate abundance of\u00a0 digital data; sometime way too much for a machine store, process, and make sense. The CogniSense center\u2019s goal is to change this paradigm by learning from biology.\n\u201cIn human, sensors and the brain work together to control attention and extract only important information from everything happening around us,\u201d said Mukhopadhyay. \u201cCan we make electronic sensors that behave like that \u2013 cognizant and energy efficient?\u201d\nThe team he\u2019s assembled is made up of 20 researchers from 12 different institutions, including two other ECE faculty members:\nJustin Romberg\n(associate chair for research in ECE) and\nMuhannad Bakir\n(interim director of the Georgia Tech 3D Systems Packing Research Center).\n\u201cWe have a diverse team with expertise in radars, optics, integrated circuits, packaging, signal processing, and artificial intelligence to build these new sensors with a brain,\u201d said Mukhopadhyay.\nBeyond Campus\nGeorgia Tech researchers will play critical roles in three other centers based at other universities around the country:\n\u2022 PRISM: Center for Processing with Intelligent Storage and Memory\n\u2022 ACE: Evolvable Computing for Next-Generation Distributed Computer Systems.\n\u2022\u00a0CHIMES: Center for Heterogenous Integration of Microelectronic Systems\nCHIMES in particular will feature a large, multi-disciplinary Georgia Tech influence including ECE\u2019s\nSuman Datta ,\nCallie Hao , and\nShimeng Yu ; George Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering\u2019s\nSuresh Sitaraman\nand\nSatish Kumar;\nand the center\u2019s associate director, Bakir (doubling up on his JUMP 2.0 responsibilities as a member of both CogniSense and CHIMES).\n\u201cWe are delighted in the critical and fundamental role Georgia Tech plays within CHIMES,\u201d said Bakir. \u201cIn each of the four research themes that constitute this center, Georgia Tech faculty play a key role. This not only reflects our world class faculty, students, and staff, but also our world-class fabrication, assembly and bonding, and advanced system level prototyping facilities that will be critical in enabling next generation 3D heterogeneous and 3D monolithic circuits and systems.\u201d\nTech's multidisciplinary research activities related to CHIMES are supported by the\nInstitute for Electronics and Nanotechnology (IEN) . Georgia Tech's nanotechnology core facilities, namely the IEN\nMicro/Nanofabrication Facility\nand\nMaterials Characterization Facility , support CHIMES and other JUMP 2.0 research activities.\nEstablishing all of these new semiconductor research centers is the result of impeccable timing, according to Raychowdhury, who pointed out that ECE broke into the\ntop two in national rankings by\nU.S. News and World Report\nrankings for the first time in 2022, not long after President Biden signed the CHIPS and Science Act, which provides about $280 billion in new funding to boost U.S. research and manufacturing of semiconductors.\n\u201cThese research centers are part of a confluence of things that are happening simultaneously across the U.S.,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd they have implications for Georgia Tech, national security, and the independence of our national supply chain as a whole.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nContact\nWriter:\nJerry Grillo\nEmail\njerry.grillo@ibb.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
