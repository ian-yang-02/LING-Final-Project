Maintaining and expanding the necessary physical and human capabilities to complete this mission is driving renewed investments into nuclear science and engineering.\nGeorgia Tech researchers were recently awarded $11.6 million from the NNSA to address this growing need \u2014 and to study and expand on existing models of transuranic chemistry, a branch of chemistry dedicated to studying elements with atomic numbers greater than that of uranium.\nLed by\nSchool of Chemistry and Biochemistry\nAssociate Professor\nHenry \u201cPete\u201d La Pierre , the funding will serve to establish the\nTransuranic Chemistry Center of Excellence . Directed by La Pierre, the Center will house a collaborative network of five other universities and six national laboratories across the United States conducting both theoretical and applied research.\n\u201cScientifically, actinides and transuranic elements present unique challenges to existing models of chemical bonding,\u201d explains La Pierre. These elements are man-made radioactive metals, many of which are not available in large quantities. \u201cThere are amazing open-ended questions that are fundamental to our understanding of chemical bonding and activities, that serve to transform our knowledge of how the elements form bonds across the Periodic Table.\u201d\nJoining seven other universities, this funding comes to Georgia Tech as part of NNSA\u2019s $100 million program establishing Stewardship Science Academic Alliances Centers of Excellence. A main goal of this program is to recruit, train, and educate the next generation of researchers in nuclear science and engineering.\n\u201cThese cooperative agreements will allow NNSA to train the smartest and most skilled individuals while creating a direct pathway into our workforce with a diverse group of experts that can meet the evolving needs of the nuclear security enterprise,\u201d said\nKevin Greenaugh , Chief Science and Technology Officer for Defense Programs, in a recent\npress release .\n\u201cThe science and engineering collaboration of this center is a true synergy,\u201d says\nMartha Grover , professor and associate chair for Graduate Studies in the\nSchool of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering\nand one of the collaborators for the Center.\u00a0 Anna Erickson , Woodruff Professor and associate chair for Research in the\nGeorge W. Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering , is another Georgia Tech collaborator. \u201cThis center provides a new example of the growing prominence of Georgia Tech in the nuclear field.\u201d\nPushing the bounds of chemistry\n\u201cWe are at core a synthetic inorganic chemistry group, which means we make new molecules and characterize them,\u201d La Pierre explained. In his research as part of the Center, La Pierre will \u201cbe handling both radioactive and chemically reactive species to make new forms of matter.\u201d\nCharacterizing new forms of matter is no easy task, requiring advanced techniques that allow scientists to envision and measure the properties of chemical bonds. Exposing the molecules to X-rays or neutrons and measuring how they scatter or diffract (depending on the experimental design), gives researchers insights into the chemical bonds that are formed.\nUsing a combination of these advanced techniques as well as theoretical models, La Pierre and the collaborators of the Center will be creating new molecules out of actinides and lanthanides \u2014 metallic elements on the bottom of the periodic table \u2014 and studying the details of their structures and behavior during chemical reactions. As these elements are not found naturally, the structures and properties of many of these compounds have never been studied before.\n\u201cWe are creating systems that challenge existing bonding models, which we then have to go back and build new theoretical techniques in order to understand what we're seeing,\u201d La Pierre explained. \u201cSo, this does push the forefront of our understanding of basic chemical model systems.\u201d\nTo push those boundaries, scientists and engineers will be working together across the country \u2014 led by Georgia Tech.\n\u201cThere are so many faculty at Georgia Tech working in nuclear science and technology,\u201d says Grover. \u201cThis center gives me the opportunity to collaborate with Prof. La Pierre and Erickson for the first time, in the area of flow chemistry and separations.\u201d\n\u201cI'm looking forward to working with some incredibly talented colleagues whom I don't normally get a chance to work with,\u201d says La Pierre. \u201cAnd now we have the opportunity to work together every week with fantastic students that I would never have met otherwise. That's the main draw for me.\u201d\nAdditional Media\nRelated links\nHannah Choi and Henry S.
