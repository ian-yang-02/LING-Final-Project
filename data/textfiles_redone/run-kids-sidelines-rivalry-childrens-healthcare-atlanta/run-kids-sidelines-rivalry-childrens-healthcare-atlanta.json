Returning after a pandemic-induced hiatus, the relay, beginning at the UGA FIJI house at 7 a.m., spans 77 miles between the two campuses. Runners from the two chapters meet at a midway point in Loganville for the exchange before arriving in Atlanta at 6 p.m. The final leg of the relay will be completed just before toe meets leather on Saturday night as the ball is carried into the stadium.\nThe event began in 1998 and has raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for the nonprofit healthcare network that cares for more than a million children each year. The most recent event in 2019 raised $30,000, and Jacob Keenan was among several FIJI members determined to get the ball rolling again.\n\"This event is unique because we're bridging the gap between UGA and Georgia Tech,\u201d said Keenan, a business administration major and FIJI\u2019s recording secretary. \u201cIn a week where our rivalry is the strongest, we come together for this common cause along with the broader Atlanta community because Children's Healthcare of Atlanta has become a beacon of hope for a lot of people here.\u201d\nWith a Georgia State Patrol escort and a truck full of snacks, water, and support trailing, members of each chapter will run a portion of the relay. While the day after Thanksgiving could be considered a difficult day to convince their peers to run several miles, Keenan said the buzz of bringing the relay back and the recognition of their cause's importance has left them with no shortage of participants.\n\"It's a huge team effort, and what makes this event so incredible is that we're working hard behind the scenes, on the streets, and running the football to raise awareness, and we feel personally connected with the mission,\" Keenan said. \u201cEvery child deserves to hear those magical words, \u2018all better,\u2019 and this relay is our way of making that dream come true.\u201d\nThe Georgia Tech FIJI chapter welcomes\nonline\ndonations for this year's relay.\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nDonate to FIJI's Run for the Kids\nContact\nSteven Gagliano\n- Institute Communications\nEmail\nSteven.gagliano@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
