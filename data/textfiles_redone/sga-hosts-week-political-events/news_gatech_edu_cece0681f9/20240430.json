This year is no different, with a week's worth of events focused on informing potential voters, beginning with voter registration tabling at Tech Walkway, Sept. 28\u201330 from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m.\nA debate\nwill take place among the four major student-led political organizations on campus: College Democrats, College Republicans, Young Democratic Socialists of America, and Young Americans for Liberty. This debate will be held on Sept. 30 at 7 p.m. in the Clary Theatre of the Bill Moore Student Success Center and will provide these organizations a platform to discuss major issues in the U.S. and Atlanta.\nThis year, elections are also being held for the mayor of Atlanta as well as city council positions. SGA hopes to help students go beyond the Tech campus and become active members of the community. SGA has partnered with WSB-TV to host the top five mayoral candidates \u2013 Antonio Brown, Andre Dickens, Sharon Gay, Felicia Moore, and Kasim Reed \u2013 right on Tech\u2019s campus.\nThe forum\nwill take place at 9 a.m. on Saturday, Oct. 2, in the main auditorium of The Kendeda Building for Innovative Sustainable Design; it will also be livestreamed\nhere . SGA hopes the event will help students gain insight into a complex race involving 14 total candidates.\nBeyond the week, SGA will continue to encourage students to get registered in their state and participate in our electoral system. There will be more speakers brought on campus to continue to help inform students leading up to Election Day, Nov 2.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nConnor White\nInstitute Communications\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
