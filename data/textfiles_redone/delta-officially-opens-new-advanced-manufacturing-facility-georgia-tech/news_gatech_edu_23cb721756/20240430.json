Our students, faculty, staff and researchers will be able to develop products, and it provides Delta an opportunity to collaborate with its partners.\u201d\nMade possible by a $3 million gift from the Delta Air Lines Foundation, the facility was designed to be an integrated physical and cyber manufacturing technology testbed as well as a demonstration and teaching facility. The Advanced Manufacturing Pilot Facility (AMPF) will be a flagship component of the Georgia Tech Manufacturing Institute as a location where early-stage concepts can go from idea to reality.\n\u201cOver the last two years, inspired by insights gained from our close collaboration in manufacturing research with industry partners, faculty members from the schools of Mechanical Engineering, Aerospace Engineering, Industrial and Systems Engineering, Materials Science and Engineering, and Interactive Computing came together to define the requirements for a learning and research facility that will provide the foundation for future innovations in digital manufacturing,\u201d said Don McConnell, Georgia Tech\u2019s vice president of Industry Collaboration.\nPeterson said the building had been part of the Atlantic Steel plant and before it was converted to house Delta\u2019s AMPF and Boeing\u2019s Manufacturing Development Center, the building had served as a warehouse for Georgia Tech\u2019s Housing department to store and repair furniture for residence halls and on-campus apartments.\n\u201cGeorgia Tech is a world-class institute, and we\u2019re really blessed to have you in our hometown,\u201d said Gil West, senior executive vice president and chief operating officer for Delta.\nBack on May 2, Delta and Georgia Tech held a ribbon cutting for an innovation center called \u201cThe Hangar\u201d in Tech Square, which is now home to 20 such innovation centers. The AMPF establishes Georgia Tech as a national leader in advanced manufacturing.\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nInnovation Soars at The Hangar in Tech Square\nBoeing, Georgia Tech Unveil New Research Center\nContact\nlance.wallace@comm.gatech.edu\nEmail\nlance.wallace@comm.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
