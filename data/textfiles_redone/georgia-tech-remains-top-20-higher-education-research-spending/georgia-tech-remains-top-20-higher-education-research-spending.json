Georgia Tech ranked No. 20, based on the annual\u00a0 Higher Education Research and Development Survey \u00a0conducted by the\u00a0National Science Foundation (NSF). The ranking is especially significant because Georgia Tech is the only institution in the Top 20 without a medical school.\nIndeed, the research funding has led to\u00a0 remarkable breakthroughs in biomedicine , such as 3D-printed medical devices, including tracheal and bronchial splints for children with rare, life-threatening genetic irregularities. It also has put Georgia Tech at the forefront of sustainability as researchers\u00a0 reimagine toilet systems \u00a0that operate without inlet water or output sewer lines, improving issues with sanitation and pollution.\n\u201cWe strive for knowledge, understanding, and impact in all that we do at Georgia Tech,\u201d\u00a0said Chaouki T. Abdallah, executive vice president for Research at Georgia Tech.\u00a0\u201cThese expenditures also help us address our most pressing challenges here at home in Georgia, around the world, and even beyond Earth.\u201d\nThe research has also taken Georgia Tech to space with a team of faculty and students\u00a0 guiding NASA\u2019s Lunar Flashlight satellite probe \u00a0in the quest to find frozen water on Earth\u2019s moon. Here at home, Georgia Tech is\u00a0 leading a coalition of partners \u00a0across the state in an effort to bring together artificial intelligence and innovation to strengthen Georgia\u2019s manufacturing sector, create new opportunities for the state\u2019s workforce, and augment its economic resiliency.\nGeorgia Tech\u2019s R&D spending of $1.114 billion in fiscal year 2021 reflects a 6.2% increase from the 2020 figure for its entire research enterprise, which includes the Georgia Tech Research Institute (GTRI). All R&D spending in higher education increased 4% to $89.872 billion in fiscal year 2021. The nation\u2019s top 30 schools accounted for 42% of that overall R&D spending amount, unchanged from 2020.\n\"We are proud to see Georgia Tech in such a distinguished group of public and private universities,\u201d said Abdallah. \u201cThe driving mission behind all of our research is to\u00a0develop and lead in creative work and innovations that improve the human condition.\u201d\nThe NSF collected its data from 916 universities in the Higher Education Research and Development Survey, sponsored by the NSF\u2019s National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics unit.\nThe Institute\u2019s showing on the list of research-intensive or R1 universities places it among a group of schools that include Johns Hopkins University, which had the top spot in R&D spending with $3.181 billion, Duke University (No. 11 with $1.237 billion), and Yale University (No. 15 with $1.165 billion).\nIn addition to the innovations that those federal and state research dollars and foundation grants help support, the R&D funding has very real and immediate impact on Georgia\u2019s economy. According to the University System of Georgia, all schools within the system\u00a0 contributed $19.3 billion to the state\u2019s economy \u00a0in fiscal year 2021. Georgia Tech\u2019s portion of that total \u2014 roughly $4.2 billion \u2014 was the highest of any USG institution and reflects a 4.6% jump from fiscal year 2020.
