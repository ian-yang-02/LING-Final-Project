That\u2019s what we did with Watson.\u201d Watson was trained by student teams in a class at Georgia Tech using 1,200 question-answer pairs (200 for each of six teams), which allowed them to \u201cchat\u201d with Watson and seek out inspiration for big design challenges in areas such as engineering, architecture, systems, and computing. The teams worked with the AI to learn about solutions that could be replicated from the natural world \u2014\u00a0something known as biologically inspired design \u2014\u00a0after first feeding Watson several hundred\u00a0biology articles\u00a0from\u00a0 Biologue , an interactive biology repository. Teams then posed questions to Watson about the research it had learned. Questions included, \u201cHow do you make a better desalination process for consuming sea water?\u201d Animals, it turns out, have a variety of answers for this, such as how seagulls filter out seawater salt through special glands. Another question asked, \u201cHow can manufacturers develop better solar cells for long-term space travel?\u201d One answer: Replicate how plants in harsh climates use high-temperature fibrous insulation material to regulate temperature. IBM\u2019s Watson quickly culled answers for students from the\nBiologue\narticles in a fraction of a second. Watson effectively acted as an intelligent sounding board to steer students through what would otherwise be a daunting task of parsing a wide volume of research that may fall outside their expertise. This approach to using Watson could assist professionals in a variety of fields by allowing them to ask questions and receive answers as quickly as in natural conversation to help with problem solving. Georgia Tech discovered that Watson\u2019s ability to retrieve natural language information would allow a novice to quickly \u201ctrain up\u201d about complex topics and better determine whether their idea or hypothesis is worth pursuing. The students call their technique \u201cGT-Watson Plus,\u201d a moniker that implies the system\u2019s advanced capabilities. In addition to the ability to \u201cchat\u201d on a topic, this version of Watson prompts users with alternate ways to ask questions for better results. Those results are packaged in an intuitive presentation \u2014 visualized as a \u201ctreetop\u201d where each answer is a \u201cleaf\u201d that varies in size based on its weighted importance.\u00a0This allows the average person to navigate results more easily on a given topic. \u201cResearchers are provided a quickly digestible visual map of the concepts relevant to the query and the degree to which they are relevant,\u201d says Goel, who taught the course. \u201cWe were able to add more semantic and contextual meaning to Watson to give some notion of a conversation with the AI.\u201d Goel plans to investigate other areas with Watson such as online learning and healthcare. The work will be presented at the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) 2015 Fall Symposium on Cognitive Assistance in Government, Nov. 12-14, in Arlington, Va.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nJoshua Preston Research Communications Officer GVU Center and College of Computing\n678.231.0787\nEmail\njpreston@cc.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
