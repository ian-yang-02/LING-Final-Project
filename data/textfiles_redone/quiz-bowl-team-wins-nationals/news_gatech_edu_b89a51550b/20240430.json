A. Shenoy, Alexander Li, and Rodrigo Rose\nMay 16, 2022\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nEvery year, Georgia Tech\u2019s\nacademic quiz bowl team\ncompetes in two national tournaments. This year, their top team won first among 51 of the best teams in the country in the Academic Competition Federation's Nationals Tournament.\nIn some ways, quiz bowl is similar to\nJ eopardy! . Topics range from fine arts to sciences. Rather than competing as individuals, though, teams of four compete together.\n\u201cPeople are often put into bins by majors, but their other interests are reflected by the questions,\u201d said S.A. Shenoy, a computer science major and member of the winning team (as well as a former\nJeopardy!\ncontestant). Quiz bowl participants must learn about a wider range of topics and fields than what they learn in their coursework. Any source of knowledge could prove crucial to a win \u2014 one participant knew an answer from a conversation they had with someone about music. That kind of community has helped many Tech students find a home in this club that goes beyond the buzzer.\nAside from the joy of winning, there is a more meaningful reason this win was so special to the team.\n\u201cRobert Meredith was a professor at Tech. He popularized quiz bowl in the Southeast, and the trophy we won is named in his honor,\u201d said Hari Parameswaran, president of the club and an electrical and computer engineering major, and another\nJeopardy!\nalum. Meredith kept the spirit of quiz bowl alive, and this was the first time since 1996 that a Georgia Tech team was able to bring home the trophy.\nAbove all, the club is a place in which people can feel safe learning with their peers.\n\u201cWe never put winning above well-being, because it is important to cultivate positive mindsets,\u201d said Rodrigo Rose, an aerospace engineering major. The club wants to win, but that never outweighs the need for everyone to feel included and accepted.\nAcademic quiz bowl is always seeking new members. The club meets every Monday and Thursday, and everyone is welcome, even if they do not want to compete. There are many ways to be involved, including volunteering, competing, and planning tournaments.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nConnor White\nInstitute Communications\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
