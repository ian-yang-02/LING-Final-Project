CE 2021, prepares to cross the Commencement stage for the second, and most likely final, time, he is\u00a0 speaking from experience.\nSince he was first introduced to Georgia Tech through a distance learning math program as a high school senior, the Cumming, Georgia, native has done it all \u2014 from decorating his RAT cap and running in the Freshman Cake Race to leaving change for Sideways before exams and playing trumpet in the Yellow Jacket Marching Band.\nThe latter was his favorite part of attending Tech. \u201cThe band keeps up with so many traditions that made me feel more connected to Tech\u2019s history,\u201d he said. Even more importantly, it was where he met his wife, Kailee Garrett, CE 2019, M.S. CE 2020, who played piccolo, flute, and oboe. They married in May 2021 and celebrated with a post-nuptial ride in the Ramblin\u2019 Wreck.\nHe also appreciated \u201call the opportunities there are for study abroad at Georgia Tech.\u201d Garrett participated in the School of Civil and Environmental Engineering\u2019s London program, which included studying iconic structures in London, Paris, and Edinburgh, and which \u201cshaped my path to becoming a structural engineer.\u201d\nIn fact, his full-time career began last summer, while he worked on his master\u2019s degree. He became a structural engineer at PM&A, a national provider of engineering, technical, and consulting services in the construction industry whose headquarters are in Atlanta. In the coming years, he plans to continue working for the firm and to pursue his structural engineering license.\nFor most Tech graduates over the past 22 months, the coronavirus pandemic affected their academic careers in profound and unforgettable ways. For his part, Garrett found a silver lining. \u201cMoving all the classes online was actually very helpful for me,\u201d he said. \u201cIt meant I could still work full-time and watch my classes and do homework before or after my normal workday. It also meant I had flexibility when I had to travel for site visits for work, because I could take a test or complete homework in my hotel room instead of having to make it up at another time.\u201d And though there were challenges, he credits his instructors with doing \u201ca fantastic job transitioning to online classes.\nHe has also used this time to take up marathon running \u2014 a far cry from the frenzied sprint up Freshman Hill \u2014 and he looks forward to continuing his newfound passion.\nEngineering, music, and beloved Tech traditions all wove their way through his years as a Yellow Jacket. And though Garrett is excited about this second graduation, and the prospect of attending events as a spectator rather than a participant, he urges current students not to rush to get out.\nAbove all, he reminds them to be grateful \u2014 for the opportunities and the memories, for the fun and the hard work, and for the help of others along the way. \u201cThank you,\u201d he says, \u201cto my family, friends, and amazing wife for supporting me throughout my time at Georgia Tech.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nContact\nStacy Braukman\nInstitute Communications\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
