And, together with computer science major Austin Condict, he created a new way to fly quadcopter drones.\n\u201cI wanted to recreate that feeling with a drone and have young people experience flying in a fun, new way,\u201d Parker explains. That is, without the use of a standard radio controller.\nThe custom-fitted drones created by Finger Flyer can be controlled simply by using your fingers or hands. Using an Inertial Measurement Unit sensor and a unique 3D-printed finger-port system, the Finger Flyer quadcopter drone is able to be manipulated and perform pre-programmed flight maneuvers.\nFinger Flyer sought to create a quadcopter drone with an easy learning curve, while also giving users the feeling of surfing the wind with their hands. \u201cIt was heavily coded and adapted, but we\u2019ve found that it\u2019s generally easy to use,\u201d says Condict.\nAccording to the creators, people tend to crowd around when they test the device in public. \u201cThey definitely want to try it out for themselves,\u201d explains Condict.\nThe prototypes and final products were actually built on campus in Georgia Tech\u2019s Flowers Invention Studio. \u201cWe used resin-printers and soldering tools to bring this to life,\u201d says Parker. \u201cWe essentially built this from scratch right here at Georgia Tech.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nContact\nSteven Norris\nInstitute Communications\nEmail\nsnorris@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
