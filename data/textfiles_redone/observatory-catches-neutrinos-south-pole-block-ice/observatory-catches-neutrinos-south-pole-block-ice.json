The block is part of IceCube, an observatory built in one of the most inhospitable parts of the world to study neutrinos zipping through the Earth from outer space. These subatomic particles normally pass through the Earth as easily as light passes through a pane of glass.But a few of them crash into the ultra-clear ice of IceCube. When they do, they produce secondary particles that can create a faint bluish light called Cherenkov radiation. Scientists like Ignacio Taboada, an assistant professor in the Georgia Tech School of Physics, are using information from that glow to learn more about these neutrinos \u2013 including, perhaps, where in the universe they came from. Using data collected between May 2010 and May 2012, IceCube has measured 28 neutrinos that likely originated outside our solar system, the first time such very-high-energy cosmic neutrinos have been observed. As the IceCube Neutrino Observatory celebrates the third anniversary of the end of construction on Dec. 18th, it is receiving the \u201cBreakthrough of the Year\u201d award from the British journal\nPhysics World\nfor observing these cosmic visitors. \u201cWe now know that neutrinos from outside our planet are there, and we saw roughly as many as we had expected,\u201d said Taboada, who has been part of the IceCube Collaboration team for 14 years and was a co-author of the Nov. 22 paper in the journal\nScience\nthat reported the neutrino findings. \u201cWe have learned some things about neutrinos, but there are still other things that we still don\u2019t understand.\u201d The centerpiece of IceCube is a matrix of 86 strings of basketball-sized optical detectors placed one and a half kilometers beneath the Antarctic snow. Each string includes 60 optical detectors that are so sensitive they can register a single photon. Dug into the ice by a special hot-water drill, the strings are arranged in a pattern designed to use the Cherenkov radiation to map the path of neutrinos through the ice. By observing the path of the particles through the ice block, scientists had hoped to learn where the particles originated in space. But from the 28 neutrino events observed, that hasn\u2019t yet been possible. \u201cSo far, we are not seeing individual sources for the neutrinos,\u201d said Taboada. \u201cWe are not seeing any place in the sky that we can point to and say that we see even three or four of the neutrinos coming from. It is very diffuse. It may be that the sources are very weak, or that we have a detector that is not large enough.\u201d Neutrinos are nearly-massless particles that carry no electrical charge and originate from a variety of sources, including radioactive decay, our own Sun, cosmic rays and events such as exploding stars. From May 2010 to May 2012, IceCube recorded 28 neutrinos with very high energy levels \u2013 above 30 trillion electron volts \u2013 suggesting they were from beyond our own solar system. One challenge for the nearly 300 scientists involved in the program is separating cosmic neutrinos from those that originate on Earth. Cosmic neutrinos tend to have much higher energy levels, which can be measured by the amount of light they produce in the ice. Their direction also gives a clue; only cosmic neutrinos can pass through the Earth into the ice. Built with funds from the National Science Foundation and scientific organizations from three European countries, IceCube was also designed to measure cosmic rays, which accompany the formation of neutrinos. The existence of cosmic rays has been known for more than a hundred years, but their sources are also unknown. \u201cThis is essentially the birth of a new branch of astrophysics,\u201d said Taboada. \u201cWe\u2019ve observed the universe with photons, and now we can observe using neutrinos.\u201d IceCube is also facilitating Taboada\u2019s own research on gamma-ray bursts, which is being conducted with Ph.D. students James Casey and Jacob Daughhetee. \u201cGamma ray bursts are gigantic explosions that last for only a few seconds,\u201d Taboada said. \u201cOver those few seconds, they are so bright that they can outshine the rest of the universe combined. They are brief, but they are very powerful while they last.\u201d Scientists believe that there are at least two kinds of gamma ray bursts: those associated with supernovas that eject jets of matter and radiation, and neutron stars that spiral together and eventually merge. Neutrinos from gamma ray bursts can also be detected by IceCube. IceCube was built at the South Pole to take advantage of the very clear ice available there and the darkness within the ice. \u201cWe used Antarctic ice because we needed a highly transparent material to observe the Cherenkov radiation,\u201d explained Taboada. \u201cThe ice allows us to see evidence of these secondary particles.\u201d But that transparency has a cost. The South Pole experiences extremely cold temperatures, and everything used there must be flown in. Taboada has been to the South Pole three times, each time for a month during the Antarctic summer \u2013 when temperatures can still be as low as 45 degrees below zero Celsius (minus 49 degrees Fahrenheit). \u201cIt\u2019s a very work-oriented place,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause it is so difficult to get there, you work every day, 12 and 15 hours a day. At the end of a month, you are exhausted.\u201d During the summer \u2013 November through February \u2013 as many as 150 people work at the South Pole facilities, known officially as the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station. During the Antarctic winter, only 50 or 60 people work there, and aircraft don\u2019t land except in extreme emergencies. While space is tight, the station does have a music room, gymnasium and basketball court, along with a greenhouse for growing fresh vegetables. Water is precious because it is obtained by melting ice, so researchers are limited to two two-minute showers per week. Construction of IceCube began in 2005, and the facility \u2013 now managed by the University of Wisconsin \u2013 was turned on in December 2010. With participation from 41 institutions in 12 countries, IceCube is expected to operate for at least ten years. Already, however, there is discussion about enhancing its capabilities \u2013 and perhaps expanding it to capture more neutrinos. Basic science done in facilities like IceCube is really all about human curiosity \u2013 which often ends up having a more practical benefit. \u201cBasic science is not always about finding a cure for cancer,\u201d Taboada said. \u201cBut if you look at the last 400 years of basic scientific discovery, research and basic science have time and again resulted in a better life for humans. Satisfying that human curiosity often turns out to be a very long-term, very high-risk and very high payoff investment. That\u2019s a basic reason to do science.\u201d Research News Georgia Institute of Technology 177 North Avenue Atlanta, Georgia\u00a0 30332-0181\u00a0 USA \u00a0 Media Relations Contacts : John Toon ( jtoon@gatech.edu )(404-894-6986) or Brett Israel ( brett.israel@comm.gatech.edu )(404-385-1933).
