This site will be the first at Tech to be devoted to the Divine Nine as a whole and will join campuses all over the county that have installed plots to celebrate the Divine Nine in celebration of their communities, students, and alumni.\n\u201cI\u2019m exceedingly proud of our students and alumni for leading this charge from the beginning,\u201d said President \u00c1ngel Cabrera at the groundbreaking. \u201cAnd I\u2019m excited to see all the ways this new space will prove to be a boon and a blessing to our campus community for future generations of Yellow Jackets.\u201d\nThe nine member organizations of the NPHC are Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity Inc., Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity, Omega Psi Phi Fraternity, Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity, Zeta Phi Beta Sorority, Sigma Gamma Rho Sorority, and Iota Phi Theta Fraternity.\n\u201cThis plaza and the Divine Nine plots sit along our recently established experiential pathway \u2014 which was designed to recognize student contributions, service, and leadership,\u201d Luoluo Hong, vice president for Student Engagement and Well-Being, said. \u201cAs such, it is an ideal location to highlight the activism and advocacy, the history and traditions, as well as the culture and community that are the legacies of these foundational NHPC organizations.\u201d\nThe plaza will feature nine plots representing organizations in the NPHC and an amphitheater for events and performances. The Divine Nine Plaza will offer an opportunity for NPHC organizations to gather and foster community engagement and programming.\u202fIt is scheduled to open in Fall 2023.\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nDivine Nine Plaza\nContact\nSara Warner\nStudent Engagement & Well-Being\nsara.warner@gatech.edu\nEmail\nsara.warner@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
