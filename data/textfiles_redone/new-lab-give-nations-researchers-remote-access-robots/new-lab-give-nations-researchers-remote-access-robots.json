Researchers from other universities, as well as middle and high school students, will schedule experiments, upload their own programming code, watch the robots in real-time via streamed video feeds and receive scientific data demonstrating the results. The \u201cRobotarium\u201d is expected to house up to 100 ground and aerial swarm robots. No other university has a similar facility. \u201cBuilding and maintaining a world-class, multi-robot lab is too expensive for a large number of roboticists and budding roboticists. This creates a steep barrier to entry into our field,\u201d said Magnus Egerstedt, Schlumberger Professor in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE). \u201cWe need to provide more access to more people in order to continue creating robot-assisted technologies. The Robotarium will allow that.\u201d Egerstedt will lead the project, which includes several Georgia Tech faculty members who will also have access to the facility for their own multidisciplinary experiments and curriculum. The team has already created a mini-version of the Robotarium. Georgia Tech graduate students used it to complete their robotics projects. Researchers from the University of California, San Diego, successfully uploaded code during a recent test session. Access is only one goal of the project. \u00a0 \u201cA research instrument like the Robotarium has the potential to build stronger networks of collaborative research, making the whole significantly larger than the sum of its parts,\u201d he said. \u201cThe end result has the potential to show how remote access instruments can be structured in other areas beyond robotics.\u201d The National Science Foundation is helping to fund the project with two grants totaling $2.5 million. Georgia Tech will transform an existing classroom into the new lab. Georgia Tech will use the other award to help create safe and secure open-access systems for the remote lab. \u201cThe first thing that\u2019s going to happen when you open it to the public is someone is going to try to break it,\u201d said Aaron Ames, an associate professor in the Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering and ECE who\u2019s involved in the project. Ames has already developed an algorithm to prevent robots from colliding with each other. The Robotarium is expected to be fully operational in 2017. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a room where robots are always roaming around,\u201d said Egerstedt. \u201cGeorgia Tech students will be able to hang out and watch research that is happening across the country and beyond.\u201d This research is supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF) through grant numbers ECCS-1531195 and CNS 1544332.
