This opened the door for Georgia Tech leadership to prioritize areas of investment and finalize allocations for the upcoming fiscal year.\nOverall, the USG\u2019s FY24 budget included a $66 million decrease in state funding which will affect teaching budgets across the state.\u202fGeorgia Tech\u2019s portion of the decrease is roughly $10 million, which was based on its share of state appropriations among the 26 USG institutions.\nAdditionally, the BOR is maintaining tuition and mandatory student fees at current levels for most USG institutions, including Georgia Tech, in the 2023-24 academic year.\nIn light of limited new funding, Georgia Tech leadership, along with the Administration and Finance Dean\u2019s Council, Budget Advisory Committee, and Institute Budget Planning and Administration, has worked to ensure that funds are conservatively and strategically allocated.\n\u201cNow more than ever, it is important for us to demonstrate our commitment to financial stewardship, ensuring that every dollar is spent in a timely manner and invested to support our students, mission, and strategic plan,\u201d said Jim Fortner, vice president for Finance and Planning and interim chief financial officer. \u201cWe prioritized our allocations to enable us to continue to advance our instructional, research, and service missions, and prioritize our people, growth, and performance.\u201d\nThe following Q&A with Jamie Fernandes, executive director for Institute Budget Planning and Administration, provides additional details on the FY24 budget, including revenue sources, where funds are being allocated, and how leadership prioritized allocations.\nHow will state earnings and increased tuition revenue affect Georgia Tech?\nWe are grateful to the BOR and the state for our formula earnings, which generated an additional $21.3 million for FY24. In addition to these formula earnings, we project a $7.9 million increase in tuition revenue associated with enrollment growth and $3 million growth in our indirect cost recoveries. \u00a0With this growth, we did not have to consider a budget reduction in FY24, and we were able to allocate funds for the Institute\u2019s highest priorities.\nWhat are some of the key campus allocations for FY24?\nThey are focused on\u202fthree\u202fprimary\u202fareas: people,\u202fgrowth,\u202fand\u202fperformance.\nSupporting Students, Faculty, and Staff\u202f($17.6M)\n$13.1 million to assist with cost-of-living adjustment funding.\n$3.9 million for faculty and staff retention and compression, strategic hires, and faculty promotion and tenure.\n$670,000 to subsidize graduate student's\u2019 health insurance.\nFacilitating Growth\u202f($13.8M)\n$5.1 million to support instruction, including new tenure and non-tenure track faculty lines.\n$5.6 million to support faculty research and related indirect cost expenses.\n$1.7 million to support previous growth in class sizes and course sections.\n$1.4 million for Development initiatives.\nImproving Performance and Reinforcing Compliance\u202f($2.2M)\n$1.4 million for facility contract increases and Maintenance and Operations expenditures.\n$800,000 for memberships, background checks, and other compliance activities.\nWhat were the determining factors in how allocations were prioritized once the budget was approved?\nThe limited new funds available required careful prioritization by leadership. We worked with our\nbudget governance committees\nto prioritize planned expenditures to enable us to continue to advance our instructional, research, and service missions.\nAdditional information on the FY24 budget, including allocations, will be provided as it becomes available.\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nbudget governance committees\nContact\nIndia Maul\nCommunications Program Manager | Institute Communications\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nindia.maul@gatech.edu | comm.gatech.edu | gatech.edu\nEmail\nindia.maul@gatech.edu\nAdditional information\nView the presentation of the FY24 budget (begins at the 23:16 time stamp) delivered during the June A&F Town Hall at\u00a0 af.gatech.edu/af-townhalls .\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
