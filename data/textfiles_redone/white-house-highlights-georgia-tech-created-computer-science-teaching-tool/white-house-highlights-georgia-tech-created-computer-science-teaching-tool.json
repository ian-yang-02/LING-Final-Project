Using a digital audio workstation, students write code to create and remix music in popular styles such as hip hop and dubstep.\nThe software has been used by more than 75,000 students in all 50 states and more than 100 countries since launching in 2013. It is freely accessible to all teachers and students. Georgia Tech researchers created the program to address the national need to make major strides in computer programming literacy for K-12 students, especially among underserved populations.\n\u201cStudents who study with EarSketch have been shown to make progress in both content knowledge and attitudes toward computer science,\u201d said co-creator Jason Freeman, a professor of music in the College of Design. \u201cEarSketch is especially effective at engaging female students in computing, whose gains in computing engagement in our research can be two or three times higher than their male peers.\u201d\nEarSketch will train 50 K-12 teachers in computer science principles this summer through in-person workshops and online training.\nFreeman co-directs EarSketch with Brian Magerko, an associate professor in the Ivan Allen College School of Literature, Media, and Communication,\u00a0in collaboration with Georgia Tech\u2019s Center for Education Integrating Science, Mathematics, and Computing (CEISMC) and the Institute for Computing Education. EarSketch is supported by the National Science Foundation, Arthur M. Blank Family Foundation, Scott Hudgens Family Foundation and Google.\nThis morning\u2019s White House fact sheet kicks off CSEdWeek and highlights new actions of support for computer science education. President Barack Obama challenged the nation to create opportunities for every child to learn computer science during February\u2019s State of the Union Address.\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nWhite House Fact Sheet\nBrian Magerko Biography\nJason Freeman Biography\nEarSketch\nContact\nJason Maderer\nNational Media Relations\nmaderer@gatech.edu\n404-660-2926\nEmail\nmaderer@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
