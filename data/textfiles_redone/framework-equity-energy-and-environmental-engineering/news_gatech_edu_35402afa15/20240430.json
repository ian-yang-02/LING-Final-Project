The assistant professor in Georgia Tech\u2019s\nSchool of Civil and Environmental Engineering\nlooks at food intake across a number of groups, including socioeconomic status, race, and age. Using that data, he\u2019s able to create models that better inform communities and assist policy makers.\nHowever, the most consistent, thorough data he uses to develop those models are from 2005-2010. Five-year datasets before and after that timeframe aren\u2019t standardized, as all sociodemographic groups are not included. This makes it difficult for Bozeman to draw comparisons that are inclusive of everyone across spatial scales and time periods.\nIt\u2019s one reason why he and researchers at Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Colorado Denver have\npublished a framework and 10-step process\nto help engineers, scientists, and community members standardize their data related to energy and environmental topics. Their goal is to integrate equity into these fields, a practice Bozeman and his colleagues call systemic equity. By doing so, they hope to create a system that all demographics of groups are included, including age groups, income levels, race, and ethnicity.
