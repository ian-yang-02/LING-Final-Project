But, is it correct to assume that a person\u2019s face is an accurate indicator of what\u2019s happening inside?\n\u201cA lot of times, people are not aware of what their face is presenting,\u201d said LaTrese Ferguson, manager of\nWorkplace Learning and Professional Development\nin Tech\u2019s Office of\nHuman Resources . \u201cReading a person\u2019s facial expression becomes problematic if someone misinterprets what they see.\u201d\nFerguson recalled feedback she received from a former manager when a colleague thought Ferguson was disengaged during a meeting.\n\u201cMy manager said to me, \u2018I know you well enough to know you\u2019re not disengaged. I know that when you have a certain look on your face that you are processing information in the moment,\u2019\u201d Ferguson said. Her manager understood that Ferguson was actively engaged, but, because she was deep in thought, it looked as if she was disengaged.\nSo, is there a way to control your facial expressions and avoid misinterpretation?\n\u201cExpressions are driven by many factors: culture, gender, class, education, among others,\u201d said Karen Head, executive director of the\nNaugle Communication Center\n(CommLab) and associate professor and associate chair of the School of Literature, Media, and Communication.\n\u201cOne of the things we always focus on with students in the CommLab is understanding your audience\u2019s expectations in order to prevent misunderstandings. That is to say, your preparations must engage two aspects: understanding yourself as a speaker and understanding your audience\u2019s likely reception of your nonverbal actions,\u201d said Head.\nShe said that for presentations, the responsibility for nonverbal cues is always on the presenter. But, in everyday, informal communication, there is more of a balance of responsibility.\n\u201cEach side should (although doesn\u2019t always) take some responsibility for considering how they might be misinterpreting nonverbal signals,\u201d said Head.\nFerguson agrees.\n\u201cIt would be nice if everyone would lead with good intent, ask questions, and gain clarification. But that doesn\u2019t always happen,\u201d Ferguson said.\n\u201cTypically, humans go toward negative thinking, particularly when you don\u2019t ask questions or try to get beneath the surface. So, if I see someone with a blank facial expression, I will just ask what\u2019s going on or ask if I said something that offended them,\u201d she said.\n\u201cWe have this international campus with all types of people misreading each other. The danger is that when you don\u2019t gain clarification, you are carrying your own biased way of thinking. Sometimes, it can cause unnecessary conflict,\u201d Ferguson said.\nOther factors that can lead to confusion or conflict include how introverts and extroverts may communicate differently. There is also the problem of gender bias in communication, with one example being a derogatory term used to describe some women\u2019s normal, non-reactive expressions \u2014 frequently abbreviated as \u201cRBF\u201d \u2014 as unpleasant or even angry. And women with a somber expression might sometimes be instructed \u2014 even by strangers \u2014 to \u201csmile more,\u201d whereas men who display somber expressions are usually perceived with more gravitas.\n\u201cThese are the faces that our parents gave us,\u201d Ferguson said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing I can do to change my face.\n\u201cEven when you have a pleasant resting facial expression, people may ask \u2018Why are you so happy?\u2019 You have to find a happy medium, and I don\u2019t know where it is,\u201d she said.\nFerguson said she is glad her former supervisor brought the comments to her attention. It made her aware of a situation that she did not know existed, and it allowed her to think about how \u2014 or if she wanted to change it.\nFor those who think people are misinterpreting their facial expression, Ferguson has some suggestions.\nFirst, acknowledge that your face may be saying something very different from what you are thinking or feeling. Second, decide if you will accept the situation as it is, or if you want to change it. Third, if you decide you want to change the response you are getting from others, you should over-communicate your thoughts (instead of leaving it up to someone else\u2019s interpretation), and build relationships so that coworkers will better understand your demeanor or feel comfortable asking you questions instead of making inaccurate assumptions.\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nInterruptions podcast: What's My Face Telling You?\nContact\nVictor Rogers\nInstitute Communications\nEmail\nvictor.rogers@comm.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
