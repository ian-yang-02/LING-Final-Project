This announcement comes on the heels of\nDaren Hubbard\u2019s appointment\nto interim executive vice president for Administration and Finance and interim chief business officer.\nHowell will begin his new role on June 20. Both Hubbard and Howell will serve in interim roles until the permanent position of executive vice president for Administration and Finance is appointed. Howell will join the president\u2019s cabinet and continue to serve in his current role as CISO.\n\u201cHaving recently accepted my interim appointment and the responsibilities that come with leading A&F\u2019s robust portfolio, it became clear that we needed leadership at the helm of the Office of Information Technology (OIT) to help ensure business continuity,\u201d said Hubbard. \u201cLeo has been instrumental in leading efforts across the campus community to develop comprehensive solutions to Georgia Tech\u2019s cybersecurity risks. I have full confidence in his ability to lead the team during this transitional period.\u201d\nHowell joined Georgia Tech in October 2021 , reporting directly to Hubbard as the chief information security officer. In this role, he leads the development and implementation of an Institute-wide information security and risk management program. As a member of the senior leadership team in OIT, he is responsible for creating and maintaining a cybersecurity program and leading the cybersecurity team, which manages the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of Institute information assets and cybersecurity related compliance.\n\u201cIt is a privilege to step into this role for OIT as part of the leadership transitional plan,\u201d said Howell. \u201cI look forward to working with my colleagues to further support the Institute\u2019s instructional, research, and service missions.\u201d\nThe search for the next executive vice president for A&F is in progress, and more information will be shared as soon as it is available.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nRachael\u00a0Pocklington\n- Institute Communications\nEmail\nrpocklington@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
