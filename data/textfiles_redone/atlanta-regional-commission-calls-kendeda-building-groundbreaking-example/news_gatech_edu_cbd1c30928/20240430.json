The honor recognizes projects and places every year that are improving the quality of life for residents.\n\u201cThe building exemplifies the sustainability and exceptional design goals in the Atlanta Region\u2019s Plan,\u201d said Shan Arora, Kendeda Building director, referring to metro Atlanta\u2019s long-range, comprehensive blueprint. \u201cIt is a tangible example that can show others how to also advance those goals across the region.\u201d\nMade possible by a grant from\nThe Kendeda Fund , the building was designed and constructed to achieve\nLiving Building Challenge 3.1 certification \u00a0\u2014 meaning that it gives back more to the environment than it takes through its construction and operation. The building is designed to annually collect more water and energy than it consumes, and it diverted nearly all construction waste from landfills and repurposed salvaged materials. It also largely eliminated materials containing 22 chemicals known to harm people or the environment.\nArora said the building\u2019s water system and materials features, in particular, are important to the Atlanta region\u2019s future.\n\u201cAside from its first-in-the-state commercial system to turn rainwater into drinkable water, the building manages its greywater and biowaste on site without adding burden to the region\u2019s already stressed wastewater infrastructure,\u201d he said.\nThe regional commission cited The Kendeda Building\u2019s makerspace, edible landscape, public art, and outdoor spaces as other features worthy of distinction and praised the project for developing new best practices in high performance construction.\n\u201cWe are deeply honored to be recognized by the Atlanta Regional Commission,\u201d said Jim Fortner, interim executive vice president for Administration and Finance. \u201cWe have learned much through the design and construction of this amazing project. We want this building to be a catalyst for innovative design and performance, and this award helps us share those lessons across the region.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nKendeda Building for Innovative Sustainable Design\nAtlanta Regional Commission Development of Excellence Award\nThe Kendeda Fund\nLiving Building Challenge\nContact\nJoshua Stewart\n404.894.6016\nEmail\njstewart@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
