However, the aged system is experiencing operational issues that, if not addressed, could lead to a potential unplanned outage for the entire campus and significantly affect Institute operations.\nTo implement operational resiliency for the entire campus, beginning in mid-December, the chilled water system valves will be replaced, or new ones installed, in a phased approach. This planned outage will allow technicians in the future to shut off the valves to isolate problem areas and service sections of the campus chilled water infrastructure with fewer interruptions to the entire system.\n\u201cCurrently, technicians cannot isolate an active leak in the oldest section of the distribution system, placing the Institute at risk for a much broader chilled water outage,\u201d said Greg Spiro, interim executive director for Infrastructure.\nWithout an operational chilled water system, campus buildings cannot be cooled, causing discomfort for building occupants, especially in the warm weather months. More importantly, lack of cooling would affect the Institute\u2019s research and academic mission since much of the work conducted and equipment used in laboratories and data storage must be temperature controlled throughout the year.\nTeams from Infrastructure and Sustainability and the Office of Emergency Management are working directly with building managers across campus to identify any areas of concern. Each building manager should have previously completed a Continuation of Operations Plan with the Georgia Tech Office of Emergency Management. These plans are critically important to ensure each building has an individual who knows what to do in an unplanned outage.\nBuilding lists and a color-coded map of the phased outage plan (see image) have been shared with building managers. Communication with building managers about the project's progress will be ongoing throughout the improvement period, Dec. 16 \u2013 28.\nBuildings in red: Outage planned Dec. 16 \u2013\u00a028.\nBuildings in yellow: Outage planned Dec. 16 \u2013\u00a023.\nBuildings in purple: Outage planned Dec. 22 \u2013\u00a028.\nBuildings in blue: No outage planned for this year. More information will be provided as soon as it is available.\nView the building listings with planned outage dates\nhere .\nRelated links\nChilled Water Outage Building Listing with Dates\nContact\nCathy Brim\nCommunications Officer\nInstitute Communications\nEmail\ncathy.brim@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
