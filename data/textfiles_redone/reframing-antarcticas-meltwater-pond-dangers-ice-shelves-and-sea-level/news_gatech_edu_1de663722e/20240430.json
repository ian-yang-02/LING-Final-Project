Though pooled meltwater does fracture ice, ensuing chain reactions appear short-ranged.\nStill, massive increases in surface melting due to unusually warm weather can trigger catastrophic ice shelf collapses like that of the\u00a0 iconic shelf \u201cLarsen B,\u201d which shattered in 2002 . Now, a study led by a researcher at the Georgia Institute of Technology has modeled fracture chain reactions and how much water it would take for a repeat of that rare, epic collapse.\nLarsen B\u2019s disintegration was preceded by an atypical heatwave that riddled it with meltwater ponds, focusing researchers\u2019 attention on pond fracturing, also called hydrofracturing. They discovered that a melt pond hydrofracturing the ice shelf can prompt neighboring ponds to do the same. Concerns grew of possible extensive chain reactions, which the new study addressed.\nToo much meltwater\n\u201cThe chain reactions will not spread that far on the ice shelf,\u201d said Alex Robel,\u00a0 an assistant professor in Georgia Tech\u2019s School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences . \u201cNormally, it would take many years for the chain reactions to have an effect on the integrity of the ice shelves. But there\u2019s a caveat. Ponds that are close together and growing rapidly deeper could destroy the ice\u2019s integrity.\u201d\n\u201cThere is a speed limit in the study that shows that an ice shelf can\u2019t collapse ridiculously fast,\u201d said co-author Alison Banwell, a\u00a0 glaciology researcher at the University of Colorado Boulder . \u201cHowever, if it becomes as covered in meltwater ponds very quickly like Larsen B was, it can collapse in a similar way.\u201d She added, \u201cMultiple hydrofracture chains originating in different areas of an ice shelf could also lead to a larger-scale ice shelf breakup.\u201d\nThe researchers\u00a0 published their results in the journal\u00a0 Geophysical Research Letters \u00a0on October 24, 2019. The research was funded by the National Science Foundation and the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences at CU Boulder. An unrelated,\u00a0 recent study \u00a0reported a record number of meltwater ponds on Antarctica.\n\u201cCurrently there are not nearly enough ponds on any ice shelf for a repeat of Larsen B, but much meltwater is weighing on ice shelves and contributing damage to them,\u201d said Banwell, who helped pioneer hydrofracture research on ice shelves.\nQ&A\nBroken ice shelves themselves don\u2019t add much to sea level. So, why care?\nIce shelves float in the ocean, where they already contribute to sea level, so when they break up or melt, they don\u2019t add much more to it. But many ice shelves push back against glaciers on land that do drive up sea level when they enter the ocean.\nWith the shelf gone, the speed of glacial flow can jump four- to tenfold. Glaciologists were not aware of this until Larsen B, which was a kilometer (0.62 miles) thick with a surface of 3,250 square km (1,250 square miles), splintered within weeks, and glacial flow behind it surged.\n\u201cOur research field thought ice shelves weren\u2019t too important, then Larsen B showed us that was incorrect. Buttressing by ice shelves really is the thing that stabilizes the glaciers. Few issues are more significant than those that this study addresses,\u201d said Brent Minchew, an\u00a0 assistant professor of geophysics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology .\nMinchew was not involved in the study but recently co-published another study that relates to it. The MIT study rules out one absolutely nightmarish scenario of rapid glacier fracture due to the disappearance of ice shelves. But he and the other researchers reiterated that glacial flow nonetheless speeds up strikingly when ice shelves disappear.\nAlso, most Antarctic ice shelves probably formed in the last ice age, and it could take another ice age to replace them.\n[Ready for graduate school?\u00a0 Here's how to apply to Georgia Tech. ]\nHow does hydrofracturing work, and how did the study model its effects?\nWhen meltwater ponds on top of cracks in the ice grow heavy, they can hydrofracture the ice.\n\u201cThe water pressure concentrates down to a point called a crack tip. It tries to push the crack apart and make it deeper, and the ice pushes back. When the water gets deep enough, it can win out and propagate the crack to the bottom of the ice shelf,\u201d Robel said.\nThe water drains down the crack, into the ocean, then the ice hops back up, making new cracks that can trigger neighboring ponds to hydrofracture, too. The study showed that this would encompass only small numbers of ponds.\nConveniently for Robel, who explores ice dynamics with math, physics, and computer science, as ice shelves form, regimented matrices of surface dents appear in them, and that\u2019s where the ponds collect.\nRobel could apply computer science modeling called\u00a0 cellular automata \u00a0\u2013 known from pixelated matrix-like\u00a0 video games \u00a0\u2013 to model hydrofracture chain reactions. The model even outputs animations that the researchers named \u201cminesweeper plots\u201d after the\u00a0 classic 1990s computer game .\nDoes the study mean there is less danger than before of glacial flow accelerating?\nNo, the study simply adds to scientific knowledge, and actually, the flow of some glaciers on Antarctica has already sped up a lot.\n\u201cMaybe this mechanism is not something we have to worry as much about. But we shouldn\u2019t breathe a sigh of relief because there are plenty of other ways of getting a whole lot of ice out of West Antarctica quickly,\u201d Minchew said.\nPerhaps the greatest potential for glacier loss is instability where glaciers rest on the ground next to seawater. A\u00a0 study Robel published in July \u00a0projected that instability to be extremely likely to accelerate sea level rise.\nHow does this study help advance glacier research?\nIt makes it easier to look for harbingers of ice shelf damage.\n\u201cLooking at the volume of water on the surface of the ice is much easier than looking for stress failures within the ice,\u201d said Banwell, who will visit Antarctica in November to study melt ponds on the George IV ice shelf.\nAlso READ:\u00a0 Instability in Antarctic Ice Projected to Make Sea Level Rise Rapidly\nThe research was funded by the National Science Foundation (grants\u00a0NSF PLR-1735715 and NSF PLR-1841607) and by the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences at CU Boulder.
