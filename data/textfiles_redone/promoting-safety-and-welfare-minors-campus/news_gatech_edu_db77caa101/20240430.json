A special duty of care and supervision is required to protect Tech\u2019s youngest learners. To help support a safe and engaging environment for all who participate, volunteer, or work in these youth programs, the University System of Georgia (USG) and Georgia Tech require that all programs serving minors be registered at Tech\u2019s Youth Programs website,\nyouthprograms.gatech.edu .\nYouth programs vary, from internships with high school students, to student organization outreach activities, to summer camps and mentoring/tutoring in local schools. Campus and lab tours, and school field trips to the Tech campus, are generally not considered youth programs.\n\u201cThe breadth and depth of youth programs at Georgia Tech are extensive,\u201d said Kelly Cross, Institute policy manager in the Office of Ethics and Compliance. \u201cThrough conversations with program organizers, internship supervisors, building managers, and human resources representatives, it is clear to me that there is a passion for excellence in youth programming and outreach here.\u201d\nAccording to Youth Programs Compliance, the exciting work occurring at Tech also presents unique risks. To help mitigate these risks, Youth Programs has been actively implementing the\nYouth Programs Policy , which mandates program registration, safety protocols, and more to assist everyone involved in working with minors.\nPrograms are required to register every calendar year, at least 30 days in advance of the program start date. Failure to do so may result in the cancellation of programming. By registering, programs that work with minors will proactively receive information on the resources and policies developed for the protection of the minors and the program staff.\nThis spring, online information sessions (see schedule in sidebar) will be conducted to clarify policies, process requirements, and how to register a program. Training will focus on key areas of responsibility for organizers of youth programs broadly, and specific sessions will also focus on requirements when minors want to intern or participate in research activities at Tech.\nVisit Youth Programs\nto learn more and register your program.
