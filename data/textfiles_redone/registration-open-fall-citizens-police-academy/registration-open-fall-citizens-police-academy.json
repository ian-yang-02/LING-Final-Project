The Academy, which is accepting applications for fall, is open to all Tech faculty, staff, and students.\n\u201cIf you have questions about the operations of the department, the type of training the officers receive, the day-to-day function of the department, or if you just want to have a better understanding of law enforcement \u2014 this academy is for you,\u201d said Georgia Tech Sergeant Jessica Howard, Academy coordinator.\nThe training, which begins Oct. 21, includes classes on investigations, the Clery Act, K-9, law enforcement technology, firearms, emergency preparedness, and crime prevention. All classes are held from 5:30 to 7:30 p.m. at the Georgia Tech Police Department on Tech\u2019s campus. The program is free, but participants must commit to attend all sessions.\nClass size is limited. Applicants must submit an online application by Oct. 18 and undergo a limited background investigation.\nHoward believes the Academy helps to develop and foster positive relations between the community and GTPD through education.\n\u201cI believe giving people the opportunity to gain insight into how and why a law enforcement agency operates the way it does \u2014 from administrative positions to the officers in the field \u2014 brings better understanding and, ultimately, long-lasting positive relationships,\u201d Howard said.\nFor schedule details and to register for the Citizens Police Academy, visit\npolice.gatech.edu/citizens-police-academy .\nAdditional Images\nContact\nKristen Bailey\nInstitute Communications\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
