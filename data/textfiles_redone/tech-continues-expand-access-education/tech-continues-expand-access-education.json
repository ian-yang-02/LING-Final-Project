Undergraduate Admission also increased its dual enrollment and transfer enrollment.\n\u201cWe continue to expand access by offering more students from all backgrounds, including students from communities across the state of Georgia, an opportunity to pursue a Georgia Tech degree,\u201d said Rick Clark, director of Undergraduate Admission. The Institute\u2019s recruitment programs are aligned with its strategic plan and values, with students as the top priority. \u201cWith each new class we further strengthen our commitment to inclusive excellence.\u201d\nStudents in the incoming class come from 102 of Georgia\u2019s 159 counties (12% hail from rural areas in the state), from all 50 states, and from 93 countries. The race/ethnicity of incoming students is: 9% Black, 10% Hispanic, 4% multi-racial, 1% unreported, 38% white, and 39% Asian. The combined incoming class of first-year and transfer students includes 14% coming from a household where neither parent graduated from college \u2014 an increase of 80% over the last five years.\nGeorgia Tech\u2019s undergraduate student body increased by 1,200 in the last five years. The number of incoming first-year Black students increased 62%, for first-year Hispanic students it\u2019s a 55%\u00a0increase, and the number of incoming first-year women students increased 25% during that time, with 1,000 more women undergraduates enrolled now than five years ago. For the first time in Institute history women will comprise 40% of this fall\u2019s total undergraduate population.\nBecause of the coronavirus pandemic this year\u2019s recruitment efforts were entirely\nvirtual . Undergraduate Admission held more than 600 virtual programs, and campus partners such as Student Affairs and Housing held additional programming, hosting a total number of 10,500 visitors.\n\u201cThe entire campus really showed up to help meet the Institute\u2019s enrollment goals,\u201d said Clark. \u201cWe had faculty members and deans hosting programs, making calls, and writing to prospective students. It was an inspiring collective effort.\u201d\nNear the end of summer Undergraduate Admission resumed hosting in-person tours of campus.\n\u201cEven though we weren\u2019t hosting formal tours and programs, prospective students and families were still coming to campus for self-guided tours, especially on weekends and during holidays,\u201d Clark said. \u201cPart of expanding access to Georgia Tech includes creating and delivering more accessible information. It is critical we continue developing quality virtual programming so prospective students \u2014 regardless of their socioeconomic background or when they show up to see the campus \u2014 can receive the same information they would get if they had the resources to come at a certain time. I\u2019m really pleased that we are applying the lessons learned and being innovative in our approach.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nContact\nVictor Rogers\nInstitute Communications\nEmail\nvictor.rogers@comm.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
