New research from the Georgia Institute of Technology finds that activity on this forum changes dramatically in the aftermath of celebrity suicides. Instead of reaching out to others for support against suicidal thoughts, Redditors show expressions that indicate increased and explicit suicidal tendencies. Content and participation in the days and weeks after a celebrity\u2019s death are more likely to be angry and more anxious.\n\u201cPeople come to this site with hope to fight thoughts of self-destruction,\u201d said Munmun De Choudhury, a Georgia Tech assistant professor who co-led the study. \u201cThey\u2019re looking for help. But the pleas of support changed to hopelessness and despair.\u201d\nDe Choudhury\u2019s group, which included co-leader Mark Dredze of Johns Hopkins University and Glen Coppersmith from the mental health startup Qntfy, looked at nearly 66,000 posts from 19,000 unique users from October 2013 to December 2014. The researchers noticed how language changed in the weeks before and after 10 celebrity suicides, including the 2014 death of comedian Robin Williams.\nFor example, posts prior to suicides included \u201cmaybe I should just do it\u201d and \u201cI need some help\u2026I feel I\u2019m right on the edge.\u201d Afterward, phrases were often along the lines of \u201cIt will be one more week and I\u2019ll be done\u201d and \u201cI\u2019ll be ending it this weekend.\u201d\n\u201cRedditors tended to be more inwardly focused after celebrity suicide,\u201d said Dredze. \u201cThey wrote less about other people. Posts about family and friends shifted to \u2018I\u2019 and \u2018me.\u2019 We saw more self-disclosure and sadness.\u201d\nThe researchers add that Redditors didn\u2019t go online to talk about the celebrity. They posted about their own life and the potential of ending it.\nThe study mirrors the \u201cWerther effect\u201d \u2013 that there is an increased number of completed or attempted suicides after the media covers a celebrity\u2019s suicide. Studies that focus on the Werther effect focus on people\u2019s concrete actions. The new study uses social media to gain fresh insights about the morale of a community contemplating suicide.\n\u201cWe could explore what they thought and how they felt, that is, markers of suicide ideation,\u201d said De Choudhury, a faculty member in Georgia Tech\u2019s School of Interactive Computing.\nShe and the research group say the findings can be used to offer better online support for psychologically vulnerable populations. For example, the leaders of the sub-Reddit group could prompt more moderators to check the site more frequently after celebrity suicides. Algorithms could be designed to develop risk scores based on language variations before and after a celebrity\u2019s death, then have specialists keep an eye on Redditors most at risk.\nThe current paper, \u201c Detecting Changes in Suicide Content Manifested in Social Media Following Celebrity Suicides ,\u201d was presented in early September at the Proceedings of 26th ACM Conference on Hypertext and Social Media in Cyprus. It builds on De Choudury and her team\u2019s prior social media studies about mothers with postpartum depression. Another of her papers, which monitored Reddit posts to help determine the likelihood that people trying to quit\nwill actually abstain from tobacco and alcohol , will also be presented at the conference in Cyprus.\nThis research was supported by National Institutes of Health grant 1R01GM11269701.
