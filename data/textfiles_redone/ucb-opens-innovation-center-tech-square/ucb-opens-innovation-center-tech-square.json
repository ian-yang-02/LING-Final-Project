The 2,500-square foot innovation center will be located in the Centergy Building at Technology Square, part of Georgia Tech\u2019s innovation neighborhood.\nWith its North America Headquarters in Smyrna, GA, UCB is a global biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of innovative medicines and solutions to treat severe diseases of the immune and central nervous system. As the first pharmaceutical company with an innovation center in Technology Square, UCB will be able to tap into Georgia Tech\u2019s state of the art machine learning and advanced analytics resources to improve patient care as well as the patient experience.\n\u201cEstablishing a presence in Technology Square is a natural extension of our existing relationship with Georgia Tech,\u201d said Jeff Wren, head of UCB\u2019s Neurology Patient Value Unit. \u201cWe are thrilled to join this vibrant innovation community to learn and grow our own capabilities. We are confident that co- location and proximity to the Georgia Tech community will enable us to quickly develop quality solutions that will create real value for the patients we serve.\u201d\nFor the past year, UCB has collaborated with Georgia Tech\u2019s Interoperability & Integration Innovation Lab (I3L) in using predictive analytics to answer the question: how can we better fit medications to patients and positively impact patient care?\n\u201cWe are delighted to welcome UCB as the first pharmaceutical company to join the growing innovation ecosystem in Tech Square,\u201d said Georgia Tech President G. P. \u201cBud\u201d Peterson. \u201cWe have already begun several collaborations with the company, and look forward to future opportunities for Georgia Tech students, faculty, and staff to help develop solutions to positively impact patient care for those living with chronic, severe diseases.\u201d\nUCB expects the space to be used by multiple collaborators from Georgia Tech researchers, faculty and students, to UCB interns and staff from its North America headquarters as well as from its global headquarters in Brussels Belgium.\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nInnovation Ecosystem fueled by Georgia Tech\nContact\nFor more information about the innovation centers in Georgia Tech's Tech Square please contact Greg King,\ngreg.king@gatech.edu\nFor more information about the UCB Solution Accelerator please contact Kristie Madara,\nkristie.madara@ucb.com\nEmail\nlaura.diamond@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
