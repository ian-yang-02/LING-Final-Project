It\u2019s called \u201cMacGyvering,\u201d based off the name of a 1980s \u2014 and recently rebooted \u2014 television series. In the series, the title character is known for his unconventional problem-solving ability using differing resources available to him.\nFor years, computer scientists and others have been working to provide robots with similar capabilities. In their new robot-MacGyvering work, RAIL lab researchers led by Associate Professor\nSonia Chernova\nused as a starting point a robotics technique previously developed by former Georgia Tech Professor\nMike Stilman .\nIn this latest work, a robot trained using the team\u2019s novel approach is given a set of optional parts and told to make a specific tool. Much like its human counterparts, the robot first examines the shapes of each part and how one might be attached to another.\nUsing machine learning, the robot is trained to match form to function \u2013 which object shapes facilitate a particular outcome \u2013 from numerous examples of everyday objects. For example, by learning that the concavity of bowls enables them to hold liquids, it makes use of this knowledge when constructing a spoon. Similarly, the robots were taught how to attach objects together from examples of materials that could be pierced or grasped.\nIn the study, researchers successfully created hammers, spatulas, scoops, squeegees, and screwdrivers.\n\u201cThe screwdriver was particularly interesting because the robot combined pliers and a coin,\u201d said\nLakshmi Nair , a Ph.D. student in the\nSchool of Interactive Computing\nand one of the researchers on the project. \u201cIt reasoned that the pliers were able to grasp something and said that the coin sort of matched the head of a screwdriver. Put them together, and it creates an effective tool.\u201d\nCurrently, the robot is limited only to the shape and attachment. It cannot yet effectively reason about particular material properties, a crucial step in advancing to a real-world scenario.\n[RELATED: Robot Able to Instantly Identify Household Materials Using Near-Infrared Light]\n\u201cPeople reason that hammers are sturdy and strong, so you wouldn\u2019t make a hammer out of foam blocks,\u201d Nair said. \u201cWe want to reach that level of reasoning in our work, which is something we\u2019re working on now.\u201d\nThe inspiration for the work comes from the popular story of Apollo 13, the doomed seventh crewed flight of the Apollo space program. After an oxygen tank in the ship\u2019s service module exploded two days into the mission, crew members were forced to make makeshift modifications to the carbon dioxide removal system.\nDespite a dangerously tight window of time and extremely high tension among all aboard and at mission control, the rescue proved successful. Nair and collaborators hope this research will prove foundational to future robotics technology that could reason faster and without the burden of stress.\n\u201cThey were able to make this filter, but the solution took a long time to come up with,\u201d Nair said. \u201cWe want to make robots that can assist humans in these kinds of scenarios to take the pressure off of them to come up with innovative solutions and potentially save their lives.\u201d\nThis work was presented at the 2019 Robotics: Science and Systems conference in a paper titled\nAutonomous Tool Construction Using Part Shape and Attachment Prediction\n(Lakshmi Nair,\nNithin Shrivatsav ,\nZackory Erickson , Sonia Chernova).
