But\u00a0it's\u00a0a powerful means to a more powerful end, which is about empowering every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. The innovation\u00a0you're\u00a0driving here at Georgia Tech comes at one of the most consequential moments in the history of technology. As we enter this age of artificial intelligence, it's communities like this one that will help create the world we want to live in,\" Nadella said.\nWith over 2,000 Georgia Tech alumni on its staff and a prominent presence in the city of Atlanta, Microsoft recently became the second company in history to surpass a $3 trillion market value. Accepting the degree, Nadella, who became the company's CEO in 2014, spoke of aligning values between Microsoft and Georgia Tech and looking forward to working together to create technologies and solutions for the world's most pressing challenges.\n\"When you talk to Satya, he always leads with the impact that the company is having on people and organizations around the world,\" Georgia Tech President \u00c1ngel Cabrera said during the ceremony. \"That sounds awfully familiar with our mission at Georgia Tech \u2014 to develop leaders who advance technology and improve the human condition. Our motto is progress and service. We define our success by the impact that we have in the lives of others. So, that explains why we're so excited to bring Satya into the family of Yellow Jackets.\"\nA fireside chat between Cabrera and Nadella followed the ceremony. Along with the transformative nature of AI and its ability to improve workflows and productivity in business, Nadella spoke of its potential to bring personalized instruction to students worldwide.\nHe also participated in a roundtable discussion with faculty members about the implementation and impact of AI in higher education, robotics, cybersecurity computing, and other areas.\nAlex Orso , interim dean of the College of Computing, was among the participants and discussed ways to foster the exchange of talent between Georgia Tech and Microsoft. He also discussed how Georgia Tech's\nonline computer science master's program , in collaboration with the Division of Lifetime Learning, can serve as a global platform to educate students before, during, and after college.\nIrfan Essa , senior associate dean in the College of Computing and co-director of Georgia Tech's AI Hub, added that Nadella and the faculty shared ideas for how industry and academia can collaborate to produce a strong workforce in the years to come.\n\"We are a leader in this area and a part of the conversation,\" he said. \"Industry leaders like Microsoft and places like Georgia Tech have to figure out a collaborative system to have more conversations about understanding the future workforce but also learning from companies about what kinds of things we should be providing from a broad standpoint educationally.\"\nNadella then sat down with a group of students, all former Microsoft interns, to discuss their educational experience and what he called a \"paradigm shift\" across the industry,\u00a0similar to\u00a0the rise of the internet and cloud computing.\nRynaa Grover will graduate with a master's degree in computer science in May and has accepted a position with Microsoft. \"The research that goes on at Georgia Tech is very advanced and in line with the industry.\u00a0It's\u00a0incredible to be in this field\u00a0at this point in time\u00a0and to be able to contribute to such a big firm;\u00a0it's\u00a0really empowering,\" said Grover, who worked with Microsoft's machine learning platforms as an intern and with large language models in Assistant Professor\u00a0 Srijan Kumar \u2019s lab.\nYi Qin will also join Microsoft after graduating with a master's in human-computer interaction.\n\"This was such a memorable experience for me,\u201d she said. \u201cConversations like this make me feel like we\u00a0are capable of doing\u00a0a lot of\u00a0great things. We should capture every opportunity that we have, have a growth mindset, and create whatever impact we want to make.\"\nAdditional Media\nContact\nSteven Gagliano\n- Institute Communications\nEmail\nsteven.gagliano@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
