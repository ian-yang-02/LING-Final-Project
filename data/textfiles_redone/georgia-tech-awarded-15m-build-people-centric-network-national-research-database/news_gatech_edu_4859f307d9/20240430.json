With that in mind, the National Science Foundation (NSF) is creating the first-ever\nprototype open knowledge network .\nKnown as Proto-OKN, it will be a free, publicly available, searchable database containing troves of research data from major U.S. government agencies. The project aims to fuel the next data revolution in support of data-centric solutions to societal challenges. A team at the Georgia Institute of Technology is going to help build it.\nWith an award of $1.5 million, the Georgia Tech team will design a layer of the network known as a knowledge graph \u2013 a tool that facilitates data and knowledge sharing using nodes and edges and is similar to a social network. But unlike the other 17 teams working on the NSF effort, Georgia Tech\u2019s contribution will focus on the entity most crucial for scientific breakthroughs: people. One of the team\u2019s primary goals is to raise visibility for researchers often left out of the current research collaboration landscape.\nLew Lefton , emeritus faculty in the\nSchool of Mathematics\nand former associate vice president for Research Computing, will lead the project. The team includes\nKexin Rong , assistant professor in the\nCollege of Computing , and\nDidier Contis ,\u00a0executive\u00a0director of Academic Technology, Innovation, Research Computing in the\u00a0 Office\u00a0of Information Technology . Their knowledge graph will be centered on people, research topics, and organizations with a focus on elevating researchers at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs).\n\u201cResearch collaborations are driven by people making connections, but how do you connect to other researchers if you don\u2019t know who they are?\u201d Lefton said. \u201cCurrent tools or search engines are biased to showing people with the most funding and prestige. Our tool will identify potential collaborators who have similar research interests but who may not be as well-known.\u201d\nMost tools and databases on research activity start with data from the top R1 institutions where the most federal funding is concentrated. Lefton\u2019s team will instead build the network starting with data from researchers at HBCUs and MSIs. While often doing cutting-edge research like their counterparts at institutes like Georgia Tech and MIT, these researchers face challenges in finding collaborators and securing federal funding due to heavy teaching loads and a lack of internal research support infrastructure.\n\u201cIn talking to our partners, we found that their biggest challenges are not in researching the state of the field or doing a literature review \u2013 the biggest challenge is finding collaborators,\u201d Rong said.\nUsing a human-centered design approach, the Georgia Tech team will incorporate open data sources and infrastructures to create a tool to help researchers at these institutions find collaborators. The team will work with colleagues at HBCUs \u2013 Fisk University, Texas Southern University, Morehouse College, and the University at Buffalo \u2013 to both build the network and do iterative design based on that target audience's needs. In the design process, they will work together to identify gaps to make sure researchers are sufficiently represented.\nThe team will advance and refine state-of-the-art algorithms and machine learning models that take in research journal articles, conference proceedings, preprints, patents, and theses, and extract who worked on them and what topics they cover.\nThe team will also use the award to expand and launch CollabNext, a proof-of-concept tool created at Georgia Tech that helps HBCU and Georgia Tech researchers connect. The\nCollabNext portal\nwill serve as the front-end interface for the team\u2019s knowledge graph.\n\u201cThe current research collaboration landscape leans toward \u2018winner takes all,\u2019 and because extremely successful researchers are more visible, they become even more successful,\u201d Rong said. \u201cWith this project, we want to give talented researchers more visibility, which will hopefully increase their chances of success.\u201d\nGeorgia Tech is particularly invested in expanding research collaborations with HBCUs and has undertaken several\ninitiatives towards that effort . The team hopes the tool will make it easier for both researchers at HBCUs and MSIs to find collaborators and researchers at other universities to find collaborators at HBCUs and MSIs.\nIt is statistically impossible to know who or where the next big scientific breakthrough will come from, Lefton said. It could be from a researcher who is not well known but who happened to have the right idea at the right time. But with money and influence concentrated in specific places, it is all too easy to not notice a great new idea.\n\u201cAs a society we are facing difficult and complex challenges,\u201d Lefton said. \u201cIn my opinion, the best approach to solving these problems is to consider many different perspectives and ideas, and that means we need everyone at the table.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nContact\nCatherine Barzler, Senior Research Writer/Editor\ncatherine.barzler@gatech.edu\nEmail\ncatherine.barzler@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
