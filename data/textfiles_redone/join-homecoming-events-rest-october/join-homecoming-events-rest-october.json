As the weather begins to cool down and the leaves start changing color, many Georgia Tech organizations such as the\nStudent Center Programs Council (SCPC)\nand\nRamblin\u2019 Reck Club\nare working tirelessly to make the next two weeks unforgettable.\nThe theme this year is \u201cBuzzing Into Fall,\u201d and, with that, there are events ranging from a scavenger hunt to a banner competition. For a full listing of events, you can consult this\nguidebook .\nHowever, there are a few main staples to look out for this week.\nThe first major event is the\nHomecoming Carnival .\nThis will be Tuesday, Oct. 26, from noon to 3 p.m. on Tech Green. There are many reasons to come out, whether it be the fall foods of apple cider and caramel apples or the games of human foosball and axe throwing.\nThe\nMini 500\nhas been a tradition since 1969 where students use tiny tricycles to race around Peters Parking Deck. With four racers and a pit crew, this event is an intense competition. Although the period to sign up has passed, this is a great event to watch the night before the game on Friday, Oct. 29, at 5:30 p.m.\nThe\nFreshman Cake Race ,\nWreck Parade , and\nHomecoming football game\nall take place on Saturday, Oct. 30. The\nFreshman Cake Race\nis a century-old tradition among first years. While this began as a way to recruit for the school track team, it has since become an open race to get first-year students in the Homecoming spirit. The race begins at 6:30 a.m. It is a half mile long, beginning at Sixth and Fowler Streets. All participants get a free cupcake, and the male and female winners get a whole cake as well as halftime congratulations from Mr. and Ms. Georgia Tech.\nThe last event before the game is the\nWreck Parade ,\nwhich begins at 8 a.m. This event shows off three types of vehicles. Classic cars are over 25 years old and retain the spirit of the Wreck itself. Fixed bodies are built by students and based on the Homecoming theme. Contraptions are completely human-powered with the Homecoming theme in mind. All along Fowler Street, students will be able to watch the vehicles as they drive by.\nAll of these events culminate with the Homecoming football game against Virginia Tech. The kickoff time will be announced closer to the game.\nThe\nAlumni Association\nalso hosts a slate of events that share the history and traditions of Georgia Tech and offer opportunities for those who \u201ccome home\u201d to connect with each other. Students are welcome to also attend these spirit-focused events.\nLearn more and register for events .\nHomecoming Event Highlights:\nPie Up the Competition\nMonday, Oct. 25\n4 p.m.\nMidtown II, Exhibition Hall\nHomecoming Carnival\nTuesday, Oct. 26\nNoon \u2013 3 p.m.\nTech Green\nFoosball Frenzy\nWednesday, Oct. 27\n11 a.m.\nMidtown V, Exhibition Hall\nMock Rock\nWednesday, Oct. 27\n7 p.m.\nFerst Center for the Arts\nPomp Displays\nThursday, Oct. 28\nNoon \u2013 5 p.m.\nLocations across campus\nMini 500\nFriday, Oct. 29\n5:30 p.m.\nPeters Parking Deck\nFreshman Cake Race\nSaturday, Oct. 30\n6:30 a.m.\n6th and Fowler Streets\nWreck Parade\nSaturday, Oct. 30\n8 \u2013 9:30 a.m.\nFowler Street\nFootball Game\nSaturday, Oct. 30\nNoon\nBobby Dodd Stadium\nAdditional Images\nContact\nConnor White\nInstitute Communications\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
