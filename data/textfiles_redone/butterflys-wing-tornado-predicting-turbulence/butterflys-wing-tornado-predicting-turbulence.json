Though chaos theory says it\u2019s basically impossible to compute exactly how that might happen, Georgia Tech scientists are making new advances in getting math around the swirly phenomenon behind it called turbulence.\nRecent progress by physicists from the Georgia Institute of Technology could one day help sharpen weather forecasts and extend their range by making better use of masses of weather and climate data.\nTurbulence can curve as a puff of air, swirl past a river bend or churn as a hurricane, and though its curlicues may appear random, turbulence lays down signature patterns that the physicists are investigating.\u00a0 They have developed a simple mathematical model that has helped them show how turbulent flows will evolve over intervals .\nAnd, in a novel experiment, they verified their predictions physically in a two-dimensional turbulent flow produced in a lab.\n\u2018Butterfly Effect\u2019 catchphrase\nThe new Georgia Tech research befits the origins of that adage.\nIt was coined more than 55 years ago by\u00a0 MIT meteorology professor Edward Lorenz \u00a0after he established that tiny forces influenced major weather enough to throw long-range forecasts for a loop. The title of his paper, \u201cPredictability: Does the Flap of a Butterfly\u2019s Wing in Brazil Set Off a Tornado in Texas?\u201d morphed into the well-known catchphrase.\nMichael Schatz \u00a0and\u00a0 Roman Grigoriev , \u00a0professors in Georgia Tech\u2019s\u00a0 School of Physics , along with graduate researchers Balachandra Suri and Jeffrey Tithof, published their research results online in the journal\u00a0 Physical Review Letters \u00a0on Wednesday March 15, 2017 . The research was funded by the National Science Foundation.\nOrder in chaos\nFor hundreds of years, while scientists used math to get a grip on\u00a0 Newton\u2019s falling apple , substantiate the\u00a0 Theory of Relativity \u00a0and theorize the existence of\u00a0 the Higgs boson , turbulence has been like wet soap in math\u2019s grasp. But for all its elusiveness, turbulence impresses with visibly coherent, recurring, recognizable shapes.\nFluid swirls quickly establish themselves then shift or disappear, but they reappear persistently at different locations, producing transient and varying, yet repeating patterns.\n\u201cPeople have seen these patterns in turbulent flows for centuries, but we\u2019re finding ways to relate the patterns to mathematical equations describing fluid flows,\u201d Grigoriev said. Some recurrent patterns, in particular, interest Grigoriev and Schatz. They\u2019re called\u00a0 exact coherent structures (ECSs).\nThey give the physicists convenient entry points into computing predictions about what turbulence will do next.\nTurbulent flow snapshots\nBut what are these\u00a0 exact coherent structures ? Visually, in turbulence, they may show up as fleeting moments when the patterns stop changing. And it can look like the flow is temporarily slowing down.\nTo the untrained eye, an ECS doesn\u2019t look much different from the rest of the swirls and curls, but one can learn to spot them. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly how we go about finding them,\u201d Schatz said. \u201cWe watch the turbulence, continually taking snapshots. The flow is moving around, moving around. We look for the instant when it slows down the most, and we pick out a snapshot.\u201d\n\u201cWe feed that into the mathematical model,\u201d Schatz said, \u201cand it indicates that we\u2019re close, and shows what the math looks like at that point.\u201d That math solution describes a point in the turbulent flow that can be worked with to compute a prediction of what the turbulence will do next.\nTo understand what an\u00a0 exact coherent structure \u00a0is dynamically, we need to step back from what turbulence looks like visually with bunches of curls and swirls. Instead, let\u2019s look at a turbulent flow as a single physical entity by translating it into a crude metaphor, a swinging pendulum -- with some marked oddities.\nPendulum on its head\nThis is going to get a bit abstract: First,\u00a0 invert the pendulum .\nInstead of picturing the bottom point of a normal pendulum\u2019s swing, the equilibrium, as a stable point in a stable swing, now, with the upside-down pendulum, the equilibrium is the top-most point. And it\u2019s unstable. Also, it doesn\u2019t swing in just two directions but in all directions.\nA turbulent flow\u2019s reliable patterns reflect dynamics that are back-and-forth-to-and-fro but in all kinds of variations.\nAs the metaphorical pendulum swings up toward its peak, it comes to a near but never complete stop. Instead it flops over to some other side. That near-halt point is analogous to an\u00a0 exact coherent structure , but there are a few more kinks in the metaphor.\n\u201cIf we change initial dynamics ever so slightly, an inverted pendulum can swing past its\u00a0 unstable equilibrium \u00a0at the peak, or it can stop and then start moving in the opposite direction. In the same way, the turbulent flow can evolve in various different ways after passing by an ECS,\u201d Grigoriev said.\nMultiple\u00a0 exact coherent structures \u00a0with varying qualities turn up in a turbulent flow.\nTurbulence roads to ECS cities\nThat all may feel unusual for a reason.\n\u201cUsually, people like to look at stable things that are unchanging like the even, symmetric normal pendulum,\u201d Schatz said. \u201cIt turns out it\u2019s really these unstable patterns that form a rough core alphabet that we use to build a sort of predictive theory.\u201d\nStaying with the dynamics of that floppy inverted pendulum, now picture each\u00a0 exact coherent structure \u00a0as being a city on a map. There are paths that guide the turbulent flow \u201ctraffic\u201d toward, from, and around each city just like roadways. \u201cThis road map around and between cities does not change in time, which enables us to predict the evolution of the flow,\u201d Grigoriev said.\nECSs occur regularly, almost like clockwork, opening up the possibility of refining predictions at regular intervals.\nExact coherent structures \u00a0were already known to exist, Schatz said. \u201cWhat no one has done before is demonstrate in a lab experiment how they can be harnessed to describe dynamics, the behavior evolving in time, which is really what you need for prediction.\u201d\nMining weather data\nIn the 19 th \u00a0century, math equations were developed to describe the basic flow of fluids. Those who took high school physics may remember\u00a0 Newton\u2019s Second Law \u00a0relating forces, acceleration and mass. The\u00a0 Navier-Stokes equations , \u00a0used in this study, apply it to fluids.\nTurbulence is challenging to describe mathematically because its swirls contain myriad dimensions, with the flow in each small region appearing to dance to its own tune. But there is clear order that emerges upon finding\u00a0 exact coherent structures .\nTo make their predictions, Schatz and Grigoriev\u2019s research team devised a way to mathematically connect that high dimensionality to the much simpler roadway concept.\nThey broke down the turbulent flow into regions, each small enough to apply the equations, then used their solutions to precisely place the flows on the road map.\nToday, the compendium of\u00a0 data on weather and climate , the shape of ocean floors, dimensions of the atmosphere, effects of gravity, rotation, or concentrations of dissolved minerals is impressive and growing.\nPredictive methods like those in this research offer paths into that data to extract better predictions from it.\nThe research was funded by the National Science Foundation under grants\u00a0 CMMI-1234436 and DMS-1125302.
