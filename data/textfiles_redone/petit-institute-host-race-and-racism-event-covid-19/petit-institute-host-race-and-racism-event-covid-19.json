Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering.\nThe conversation will take place Monday, Oct. 19, from 1 to 2 p.m.\nvia Microsoft Teams , with a maximum capacity of 250 attendees, limited to those logged in with a Georgia Tech email address. Attendees will have the chance to ask questions, and a recording will be made available on the\u00a0 Petit website \u00a0following the event.\nIn addition to the many research angles of Covid-19 \u2014 including therapeutics, diagnoses, co-morbidities, public health, public policy, and healthcare systems \u2014 this session will highlight the health disparities associated with Covid-19, providing an additional perspective into this public health crisis.\nThe discussion has been planned and organized by a committee for diversity, equity, and inclusion within the Petit Institute. The group was formed in September following a June town hall and a collective desire within the community to take action following national race-related tragedies.\n\u201cThe goal of our committee\u00a0is to create a safer, more inclusive, and more highly prosperous environment for our historically underrepresented minority faculty, trainees, and staff,\u201d said Ed Botchwey, committee chair and associate professor in the Coulter Department. \u201cWe hope to maintain a focus on anti-racism action within our Institute.\u201d\nIn support of this goal, the group began hosting town halls within the Petit community on ways to think about systemic racism across disciplines.\n\u201cWe must confront the routines, biases, and contradictions that preserve the status quo,\u201d Botchwey said. \u201cThis town hall is a fresh call to antiracist action in the bioengineering and bioscience community. I\u2019m looking forward to our conversation as we look for ways in which all of our members can answer the call.\u201d\nOther committee members include:\nNettie Brown, BME, predoctoral representative\nMar\u00eda Coronel, ME, postdoctoral representative\nAndr\u00e9s Garc\u00eda, ME, Petit Institute executive director\nMilan Riddick, BME, undergraduate representative\nLakeita Servance, Petit Institute, staff representative\nAdditional Images\nContact\nKristen Bailey\nInstitute Communications\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
