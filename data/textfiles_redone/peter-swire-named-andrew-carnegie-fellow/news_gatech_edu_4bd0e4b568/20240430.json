This ties into Swire\u2019s core research areas of privacy and cybersecurity, including his\nongoing research about the rules for government access to communications and other data .\n\u201cThis award brings recognition to the crucial issues of how to govern cross-border flows of personal information,\u201d said Swire, the\nElizabeth and Tommy Holder Chair of Law and Ethics\nin the Scheller College of Business. \u201cI am humbled by the opportunity to try to help solve these global challenges before they turn into severe global problems.\u201d\nSwire said the conflicts arising from data nationalism pose large risks to privacy and human rights. It also endangers the effectiveness of legitimate law enforcement and intelligence activities, he said.\nThirty-one scholars and writers were selected for the fellowship, often called the \u201cbrainy award,\u201d from nearly 300 nominations. Swire is the only recipient from Georgia.\nThe winning proposals focus on a variety of political, economic, technological, humanistic and sociological matters.\n\u201cThe jurors were greatly impressed by the wide range of institutions represented, the remarkable quality and depth of the proposals, and the overall display of intellectual diversity and creativity shown by the nominees,\u201d said Susan Hockfield, chair of the Andrew Carnegie Fellows Program jury. \u201cNarrowing the field to 31 fellows was both challenging and rewarding for the jurors. We are pleased to know that this investment provides a tremendous opportunity for the fellows to contribute important research and writing to their fields of study, which is a benefit to us all.\u201d\nSwire holds courtesy appointments in the College of Computing and in the School of Public Policy in the Ivan Allen College of Liberal Arts. He is associate director for policy in the Institute for Information Security and Privacy.\nIn addition to academic appointments, Swire has also held several presidential appointments. Under President Clinton, he was the chief counselor for privacy in the U.S. Office of Management and Budget, the only person to date to have U.S. government-wide responsibility for privacy policy. Under President Obama, he was one of five members of the President\u2019s\nReview Group on Intelligence and Communications Technologies .\nAdditional Images\nContact\nLaura Diamond\nMedia Relations\u00a0 laura.diamond@gatech.edu\n404-660-2927\nEmail\nlaura.diamond@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
