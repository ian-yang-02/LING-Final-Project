That\u2019s the highest of any University System of Georgia school, according to the Selig Center for Economic Growth at the University of Georgia.\nOverall, the 26 public colleges and universities in Georgia created nearly $17.7 billion in economic activity for their communities.\n\u201cThe annual state economic impact report highlights just how vital University System of Georgia institutions are to communities throughout the state through the multiplier effect,\u201d said Georgia Tech President G.P. \u201cBud\u201d Peterson. \u201cWhen you add in the impact of graduates in the community, the value is priceless. In addition, Georgia Tech is honored to contribute through research collaborations, innovation neighborhoods and partnerships throughout the state, as well as through programs to strengthen Georgia\u2019s STEM workforce.\u201d\nThe Selig Center report\ncalls the top-line economic impact number \u201ctotal output impact.\u201d Excluding foreign and domestic trade \u2014 and, therefore, better reflecting the economic benefits that flow just within the region \u2014 Georgia Tech\u2019s \u201cvalue-added\u201d impact was $2.4 billion.\nThe Institute also accounts for roughly 27,000 jobs in metro Atlanta. More than two-thirds of those jobs were created off campus as a result of Georgia Tech buying products and services from businesses in the region, not to mention the money students spend locally. Those businesses, in turn, buy materials and services, and so on.\nCombined, that\u2019s an impact greater than all other employers in the state except Fort Benning and Walmart, the state\u2019s top two job-providers, according to the report.\nRead the full Selig Center report.\nEconomic Impact from the Top 5 USG Universities:\nGeorgia Institute of Technology - $3.35 billion\nUniversity of Georgia - $2.84 billion\nGeorgia State University - $2.59 billion\nAugusta University & AU Health System - $2.35 billion\nKennesaw State University - $1.55 billion\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nThe Economic Impact of University System of Georgia Institutions on their Regio\u2026\nNews Release: University System of Georgia Increases Statewide Economic Impact \u2026\nContact\nJoshua Stewart\n404.894.6016\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
