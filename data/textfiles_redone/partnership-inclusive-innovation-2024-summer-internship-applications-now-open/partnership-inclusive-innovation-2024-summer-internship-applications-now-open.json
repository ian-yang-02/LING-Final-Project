Our competitive, immersive 12-week program brings together extraordinary cohorts of interns representing colleges and universities nationwide and communities around the world.\nInterns will gain valuable experience working with local government, community, and non-profit leaders while receiving a summer living stipend of $8,000* for the 12-week internship. *The summer living stipend is paid bi-weekly at a rate of $16.66 an hour and is taxed as income.\nInterns selected for positions are required to live within the community they serve and work in person at the work site indicated on the individual job description. PSI interns will be responsible for the\u00a0cost of housing/food/transportation. All interns must have reliable transportation to get to their positions daily.\nWith a presence across the Southeast United States, the talent and diversity from these cohorts have demonstrated major feats. In just a few years, the PSI has evolved from a modest initiative to an unparalleled platform for innovation. The\u00a0 2023 PSI cohort of 63 interns \u00a0stands as its largest, most competitive, and most diverse group, to date.\nRelated links\nhttps://pingeorgia.org/summer_internships_overview/\nContact\nP\u00e9ralte C.
