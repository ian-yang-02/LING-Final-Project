L-22 served as the main program, administrative and engineering building for the F-22 Raptor stealth fighter program from the mid-1990s until 2013 when the last of the F-22 employees left Marietta. L-59 was a training center.\nJun 27, 2016\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nLockheed Martin\u00a0and the Georgia Institute of Technology have signed a contract on a real estate deal that includes four buildings and 52 acres on Lockheed Martin\u2019s south campus in Marietta.\u00a0 Collocated with five buildings occupied by the Georgia Tech Research Institute in Cobb County, the additional space for conducting and administering applied research will relieve crowding in Georgia Tech\u2019s rapidly expanding research enterprise. \u201cLockheed Martin and Georgia Tech have worked together in numerous areas over the years,\u201d said Georgia Tech President G.P. \u201cBud\u201d Peterson. \u201cThis is another area in which our collaboration will prove to be mutually beneficial as we both look to serve our nation with our respective capabilities.\u201d The portion of the Lockheed Martin facility being sold previously housed the offices and operations for the F-22 Raptor program. These facilities were vacated when production of the F-22 ceased in 2013. \u201cThis is a win-win situation as we evolve our business and assist Georgia Tech in expanding their capabilities,\u201d said Karmyn Norwood, Lockheed Martin vice president for line of business integration. The deal could see as many as 500 jobs located in Cobb County as Georgia Tech uses the facility for research and education. \u201cThis is great news for Cobb County,\u201d said Tim Lee, Cobb County Commission Chairman. \u201cBoth Lockheed Martin and the Georgia Tech Research Institute are great community partners and this purchase strengthens our reputation as a center for research, development and hi-tech jobs.\u201d About Lockheed Martin Headquartered in Bethesda, Maryland, Lockheed Martin is a global security and aerospace company that employs approximately 125,000 people worldwide and is principally engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration and sustainment of advanced technology systems, products and services.
