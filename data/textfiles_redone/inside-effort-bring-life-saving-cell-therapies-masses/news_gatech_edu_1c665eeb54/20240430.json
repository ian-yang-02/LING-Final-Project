His body was then infused with stem cell-rich donor umbilical cord blood. A second dose came four weeks later, through a spinal tap, delivering millions of cells directly to his central nervous system.\nThe rush to save the newborn came about two months after his 10-month-old sister, Mabry Kate, died from the same disease. Christin and Kyle Webb had spent months in and out of hospitals searching for answers as to why their daughter no longer smiled and was having muscle spasms and trouble eating.\nBy the time she was diagnosed with Krabbe at 6 months of age, the disease had progressed too far for treatment.\n\u201cWe felt helpless,\u201d Christin Webb said. \u201cAs parents we were supposed to be able to help her, and we couldn\u2019t.\u201d\nBut their search wasn\u2019t in vain. It led them to Duke and to the discovery that for Owen, it was not too late.\nFor years, medical researchers across the country have been working on a host of groundbreaking therapies using human cells to treat a range of diseases, from neurological leukodystrophies such as Krabbe disease, all the way to certain types of cancer.\nFor all of its promise, however, cell therapy still faces hurdles before it can be used to treat more than a handful of patients at a time. Challenges range from the need to standardize the way cells are manufactured to figuring out how to produce cells faster, in greater quantities, and at lower cost. Georgia Tech researchers have embarked on a multiyear effort aimed at helping doctors and scientists address these challenges and expand cell therapies to more people and more conditions.\n\u201cThe fundamental challenge is that we\u2019re dealing with a living entity,\u201d said Krishnendu Roy, Robert A. Milton Chair and professor in the Wallace H. Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering at Georgia Tech and Emory University. \u201cClassically we\u2019ve always dealt with manufacturing an inanimate object, like materials or a car or an airplane. Even in biomanufacturing we have mostly dealt with a single molecule or protein, not a complete living product like a cell that can change with every manipulation you make.\u201d\nIn January 2016, Georgia Tech announced a research center devoted to developing processes and techniques to manufacture living cells \u2014 the Marcus Center for Therapeutic Cell Characterization and Manufacturing (MC3M). Made possible by a $15.7 million grant from the Atlanta-based Marcus Foundation, the $23 million center will include a facility to produce cells under strict federal quality control protocols \u2014 referred to as a good manufacturing practices facility \u2014 and will provide the framework for partnerships with industry as well as research and clinical institutions across the country.\nThe cell manufacturing effort is just one of myriad research initiatives ongoing at Georgia Tech geared toward advancing manufacturing technologies to solve real-world problems in a broad range of areas.\nRead the compete article\nfrom\nResearch Horizon s magazine.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nJosh Brown\nResearch News\n404-385-0500\nEmail\njosh.brown@comm.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
