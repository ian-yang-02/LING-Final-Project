One such expert at the H. Milton Stewart School of Industrial and Systems Engineering (ISyE) is Pinar Keskinocak, William W. George Chair and professor in ISyE, College of Engineering ADVANCE Professor, and co-founder and director of the\nCenter for Health and Humanitarian Systems .\nKeskinocak has focused her career on heath and humanitarian systems, including hospital operations management, infectious disease modeling, and evaluating the effectiveness of intervention strategies. Since the initial coronavirus outbreak, she has worked on developing a comprehensive agent-based disease spread model, in collaboration with ISyE Professor Nicoleta Serban and Ph.D. students Buse Eylul Oruc, Arden Baxter, and others. The model estimates the spread of the disease geographically and over time; resource needs such as hospital beds, ICU beds, and ventilators; and enables the team to evaluate the impact of various intervention scenarios to determine the best course of action.\nIn a recent CNN interview, Keskinocak discusses the impact of social distancing and current shelter in place orders. She cautions that a careful, gradual approach is needed as society plans to go back to work and social life, a balancing act between public health and the economy. She emphasizes the importance of the need to continue social distancing to slow down COVID-19 spread, flatten the curve, and save lives.\nAdditional Stories Featuring Dr. Pinar Keskinocak\n5/14\u00a0-\u00a0 Turn the Cacophony Of COVID-19 Responses Into a Symphony \u2014 Now!\n5/11 -\u00a0 We\u2019re in the Calm before a New Storm of COVID-19 Infections and Deaths\n5/11 - Fox 5 -\nGeorgia Tech model predicts alarming coronavirus numbers\n4/27 -\u00a0 US pharmaceutical supply chain unprepared for COVID-19\n4/21 -\u00a0 Fox 5 - Georgia Tech researchers create COVID-19 tool to help doctors spot 'false negative' patients\n4/14 -\nCNN Newsroom - Pinar Keskinocak of Georgia Tech on How Fast Governments Should Get Back to Work\n4/10 -\nWe can\u2019t shelter in place forever: How the coronavirus lockdown might end\n4/1 -\nUnderlying Health Disparities Could Mean Coronavirus Hits Some Communities Harder\n3/31 -\nHospitals, state scramble to prepare for coronavirus surge\n3/28 -\nHow Fast Can The U.S. Go Back To Work?\n3/25 -\nWhen will 'social distancing' end?\n3/25 -\nCreate Dedicated Pandemic Clinics Now to Address COVID-19\n3/23 -\nCoronavirus\u2019 health-care capacity gut check: We need to radically ramp up facilities in America\n3/20 -\nHow to Triage Patients Who Need Intensive Care\n3/18 -\nIn 'coronapocalypse' the worst shortages could be deadly\n3/16 -\nGeorgia Tech professor explains how social distancing slows spread of COVID-19\n3/6 -\nA Look At The \u2018Supply Chain\u2019 For Consumers And How Coronavirus Could Test It\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nCenter for Health and Humanitarian Systems\nMore about Dr. Pinar Keskinocak\nContact\nLaurie Haigh\nCommunications Manager\nH.
