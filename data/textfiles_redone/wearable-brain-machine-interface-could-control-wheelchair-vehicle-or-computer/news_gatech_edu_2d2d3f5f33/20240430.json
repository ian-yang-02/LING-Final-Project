The system\u2019s ability to measure EEG signals for BMI has been evaluated with six human subjects, but has not been studied with disabled individuals.\nThe project, conducted by researchers from the Georgia Institute of Technology, University of Kent and Wichita State University, was reported on September 11 in the journal\nNature Machine Intelligence .\n\u201cThis work reports fundamental strategies to design an ergonomic, portable EEG system for a broad range of assistive devices, smart home systems and neuro-gaming interfaces,\u201d said\nWoon-Hong Yeo , an assistant professor in Georgia Tech\u2019s\nGeorge W. Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering\nand\nWallace H. Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering.\n\u201cThe primary innovation is in the development of a fully integrated package of high-resolution EEG monitoring systems and circuits within a miniaturized skin-conformal system.\u201d\nBMI is an essential part of rehabilitation technology that allows those with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), chronic stroke or other severe motor disabilities to control prosthetic systems. Gathering brain signals known as steady-state virtually evoked potentials (SSVEP) now requires use of an electrode-studded hair cap that uses wet electrodes, adhesives and wires to connect with computer equipment that interprets the signals.\nYeo and his collaborators are taking advantage of a new class of flexible, wireless sensors and electronics that can be easily applied to the skin. The system includes three primary components: highly flexible, hair-mounted electrodes that make direct contact with the scalp through hair; an ultrathin nanomembrane electrode; and soft, flexible circuity with a Bluetooth telemetry unit. The recorded EEG data from the brain is processed in the flexible circuitry, then wirelessly delivered to a tablet computer via Bluetooth from up to 15 meters away.\nBeyond the sensing requirements, detecting and analyzing SSVEP signals have been challenging because of the low signal amplitude, which is in the range of tens of micro-volts, similar to electrical noise in the body. Researchers also must deal with variation in human brains. Yet accurately measuring the signals is essential to determining what the user wants the system to do.\nTo address those challenges, the research team turned to deep learning neural network algorithms running on the flexible circuitry.\n\u201cDeep learning methods, commonly used to classify pictures of everyday things such as cats and dogs, are used to analyze the EEG signals,\u201d said Chee Siang (Jim) Ang, senior lecturer in Multimedia/Digital Systems at the University of Kent. \u201cLike pictures of a dog which can have a lot of variations, EEG signals have the same challenge of high variability. Deep learning methods have proven to work well with pictures, and we show that they work very well with EEG signals as well.\u201d\nIn addition, the researchers used deep learning models to identify which electrodes are the most useful for gathering information to classify EEG signals. \u201cWe found that the model is able to identify the relevant locations in the brain for BMI, which is in agreement with human experts,\u201d Ang added. \u201cThis reduces the number of sensors we need, cutting cost and improving portability.\u201d\nThe system uses three elastomeric scalp electrodes held onto the head with a fabric band, ultrathin wireless electronics conformed to the neck, and a skin-like printed electrode placed on the skin below an ear. The dry soft electrodes adhere to the skin and do not use adhesive or gel. Along with ease of use, the system could reduce noise and interference and provide higher data transmission rates compared to existing systems.\nThe system was evaluated with six human subjects. The deep learning algorithm with real-time data classification could control an electric wheelchair and a small robotic vehicle. The signals could also be used to control a display system without using a keyboard, joystick or other controller, Yeo said.\n\u201cTypical EEG systems must cover the majority of the scalp to get signals, but potential users may be sensitive about wearing them,\u201d Yeo added. \u201cThis miniaturized, wearable soft device is fully integrated and designed to be comfortable for long-term use.\u201d\nNext steps will include improving the electrodes and making the system more useful for motor-impaired individuals.\n\u201cFuture study would focus on investigation of fully elastomeric, wireless self-adhesive electrodes that can be mounted on the hairy scalp without any support from headgear, along with further miniaturization of the electronics to incorporate more electrodes for use with other studies,\u201d Yeo said. \u201cThe EEG system can also be reconfigured to monitor motor-evoked potentials or motor imagination for motor-impaired subjects, which will be further studied as a future work on therapeutic applications.\u201d\nLong-term, the system may have potential for other applications where simpler EEG monitoring would be helpful, such as in sleep studies done by\nAudrey Duarte , an associate professor in Georgia Tech\u2019s\nSchool of Psychology .\n\u201cThis EEG monitoring system has the potential to finally allow scientists to monitor human neural activity in a relatively unobtrusive way as subjects go about their lives,\u201d she said. \u201cFor example, Dr. Yeo and I are currently using a similar system to monitor neural activity while people sleep in the comfort of their own homes, rather than the lab with bulky, rigid, uncomfortable equipment, as is customarily done. Measuring sleep-related neural activity with an imperceptible system may allow us to identify new, non-invasive biomarkers of Alzheimer's-related neural pathology predictive of dementia.\u201d\nIn addition to those already mentioned, the research team included Musa Mahmood, Yun-Soung Kim, Saswat Mishra, and Robert Herbert from Georgia Tech; Deogratias Mzurikwao from the University of Kent; and Yongkuk Lee from Wichita State University.\nThis research was supported by a grant from the Fundamental Research Program (project PNK5061) of Korea Institute of Materials Science, funding by the Nano-Material Technology Development Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning (no. 2016M3A7B4900044), and support from the Institute for Electronics and Nanotechnology, a member of the National Nanotechnology Coordinated Infrastructure, which is supported by the National Science Foundation (grant ECCS-1542174).\nCITATION : Musa Mahmood, et al., \u201cFully portable and wireless universal brain-machine interfaces enabled by flexible scalp electronics and deep learning algorithm.\u201d (Nature Machine Intelligence, 1, 412-422, 2019).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s42256-019-0091-7\nResearch News\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\n177 North Avenue\nAtlanta, Georgia\u00a0 30332-0181\u00a0 USA\nMedia Relations Contact : John Toon (404-894-6986) (jtoon@gatech.edu).\nWriter : John Toon\nAdditional Images\nContact\nJohn Toon\nResearch News\n(404) 894-6986\nEmail\njtoon@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
