The work was sponsored by the National Science Foundation and the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation.\n\u201cFor a lot of these Ph.D.s, the postdoc is an opportunity to consider other options and explore other career paths,\u201d said Michael Roach, the co-author of the paper and an assistant professor in the Dyson School of Applied Economics and Management at Cornell University.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an easy natural next step for them, and it gives them flexibility to keep that academic option open,\u201d Roach said.\nSauermann and Roach were prompted to look into the motivations of students pursuing postdocs because of what they saw as an imbalance between the number of postdoc researchers and the number of research-oriented faculty jobs at colleges and universities across the country.\n\u201cMany people believe that students don\u2019t know what the market looks like and that this is why they hope to get a faculty position and do a postdoc,\u201d Sauermann said. \u201cWe wanted to understand what was going on inside students\u2019 minds as they were making these decisions.\u201d\nThey surveyed Ph.D. students beginning in 2010 at 39 research-intensive universities in the United States. The students were surveyed again in 2013 after many had already begun a postdoc or entered other full-time positions.\nThe respondents were also asked to estimate how likely it is for them to get a tenure-track position within five years after finishing their Ph.D. While the respondents were knowledgeable about the limited availability of faculty positions in general, some appeared to be overly optimistic about their own chances of getting a faculty position, Sauermann said.\nThe study highlights the need for more data on students\u2019 career preferences in order to compare graduates\u2019 career goals to their actual career transitions, Sauermann said. More data is needed to determine also how useful a postdoc is for non-academic careers, he added.\nWhile students need to consider career plans early, they also need better information to understand the various career paths and their job prospects, Sauermann said. Such information should come from academic advisers, professional organizations or career development programs.\n\u201cIn a lot of the conversations I\u2019ve had, Ph.D. students start the program because they have a passion for research,\u201d Roach said. \u201cAlthough more information about career paths is unlikely to dissuade Ph.D.s from starting the program, it would be extremely valuable to Ph.D. students as they consider whether to do a postdoc.\u201d\nThis material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. SMA1262270.
