Baker, who has served as dean of GTPE since 2012, has been serving as the Lifetime Learning initiative co-chair.\n\u201cThe world around us is changing rapidly, and we know we need to change with it to continue to fulfill our educational mission,\u201d said McLaughlin. \u201cThis appointment is an important step to facilitate the big thinking, collaboration and consensus, and operational planning necessary to create a new College. I\u2019d like to thank Dean Baker for his vision and leadership of the initiative thus far and for his continued leadership during this transition.\u201d\nMost recently, members of the\ninitiative working groups\ncompleted Phase 1 and delivered a\nreport that outlines recommendations, including a proposed new College, to President \u00c1ngel Cabrera and the Institute Executive Leadership Team. The working report was a collaborative effort across all three working groups, including significant contributions from C21U, CEISMC, and GTPE.\nThe groups\nrecommend that Georgia Tech, through the lens of its technological expertise, build educational opportunities from \u201cK to grey\u201d t hat are accessible, affordable, transformational, and achievable at all stages of life and career. After further collaboration with the University System of Georgia (USG) and other key stakeholders, the final report will be approved and released at a later date.\nPhase 2 starts now and will take place over the next several months. Phase 2 activities will involve deeper engagement opportunities, more formal governance conversations with faculty leadership and the USG, additional listening sessions with the broader campus community, and detailed implementation planning. As interim dean, Baker will lead the process of creating the new unit, including establishing its leadership team. When the final College is approved and named, there will be a national search for a permanent dean.\n\u201cI am deeply excited to be a part of this transformational work, providing new opportunities for research, education, and service to people at all stages of life,\u201d said Baker. \u201cI look forward to learning from and working with the many colleagues in C21U, CEISMC, GTPE, and across Georgia Tech, building upon what has been accomplished to date and to help shape the future of this new endeavor.\u201d\nOngoing updates on the Division of Lifetime Learning, including engagement activities, milestones, and a timeline can be found at\nhttps://provost.gatech.edu/lifetime-learning-initiative .\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nGeorgia Tech to Explore New Academic Unit, Aligns Key Units\nContact\nOffice of the Provost\nEmail\nprovostsoffice@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
