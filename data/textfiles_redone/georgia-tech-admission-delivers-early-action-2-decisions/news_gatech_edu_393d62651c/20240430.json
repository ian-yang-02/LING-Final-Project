As of this year, first-year applicants could select from one of three admission plans: Early Action 1, Early Action 2, and Regular Decision. Early Action 1 was reserved specifically for Georgia students, including Georgia residents attending high school out of state.\nThe overall admit rate for Early Action 2, which included both international and out-of-state students, was 14% (38% for Georgia students). Admitted students hail from all 50 states, 74 nations, and 1,889 high schools from around the globe. These students join 2,330 Early Action 1 applicants from Georgia who were\nadmitted in early December .\n\u201cA primary focus area in Tech\u2019s new strategic plan is to \u2018expand access,\u2019 and our Early Action decisions put us on a solid path toward achieving that goal,\u201d said Rick Clark, director of Undergraduate Admission. \u201cWe admitted nearly 800 more students in the Early Action rounds this year versus last year, with increases of over 40% in key demographics, including first-generation, Black, and Hispanic admits.\u201d\nThis year also saw a record number of applicants; all six of Georgia Tech\u2019s colleges saw an increase in applications.\n\u201cThrough the\nGeorgia Tech Scholars Program\nand other statewide initiatives, Tech\u2019s popularity has grown dramatically in recent years. This year applications from Georgia residents increased by 22%, and we set a record for the number of Georgia counties represented in both our applicant and admitted pools,\u201d Clark added.\nRegular Decision admission announcements will go out in late March.\n\u201cAt this point, our team is not only focused on reading the more than 17,000 Regular Decision applications we received, as well as re-reading deferred applicant files, but also convincing our newly admitted students to choose Tech from among their other amazing college options,\u201d Clark said.\nWhile the 2021 first-year class continues to take shape, the Spring 2021 transfer class has arrived on campus. This year, Tech saw a 20% increase in spring enrollment. Sixty-three percent of spring transfers are Georgia residents, and 13% of the total class are first-generation college students.\nLearn more about potential first-year\nadmissions decisions\nand\ntransfer pathways .\nAdditional Images\nContact\nGrace Wyner\nInstitute Communications\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
