The award will help Singh continue her genomics studies.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nEmail\nMay 20, 2021\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nThis story first appeared in the\nGeorgia Tech Bioinformatics News Center .\nThe\nBioinformatics Interdisciplinary Graduate Program\nis proud to announce\nDevika Singh\nas our winner for the inaugural \u201c Mark Borodovsky Prize in the College of Sciences \u201d for the Top Bioinformatics PhD student, 2021.\u00a0 The Borodovsky Prize is intended to recognize outstanding academic merit at Georgia Tech.\nDevika works with professor\nSoojin Yi , in the\nComparative Genomics and Epigenomics Lab\nat Georgia Tech.\u00a0 Devika completed both her bachelor\u2019s (Biology) degree and her master\u2019s (Bioinformatics) degrees at Georgia Tech.\u00a0 She worked for one year at the\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention\nbefore returning to Georgia Tech to pursue her doctoral studies in 2017.\nDevika\u2019s doctoral work integrates large \u201c-omics\u201d datasets to study broad questions around the organization and evolution of non-coding regulatory regions, particularly enhancers, in the human genome. This work includes investigating the underlying architecture of enhancer-gene regulatory networks utilizing multi-tissue, whole-genome chromatin state maps (Results published in MBE). Indicative of the breadth of research in the Yi lab, Devika also worked on projects which analyzed DNA methylation signatures in non-human primates and non-model organisms. In collaboration with researchers at the University of Nevada, Reno, and the Australia Museum, she generated and explored the first tissue- and sex-inclusive, whole-genome \u201cDNA methylome atlas\u201d for the modern koala.\nSo far in her studies, Devika has published\u00a0 eight papers , including five first-author papers.\u00a0 In addition, Devika gave a poster presentation at a CDC conference in 2017.\u00a0 She also received a travel award to present her work at the Allied Genetics Conference earlier this year. Although the meeting was canceled at the last minute due to the pandemic, the fact that Devika was granted a travel award and invited for a presentation speaks for the strength of her work.\nYi notes, \u201cDevika and I have several projects in the pipeline, and I expect she will have at least two additional papers as the lead author from her PhD studies. She is one of the best students I have worked with during my 16 years as a faculty member\u00a0at Georgia Tech.\u201d\nThe Borodovsky Prize nominations were reviewed by an interdisciplinary committee of faculty members, including Joe Lachance (College of Sciences), Peng Qiu (College of Engineering), and Xiuwei Zhang (College of Computing).\u00a0 According to the committee, \u201cDevika Singh exhibited an impressive ability to both analyze complex bioinformatics datasets and frame her research within a larger biological context.\u00a0 Despite the pandemic, she was able to publish three high-profile first author papers in 2021.\u00a0 Topics covered in these papers ranged from the evolution of regulatory DNA in humans to epigenetics in koalas.\u201d\nCongratulations to Devika!\nAdditional Images\nContact\nRenay San Miguel\nCommunications Officer II/Science Writer\nCollege of Sciences\n404-894-5209\nEmail\nrenay.san@cos.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
