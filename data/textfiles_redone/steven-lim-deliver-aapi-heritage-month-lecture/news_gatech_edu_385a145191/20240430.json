Register for the event\nhere .\nWhile AAPI Heritage Month is widely recognized in May, Tech\u2019s Office of Institute Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion and the Asian American Student Association celebrate the event in April before the semester ends. AAPI Heritage Month recognizes and honors the contributions, achievements, and influence of Asian Americans and Pacific Islander Americans who have shaped the culture and history of the U.S.\n\u201cIn light of the increase in violence and discrimination against AAPI communities, the annual celebration takes on even more importance,\u201d said Sun Graham, president of the Asian American Student Association. \u201cThis is an important month that highlights Asian culture at Georgia Tech, a demographic that encompasses over 40% of students on the Atlanta campus.\u201d\nAs a Korean American adoptee, Graham said she didn\u2019t grow up with a strong Asian presence within her community.\n\u201cAAPI Heritage Month allows my Asian identity not only to be seen, but celebrated through events and initiatives that bring the Asian community together,\u201d she said. \u201cAs I close out on my second and final year of being the president of the Asian American Student Association and being awarded Student Leader of the Year at Georgia Tech, I feel honored to have been given the position to host AAPI Heritage Month alongside our wonderful board. It is important to me to dedicate the time and energy to promoting events that make a positive impact on Georgia Tech\u2019s campus and amplifies Asian voices.\u201d\nFollow Georgia Tech\u2019s AASA on Instagram @gtaasa\nFor other AAPI Heritage Month events\nclick here .\nAdditional Images\nContact\nVictor Rogers\nInstitute Communications\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
