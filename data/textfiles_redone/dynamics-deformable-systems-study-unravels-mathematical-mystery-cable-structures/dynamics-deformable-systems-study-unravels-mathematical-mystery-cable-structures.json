We all know the convention\n\u2014\nthat solids maintain their shapes, while liquids fill the containers they\u2019re in. But often in the real world, those lines are blurred. Imagine walking on a beach. Sometimes the sand gives way under feet, deforming like a liquid, but when enough sand grains pack together, they can support weight like a solid surface.\nModeling these kinds of systems is notoriously difficult \u2014\u00a0but\nZeb Rocklin , an assistant professor in the\nSchool of Physics\nat Georgia Tech, has written a new paper doing just that.\nRocklin\u2019s study, \u201c Rigidity percolation in a random tensegrity via analytic graph theory ,\u201d is published in the journal\nProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) . The results have the potential to impact fields spanning biology to engineering and nanotechnology, showing that these types of deformable solids offer a rare combination of durability and flexibility.\n\"I'm very proud of our team, especially Will and Vishal, the two Georgia Tech undergraduates who co-led the study,\u201d\nRocklin says.\nThe lead author,\nWilliam Stephenson,\nand co-author\nVishal Sudhakar\nboth completed their undergraduate studies at the Institute during the time of this research. Stephenson is now a first-year grad student at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, and Sudhakar has been admitted to Georgia Tech as a graduate student. Additionally, co-author\nMichael Czajkowski\nis a post-doctoral researcher in the School of Physics, and co-author\nJames McInerney\ncompleted his graduate studies in the School of Physics under Rocklin. McInerney is now a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Michigan.\nConnecting the dots\u2026 with cables\nImagine building molecules in chemistry class\n\u2014\nlarge wooden spheres connected with sticks or rods. While many models use rods, including mathematical models, biological systems in real life are constructed of polymers, which function more like stretchy strings.\nLikewise, when creating mathematical or biological models, researchers frequently treat all the elements as rods as opposed to treating some of them as cables, or strings. But, \u201cthere are tradeoffs between how mathematically tractable a model is and how physically plausible it is,\u201d Rocklin says. \u201cPhysicists can have some beautiful mathematical theories, but they aren\u2019t always realistic.\u201d\u00a0 For example, a model using connective rods might not capture the dynamics that connective strings provide. \u201cWith a string you can stretch it, and it'll fight you, but when you compress it, it collapses.\u201d\n\u201cBut, in this study, we\u2019ve extended the current theories,\u201d he says, adding cable-like elements. \u201cAnd that actually turns out to be incredibly difficult, because these theories use mathematical equations.\nIn contrast, the distance between the two ends of a cable is represented by an inequality, which is not an equation at all. So how do you create a mathematical theory when you aren't starting from equations? \u201d While a rod has a certain length in a mathematical equation, the ends of the string have to be represented as less than or equal to a certain length.\nIn this situation \u201call the usual analytic theories completely break,\u201d Rocklin says. \u201cIt becomes very difficult for physicists or for mathematicians.\u201d\n\u201cThe trick was to notice that these physical systems were logically equivalent to something called a directed graph,\u201d Rocklin adds, \u201cwhere different modes of deformation are linked to each other in specific ways. This allows us to take a relatively complicated system and massively compress\nit to a much smaller system. And when we did that, we were able to turn it into something that becomes extremely easy for the computer to do.\u201d\nFrom biology to engineering\nRocklin\u2019s team found that when modeling with cables and springs, the target range changed \u2014 becoming softer, with a wider margin for error. \u201cThat could be really important for something like a biological system, because a biological system is trying to stay close to that critical point,\u201d says Rocklin. \u201cOur model shows that the region around the critical point is actually much broader than what models that only used rods previously showed.\u201d\nRocklin also points out applications for engineers. For example, since Rocklin's new theory suggests that even disordered cable structures can be strong and flexible, it may help engineers leverage cables as building materials to create safer, more durable bridges. The theory also provides a way to easily model these cable-based structures, to ensure their safety before they are built, and provide a way for engineers to iterate on designs.\nRocklin also notes potential applications in nanotechnology. \u201cIn nanotechnology, you must accept an increasing amount of disorder, because you can't just have a skilled worker actually go in and put segments there, and you can't have a conventional factory machine put segments there,\u201d Rocklin says.\nBut biology has known how to lay down effective, but disordered, rod and cable structures for hundreds of millions of years. \u201cThis is going to tell us what sorts of machines we can make with those disordered structures when we're getting to the point of being able to do what biology can do. And that's a possible future design principle for the engineers to explore, at very small scales, where we can't choose exactly where each cable goes,\u201d Rocklin says.\n\u201cOur theory shows that with cables, we can maintain a combination of flexibility and strength with much less precision than you might otherwise need.\u201d\nFunding:\nThis research was funded by the Army Research Office through the MURI program (#W911NF2210219).\nDOI:\nhttps://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2302536120\nFigure caption:\nSystems of rigid rods acquire rigidity via the addition of random additional rods and cables, as captured via a graph theory.
