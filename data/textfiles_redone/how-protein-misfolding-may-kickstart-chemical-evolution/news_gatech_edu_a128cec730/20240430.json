And in the second paper, we showed that these complex systems can have remarkable and unexpected functions,\u201d said\nDavid Lynn , a systems chemist at Emory who led the research. \u201cThe work was inspired by our current understanding of Darwinian selection of protein misfolding in neurodegenerative diseases.\u201d\nThe\nLynn lab\nis exploring ways to potentially control and direct the processes of these proteins \u2013 known as prions \u2013 adding to knowledge that might one day help to prevent disease, as well as open new realms of synthetic biology. For the current papers, Emory collaborated with the research group of\nMartha Grover , a professor in the Georgia Tech\nSchool of Chemical & Biomolecular Engineering , to develop molecular models for the processes.\nDarwin\u2019s theory of evolution by natural selection is well-established \u2013 organisms adapt over time in response to environmental changes. But theories about how life emerges \u2013 the movement through a pre-Darwinian world to the Darwinian threshold \u2013 remain murkier.\nThe researchers started with single peptides and engineered in the capacity to spontaneously form small proteins, or short polymers. \u201cThese protein polymers can fold into a seemingly endless array of forms, and sometimes behave like origami,\u201d Lynn explained. \u201cThey can stack into assemblies that carry new functions, like prions that move from cell-to-cell, causing disease.\u201d\nThis protein misfolding provided the model for how physical changes could carry information with function, a critical component for evolution. To try to kickstart that evolution, the researchers engineered a chemical system of peptides and coupled it to the physical system of protein misfolding. The combination results in a system that generates step-by-step, progressive changes, through self-driven environmental changes.\n\u201cThe folding events, or phase changes, drive the chemistry and the chemistry drives the replication of the protein molecules,\u201d Lynn said. \u201cThe simple system we designed requires only the initial intervention from us to achieve progressive growth in molecular order. The challenge now becomes the discovery of positive feedback mechanisms that allow the system to continue to grow.\u201d\nThe researchers used mathematical modeling to help guide the experimental work.\n\u201cModeling requires us to formulate our hypotheses in the language of mathematics, and then we use the models to design further experiments to test the hypotheses,\u201d said Grover. \u201cIn this project, the hypotheses were sometimes invalidated by these further experiments, but ultimately this led us to a better understanding of the underlying chemical and physical events and their interactions.\"\nThe research was funded by the McDonnell Foundation, the National Science Foundation\u2019s Materials Science Directorate, Emory University\u2019s Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Research Center, the National Science Foundation\u2019s Center for Chemical Evolution and the Office of Basic Energy Sciences of the U.S. Department of Energy.\nAdditional co-authors of the papers include: Toluople Omosun, Seth Childers, Dibyendu Das and Anil Mehta (Emory Departments of Chemistry and Biology); Ming-Chien Hsieh (Georgia Tech School of Chemical & Biomolecular Engineering); and Neil Anthony and Keith Berland (Emory Department of Physics).\n- Written by Carol Clark, Emory University\nResearch News\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\n177 North Avenue\nAtlanta, Georgia \u00a030332-0181 \u00a0USA\nMedia Relations Contact s: John Toon (404-894-6986) (jtoon@gatech.edu) or Ben Brumfield (404-385-1933) (ben.brumfield@comm.gatech.edu).\nAdditional Images\nContact\nJohn Toon\nResearch News\n(404) 894-6986\nEmail\njtoon@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
