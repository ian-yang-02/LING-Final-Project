All undergraduate students received an email on Dec. 16 with the review attached. Click\nhere\nto view it on SGA\u2019s website.\nThe review is broken down into 13 different categories. The first 12 outline the work of various committees and boards, each one headed up by a member of the\nundergraduate cabinet . The 13th category lists the resolutions passed by the\nUndergraduate House of Representatives .\nThis semester\u2019s Undergraduate Executive Review covered everything from Black Lives Matter advocacy to the establishment of McCamish Pavilion as the country\u2019s first\nfully student-staffed Election Day polling precinct . One of the cabinet\u2019s most noteworthy efforts was its work on Georgia Tech\u2019s response to the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\u201cWe ensured that there was a student representative in almost every meeting about decisions on returning to campus, and we\u2019re really proud of the work we\u2019ve done toward making campus as safe as we can,\u201d said Grace Swift, SGA\u2019s vice president of communications.\nThroughout the spring, continuing to make campus as safe as possible during the pandemic will be at the forefront of SGA\u2019s initiatives. These efforts will add to and tie in with other ongoing advocacy work in such areas as mental health, campus services, and sustainability.\nSGA hopes that in addition to highlighting its members\u2019 accomplishments, the executive review helps improve transparency between students and the organization.\n\u201cA lot of people think SGA is this mysterious organization that only handles the student activity fee, when in reality we do a ton of advocacy work behind the scenes,\u201d said Swift. \u201cIt\u2019s important that people know about the work we do so they can feel confident that they are well represented.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nSGA Website\nContact\nGrace Wyner\nInstitute Communications\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
