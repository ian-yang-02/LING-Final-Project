Without question, the vaccine offers the best defense against the pandemic, and, if you have not done so, we urge you to consult with a medical professional and\nconsider getting vaccinated now . Doing so at Tech is easy and free.\nAdditionally, all students, faculty, and staff are encouraged to participate each week in our free asymptomatic surveillance testing program, even if you have been fully vaccinated. We especially urge those who have not yet been vaccinated to get tested weekly. Find\ncampus testing sites and locations .\nBeginning today, Georgia Tech is introducing new rewards to encourage individuals to get vaccinated and test weekly:\nAll students, faculty, and staff who get vaccinated at\nStamps Health Services\nor participate in our\ncampus surveillance testing program\nbetween now and end of day September 30, 2021, will be entered into a drawing to receive a\n$50 Barnes & Noble at Georgia Tech gift card .\n350 individuals will be randomly selected\nthe following week to each receive a gift card.\nAdditionally, all students, faculty, and staff vaccinated on campus between now and end of day September 10, 2021, will also receive a\n$20 Barnes & Noble at Georgia Tech gift card .\nThrough September 10, more than\n1,000 $5 coupons for local restaurants ,\n350 limited edition Georgia Tech Athletics t-shirts , and several\nhelmets and footballs signed by Coach Geoff Collins\nwill also be distributed at random to campus test sites and vaccine clinics.\nCookie drops\ncontinue at test sites, along with\nstickers\nat test sites and vaccine clinics.\nIf you are unvaccinated, you are at risk of contracting Covid-19 and infecting others, with potentially severe consequences for you or someone else.
