The center was established in 2016 and made possible by a $15.75 million gift from philanthropist Bernie Marcus, with a $7.25 million investment from Georgia Tech and another $1 million from the\nGeorgia Research Alliance .\nMC3M is already helping researchers from Georgia Tech and partner organizations develop ways to provide therapeutic living cells of consistent quality in quantities large enough to meet the growing demands for the cutting-edge treatments. The center and this new facility also provide the infrastructural foundation for the Georgia Tech-led National Science Foundation Engineering Research\nCenter for Cell Manufacturing Technologies\n(CMaT), which was announced in September 2017.\nThe Marcus Foundation\u2019s gift along with the NSF\u2019s expected funding over ten years in CMaT, together with potential private-sector contributions and the state of Georgia\u2019s investment in infrastructure related bio manufacturing, could result in a combined statewide investment of more than $70 million in cell manufacturing. Beyond developing technologies to help make these life-saving cell therapies broadly available and affordable, the initiative will also help train the specialized workforce needed to manufacture these therapies at large scale.\n\u201cThis initiative has the potential to change the way we think about medical treatments, to change the way we think about medicine, and the way we approach cures for different diseases,\u201d said Georgia Tech President G.P. \u201cBud\u201d Peterson, who opened the dedication event. \u201cHere, we will develop the tools and technologies to produce these cells at lower cost, more rapidly and for more people.\u201d\nMC3M is already supporting 23 research projects aimed at all components of the challenge, from understanding cell quality and developing scalable processes, to chip-based disease models for safety and efficacy testing and new models for supply-chain optimization and logistics. The center collaborates with several other institutions, supporting the work of 29 faculty members, and helping train 27 students and fellows for the emerging cell manufacturing industry.\nThe new facility dedicated on June 6 is a unique \u201csandbox\u201d for collaboration among engineers, clinicians, and industry to develop and validate new scalable manufacturing processes for cell therapies under GMP conditions necessary to eventually obtain regulatory approvals. It will serve as the translational arm of the Marcus Center and CMaT to help researchers throughout the state of Georgia translate emerging cell therapies to clinical practice. This facility \u2013 designed to enable real time quality monitoring and control of cell products during manufacturing \u2013 is a one-of-a-kind space that will be instrumental in bringing affordable cell therapies to patients faster.\nThe new cell-based therapies being approved for use in humans can have dramatic impact. But the therapies are costly, as much as a $500,000 per patient. The MC3M will help develop new technologies and processes to make these treatments consistent in quality and available to the average person.\n\u201cThe center is about providing access for patients and enabling patients to benefit from these incredible therapies that could change their lives,\u201d said Krishnendu Roy, who directs both MC3M and CMaT. \u201cWe need to scale these therapies up to treat hundreds of thousands of patients. This is the vision of Mr. Marcus \u2013 to make this available to everyone regardless of their socio-economic status.\u201d\nMarcus, who recalled working as a pharmacist before co-founding home improvement retailer The Home Depot, noted that common drugs such as aspirin are chemically consistent around the world, regardless of where they are sold. The consistency of living cell therapies can\u2019t be similarly counted on because their properties may depend on the specific skills and facilities of the research center producing them.\n\u201cPatients receiving these cells need to know that they are getting the right things,\u201d Marcus said. \u201cThis is a very practical question for which we have no answer now.\u201d Beyond consistency, the cells also need to be affordable, he said.\nThe new cell manufacturing facility will connect cell-based therapies being developed in research facilities with the appropriate tools and technologies that ensure consistency in manufacturing and product quality while enabling scalability. \u201cThere is a gap right now between what we do in the research lab and what we need to do to get these therapies to a hundred thousand or even millions of patients,\u201d Roy noted.\nBeyond developing quality control and analytical techniques to ensure consistency, the center will also develop novel feedback-controlled automation systems to lower the cost, Roy said.\nPeterson noted the potential economic impact of building a cell manufacturing industry in Georgia. \u201cWorking with our partner universities, the Technical College System of Georgia and the private sector, we will be able to attract new industries, create new jobs and help build the economy of the state of Georgia.\u201d\nThe initiative began, he noted, with the development of a national cell manufacturing roadmap, an effort supported by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The Marcus gift built on that foundation, and in turn, made it possible for Georgia Tech to lead a team including the University of Wisconsin, University of Georgia, University of Puerto Rico-Mayaguez, and other partners, to win the NSF Engineering Research Center award last fall.\nOther collaborators in Georgia include Emory University and Children\u2019s Healthcare of Atlanta.\nThe NSF ERC could provide up to $40 million over ten years, and attract private and local investment that could boost that amount much higher.\n\u201cWe have incredible momentum,\u201d Roy said. \u201cWe are bonded together by a single goal: getting these therapies to many patients at a lower cost to really help them.\u201d\nResearch News\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\n177 North Avenue\nAtlanta, Georgia\u00a0 30332-0181\u00a0 USA\nMedia Relations Contact : John Toon (404-894-6986) (jtoon@gatech.edu).\nWriter : John Toon\nAdditional Images\nContact\nJohn Toon\nResearch News\n(404) 894-6986\nEmail\njtoon@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
