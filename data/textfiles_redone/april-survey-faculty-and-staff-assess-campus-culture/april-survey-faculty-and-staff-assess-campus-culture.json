The survey will take no more than 10 to 15 minutes, and all responses will remain anonymous. It will be accessible until the close of business on Friday, April 28.\n\u201cI encourage all faculty and staff to complete the survey to ensure that their voices are heard. The results of the survey will be used to shape our actions and priorities for the 2023-2024 academic year,\u201d said Frank Neville, senior vice president for Strategic Initiatives and chief of staff.\nResults from last year\u2019s survey were used to identify priority actions for Tech\u2019s cultural strengthening initiative, also known as L.O.V.E. GT, which seeks to ensure that\nGeorgia Tech values\nare at the heart of our organizational culture and are reflected in how we deliver on our mission, pursue our vision, and achieve our goals.\nL.O.V.E. GT operates in three dimensions: leadership, engagement, and systems. The leadership component seeks to train and equip leaders to \u201clead by example\u201d in living our values every day. The engagement effort is focused on communication and connecting values to the fabric of our daily work. The systems dimension works to ensure that internal policies, practices, and procedures reflect Georgia Tech\u2019s values.\nProgress Across the Institute\nActions taken over the past year include:\nLeadership\nLeadership 360 Feedback and Development \u2014 We have rolled out a 360 assessment for Institute leaders to receive feedback from institutional peers, direct reports, supervisors, and others while also completing a self-evaluation to understand what leadership practices are working well and potential areas of growth.\nInternal Coaching Cadre \u2014 We have expanded access to coaching services by building capacity through training Georgia Tech staff and contracting with external vendors.\nLeadership Competency Model \u2014 We have defined the competencies expected of leaders as we rely on them to model our values and practice them consistently.\nWorkshops \u2014 More than 100 leaders engaged in workshops (Psychological Safety and Leading Congruently) that provided tools and strategies to align their own practices and behaviors with the Institute\u2019s values.\nEngagement\nGeorgia Tech Culture Survey and Action Planning - We assessed the experience of students, faculty, and staff through the inaugural survey and actively engaged several units in action planning efforts to improve culture.\nCulture Councils \u2014 Five Staff Culture Advisory Councils were created across the administrative, research, and academic units in order to promote healthy and productive cultures.\nGT Cares Week \u2014 We launched the first-ever \u201cL.O.V.E. GT Day\u201d during the inaugural GT Cares Week, engaging more than 600 faculty, staff, and students in celebration of our values.\nEmployer Branding \u2014 A new social media campaign has been launched, featuring testimonials and videos to amplify Georgia Tech\u2019s brand as an employer of choice.\nSystems\nPerformance Management \u2014 We have revised the performance management process to make the values a prominent part of every step: self-assessments, performance feedback, and goal setting.\nOnboarding \u2014 We have embedded the new leadership competency model into the recruiting and orientation processes for leadership roles.\nPresident\u2019s Goals \u2014 The President\u2019s FY23 goals include 11 items specific to improving our culture.\nRecognition \u2014 We have begun to integrate the Institute values into recognition and awards.\nWhat Is Next?\nIn addition to the Georgia Tech Culture Survey, here are a few of the key actions planned for L.O.V.E. GT in the coming months:\nIncorporate the newly developed Georgia Tech leadership competencies into next year\u2019s performance management cycle.\nContinue to celebrate and recognize our community through the annual staff and faculty awards, peer-to-peer recognition, and GT Cares Week.\nDeploy a toolkit to equip the community with resources to understand, recognize, and identify how Georgia Tech\u2019s values can be implemented into daily practices and behaviors.\nMore broadly, faculty and staff are actively working to improve their culture in numerous efforts. To nurture community well-being, some leaders are participating in, and encouraging employees to attend, campus wellness events, workshops, and programs to improve holistic well-being. Some teams are working to improve employee well-being by increasing internal communication and fostering team development.\n\u201cOur culture is what we make of it.\u00a0Through the strategic planning process as a community we identified the values that we embraced and to which we aspired. It\u2019s now up to all of us to be active participants in shaping our culture by striving to Live Our Values Every Day,\u201d said Neville.\nTo learn more or become involved in L.O.V.E.
