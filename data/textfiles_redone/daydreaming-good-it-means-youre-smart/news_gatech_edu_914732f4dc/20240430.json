It Means You\u2019re Smart\nPeople with efficient brains may have too much brain capacity to stop their minds from wandering.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nEmail\nPhoto credit: iStock/fixkes\nOct 24, 2017\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nA new study from the Georgia Institute of Technology suggests that daydreaming during meetings isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing. It might be a sign that you\u2019re really smart and creative.\n\u201cPeople with efficient brains may have too much brain capacity to stop their minds from wandering,\u201d said Eric Schumacher, the Georgia Tech associate psychology professor who co-authored the study.\nSchumacher and his students and colleagues, including lead co-author Christine Godwin, measured the brain patterns of more than 100 people while they lay in an MRI machine. Participants were instructed to focus on a stationary fixation point for five minutes. The Georgia Tech team used the data to identify which parts of the brain worked in unison.\n\u201cThe correlated brain regions gave us insight about which areas of the brain work together during an awake, resting state,\u201d said Godwin, a Georgia Tech psychology Ph.D. candidate.\n\u201cInterestingly, research has suggested that these same brain patterns measured during these states are related to different cognitive abilities.\u201d\nOnce they figured out how the brain works together at rest, the team compared the data with tests the participants that measured their intellectual and creative ability. Participants also filled out a questionnaire about how much their mind wandered in daily life.\nThose who reported more frequent daydreaming scored higher on intellectual and creative ability and had more efficient brain systems measured in the MRI machine.\n\u201cPeople tend to think of mind wandering as something that is bad. You try to pay attention and you can\u2019t,\u201d said Schumacher. \u201cOur data are consistent with the idea that this isn\u2019t always true. Some people have more efficient brains.\u201d\nSchumacher says higher efficiency means more capacity to think, and the brain may mind wander when performing easy tasks.\nHow can you tell if your brain is efficient? One clue is that you can zone in and out of conversations or tasks when appropriate, then naturally tune back in without missing important points or steps.\n\u201cOur findings remind me of the absent-minded professor \u2014 someone who\u2019s brilliant, but off in his or her own world, sometimes oblivious to their own surroundings,\u201d said Schumacher. \u201cOr school children who are too intellectually advanced for their classes. While it may take five minutes for their friends to learn something new, they figure it out in a minute, then check out and start daydreaming.\u201d\nGodwin and Schumacher think the findings open the door for follow-up research to further understand when mind wandering is harmful, and when it may actually be helpful.\n\"There are important individual differences to consider as well, such as a person's motivation or intent to stay focused on a particular task,\u201d said Godwin.\nThe paper, \u201c Functional connectivity within and between intrinsic brain networks correlates with trait mind wandering ,\u201d is published in the journal Neuropsychologia.\nThe research is based upon work supported by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (award number 2014-13121700006).
