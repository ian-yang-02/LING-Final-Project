The study, which was published July 1 in\nAstrophysical Journal Letters\nand led by Michigan State University, shows the first results from the Renaissance Simulations, a suite of extremely high-resolution adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) calculations of\nhigh redshift galaxy formation . The simulations show hundreds of well-resolved galaxies, allowing researchers to make several novel and verifiable predictions ahead of the October 2018 launch of the\nJames Webb Space Telescope (JWST) , a new space observatory that succeeds the\nHubble Space Telescope . \u201cThe Hubble Space Telescope can only see what we might call the tip of the iceberg when it comes to taking inventory of the most distant galaxies,\u201d said San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC) Director Michael Norman, who was part of the study\u2019s research team. \u201cA key question is how many galaxies are too faint to see. By analyzing these new, ultra-detailed simulations, we find that there are 10 to 100 times fewer galaxies than a simple extrapolation would predict.\u201d \u201cOur work suggests that there are far fewer faint galaxies than one could previously infer,\u201d said principal investigator and lead author Brian O\u2019Shea, an associate professor at Michigan State. \u201cObservations of high redshift galaxies provide poor constraints on the low-luminosity end of the galaxy luminosity function, and thus make it challenging to accurately account for the full budget of ionizing photons during that epoch.\u201d Georgia Tech Assistant Professor John Wise wrote the code that made the simulations possible on Blue Waters. He also interpreted the data to make predictions for the JWST, serving as a \u201csimulation architect\u201d by setting the simulation parameters. Wise and his fellow researchers found that the ultraviolet luminosity function of the simulated galaxies is consistent with observations of redshift galaxy populations at the bright end of the luminosity function and essentially flat rather than rising steeply at lower luminosities. \u201cThe flattening at lower luminosities is a key finding in the study and significant to researchers\u2019 understanding of the reionization of the universe, when the gas in the universe changed from being mostly neutral to mostly ionized,\u201d said Wise, Dunn Family Assistant Professor in Georgia Tech\u2019s School of Physics. The term \u2018reionized\u2019 is used because the universe was ionized immediately after the fiery Big Bang. During that time, ordinary matter consisted mostly of hydrogen atoms with positively charged protons stripped of their negatively charged electrons. Eventually, the universe cooled enough for electrons and protons to combine and form neutral hydrogen. They didn\u2019t give off any optical or UV light, and without that light astrophysicists aren\u2019t able to see traces of how the cosmos evolved during these dark ages using conventional telescopes. The light returned when reionization began. Because these simulations are so costly to generate, the team moved the entire output of the Renaissance Simulations to SDSC Cloud\u2013 some 100 terabytes of data, or the equivalent of about 150,000 audio compact discs. \u201cA data access portal is being set up so that others can investigate their properties in more detail,\u201d added Norman, also a distinguished professor of physics at UC San Diego and a faculty member with the Center for Astrophysics & Space Sciences at the university. The results are detailed in the paper, titled Probing the Ultraviolet Luminosity Function of the Earliest Galaxies with the Renaissance Simulations. In an earlier paper , simulations conducted by two researchers who were part of this new study concluded that about 300 million years after the \u201cBig Bang,\u201d the universe was 20 percent ionized, 50 percent ionized at 550 million years, and fully ionized at 860 million years after its creation.\u00a0 While the James Webb Space Telescope will give cosmic researchers the ability to view and record substantial numbers of galaxies, the telescope has a relatively small field of view, according to the researchers. As a result, interpretation of any JWST survey must by necessity take into account cosmic variance \u2013 the statistical variation in the number of galaxies from place to place. A deeper understanding based on theory may be necessary to correctly interpret high redshift survey results. The simulations were done on the National Science Foundation-funded Blue Waters supercomputer, one of the largest academic supercomputers in the world. The research team also included Hao Xu, a postdoctoral research associate with the Center for Astrophysics & Space Sciences, at the University of California, San Diego. The research was funded by the National Science Foundation and NASA.\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nRead the study\nContact\nJason Maderer National Media Relations maderer@gatech.edu 404-385-2926\nEmail\nmaderer@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
