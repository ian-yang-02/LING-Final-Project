Using Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, the company saw a 10 percent increase in efficiency without having to add new infrastructure or use more power.\nRobert Schmid, chief IoT technologist at Deloitte, shared this real-life business solution and others during the keynote address of the Georgia Institute of Technology\u2019s Center for the Development and Application of Internet of Things Technologies (CDAIT) international conference on the Internet of Things (IoT) and sustainability held July 18, 2019, at the Georgia Tech Research Institute in Atlanta.\nTitled \u201cThe Internet of Things for Sustainability is Smart Business,\u201d the conference drew more than 400 registered attendees and explored catalysts to examine some of the key promises and challenges that relate to the application of IoT technologies toward building a sustainable world. The conference also aimed to address different aspects of IoT, and how this technology could be used in multiple industries, from energy to transportation, financial services to healthcare, and environment to smart cities.\n\u201cWe need to be rooted in technology because it\u2019s complex,\u201d said Alain Louchez, managing director of the Georgia Tech CDAIT. \u201cHowever, solving related human and business problems, a critical focus at CDAIT, are paramount to a successful IoT deployment. At the end of the day, regardless of the inherent beauty of the technological solution, effectively and efficiently meeting customers\u2019 present and future needs remains the acid test for IoT.\u201d\nIoT connects a wide range of devices with smart capabilities and is increasingly seen as a core component of corporate and societal digital transformation. Sustainability or sustainable development \u2013 that which meets \u201cthe needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs,\u201d according to the United Nations\nBrundtland Report\n\u2014 is now viewed by businesses as\nmission critical .\nConference attendees included business, academic and government leaders who are working to bring cohesion and greater development of IoT across various business sectors. \u00a0Bilel Jamoussi, chief of the Study Groups Department, International Telecommunication Union (ITU) Standardization Bureau, opened the conference with a video message from Geneva. He was followed by Schmid\u2019s address and one of two roundtables which addressed how IoT technologies could be a game changer for sustainability as well as education and training needed to meet business objectives. Participants also attended five break-out sessions focused on government regulation and policy, design and operation of smart buildings and smart homes, sustainable manufacturing, supply chain and logistics and consumer products.\nAccording to the World Economic Forum, IoT could become a game-changer for sustainability because of its technology. IoT is about measuring and remotely controlling things that were previously unconnected, reaching people and objects that technology could previously not reach, and in the process it also supports sustainable development elements.\nAbout CDAIT\nThe Center for the Development and Application of Internet of Things Technologies (CDAIT, pronounced \u201csedate\u201d) is a global, nonprofit, partner-funded center located in Atlanta that fosters interdisciplinary research and education while driving general awareness about the Internet of Things (IoT). CDAIT bridges sponsors with Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech) faculty and researchers, as well as industry members with similar interests. Central to its value proposition is the belief that only a holistic approach, i.e., mindful of the complexity of the entire IoT value chain and the intricate relationships between the various links, can generate superior results. CDAIT\u2019s broad overarching goal is to expand and promote IoT\u2019s huge potential and transformational capabilities. CDAIT aims to efficiently identify, understand, and solve challenges and problems that may arise along the entire Internet of Things value chain through six Working Groups: IoT Education and Training; IoT Startup Ecosystem; IoT Thought Leadership; IoT Security and Privacy; IoT Standards and Management; and IoT Research.\nLearn more about CDAIT at\u00a0 www.cdait.gatech.edu .\nAdditional Images\nContact\nMedia Contact: Denise Ward, 404-385-2966,\ndenise.ward@comm.gatech.edu\nEmail\ndenise.ward@comm.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
