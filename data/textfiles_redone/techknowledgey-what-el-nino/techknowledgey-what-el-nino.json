It\u2019s not exactly a beach trip. It\u2019s a research project that will focus on dying coral, one of the major casualties of this season\u2019s El Ni\u00f1o. Kim Cobb, a professor in the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences, is leading the team, which will arrive at the research site on March 29.\u00a0 El Ni\u00f1o\u00a0is an ocean current that appears every few years to shake up the global thermometer, and this year's was one of the strongest ever. But what exactly is this climate phenomenon? Cobb tells us in this version of Tech+Knowledge+Y, describing some of El Ni\u00f1o\u2019s effects, its role in global warming, and how this winter's current is setting the table for a very active hurricane season later this year. Tech+knowledge+Y is a series featuring Georgia Tech faculty members explaining complex topics in simple terms. From back holes to earthquakes to the secret language of science fiction, you'll learn about it in this monthly series.\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nKim Cobb\nContact\nJason Maderer National Media Relations maderer@gatech.edu 404-660-2926\nEmail\nmaderer@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
