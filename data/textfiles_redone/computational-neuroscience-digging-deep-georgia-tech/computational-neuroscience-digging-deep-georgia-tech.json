A community of multidisciplinary researchers at Georgia Tech is decrypting that neuronal chatter, which may hold the key to better treatments for disease and addiction, advanced robotics and artificial intelligence (AI), and even global energy efficiency.\nThese researchers work in the realm of\u00a0 computational neuroscience , a branch of neuroscience that uses mathematical models, computer simulations, and theoretical analysis of the brain to gain a deeper understanding of the nervous system.\n\"We want to understand the brain and the important data that we gather from this amazing, mysterious organ,\u201d said\u00a0 Chethan Pandarinath , assistant professor in the\u00a0 Wallace H. Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering at Georgia Tech and Emory University . \u201cBut for a long time, we really didn\u2019t have the adequate tools.\u201d\nBasically, the ability to look at the brain and gather large amounts of data from it has advanced rapidly \u2014 faster than our ability to understand it all.\n\u201cThere has been an explosion of technology over the past five or 10 years,\u201d Pandarinath said. \u201cSo, we\u2019re moving into a different space in the ways we approach the brain, and the ways we think about it.\u201d\nMuch of that explosion \u2014 manifested at Georgia Tech and its partner institutions, like Emory, in the form of\u00a0 additional academic offerings \u00a0as well as research interest \u2014 has been fueled by the\u00a0 BRAIN Initiative , launched by President Barack Obama in 2014. That global research program has identified computational neuroscience (among other things) as an area where progress is most needed.\nThe wish list includes improvements in machine learning, AI, and crowdsourcing approaches to translating the massive volume of data being gathered from human brains. And Georgia Tech researchers have their hands in every area.\nPandarinath\u2019s lab, for example, is using AI tools and the insights gained from the brain\u2019s neural networks \u2014\u00a0 and support from the National Institutes of Health \u00a0\u2014\u00a0 to develop revolutionary assistive devices for people with disabilities or neurological disorders.\nHe also spearheaded the\u00a0 Neural Latents Benchmark Challenge \u00a0on GitHub. These competitions attracted a diverse range of teams that created new models for analyzing large data sets of neural activity.\n\u201cThis was our effort to accelerate progress at the intersection of neuroscience, machine learning, and artificial intelligence,\u201d Pandarinath said.\nThe challenge illustrated a need for multiple perspectives and disciplines in computational neuroscience \u2014 the winning team of the first competition in January was a firm called\u00a0 AE Studio , a software development, data science, and product design company that doesn\u2019t ordinarily focus on neuroscience but develops potent mathematical and machine-learning tools.\n\u201cThis field is multidisciplinary and collaborative by nature and necessity,\u201d said\u00a0 Tansu Celikel, \u00a0chair of Georgia Tech\u2019s\u00a0 School of Psychology , who wants to understand complex behaviors controlled by the brain in order to make smarter, more intuitive robots.\n\u201cIt begs for biologists, psychologists, mathematicians, physicists, data scientists \u2014 people from the machine learning and AI worlds \u2014 to come together and advance the state of computation and brain research,\" Celikel added. \"With that in mind, Georgia Tech is in an excellent position to make a significant impact and become a global center for this kind of research.\u201d\nCelikel and Pandarinath are just two of the researchers at Georgia Tech in computational neuroscience, a wide-ranging field that relies on collaborations between data scientists, experimentalists, and clinicians, who are forming partnerships across schools, colleges, universities, and disciplines. A small sampling of the people connecting the brain\u2019s neuronal dots and expanding this body of research at Georgia Tech include:\nHannah Choi\n\u2022 Assistant Professor,\u00a0 School of Mathematics\n\u2022\u00a0 Research Group in Mathematical Neuroscience\nNeuroscience wasn\u2019t part of Choi\u2019s plans. But while working toward her Ph.D. in applied \u00admathematics, \u201cI got really interested in nonlinear dynamical systems, a big topic in applied mathematics,\u201d she said. Such systems seem to be chaotic, unpredictable, and counterintuitive \u2014 pretty much like most systems in nature. \u201cI soon realized the brain is the most exciting nonlinear dynamical system, and that I could apply my mathematical tools and develop computational theories to better understand the brain.\u201d\nEarlier this year, Choi\u2019s work in applying math to neuroscience earned her a prestigious\u00a0 2022 Sloan Research Fellowship , which goes to the nation\u2019s most promising young scientific researchers. Since launching her lab at Georgia Tech in January 2021, Choi has continued her collaboration with the Seattle-based Allen Institute in studying how information is processed in neural networks of many different scales, while starting partnerships with several Georgia Tech and Emory researchers, including Simon Sponberg, Anqi Wu, Nabil Imam, Chris Rodgers, Ming-fai Fong, and Dieter Jaeger, working in the sprawling computational neuroscience world.\nLike some of her Georgia Tech colleagues, Choi also wants to address the problem of the environmental footprint being made by all of this computation and AI in her chosen field. \u201cThe idea is to apply what we have learned about our very energy-efficient brains to the development of better, more efficient artificial neural networks.\u201d\nEva Dyer\n\u2022 Assistant Professor,\u00a0 Wallace H. Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering\n\u2022\u00a0 Neural Data Science (NERDS) Lab\nDyer leads a diverse team of researchers in developing machine learning approaches to analyze and interpret massive, complex neural data sets. Winner of a\u00a0 McKnight Technology Award \u00a0and\u00a0 BRAIN Award \u00a0in recent years, Dyer\u2019s interest in the brain is rooted in her love of music \u2014 being keen on how we perceive sound at the neuronal level.\nAs a postdoctoral student she developed a\u00a0 cryptography-inspired strategy \u00a0for decoding neural conversations. Now one of the\u00a0 leading young researchers in computational neuroscience , Dyer directs a lab that routinely presents research at high-profile conferences like\u00a0 NeurIPS . Her team is \u201cessentially interested in how the coordinated activity of large collections of neurons are being modified or changing in the presence of something like disease,\u201d she said.\n\u201cUltimately, with the information we gather and analyze, we hope to discover biomarkers of Alzheimer\u2019s and other diseases,\u201d added Dyer, who worked with Pandarinath to develop the Benchmark Challenge. \u201cThe idea is to catch changes in neural activity that are happening before we actually see the cognitive deficits.\u201d\nDobromir Rahnev\n\u2022 Associate Professor,\u00a0 School of Psychology\n\u2022\u00a0 Perception, Neuroimaging, and Modeling Lab\nRahnev uses a combination of neuroimaging and computational modeling to reveal the mechanisms of perception and decision-making in humans.\nA recipient of the American Psychological Association\u00a0 Distinguished Scientific Award for an Early Career Contribution to Psychology \u00a0and the Vision Science Society\u00a0 Young Investigator Award , Rahnev has already made important contributions to our understanding of how people perceive the world and make decisions. He has recently started to investigate how deep neural networks \u2014 which have established themselves as state-of-the-art computer vision algorithms \u2014 can serve as excellent models for the perceptual and decisional processes in the human brain.\n\u201cOne of my strongest passions is to make science more open in every sense of the word,\u201d said Rahnev, who organized the\u00a0 Confidence Database , the largest field-specific database of open data in the behavioral sciences. \u201cIt\u2019s important for me to be involved in efforts to attract and retain people from underrepresented groups in cognitive and computational neuroscience.\u201d\nChris Rozell\n\u2022 Professor; Julian T. Hightower Chair,\u00a0 School of Electrical and Computer Engineering\n\u2022\u00a0 Sensory Information Processing Lab\nRozell describes his lab\u2019s focus on computational neuroengineering \u00a0 as a combination of data science, neurotechnology, and computational modeling, with the goal of advancing the understanding of brain function, leading to the development of intelligent machine systems and effective interventions for disease.\n\u201cOne of the projects in our lab that is really compelling right now is a novel therapy for patients with treatment-resistant depression,\u201d said\u00a0Rozell, whose lab is partnering with a clinical team to improve this experimental treatment for patients who have not responded to any currently approved therapy. \u201cSo, no drugs help them. No psychotherapy. No electroconvulsive therapy. We\u2019re using deep brain stimulation.\u201d\nThe results have been positive for patients, and the researchers are, \u201cgetting an objective readout, for the first time, of what\u2019s happening in their brains,\u201d Rozell said, thanks to a new generation of machine-learning tools called \u201cexplainable AI.\u201d \u201cWith these new approaches, we can gain a deeper understanding of the disease, which can lead to more personalized therapies.\u201d\nLewis Wheaton\n\u2022 Associate Professor, School of Biological Sciences\n\u2022\u00a0 Cognitive Motor Control Lab\nWhen he isn\u2019t helping to lead the city of Smyrna as a city councilman, Wheaton is leading a research effort that could lead to user-friendly prosthetic devices and improved motor rehabilitation training, particularly for people with upper limb amputation.\n\u201cThere are a lot of beautifully developed upper limb prostheses available right now, but one of the big challenges is they\u2019re just not heavily used by individuals \u2014 partly because they\u2019re really, really expensive, but also because they\u2019re such an easy thing to\u00a0 not \u00a0use,\u201d said Wheaton. \u201cIt\u2019s very easy to just take it off and never wear it at all.\u201d\nWhich is why much of Wheaton\u2019s research is focused on acquiring and studying data that shows what upper limb amputees are thinking or feeling while using, or trying to use, a prosthesis. Integrating a patient\u2019s neural activity with observations of behavior and gaze patterns, the team is \u201cgathering data that\u2019s never really been acquired before,\u201d Wheaton said.\n\u201cThis will help us gather more information that is helpful in developing new rehabilitation protocols for persons learning how to use prostheses. A better understanding of how rehabilitation efforts are influenced by different types of prostheses can also inform engineers and the marketplace on the type of prostheses we should be developing.\u201d\nAnqi Wu\n\u2022 Assistant Professor, School of Computer Science and Engineering\n\u2022\u00a0BRAin INtelligence and Machine Learning Laboratory\nOne of Georgia Tech\u2019s newest computational neuroscientist faculty members, Wu is building her research enterprise around building advanced machine-learning models for neural and behavioral analyses.\n\u201cI want to help experimental neuroscientists to understand their data and draw scientific conclusions,\u201d she said, pointing out that these collaborators\u00a0are collecting larger and larger populations of neurons across the whole brain, as well as more naturalistic animal behaviors. \u201cHow to integrate these big data sets and extract multilayer knowledge to understand different perspectives of the brain is a very challenging problem.\u201d\nWu, who came to Georgia Tech in Spring 2022, aims to develop sophisticated latent variable models to address those issues. These computational models are essentially used to project high-dimensional data from large neural populations across large brain areas into useful, low-dimensional (i.e., interpretable) information that experimental neuroscientists can use.\nMore Neuro News\nBallet and Neuro Ethics Come Together at Georgia Tech\nSerpooshan Lab Creates 3D-Printed Tool to Study Neuroblastoma\nWriter: Jerry Grillo\nPhotos: Joya Chapman\nAdditional Images\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
