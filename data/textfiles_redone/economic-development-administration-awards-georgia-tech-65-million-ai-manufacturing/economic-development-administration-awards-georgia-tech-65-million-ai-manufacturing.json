The grant will increase job and wage opportunities in distressed and rural communities, as well as among historically underrepresented and underserved groups.\nThe Georgia Artificial Intelligence Manufacturing Technology Corridor (GA-AIM) effort is one of 21 winning projects the White House\nannounced today\nunder the Biden administration\u2019s $1 billion\u00a0 Build Back Better Regional Challenge . The award follows a $500,000\nPhase 1 feasibility grant\nthe project received in 2021.\n\u201cGeorgia Tech is honored to lead this vision of collaborative innovation and economic development across all regions of our state,\u201d said Georgia Tech President \u00c1ngel Cabrera. \u201cThis award underscores the Institute's commitment to leverage our resources and expertise to address great challenges, serve our state and nation, and amplify our impact on the world.\u201d\nThe selected awardees represent projects in 24 states with grant amounts ranging from $25 million to $65 million.\n\u201cAs we invest and grow critical industries in the U.S., we want to create industry hubs in diverse communities across the country,\u201d U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo said in a statement. \u201cThese grants will provide critical and historic funding directly to community coalitions to invest in new infrastructure, research and development, and workforce development programs while creating good-paying jobs, supporting workers, and prioritizing equity.\u201d\nThe GA-AIM project is led by\nAaron Stebner , associate professor in the\nGeorge W. Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering\nand the\nSchool of Materials Science and Engineering ;\nDonna Ennis , director of Diversity Engagement and Program Development in Georgia Tech\u2019s\u00a0 Enterprise Innovation Institute\nand also director of its\nGeorgia MBDA Business Center ; and\nThomas R. Kurfess , executive director of the Georgia Tech Manufacturing Institute.\n\u201cThe ability\u00a0to integrate our discoveries and innovations here at the AI Manufacturing Pilot Facility with novel workforce programs and transformative outreach experiences is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to do something greater in ways that increase opportunity and prosperity for all Georgians,\u201d Stebner said. \u201cThrough an equitable AI manufacturing innovation focus, the assembled\u00a0coalition of partners and stakeholders across the state will\u00a0build a more prosperous and resilient Georgia and set a nation-leading example.\u201d\nThe\nAI Manufacturing Pilot Facility , which will allow for government and industry pilot trials, cybersecurity games, and workforce training for AI manufacturing technologies, is just one component of Georgia Tech\u2019s support for the project.\nTwo of Georgia Tech\u2019s commercialization programs \u2014\u00a0 VentureLab\nand\nI-Corps South\n\u2014 will create a center for the commercialization of AI manufacturing technologies into local and regional startups through training built on the National Science Foundation\u2019s I-Corps curriculum.\nThe Enterprise Innovation Institute, Georgia Tech\u2019s economic development arm, will engage in focused outreach and technical assistance to small- and mid-sized manufacturers and minority business enterprises through its\nGeorgia Manufacturing Extension Partnership\n(GaMEP) and\nGeorgia MBDA Business Center\nprograms. Other Enterprise Innovation Institute programs include the\nEconomic Development Lab , the\nPartnership for Inclusive Innovation , and\nATDC , which will focus on outreach and engagement in distressed and underserved parts of the state, create workforce development programs, implementation strategies, and attract outside investment.\n\u201cThe work that we will accomplish with our broad spectrum of partners in this new endeavor will leverage the latest technology in artificial intelligence to grow and strengthen our workforce ensuring that the growing manufacturing sector in Georgia has the skilled workforce that it requires for today\u2019s as well as tomorrow\u2019s needs,\u201d Kurfess said. \u201cAt the same the high paying and secure jobs will be going to a very diverse population base from across the state, providing an equitable robust future for all citizens of Georgia.\u201d\nGeorgia Tech\u2019s\nSupply Chain & Logistics Institute\nwill study the impact of automation technologies, build automation solutions tailored for rural manufacturers, and create programs that lower the barrier for rural manufacturers\u2019 access to use the AI Manufacturing Pilot Facility.\nFinally, Georgia Tech\u2019s\nK-12 InVenture Prize\nand\nCenter for Education Integrating Science, Mathematics and Computing\nprograms will expand their emphasis to rural and underserved areas of the state by piloting a rural regional event with a region-specific prize. They will also create supplemental lessons centered on AI and data science that will be part of a K-12 InVenture Prize curriculum website.\n\u201cWe are excited to be a part of this collaborative effort to catalyze research and innovation in AI and manufacturing across the state of Georgia,\u201d said Chaouki T. Abdallah, executive vice president for Research at Georgia Tech. \u201cThis project aligns with our goals to expand economic opportunity in our state's underserved communities, and to serve as a collaborative hub for interdisciplinary research that advances technology and improves people\u2019s lives.\u201d\nGeorgia Tech is working with a coalition of statewide partners to create a foundation that supports existing business growth and new business ventures across the state especially in underserved communities and rural Georgia.\n\u201cAll across the state of Georgia, our programs in the Enterprise Innovation Institute work hard to unlock potential and foster economic opportunity for all, particularly in underserved and marginalized communities,\u201d said David Bridges, vice president of the Enterprise Innovation Institute, and co-author of the grant proposal with Stebner. \u201cThis project leverages what we and our partners each do best to help achieve our broader Georgia AIM goals.\u201d\nTech\u2019s partners include the:\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Georgia Department of Community Affairs\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Georgia Cyber Center\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Houston County Development Authority\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 KITTLabs\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Russell Innovation Center for Entrepreneurs\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Robins Air Force Base 21st Century Partnership\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Spelman College\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Southwest Georgia Regional Commission\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Technologists of Color\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Technology Association of Georgia Education Collaborative\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Technical College System of Georgia\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 University of Georgia\n\u201cWhat's really special about this effort\u00a0is that it's centered on a wholistic approach with innovation, not just one piece of AI or manufacturing,\u201d Ennis said. \u201cWe're working collectively statewide to transform and propel forward our industry, communities, and most importantly, our people.\u201d\nThat collective approach is critical to GA-AIM\u2019s success, said Houston County Development Authority Executive Director Angie Gheesling.\n\u201cThe Development Authority and the 21st Century Partnership lead the Middle Georgia Innovation Project, which includes 11 counties in the Middle Georgia region, a diverse landscape of communities from rural to urban,\u201d she said. \u201cThis award further facilitates the continuation of several years of collaboration between local leadership, our universities, private industry, and Robins Air Force Base to position ourselves as a Software Center of Excellence. We are grateful to Georgia Tech for the opportunity to partner and contribute to the overall future success of GA-AIM.\u201d\nBurunda Prince, chief operating officer of the Russell Innovation Center for Entrepreneurs, echoed those sentiments, saying its reach is exponentially amplified through the GA-AIM partnership.\nThe Center will create a mobile, 5,000-square-foot LaunchPad AI Innovation Studio to provide prototyping and proof-of-concept development of physical products. Black entrepreneurs in rural and urban Georgia will have access to equipment, training, and mentoring, and LaunchPad AI will also be open to AI InVenture teams from Atlanta\u2019s urban K-12 schools.\n\u201c As part of the Build Back Better grant, the Russell Innovation Center for Entrepreneurs will help Black businesses leverage the benefits of artificial intelligence to provide better data and insights that will build stronger companies and drive greater wealth generation,\u201d Prince said. \u201cWhat makes this opportunity unique is the cross collaboration of partners which will engage and empower communities across Georgia through access to technologies that often are inaccessible.\u201d\nEqually as important is the education component and the ability for it to be a bridge to new skills and opportunities for Georgia workers, said Technical College System of Georgia Commissioner Greg Dozier.\n\u201cThe funding for the project will equip four TCSG colleges with state-of-the-art manufacturing studios that will showcase the clean, safe state of modern manufacturing,\u201d Dozier said. \u201cAutomation in manufacturing creates a demand for more skilled jobs, giving TCSG the charge to strengthen the workforce pipeline by training Georgians in these exciting, new technologies. The Georgia AIM project provides the funding to meet these opportunities head on.\u201d\n###\nAbout the U.S. Economic Development Administration\nThe mission of the U.S. Economic Development Administration (EDA) is to lead the federal economic development agenda by promoting competitiveness and preparing the nation's regions for growth and success in the worldwide economy.
