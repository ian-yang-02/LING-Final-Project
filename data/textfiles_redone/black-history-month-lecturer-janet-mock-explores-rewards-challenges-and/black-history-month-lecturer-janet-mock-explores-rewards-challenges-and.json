In the celebration of Black History Month, last week\u2019s invited speaker focused on the overlooked contributions of queer black people.\nJanet Mock, an activist, author, and media personality, discussed the rewards, challenges, and implications of being black and trans as the featured speaker for Georgia Tech\u2019s\nFourth Annual Black History Month Lecture . The visit was co-sponsored by Institute Diversity, African American Student Union (AASU), and the LGBTQIA Resource Center.\n\u201cBy bringing the achievements of queer black people to the forefront, we hope to honor these exceptional individuals and uncover histories that educate, inspire, and uplift,\u201d said Adreanna Nattiel, graduate assistant in the LGBTQIA Resource Center.\nThroughout her speech, Mock emphasized the importance of storytelling. \u201cIt gave me visibility and voice and allowed me to shift conversations such as living at the intersections of gender, race, and class, how restrictive gender expectations oppress us all, and the significance of media representation.\u201d\nShe began with her own story of living in conflict as a young person to \u201cexpress femininity in a culture that often demeans and devalues feminine people, is binary-prone, and mandates that if you are born with certain body parts, you are not allowed to express who you truly are.\u201d\nMock said many black transgender women are struggling with interconnected issues of homelessness, joblessness, and lack of access to health care and education. \u201cOur history as trans and queer people of color fighting against poverty, policing, brutality, hunger, racism, misogyny, and HIV/AIDS is deep,\u201d she said. \u201cYet despite the tragedies, there is great resilience in our communities.\u201d\n\u201cWe must remember that telling our stories can be met with love, understanding, transcendence, and community, which has brought all of us here.\u201d\nMock charged the audience to use its voice, story, privilege, and access to ignite change, and offered guidance \u201ctoward becoming more conscious partners in the struggle:\u201d\nRealize allyship is not a label or identity but an action that requires self-education.\nDon\u2019t be basic: Keep it intersectional.\nRemember when you donate your skills, time, and/or money, you are working with a group of people who are already working toward their own liberation.\nRecognize your privilege and use the access that it has given you to uplift marginalized voices.\nAs AASU Black History Chair Raianna Brown reflected, \u201cI was moved by the vulnerability and realness of Janet Mock. At the end of the lecture, she opened up about the difficulties in being strong for your community and how becoming a symbol can sometimes be alienating. However, you can draw strength to keep going from those who came before us.\u201d\n\u201cThis lecture was one of the most inspirational events that I have seen at Georgia Tech,\u201d said Archie Ervin, vice president for Institute Diversity. \u201cIt takes tremendous courage to share your own journey publicly, and the Georgia Tech community immediately embraced her story \u2014 rewards and challenges alike.\u201d\nTo learn more about the Black History Month Lecture, visit\nwww.diversity.gatech.edu .
