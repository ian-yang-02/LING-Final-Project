They used the prototypes to evaluate different power levels and disinfection times with a variety of face shields and face masks used to protect workers from the coronavirus.\n\u201cThere are tradeoffs in terms of cost, lifetime, and potential heat generated,\u201d said T. Robert Harris, a GTRI research engineer. \u201cWe wanted to evaluate these issues so that when others use UV-C for disinfecting PPE, they will have information to make good choices.\u201d\nThe goal was to provide disinfection chambers as small as possible to allow portability. The chambers were built to accommodate face masks and at least one face shield \u2013 a curved sheet of clear plastic that covers the entire face and protects against large droplets that could contain coronavirus. The portability of the chambers could allow them to be used anywhere PPE disinfection is needed.\n\u201cWe wanted a box that would fit on an ambulance or in a police car so that public service staff who are coming into contact with a lot of people on a regular basis would be able to disinfect their PPE,\u201d Harris said. \u201cThis method offers an advantage over chemical disinfection because it doesn\u2019t require drying time or risk of chemical absorption.\u201d\nOriginally, the project aimed at disinfecting PPE while it was being worn by having healthcare workers walk past an ultraviolet source while going from one hospital room to another. That idea was dropped because the wavelengths needed to inactivate the virus \u2013 280 nanometers \u2013 can cause skin and eye damage in humans.\nFor that reason, the prototype portable disinfection chambers include a safety interlock to prevent the door from being opened while the UV light is on. Disinfection takes about eight minutes, depending on the intensity of UV emissions, which vary by the lighting source. The chambers are designed to be cleaned between uses.\n\u201cHealthcare workers would put their face masks and face shields into the box, close the lid, and set the timer,\u201d Harris explained. \u201cThey would swap out one set of PPE while the other set was being disinfected.\u201d\nUltraviolet light can damage plastic items, but Harris and his colleagues didn\u2019t attempt to evaluate how many disinfection cycles the PPE could withstand. \u201cYou would expect UV to ultimately degrade PPE materials in the same way that sunlight slowly degrades polymer materials,\u201d he said.\nThe research team designed the chambers to provide the level of UV exposure that earlier studies had shown would inactivate the closely related SARs-CoV virus by damaging its outer shell and RNA. The researchers did not attempt to evaluate the ability of the UV light to inactivate the SARS-Cov-2 virus that causes Covid-19.\nOther engineering considerations included the need for cooling the UV sources, providing consistent exposure of the PPE to UV light using reflective walls in the chambers, and protecting the mercury vapor lamps from damage during use.\nUltraviolet light is now used in water and wastewater sanitation, food disinfection, killing pathogens in HVAC systems, and other purposes. Because of the growing number of applications, finding enough mercury vapor lamps and LED sources was a challenge for the research program, which was funded by GTRI\u2019s independent research and development program.\nHarris hopes the project will encourage others to further develop UV-based portable disinfection systems to supplement other methods for protecting people who encounter the coronavirus.\n\u201cThis work is part of a realization that multiple tools \u2013 including handwashing, surface disinfection, face masks, UV disinfection, social distancing, and other steps \u2013 are important and much more powerful when done together,\u201d he said. \u201cWe should all use every tool we have at our disposal to combat this virus and really think about things carefully to break every link in the chain of contagious transmission.\u201d\nBeyond Harris, the research team included Roger Campbell, Ashton Hattori, Eric Brown, Christopher Hollis, Max Schureck, Howard Atchley, John Stone, Michael Grady, and Benjamin Yang.\nResearch News\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\n177 North Avenue\nAtlanta, Georgia\u00a0 30332-0181\u00a0 USA\nMedia Relations Contact : John Toon (404-894-6986) (jtoon@gatech.edu).\nWriter : John Toon\nAdditional Images\nContact\nJohn Toon\nResearch News\n(404) 894-6986\nEmail\njtoon@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
