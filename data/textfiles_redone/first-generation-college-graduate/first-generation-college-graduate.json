(Photo by Rob Felt)\nMay 04, 2023\nThis weekend, Frida Carrera will become the first person in her family to graduate from college. The Forest Park, Georgia, resident is receiving a degree from Georgia Tech with a double major in\nbusiness\nand in\nliterature, media, and communication .\n\u201cMy parents and family have made some immense sacrifices for me to be where I am today, and it will pay off once I walk on the stage and receive my degree,\u201d said Carrera. \u201cComing from a low-income background and an underrepresented minority group, I hope to inspire my younger family members that they can achieve anything they put their minds to, especially in higher education.\u201d\nAlthough they did not attend college, Carrera\u2019s parents were determined to set her on the path toward higher education by enrolling her in a college preparatory school. She attended Elite Scholars Academy, a charter school in Clayton County, Georgia, and later was dually enrolled at Clayton State University. While in high school she toured Georgia Tech and was interested in writing and communications as well as business.\n\u201cInitially I chose literature, media, and communication as my major and later added the business major because I became interested in marketing,\u201d she said. Her internship experience has been in marketing, and she plans to work in that field.\nHer advice to current students is to make the most of their time at Tech. \u201cEverybody\u2019s situations and aspirations are different, so it\u2019s up to you to make the best of what you have in order to realize your goals.\u201d\nJoining Carrera for Commencement will be her parents, two siblings, and other close family members.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nVictor Rogers\nInstitute Communications\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
