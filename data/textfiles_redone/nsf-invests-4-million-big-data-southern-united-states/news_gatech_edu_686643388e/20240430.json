A $4 million award from the National Science Foundation (NSF) will help apply data science and engineering to address those challenges.\nThe funding will continue support for the\nSouth Big Data Innovation Hub , an organization that helps 16 Southern States and the District of Columbia identify and utilize data science and engineering to address critical societal needs. One of four NSF-supported regional data hubs in the U.S., the South Big Data Hub is managed by the Georgia Institute of Technology and the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill.\n\"The Big Data Hubs provide a connective tissue for the data science ecosystem across sectors and domains,\u201d said Renata Rawlings-Goss, the Hub\u2019s executive director. \u201cI am deeply pleased by NSF's recommitment to the growth of the South Hub and our community. Over the last three years, we have made great strides within our priority areas and are looking to broaden that reach in the next four years.\u201d\nThe NSF-supported data hubs play four key roles: (1) Accelerating public-private partnerships that break down barriers between industry, academia and government, (2) Growing R&D communities that connect data scientists with domain scientists and practitioners, (3) Facilitating data sharing and shared cyber infrastructure and services, and (4) Building data science capacity for education and workforce development.\n\u201cThere is a global shortage of data science and analytics talent that is threatening the future of innovation,\u201d added Rawlings-Goss \u201cBy working across sectors, the South Hub joins in creating solutions to increase the capacity of universities and industry to work on pressing problems for our region and for the world.\u201d\nPriorities for the hubs are determined regionally to bring together collaborators that include academics, community leaders, local and state government executives, regional businesses, national laboratories and others, explained Srinivas Aluru, principal investigator for the Hub, which was launched in 2015 and won the 2019 Georgia Tech Outstanding Achievement in Research Development Award.\n\u201cWe want to collaborate to help solve regional problems using the resources of the Hub,\u201d explained Aluru, who is also co-executive director of the Institute for Data Engineering and Science at Georgia Tech. \u201cWe are addressing truly regional issues that affect more than one state and more than one set of collaborators. These are challenges that can only be addressed by bringing these groups together.\u201d\nThe south region is pursuing five major big data priorities:\nHealth and Disparities : High impact applications of data science in precision medicine, health analytics, and health disparities. \u201cIf you look at the health outcomes, they differ by ethnic groups. Trying to understand and address these health disparities is one of our big data challenges,\u201d Aluru said.\nSmart Cities and Communities : Collection and integration of data on infrastructure, sensors, and behavior to design efficient use of resources and services, and to achieve a higher quality, affordable lifestyle, as well as concrete applications of analytics and machine learning to improve the nation\u2019s energy production and smart grid.\nAdvanced Materials and Manufacturing:\nAccess to data infrastructure for creating new materials for advanced manufacturing in every state. \u201cManufacturing is very important to the Southeast, and we plan to workwith the state manufacturing extension partnerships in different states, trying to inject big data techniques into materials science and manufacturing to shorten the deployment cycle,\u201d Aluru added.\nEnvironment and Coastal Hazards : Prevention and enhanced response to natural and human-induced environmental hazards. Southern states are disproportionately affected by hurricanes on the both the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts. Understanding these threats and how best to protect people and property is critical.\nSocial Cybersecurity : Best practices across sectors to forecast cyber-mediated changes in human behavior to ensure private, secure and ethical data sharing, reporting and use. \u201cIn modern times the virtual world is a force in and of itself; we want to support transparency in how it can change interactions and social outcomes,\u201d said Rawlings-Goss.\nThe new NSF award includes seed funding designed to evaluate the feasibility of new big data projects. Part of a hub-and-spoke system, the seed money should help create new spokes to address specific data issues identified by collaborators.\n\u201cDeveloping innovative, effective solutions to grand challenges requires linking scientists and engineers with local communities,\u201d said Jim Kurose, Assistant Director for Computer and Information Science and Engineering at the NSF. \u201cThe Big Data Hubs provide the glue to achieve those links, bringing together teams of data science researchers with cities, municipalities and anchor institutions.\u201d\nUltimately, the goal is to harness the synergy of the collaborators to address issues that require the use of data science and engineering techniques.\n\u201cBy catalyzing partnerships that integrate academic researchers into the fabric of communities across the U.S., we can accelerate and deepen the impact of basic research on a range of societal issues, from water management to efficient transportation systems,\u201d said Beth Plale, one of the NSF program directors managing the Big Data Hubs awards.\nThe South Big Data Hub was funded through the National Science Foundation\u2019s Big Data Science & Engineering Program, Awards 1550305 and 1550291.
