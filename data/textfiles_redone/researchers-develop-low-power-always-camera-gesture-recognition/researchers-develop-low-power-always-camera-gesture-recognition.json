That requires much less power to process than tracking individual pixels throughout the entire field of view.\n\u201cWhat this camera is actually looking at is not pixel values, but pixels added together in all different ways and a dramatically smaller number of measurements than if you had it in a standard mode,\u201d Romberg said.\nThe always-on camera was primarily designed as a way to wake up devices. But its ability to recognize specific gestures expands the possibilities \u2013 such as a camera that wakes up with a specific pattern or movement almost like a secret handshake.\n\u201cWe wanted to devise a camera that was capturing images all of the time, and then once you have a particular gesture \u2013 like you write a Z in the air \u2013 it\u2019s going to wake up,\u201d said Arijit Raychowdhury, an associate professor in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering. \u201cTo make that work without affecting the battery life, we wanted it to be so low power that you can power it with harvested ambient energy, such as with a photovoltaic cell.\u201d\nProgramming a camera to recognize specific gestures and wake up only when needed is also a way of conserving total system energy,\u00a0Raychowdhury\u00a0said.\n\"Simple motion detection is a well-studied area of research, and there are commercial products that support motion detection,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the problem is that a camera that can just detect motion \u2013 and not specific patterns in motion or gestures \u2013 is going to wake up more often, even when it doesn\u2019t need to.\u201d\nSuch a low-power camera could be useful in a range of applications, especially for camera systems in remote locations where efficiency is crucial.\n\u201cIf you have a camera in the field, you want them to use as little energy as possible and only record events when necessary,\u201d Romberg said.\nOther applications include specialized surveillance, robotics and consumer electronics with hands-free operation, and the researchers are already working on adding wireless functionality to transmit images and data with an antenna.\n\"Cameras are being added to more and more devices\u00a0these days, but they don\u2019t have much interactivity,\u201d\u00a0Raychowdury\u00a0said. \u201cWhat we are studying are smart cameras that\u00a0can look at something specific in the environment at extreme energy-efficiencies\u00a0and\u00a0process\u00a0the\u00a0data for us.\u201d\nThis material is based upon work supported by Intel Corp. and the National Science Foundation under Grant No. CRII 1464353.
