Georgia Tech mechanical engineers focusing on biotechnology\u00a0recently significantly improved AFM's sensitivity by adding electronic white noise.

It would brake here, boost there; rotate, translate and then, with a light jolt, lock into place.\nIn real time, large molecules interact in nanosecond speed, practically instantaneously, making them nearly impossible to watch. But scientists are a step closer to being able to observe their moves -- play-by-play -- thanks to novel fine-tuning of an atomic scale instrument by engineers at the\nGeorgia Institute of Technology.\nThe advancement could someday help researchers figure out why some drugs work well and others less so, and measure details about the workings of life at their root.\nAtomic forces seen clearly\nThe improvement works by carefully adding electronic white noise to a sensing probe inside an\natomic force microscope (AFM),\nwhich is already sensitive enough to detect forces exerted by interacting molecules, such as protein receptors and vitamins. But even with those abilities at a nanometer scale, in a slight but significant way,\nAFM\ncan be a blunt instrument.\n\u201cThere\u2019s an inability of the probe to sample the deepest part of the interaction,\u201d said researcher\nTodd Sulchek, an associate professor at Georgia Tech\u2019s School of Mechanical Engineering . \u201cYou either see how these molecules are bound together or unbound. It was either black or white, but now we\u2019re succeeding at getting varying shades of gray.\u201d\nSulchek and graduate researchers\nAhmad Haider\nand\nDaniel Potter\npublished the results of their engineering solution in\u00a0 the journal the\nProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences\nEarly Edition\nthe week of\u00a0November 21, 2016.\u00a0Their research was funded by the National Science Foundation.\nCone wiggling a cantilever\nMolecules have tractor beams, albeit weak ones. They tug at each other with an\u00a0 array\u00a0of\u00a0faint forces, such as van der Waals interactions , mostly generated though negative\u00a0or\u00a0positive polarities spread around the molecules.\nAtomic force microscopes measure those attracting energies by sticking a nanoscale cone-shaped probe close to the molecules to feel the forces out as they interact. The cone is attached to a\ncantilever , a flexible tiny stick, and makes it wiggle, as the atomic forces tug the cone this way or that.\nThe cantilever transfers the quivering into the microscope, which turns it into a usable signal much the way the needle of a turntable transfers vibrations from a record to be converted into sound. The resulting signal illustrates what is called an energy well. The top of the well is the point where the adhesive forces are about to take hold, and the bottom is a point about where the molecules meet.\nFalling into the energy well\nBut as the forces pull the cone and the molecules it\u2019s observing closer to each other, at some point, they basically jerk together, preventing a detailed measurement of the gradient of energy. As a result, as the cone approaches the interacting molecules, researchers see the top of the energy well and the end of the interaction, but the details of the well\u2019s walls, particularly deep down where the molecules most closely interact, invariably elude them.\n\u201cThe way we got around it was, we simply added some electronic noise in a well-defined manner, and that allowed the probe to feel the interaction when it was still relatively far away from the surface of the molecules,\u201d Sulchek said. The electronic vibration, called enhanced\nstochastic\nfluctuation, also diluted the effect of the adhesive forces that otherwise would have snatched the cantilever and molecules together.\n\u201cWhat I think is neat is that it\u2019s counterintuitive, because you usually try to eliminate noise from your system to get more accurate measurements, but we\u2019re adding noise,\u201d Sulchek said. The improvement gets around potential bias produced by the addition of noise by allowing researchers to take more samples and longer ones, effectively cancelling the effects of the noise in the overall data.\nAdding some noise may sound simple, but it took Haider and Potter a good two years to figure out how it could work and to make tedious adjustments to the instrumentation.\nBacterial vise grip ballet\nThe researchers used interactions between the cantilever and a material called\nmica\nto finish developing the improvement. Mica has a predictable shape and charge, good for benchmarking \u2013 it\u2019s very smooth. \u201cMica is atomically flat,\u201d Sulchek said. \u201cThat and graphite are about the two flattest surfaces that you can construct.\u201d\nNow, Sulchek\u2019s team is testing the improved cantilever in a biological scenario -- a protein from\nStreptomyces avidinii\nbacteria, which eats up the vitamin\nbiotin\nwith a vengeance. The protein, streptavidin, binds with biotin so tightly, that researchers commonly use it to study molecular adhesion.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the strongest bio-interaction known to science,\u201d Sulchek said. Streptavidin\u2019s vise grip makes for a well standardized test case\u00a0for the newly fine-tuned device. \u00a0\u201cA flap opens up and the biotin fits in it like a glove,\u201d Sulchek said. \u201cWe want to see if we can watch how that happens and measure its energy well.\u201d\nCancer, AIDS, autoimmune disease\nThat puts Sulchek closer to his dream of an instrument to boost experimental biomolecular research, and potentially lead to insights useful to medicine. \u201cI want to have a tool to visualize these intermediate steps,\u201d he said. \u201cI want a tool to see those short-lived states.\"\nResearchers could use such an improved tool to better understand autoimmune disorders, immunotherapy to treat cancer or the ability of HIV to thwart an antibody defense.\n\u201cMany\nantibodies have two binding\nsites, and there\u2019s a reason for that, but we don\u2019t yet understand why,\u201d Sulchek said. \u201cWe do know that you don\u2019t want antibodies to interact too strongly.\u201d When they do, it can result in autoimmune diseases.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of therapeutics involving antibodies, and some work well; others don\u2019t work well,\u201d Sulchek said. Antibodies may not attach\u00a0optimally to\u00a0HIV, for example, because they\u2019re having a hard time wrapping around the virus.\nCapturing the clumsy action in extreme slow motion could someday help biomedical researchers design a more effective antibody to further foil the virus.\nThe research was funded by the National Science Foundation (grant CBET-CAREER-1055437).
