The contest highlights what\u2019s next in muscial instrument design.\nThis year\u2019s nearly 20\u00a0semifinalists represent 10 countries. The finalists will perform a free concert at 7 p.m. on March 9 at the Ferst Center.\nThink of these peculiar inventions as the X-Men of musical instruments. But these mutants are also clever devices that expand our assumed notion of what constitutes an instrument and the sounds it can produce.\nHere are some examples:\nInfinitone: About the size of a soprano saxophone, this is a technologically enabled woodwind instrument. Instead of keys, the Infinitone uses a series of five slides, each controlled by a servo motor in real time via custom iPad interfaces.\nOptron: It looks like a fluorescent lamp, but this instrument is held and performed like a guitar. With the power of 144 ultra-bright, individually addressable RGB LEDs, Optron can rapidly switch between using light as a visual effect and using it as control input.\nJoining the semifinalists are three Georgia Tech graduate students who earned an entry to Guthman by winning the\nMoog Hackathon , which was held earlier this month on campus. The students \u2013 Somesh Ganesh, Lamtharn Hantrakul and Zack Kondak -- invented \u201cMoog\u2019s Greatest Hits,\u201d a drum and synthesizer attached to a cardboard box.\nGil Weinberg, director of the\nGeorgia Tech Center for Music Technology , has worked to grow the program into an international phenomenon.\n\u201cIt is exciting to see the great quality of our semifinalists this year,\u201d Weinberg said. \u201cI\u2019m really looking forward to play with these instruments myself. I hope we will see at least some of them commercialized in the future, so they can be enjoyed by everyone.\u201d\nThe contest awards $10,000 in prizes, including a $5,000 first prize.\nThe judges consider three elements: the sound, the design, and the interaction between the musician and the instrument.\nHere are this year\u2019s judges: Mike Adams, CEO of Moog Music; Elain Chew, professor of digital media at Queen Mary University of London; and Daedelus, a music producer and performer.\nLearn more about the competition\nhere .\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nMargaret Guthman Musical Instrument Competition\nContact\nLaura Diamond\nMedia Relations\n404-894-6016\n@LauraRDiamond\nEmail\nlaura.diamond@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
