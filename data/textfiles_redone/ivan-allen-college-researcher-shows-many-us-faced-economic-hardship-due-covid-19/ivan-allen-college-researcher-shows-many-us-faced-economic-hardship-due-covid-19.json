Her work was recently published in the open-access journal\nPLOS ONE . Dhongde found that significant proportions of U.S. respondents were experiencing economic hardships even early in the Covid-19 pandemic, with Hispanic citizens being particularly affected.\n\u201cThe paper highlights the plight of Americans during the early months of the economic crisis set in motion amid the coronavirus pandemic,\u201d Dhongde said. \u201cIt sheds light on how economic disparities deepened along racial and ethnic lines.\u201d\nThe pandemic triggered an unprecedented economic crisis in the U.S. Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows more than 374,000 confirmed U.S. Covid-19 cases between April 3 and April 6. The Federal Reserve Board surveyed 1,030 U.S. respondents about their households. The survey compiled data on four indicators of economic deprivation: overall financial condition, loss of employment, reduction in income, and inability to pay bills in full.\nDhongde found significant deprivation among respondents, with almost 25% reporting hardships in at least two of the four indicators. One quarter of respondents saw their incomes fall compared to the previous month, and 13% were unable to pay their monthly bills.\u00a0Young adults and those without a college education experienced a disproportionate loss of economic well-being.\nShe also found that Hispanic respondents were experiencing significantly higher deprivation: over 37% of these respondents faced hardships in at least two of the four indicators, and 8% reported hardships in all four areas.\n\u201cGoing forward, it is urgent that we prioritize economic aid to vulnerable populations,\u201d Dhongde added. \u201cThese individuals are experiencing multiple hardships, and, without immediate aid, they will not be able to sustain the economic shock of the pandemic.\u201d\nThe paper, \"Multidimensional Economic Deprivation During the Coronavirus Pandemic: Early Evidence from the United States,\"\u00a0\u00a0is available at\nhttps://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0244130\nFor more coverage of Georgia Tech\u2019s response to the coronavirus pandemic, please visit our\u00a0 Responding to Covid-19 \u00a0page.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nDenise Ward denise.ward@gatech.edu\nEmail\ndenise.ward@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
