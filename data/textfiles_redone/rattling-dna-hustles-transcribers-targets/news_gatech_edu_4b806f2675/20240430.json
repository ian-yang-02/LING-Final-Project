Here a still image from a very large, unique simulation.\nJun 12, 2017\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nImagine if a dense thicket didn\u2019t obstruct your path but instead picked you up and shuttled you through the forest. That\u2019s what tightly packed DNA might be doing with important life molecules to get them where they\u2019re needed on time.\nNew simulations of DNA as a transport conduit could shatter the way scientists have thought about how large molecules called transcription factors diffuse on their way to carry out genetic missions,\naccording to a study by researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology . The simulations add important brush strokes to our picture of elusive inner mechanics of cells.\nThe simulations strongly support the hypothesis that, in a live cell, DNA is in constant motion, making it the dominant mover of\ntranscription factors , to their target sites on DNA. There, the factors regulate the transcription of genetic code into life-sustaining action.\nDNA gorilla cage\nHow transcription factors travel through DNA has been a mystery, because the protein molecules are so large, and natural DNA is so tightly tangled. Spaces inside the windings are usually much smaller than the transcription factors that need to pass through them.\n\u201cIf the thicket is so thick, and on top of that doesn\u2019t move, then it should be impenetrable. So, how do you get stuff through to the right site?\u201d asked\nJeffrey Skolnick, a professor in Georgia Tech\u2019s School of Biological Sciences .\nIf DNA were indeed immobile, the protein molecule would appear jammed into the DNA thicket like a gorilla into a dog cage.\nDNA watch springs\nBut Skolnick and collaborator\nEdmond Chow, a computer scientist specializing in algorithms that tackle very large scientific questions , believe the widely held assumption that naturally occurring DNA is rigid like bars is false. Their simulations turn the bars into wires,\ntense like watch springs , that flex and rattle around with snake-like motions.\n\"The DNA motion is far and away the dominant force moving molecules through its thicket,\" Skolnick said. \"DNA is a bully.\"\nSkolnick, who directs\nGeorgia Tech\u2019s Center for the Study of Systems Biology , and Chow, an associate professor at\nGeorgia Tech\u2019s School of Computational Science and Engineering , published a paper on their simulations on June 6 in\nBiophysical Journal .\nChow and Skolnick modeled the simulation on a transcription factor called\nLacI\nmoving through the DNA of an\nEscherichia coli\nbacterial cell.\nLacI\nis an inhibitory molecule\nthat depends on lactose, but that function played no role in the study. The well-known transcription factor is a mainstay in many experimental studies on transcription factor movement.\nSlide, hop, and hopscotch\nIn the simulations, DNA strands flex out of\nLacI \u2019s path and also juggle the large molecule forward into the next pocket in the thicket, and so on.\nHypotheses based on rigid DNA would leave transcription factors moving more slowly than they actually appear to. But Chow and Skolnick\u2019s wiggly simulations square with rates of diffusion established in lab experiments and explain why they\u2019re so fast.\nTranscription factors have been known to slide along DNA strands, like magnets down slippery wires, until they click into a specific groove where they fit perfectly, which is where they do their work. And they\u2019ve been known to hop off the DNA strand and then reattach.\n\u201cBut the sliding and hopping combined still don\u2019t account for the speed of diffusion,\u201d Chow said.\nReattaching after a hop can actually reduce the transcription factor\u2019s speed through the DNA, by putting it back on a place on the strand where it\u2019s been before. The simulated wobble of the DNA thicket flicks transcribers to make them hopscotch more and farther, increasing their speed of diffusion.\nHerculean computations\nThe simulations will aid other researchers\u2019 understanding of important cell processes and potentially help boost speed and accuracy in biological and medical research. The computation behind the simulated dynamics was herculean.\n\u201cThese simulations are unique to this problem because of their enormity and the advanced computing techniques used. Very efficient algorithms ran in parallel on powerful computers, and, still, it took three weeks for the simulations to complete,\u201d Chow said.\nParallel\ncomputing\nchops a problem into pieces that can be run simultaneously, or in parallel, instead of in one long, time-consuming process. This allows programs to exploit many processors at the same time, multiplying the speed of computation.\nEven with that power, to make the simulation computable at all, the researchers had to slim down the model of the DNA and\nLacI\nto reveal motion dynamics without dressing up all the details of cellular DNA. \u201cYou have to choose which parts you ignore and which parts you put in,\u201d Skolnick said. \u201cIf you put everything in, you can\u2019t do it, even with the fastest codes.\u201d\nCellular toy land\nThe researchers want to take on much tougher challenges that could, years from now, lead to a toy-like, simplified model of a complete cell.\n\u201cThe ultimate goal is to put a whole cell on a computer. Let it live. Let it divide, and understand the processes,\u201d Skolnick said. \u201cMaybe even let the cell mutate and evolve.\u201d\nThe computer science behind that would be aspirational. \u201cWhen the size of a problem grows, the computing costs to solve it can grow disproportionately,\u201d Chow said. \u201cYou have to build algorithms that can run efficiently even when you scale up the problem size.\u201d\nAlso read: Instruction Manual to Repair DNA\nAlso read: Did RNA evolve in puddles?\nAlso read: Was the Secret Spice in Primal Gene Soup a Thickener?\nThis research was supported by the National Science Foundation (grant ACI-1147843).
