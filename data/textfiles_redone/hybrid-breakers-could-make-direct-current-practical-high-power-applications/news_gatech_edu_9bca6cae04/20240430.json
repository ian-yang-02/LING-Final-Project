Among the reasons: AC is simple to turn off when there\u2019s a problem \u2014 known as a fault \u2014 such as a tree falling on a power line.\nBut DC has inherent advantages over its alternating cousin, among them higher efficiency and the ability to carry more power over longer distances. That could be increasingly important as wind farms in rural areas produce power needed in population centers. And future electric aircraft and ships are likely to be powered by high-power-density DC systems.\nAlternating current can be shut down when the power level hits zero during a cycle \u2014 the zero-crossing point of a sine wave \u2014 which is the basis for breakers that protect modern power systems everywhere from substations to home installations. Without these alternating cycles, however, direct current has no opportune time to turn off the power.\nNew technology funded by a $3.3 million award from ARPA-E\u2019s BREAKERS program could help solve that problem using innovations in power electronics, piezoelectric actuators, and new insulation materials to make high-power DC circuit breakers feasible. Researchers from the Georgia Institute of Technology and Florida State University (FSU) expect to enable breaker switching speeds ten times faster than existing equipment and commercialize the technology through a consortium of industry partners.\n\u201cThe transition from AC to DC, which is already happening, will open up a new paradigm for efficiently and controllably managing power in future electrical systems and military platforms,\u201d said Michael \"Mischa\" Steurer, a research faculty member at Florida State University\u2019s Center for Advanced Power Systems. \u201cThis will be enabled by the amazing developments that have happened over the past two decades in power electronics.\u201d\nThe hybrid circuit breaker under development by the research team will use stacks of very large transistors to switch off the DC when necessary. Semiconductors are less efficient at conducting current than conventional mechanical switches, so under ordinary conditions, the current will flow through mechanical switches. But when the power must be turned off, current will be briefly routed through the power electronics until the mechanical breakers can be opened.\n\u201cWe are proposing a hybrid DC circuit breaker in which the current will have two paths,\u201d explained\nLukas Graber , an assistant professor in the\nSchool of Electrical and Computer Engineering\nat Georgia Tech. \u201cOne path will be through the semiconductors, which can interrupt the current when needed. The second path will be through mechanical switches, which will provide a much less resistive path that will be more efficient for normal operations.\u201d\nIn common consumer electronics applications, transistors are too small to see and handle just a few volts. The transistors that will be used in DC switching are much larger \u2014 a square centimeter \u2014 and dozens or hundreds of them would be combined in serial or parallel to provide enough capacity for switching thousands of volts. After the current has been moved to the solid-state transistor pathway, piezoelectric actuators will quickly separate the contacts in the mechanical switches before current rises too high in the transistors. Once separated, the current through the transistors can be switched off.\n\u201cWe need to be extremely fast,\u201d Graber said. \u201cWe have to separate the contacts within 250 microseconds and to completely break the current within 500 microseconds \u2014 just half a millisecond. For that reason, we cannot use spring-loaded or hydraulic actuators common to AC breakers. Devices that rely on the piezoelectric effect can do that for us.\u201d\nThe Georgia Tech and FSU researchers have developed intellectual property for components of the proposed DC breakers, and will work together to combine the technologies. The project is known as Efficient DC Interrupter with Surge Protection (EDISON).\n\u201cWe will combine the strengths of significantly different technologies \u2014 solid state and mechanical \u2014 into a system that functions better overall than its individual components,\u201d said Steurer. \u201cThe pieces of the system have to work together seamlessly within half a millisecond to achieve our goal.\u201d\nThe researchers \u2014 including Associate Professor Maryam Saeedifard, VentureLab Principal Jonathan Goldman, and Postdoctoral Fellow Chanyeop Park at Georgia Tech and Professor Fang Peng, Research Faculty Karl Schoder, and Assistant Professor Yuan Li at FSU \u2014 expect to build a prototype that will be tested at FSU\u2019s five-megawatt test facility within three years. The development and testing will be done in collaboration with a team of industrial partners who will ultimately transition the DC breakers to commercial use.\nDirect current could be particularly useful as more renewable energy comes online. Photovoltaics in the west may still be generating power after the sun sets in the east. Wind turbines may be producing power in the midsection of the country while clouds cover other parts of the country. Transmitting power from one location to another could therefore become more important.\n\u201cThere are large distances to be bridged with renewables,\u201d Graber said. \u201cWhen we rethink what the next grid is going to be like, DC may play a larger role.\u201d\nFor those who know the history of electrical power, the work opens a new chapter of a story that goes back almost a century and a half to two of the most celebrated inventors of all time.\nThe relative merits of DC versus AC provided the basis for the \u201cWar of Current\u201d between inventors Thomas Edison and Nickolas Tesla in the 1880s. Edison, a proponent of DC, ultimately lost out to Tesla\u2019s AC. But had Edison been able to use modern power electronics, the story might have turned out differently.\n\u201cEdison was right, but at the time he was wrong,\u201d Graber said. \u201cDC is coming back strong, and we will be a part of making it practical.\u201d\nFunding for the work is from ARPA-E\u2019s Building Reliable Electronics to Achieve Kilovolt Effective Ratings Safely (BREAKERS) program. The project was among eight funded to support the development of medium-voltage devices for grid, industry and transportation applications.\nResearch News\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\n177 North Avenue\nAtlanta, Georgia\u00a0 30332-0181\u00a0 USA\nMedia Relations Contact : John Toon (404-894-6986) (jtoon@gatech.edu)\nWriter : John Toon\nAdditional Images\nContact\nJohn Toon\nResearch News\n(404) 894-6986\nEmail\njtoon@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
