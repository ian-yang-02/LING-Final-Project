The reception, held at Cox Enterprises, featured close to 300 people including executives from Fortune 500 companies, startup founders, and investors.\nEngage began in 2017 as the first-of-its-kind collaborative innovation program and venture fund to connect startups with leading corporations. It\u2019s a formula that still works today, with active involvement from corporate behemoths including Delta Air Lines, The Home Depot, Invesco, and others that are giving tech entrepreneurs a place at the table.\n[caption id=\"attachment_10473\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"300\"]Discussion by Engage founders, from left, Blake Patton, Marty Flanagan, and G.P. \"Bud\" Peterson, moderated by Metro Atlanta Chamber President and CEO Katie Kirkpatrick[/caption]\nTo kick off the event, Engage founders and board members Marty Flanagan, president and CEO of\u00a0 Invesco , G.P. \u201cBud\u201d Peterson, president emeritus of\u00a0 Georgia Tech , and Blake Patton, managing partner of\u00a0 Tech Square Ventures , discussed the program\u2019s origin and the way they deliberately set out to meet the needs of both the tech startups and the corporate community.\n\u201cWhat startups really need is access to customers and markets,\u201d said Patton. \u201cAnd so that's what we built the concept of Engage around.\u201d\nAnd the corporations, what do they need that Engage can offer?\nThey need new ideas and the nimbleness of startups. \u201cI think Engage has done a very nice job of identifying the innovation needs of the companies that are participating and then matching that with the entrepreneurs who are being creative and innovative in the community,\u201d said Patton.\nSince its founding, Engage has mentored and invested in 10 startup cohorts, a total of 75 companies. Its portfolio companies have inked 116 customer contracts signed with corporate partners. Engage startups have raised more than $2.7 billion in capital after graduating from the program and employ more than 3,000.\nRachel Carpenter, co-founder and CEO of Intrinio, a financial technology startup from the second Engage cohort, hosted a discussion about enterprise data transformation and ways startups can work with major corporations on that, with Donie Lochan, the managing director, chief technology officer, and global head of technology for Invesco, and Chuck Adkins, senior vice president of information technology at Intercontinental Exchange (ICE).\nKeynote speaker Alex Taylor, chair and CEO of Cox Enterprises and Engage Board member, discussed the ways Cox is working with startups. The company has signed 12 contracts with Engage startups, including one with Engage graduate Help Lightning to solve a problem brought on by the pandemic.\n\u201cCox Communications has millions of customers around the country,\u201d Taylor said, explaining that technicians of his company\u2019s cable subsidiary could not go to customers\u2019 homes during the pandemic. In normal times, customers would buy the hardware from Cox and install the television modems and other devices with the technicians\u2019 help.\nNow, packets are being sent remotely.\n\u201cNot a lot of these people are trained engineers, so they don't often do it right. When there's problems, we can't go into their homes and help them,\u201d Taylor said.\nCox worked with Help Lightning, an Engage portfolio company that uses augmented reality video that enables the cable company to better serve its customers \u2014 during the pandemic through today.\n\u201cIt's a field services tool. A field services tech is out front of a customer's home with an iPad. There's a visual interface, and the customer is holding up the phone, showing the technician what they're looking at,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cThe technician is walking the customer through a two-way interaction when they can't physically be present.\u201d\nFollowing Taylor, Nammy Vedire, Engage\u2019s director of platform and operations, announced the recipient of the Executive Champion Award, given to corporate partners who exemplify and help accomplish Engage\u2019s mission. The award was presented to Jaimie Clark, head of innovation at Catalyst by Wellstar and the director of innovation and venture strategy for Wellstar Health System.\n\u201cJaimie met with several of our corporate executive teams, understood best practices, and incorporated them into the WellStar Catalyst program, which is this conduit to bring innovation to every corner of the Wellstar Health System,\u201d Vedire said. \u201cIn doing so, in the last 12 months, Jaimie has helped five of our startups sign pilots, of which three have now converted to multi-year contracts. That's an incredible effort.\u201d\nDaley Ervin, Engage\u2019s managing director, who was celebrating his last Engage cohort before leaving the position, was also presented with an award to mark his service with Engage since 2018.\nTo wrap up the evening, Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens \u2014 a Georgia Tech alum \u2014 spoke about his commitment to the city\u2019s tech startup ecosystem. To illustrate the importance of the community, he introduced the city of Atlanta\u2019s first Senior Technology Advisor Donald Beamer. \u00a0\u201cHe will be an ambassador for this ecosystem that helped catapult Atlanta. He will lift up the startup community and be able to answer the questions of venture capitalists,\u201d Dickens said.\n[caption id=\"attachment_10474\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"300\"]Founders of the cohort 10 companies[/caption]\nEngage\u2019s cohort 10 companies include:\nCivic Eagle : Gives policy professionals the tools to more effectively monitor, report, and collaborate on policy work.\nCoginiti : A collaborative intelligence company that democratizes access to data, fosters collaboration, and supports building, reusing, and sharing data and analytic assets.\nManifest Climate : Provides businesses with the tools, data, and support they need to identify climate risks and opportunities, track trends, and build competency around climate action.\nNameCoach : Uses artificial intelligence-enabled software to solve one problem that can help businesses promote inclusion, belonging, and rapport \u2014 name mispronunciation.\nQualytics : Delivers confidence in data with real-time automated anomaly detection and remediation to help improve the accuracy of enterprise decision making.\nTribute : A micro-mentorship platform enhances team collaboration, learning, and productivity in hybrid workplaces.\nWorkera: \u00a0This skills intelligence platform is redefining how enterprises understand, develop, and mobilize talent to drive innovation.\nWripple : An agency services platform that matches enterprises to individual freelancers and project teams.\nAbout Engage\nEngage is a first-of-its-kind innovation platform comprising category-leading corporations in the Southeast that have joined forces to support startups building the future of enterprise.
