What does this new agreement mean for Cubans, Americans, and others? What does it mean to you? The Hispanic Heritage Month Panel on \u201cU.S. and Cuba Relations: Past, Present, and Future\u201d answered these questions and more on September 26.\nStudents, faculty, and staff from the Georgia Institute of Technology and Georgia State University participated in the program, which was co-sponsored by Tech\u2019s Office of Hispanic Initiatives and Student Diversity Programs.\nGeorgia Tech School of Modern Languages Associate Professor Juan C. Rodr\u00edguez opened the discussion with a historical overview of the relationship between the U.S. and Cuba since 1898 at the end of the Spanish-American War. He briefly discussed the Cuban Revolution in 1933, the emergence of the new Cuban Revolution in the 1950s, the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962, how Cuba was affected after the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, and the recent diplomatic relations with the U.S.\nPanelists then reflected on the impact of a lifted trade embargo with the U.S., race relations in Cuba, and the meaningful contributions of Cuba to the world.\nLifting the Trade Embargo\nEarlier this year, President Barack Obama and Cuban President Ra\u00fal Castro called for the removal of the U.S. trade embargo. Castro argued that Cuba and the U.S. could make more progress on their shared agenda if the embargo was lifted, but the leaders disagreed on some issues, including human rights. 1\n\u201cLift the embargo, and see if socialism survives in Cuba,\u201d commented Richard Laub, director of Georgia State\u2019s Heritage Preservation Master\u2019s Degree Program.\nRodr\u00edguez emphasized the importance of distinguishing between the Cuban people and the Cuban government. As Cassandra Gomez, undergraduate student in Georgia Tech\u2019s School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, added, \u201cMany Cuban people are fearful of what these opened sanctions could mean.\u201d\nRace Relations in Cuba\nIn the U.S., 38 percent of the population is non-White, including Blacks, Hispanics, Asian/Pacific Islanders, and Native Americans. They make up 17 percent of Congress. 2\nIn Cuba, around two-thirds of the population is non-White, primarily Black and mixed race, and make up about 30 percent of civil and public leadership. 3\n\u201cRacial issues in Cuba manifest in institutional leadership,\u201d said Rodr\u00edguez.\nGeorgia State Department of Political Science Associate Professor Henry Frank Carey explained, \u201cYou don\u2019t have high crime rates in totalitarian societies. As Cuba democratizes, I think the crime rate may increase from an \u2018us versus them\u2019 phenomenon.\u201d\nRacial issues are difficult to express in Cuba, according to Georgia Tech GoSTEM Director Diley Hern\u00e1ndez. \u201cIn Cuba, the official narrative is that there is no racism or sexism because the Revolution \u2018fixed\u2019 inequality issues,\u201d she said. \u201cIn a totalitarian regime, you cannot acknowledge those issues because in doing so, it is seen as dissenting from the regime.\u201d\nCuban Contributions to the World\nThe panel agreed on Cuba\u2019s remarkable contributions of art and music to the world. \u201cCuba has done an outstanding job in keeping art and culture highly accessible to everyone in the country,\u201d remarked Hern\u00e1ndez.\nLaub added that \u201cCuba has a robust art and historic preservation program to maintain their architecture,\u201d and according to Carey, \u201cNew Orleans became the way station for Afro-Cuban music and dance.\u201d\nAnd of course there\u2019s baseball. \u201cUnlike other Hispanic countries with soccer, baseball is the national sport in Cuba,\u201d said Gomez. \u201cSome Americans think that Cubans are so different from them, but their national sport is our national sport.\u201d\nGeorgia Tech Human-Centered Computing doctoral student Michaelanne Dye also noted the growing technological advances in Cuba. \u201cThe technology sector is fascinating. In the coming years, the latest technology will penetrate Cuba, but currently, Cubans have used ingenuity to connect 9,000 homes in Havana with homegrown internet.\u201d\nThis panel discussion was part of a series of events to celebrate Hispanic Heritage Month at Georgia Tech. Other events included the Kickoff on September 15, Cross-Cultural Workshop on September 20, Mini World Cup on September 23, and Closing Banquet on October 5.\n1\nTeresa Welch, \u201c Obama, Castro: Lift the Trade Embargo ,\u201d\nU.S. News & World Report,\n(March 21, 2016).\n2\nJens Manuel Krogstad, \u201c 114 th\nCongress Is Most Diverse Ever ,\u201d Pew Research Center, (January 12, 2015).\n3\nDamien Cave, \u201c Cuba Says It Has Solved Racism.
