Researchers recently illuminated some new steps inside the molecular factory that makes the oxygen we breathe.\nThough chlorophyll is the best-known part, for the vivid green it colors nature, many compounds work together in photosynthesis. And Georgia Tech chemists devised clever experiments to inspect a small metal catalyst and an amino acid intimately involved in the release of O 2\nfrom water\u00a0in what's known as photosystem II (PSII).\nPSII is a complex protein structure found in plants and algae. It has a counterpart called\u00a0photosystem I, an equally complex light-powered producer of oxygen and biomaterials.\nPhotosynthesis Q & A\nSome questions and answers below will help elucidate the researchers\u2019 findings about\u00a0O 2\nproduction inside PSII.\n\u201cPhotosynthesis in plants and algae can be compared to an artificial solar cell,\u201d said principal investigator\nBridgette Barry , who is a\nprofessor in Georgia Tech\u2019s School of Chemistry and Biochemistry . \u201cBut, in photosynthesis, light energy fuels the production of food (carbohydrates) instead of charging a battery. O 2\nis released from water as a byproduct.\u201d\nBarry, first author Zhanjun Guo, and researcher Jiayuan He\npublished their research on May 11, 2018, in the journal\nProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences . Their work was funded by the National Science Foundation.\nHow does photosynthesis II release oxygen from water?\nMany details are still unknown, but here are some basic workings that were already well-established going into this new study.\nPS II is a biochemical complex made mostly of large amino acid corkscrew cylinders and some smaller such cylinders strung together with amino acid strands. The reaction cycle that extracts the O 2\nfrom H 2 O occurs at a\u00a0tiny spot, which the study focused on.\nFor scale, if PSII were a fairly tall, very wide building, the spot might be the size of a large door in about the lower center of the building, and the metal cluster would be located there. Intertwined in the proteins would be sprawling molecules that include beta-carotene and chlorophyll, a great natural photoelectric semiconductor.\n\u201cPhotons from sunlight bombard photosystem II and displace electrons in the chlorophyll,\u201d Barry said. \u201cThat creates moving negative charges.\u201d\nWhat is the metal catalyst?\nThe metal catalyst acts like a\ncapacitor , building up charge that it uses to expedite four chemical reactions that release the O 2\nby removing four electrons, one-by-one, from two water molecules. In the process, water also spins off four H+ ions, i.e. protons, from two H 2 O molecules.\nAn additional highly reactive compound near the metal cluster acts as a \"switch\" to drive the electron movement in each step of the reaction cycle. It's a common amino acid called tyrosine, a little building block on that mammoth protein building.\nWhat does the \u2018switch\u2019 do?\nThis is where the new study\u2019s insights come in to describe details of what's going on between the tyrosine and the cluster.\nThe light reactions remove one electron from tyrosine, making it what\u2019s called an unstable\nradical , and the radical version of tyrosine strongly attracts a new electron.\nIt very quickly gets that new electron from the metal cluster. As PSII absorbs photons, the taking of an electron from tyrosine and its radical\u2019s grabbing of a new one from the cluster repeats rapidly, making the tyrosine a kind of flickering switch.\n\u201cThe tyrosine radical drives the cycle around, and what they (Guo and He) did in the lab was to develop a way of seeing the radical reaction in the presence of the metal cluster,\u201d Barry said.\nGuo and He also found that the calcium atom in the cluster has key interactions with tyrosine.\nHow did they observe that single chemical component in a living system?\nFiguring out how to make the reactions observable was painstaking. The researchers isolated some PSII from spinach, and they slowed it way down by cooling it in the dark.\nThen they gave it a burst of red light to prepare one step in the reaction cycle, then a green flash to take the electron from tyrosine. Then the electrons slowly returned to the tyrosine.\nThe researchers observed the processes via\nvibrational spectroscopy , which revealed qualities of tyrosine\u2019s chemical bonds. The researchers also examined the calcium and discovered a special interaction between it and tyrosine.\n\u201cA new thing we saw was that the calcium ion made the tyrosine twist a certain way,\u201d Barry said. \u201cIt turns out that the tyrosine may be a very flexible switch.\u201d\nThe researchers also swapped out calcium for other metals and found that the calcium fulfills this role quite optimally.\nSo, why is understanding photosynthesis important?\n\u201cOxygen photosynthesis really is the great fueler life on our planet,\u201d Barry said.\nAbout two billion years ago, the photosynthesis that generates O 2\nexploded, and as breathable oxygen filled Earth\u2019s oceans and atmosphere, life began evolving into the complex variety we have today. There are also pragmatic reasons for studying photosynthesis.\n\u201cYou could work with it to make crops more productive,\u201d Barry said. \u201cWe may have to repair and adapt the photosynthesis process someday, too.\u201d\nEnvironmental stresses could possibly weaken photosynthesis in the future, calling for biochemical tweaks. Also, natural photosynthesis is an exceptionally good model for photoelectric semiconductors like those used in emerging energy systems.\nLike this article?\u00a0 Get our email newsletter here.\nThe research was funded by the National Science Foundation (grant MCB-14-11734).
