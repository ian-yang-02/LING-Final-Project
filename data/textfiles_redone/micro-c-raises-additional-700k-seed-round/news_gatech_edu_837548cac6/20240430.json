Paul)\nFeb 06, 2017\n\u2014 Savannah, GA\nMicro C, a Savannah-based medical device startup led by a trio of Georgia Tech graduates, said it has raised an additional $700,000 in its early-seed funding round. The additional funds follow the $260,000 the company\u00a0 successfully raised \u00a0in the round in 2016.\nMicro C, one of the Advanced Technology Development Center\u2019s ATDC Accelerate startup portfolio companies, has developed a comprehensive, hand-held X-ray and digital camera for surgeons and physicians who treat disorders of the extremities.\nAll the funders in the round are Georgia-based and the company said the investors utilized\u00a0Georgia's Angel Investor Tax Credit program.\nMicro C founder and Chief Medical Officer Dr. Greg Kolovich, Chief Executive Officer Evan Ruff, and Chief Operating Officer Kirby Sisk said they will leverage the additional funds to complete several planned\u00a0initiatives in the second quarter. Among them: a prototype build, beta testing, submission to the Food and Drug Administration, and go-to-market launch activities including demonstrations at leading professional academies for orthopedic surgeons.\n\u201cAt our sessions with orthopedic surgeons and ambulatory surgery center management, the feedback is consistent: They want to use the Micro C as soon as commercially available,\u201d said Kolovich, who is\u00a0an orthopedic hand and micro-surgeon. \u201cThey are impressed with how we have incorporated multiple innovations into a compact digital X-ray and multimodal camera that also integrates real-time, HIPPA compliant, data and image transmission together with accurate billing and much greater accuracy, clarity, safety, and speed.\u201d\nKolovich earned his electrical engineering degree from Georgia Tech, medical degree from Ohio State, and surgical training at Harvard.\u00a0The company has received several key recognitions, including the Technology Association of Georgia\u2019s TAG Most Innovative Company award and first place at the Geekend Pitch Contest in Savannah.\n\u201cWith seven patents filed, we believe that the intellectual property we created is not only winning us recognition but will also contribute to building the value of our product and our company significantly,\u201d said Ruff, who earned his degree at Tech in computer engineering.\nSisk, whose degree from Tech is in mechanical engineering, is responsible for production of the Micro C emitter, table, and accessories. \u201cCombining a compact and complex device with software, consumables, and service support will demand skills and resources that we are rapidly bringing on board with our investors\u2019 confidence and backing,\u201d Sisk said.\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nMicro C\nATDC\nGeorgia Angel Investor Tax Credit\nContact\nFor media inquiries contact:\nLaura Diamond\nGeorgia Tech Media Relations\nlaura.diamond@comm.gatech.edu\n404.894.6016\nEmail\nperalte.paul@comm.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
