They can be of any size \u2014 think clouds of bacteria in a petri dish, or schools of fish.\nRoman Grigoriev\nis mostly interested in the emergent behaviors in active matter systems made up of units on a molecular scale \u2014 tiny systems that convert stored energy into directed motion, consuming energy as they move and exert mechanical force.\n\u201cActive matter systems have garnered significant attention in physics, biology, and materials science due to their unique properties and potential applications,\u201d Grigoriev, a professor in the\nSchool of Physics\nat Georgia Tech, explains.\n\u201cResearchers are exploring how active matter can be harnessed for tasks like designing new materials with tailored properties, understanding the behavior of biological organisms, and even developing new approaches to robotics and autonomous systems,\u201d he says.\nBut that\u2019s only possible if scientists learn how the microscopic units making up active matter interact, and whether they can affect these interactions and thereby the collective properties of active matter on the macroscopic scale.\nGrigoriev and his research colleagues have found a potential first step by developing a new model of active matter that generated new insight into the physics of the problem. They detail their methods and results in a new\nstudy\npublished in\nScience Advances , \u201cPhysically informed data-driven modeling of active nematics.\u201d\nSchool of Physics graduate researcher\nMatthew Golden\nis the study's lead author. Co-authors are graduate researcher\nJyothishraj Nambisan\nand\nAlberto Fernandez-Nieves , professor in the Department of Condensed Matter Physics at the\nUniversity of Barcelona\nand a former associate professor of Physics at Georgia Tech.\nA two-dimensional 'solution?'\nThe research team focused on one of the most common examples of active matter, a suspension of self-propelled particles, such as bacteria or synthetic microswimmers, in a liquid medium. These particles cluster, swarm, and otherwise form dynamic patterns due to their ability to move and interact with each other.\n\u201cIn our paper, we use data from an experimental system involving suspensions of microtubules, which provide structural support, shape, and organization to eukaryotic cells (any cell with a clearly defined nucleus),\u201d Grigoriev explains.\nMicrotubules, as well as actin filaments and some bacteria, are examples of nematics, rod-like objects whose \"heads\" are indistinguishable from their \"tails.\u201d\nThe motion of microtubules is driven by molecular motors powered by a protein, kinesin, which consumes adenosine triphosphate (ATP) dissolved in the liquid to slide a pair of neighboring microtubules past one another. The researcher\u2019s system used microtubules suspended between layers of oil and water, which restricted their movement to two dimensions.\n\u201cThat makes it easier to visualize the microtubules and track their motion. By changing the kinesin or ATP concentrations, we could control the motion of the microtubules, making this experimental setup by far one of the most popular in the study of active nematics and even more generally, active matter,\u201d Grigoriev said.\n\u2018This is where the story gets interesting\u2019\nGetting a clearer picture of microtubular movements was just one discovery in the study.\nAnother was learning more about the relationships between the characteristic patterns describing the orientation and motion of nematic molecules on a macroscopic scale. Those patterns, or topological defects, determine how the nematics orient themselves at the oil-water interface, that is in two spatial dimensions.\n\u201cUnderstanding the relationship between the flow \u2014 the global property of the system, or the fluid \u2014 and the topological defects, which describe the local orientation of microtubules, is one of the key intellectual questions facing researchers in the field,\u201d Grigoriev said. \u201cOne needs to correctly identify the dominant physical effects which control the interaction between the microtubules and the surrounding fluid.\u201d\n\u201cAnd this is where the story gets interesting,\u201d Grigoriev adds. \u201cFor over a decade, it was believed that the key physics were well understood, with a large number of theoretical and computational studies relying on a generally accepted first principles model\u201d \u2014 that is, one based on established science \u2014 \u201cthat was originally derived for active nematics in three spatial dimensions.\u201d\nIn the Georgia Tech model, though, the dynamics of active nematics \u2014 more specifically, the length and time scales of the emerging patterns \u2014 are controlled by a pair of physical constants describing those assumed dominant physical effects: the stiffness of the microtubules (their flexibility), and the activity describing the stress, or force, generated by the kinesin motors.\n\u201cUsing a data-driven approach, we inferred the correct form of the model demonstrating that, for two-dimensional active nematics, the dominant physical effects are different from what was previously assumed,\u201d Grigoriev says. \u201cIn particular, the time scale is set by the rate at which bundles of microtubules are stretched by kinesin.\u201d It is this rate, rather than the stress, that is constant.\nThe danger of confirmation bias\nGrigoriev said the results of the study have important implications for understanding of active nematics and their emergent behaviors, explaining that they help rationalize a number of recent experimental results that were previously unexplained, such as how the density of topological defects scales with the concentration of kinesin and the viscosity of the fluid layers.\n\u201cMore importantly, our results demonstrate the danger associated with traditional assumptions that established research communities often land on and have difficulty overcoming,\u201d Grigoriev said. \u201cWhile data-driven methods may have their own sources of bias, they offer a perspective which is different enough from more traditional approaches to become a valuable research tool in their own right.\u201d\nAbout Georgia Institute of Technology\nThe Georgia Institute of Technology, or Georgia Tech, is one of the top public research universities in the U.S., developing leaders who advance technology and improve the human condition.
