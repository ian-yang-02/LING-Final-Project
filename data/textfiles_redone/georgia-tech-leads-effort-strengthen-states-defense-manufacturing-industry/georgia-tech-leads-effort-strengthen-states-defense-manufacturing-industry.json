The Consortium, which will begin accepting members in\u00a0April 2022, will work with Georgia defense manufacturers to incorporate cybersecurity protocols, smart technologies such as sensor packs, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and other best practices under Industry 4.0 technology standards.\nLed by Aaron Stebner, associate professor in the\u00a0 George W. Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering \u00a0and the\u00a0 School of Materials Science and Engineering , the Consortium is an 18-month pilot funded by a Department of Defense Office of Local Defense Community Cooperation (OLDCC) grant of nearly $1 million. Georgia Tech is working in partnership with Spelman College, the Technical College System of Georgia, and the Georgia Department of Economic Development, under the grant to develop workforce, training manuals, a curriculum, and to support businesses in adapting to economic and technological changes that emerge at a much more rapid pace today.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a cooperative effort that\u2019s really focused on helping to get modern technologies to these Georgia manufacturers. This is about establishing a community of manufacturers who all want to move forward but don\u2019t have the bandwidth or capabilities do it individually,\u201d Stebner said.\nThe Consortium has three goals. The first is to increase the manufacturing defense supply chain\u2019s resilience and diversification. That will allow those companies to pivot quickly in response to demand and let non-defense-related industries enter the supply chain at critical junctures. The second goal is to work with Georgia manufacturers in adopting new technologies and address challenges that put those businesses at risk.\nLastly, the Consortium is to be a conduit that helps small- and medium-sized manufacturers test out innovations using Georgia Tech resources such as the Advanced Manufacturing Pilot Facility, connect manufacturers with each other, and potentially unlock new markets and collaboration opportunities.\nWhile the focus is on defense manufacturing, the Consortium is open to all manufacturers.\n\u201cWe want to help as many manufacturers as we can, to grow a bigger pie that helps everybody, lowers risk, and allows companies to be part of building innovative solutions\u201d Stebner said.\nManufacturing Supports Georgia Economy\nNational Association of Manufacturers data \u00a0show that manufacturing accounts for $61.1 billion in economic activity, roughly 10% of Georgia\u2019s total output. The industry includes more than 6,600 firms that employ nearly 400,000.\nAt $14 billion a year, Georgia is ranked 13 th \u00a0in federal defense spending. Roughly 1,200 manufacturers in the state are in defense or related industries. Those include information technology companies that support cybersecurity, wireless communications, and other innovations that are critically essential to Industry 4.0 in defense manufacturing.\nUniversity partners from the Technical College System of Georgia and Spelman College will look to take the Consortium findings and data from the work they do with member companies to create educational programming and workforce training.\nToday, there is a need for more workers in machine learning and other aspects of advanced manufacturing, as well as a need to change perceptions of manufacturing, especially in rural parts of the state, Stebner explained.\nTo that end, the Technical College System of Georgia could develop programming for students within its two-year education curriculum. It also has a mobile manufacturing unit that could be taken to rural parts of the state and used as a tool to highlight opportunities in manufacturing and dispel misconceptions about the industry.\nThe all-women\u2019s Spelman College, one of the nation\u2019s premier historically black colleges and universities,\u00a0launched an extended reality program in the fall of 2020. That program aims to integrate art, technology, and narrative on a gaming platform which is familiar and engaging for students.\u00a0Those students will develop the technical skills to develop games, create immersive virtual experiences, and develop visual simulations for research, education, and training.\nFor Consortium members, Spelman\u2019s extended reality\u00a0program can be used to help turn research data gathered from them into workforce training and development modules.\n\u201cSpelman has a long history of graduating women in the natural sciences, and that history has recently led the Department of Defense to distinguish the College as a Center of Excellence for educating women in STEM,\u201d said Jerry Volcy, a Spelman professor and co-director of the Spelman Innovation Lab.\nThe extended reality program furthers Spelman\u2019s goal to increase the technological readiness of its graduates.\n\u201cSpelman has a long record of forging pathways for women of color into new spaces. Today, these spaces include extended reality, defense and, to some extent, manufacturing research,\u201d Volcy said. \u201cFrom the College\u2019s perspective, participation in the Consortium has the dual potential of creating and discovering new pathways into these industries while immediately providing real-world applications laboratory for the developing extended reality program.\u201d\nFulfilling Georgia Tech\u2019s Mission\nWithin Georgia Tech, the\u00a0 Georgia Manufacturing Extension Partnership \u00a0and the\u00a0 Georgia Tech Manufacturing Institute \u00a0will support Consortium efforts.\nThe Consortium reflects Georgia Tech\u2019s broader mission to further its Advanced Manufacturing Initiative, said\nGeorge White , Georgia Tech\u2019s interim vice president of Industry Collaboration.\n\u201cThe anticipated research impact envisioned through the Defense Manufacturing Consortium will strengthen Georgia Tech\u2019s positioning in enabling major public private collaborations,\u201d White said. \u201cThe advent of the Consortium represents the opportunity to convene key stakeholders from government, academics, and industry to innovate and solve the most challenging problems in manufacturing.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nContact\nWriter and media relations contact:\nP\u00e9ralte C.
