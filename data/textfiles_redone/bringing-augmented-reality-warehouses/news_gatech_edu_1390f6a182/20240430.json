The device is a finalist for the 2017 Collegiate Inventors Competition. It was also a finalist for Georgia Tech's InVenture Prize.\u00a0Photo by Rob Felt.\nMar 14, 2017\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nSarthak Srinivas visited a warehouse a few months ago and worked a shift as a picker. It was his job to get a bunch of items scattered throughout the warehouse and bring them to one location.\nAfter a few hours of manipulating a heavy cart and carrying a tablet and a barcode scanning gun, his back and legs began to hurt. He also had trouble finding his way around the large, unfamiliar warehouse.\nShortly after his warehouse visit, Srinivas, a computer science major at Georgia Tech, entered a hackathon with two other computer science majors. The three do research in augmented reality and wondered how the technology could be used in an everyday setting.\nThey applied their research to the inefficiencies at warehouses and created PickAR, a headset that uses augmented reality technology to overlay picking information so warehouses can find and process orders more efficiently.\nThe invention is one of six competing for the 2017 Georgia Tech InVenture Prize. The annual competition awards $35,000 in cash prizes and brings together student innovators from all academic backgrounds to foster creativity, invention and entrepreneurship.\n\u201cWarehouses have three main problems and PickAR can solve them all really well,\u201d explained Srinivas, who is from Bangalore, India.\nThe device integrates with existing warehouse management systems so the pickers always have the most relevant information available. The team also built the barcode scanner into the headset, eliminating the need to carry additional equipment.\nAnd they included a navigation system that takes advantage of the headset\u2019s tracking capabilities to map out where to go in the warehouse. The device calculates which package is closest and where it is located and provides this information in the top left corner of the headset. Then the headset maps out the shortest path, using green arrows to lead the way.\nOrder picking constitutes up to 60 percent of the operational costs for warehouses, said Cheng Hann Gan, who is from Wheaton, Ill. And since about 80 percent of order picking in warehouses is manual any improvement will allow companies to save money, he added.\nThe team envisions the technology being used in warehouses run by large companies such as Amazon and Wal-Mart. But they said it could also benefit large government archives and libraries as well.\n\u201cAs computer science majors we knew we could create these solutions and design it in a way for everyone to use,\u201d said Wenqi Xian, who is from Beijing.\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nGeorgia Tech's InVenture Prize\nContact\nLaura Diamond\nMedia Relations\n404-894-6016\n@LauraRDiamond\nEmail\nlaura.diamond@gatech.edu\nAdditional information\nThe winning InVenture Prize team will take home $20,000 and represent Georgia Tech in the annual ACC InVenture Prize, taking place on campus much March 31.\nThe second-place team earns $10,000.\nBoth first- and second-place finishers will receive free U.S. patent filings by Georgia Tech\u2019s Office of Technology Licensing and a spot in Georgia Tech\u2019s startup accelerator program, Flashpoint.\nA $5,000 People\u2019s Choice Award will go to the fans\u2019 favorite invention. Voting will be held online and by text messaging during the finale.\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
