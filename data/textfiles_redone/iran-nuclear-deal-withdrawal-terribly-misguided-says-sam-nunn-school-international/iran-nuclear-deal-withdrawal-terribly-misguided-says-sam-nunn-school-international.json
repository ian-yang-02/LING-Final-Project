Whitlark said she doubts this scenario, in part because the United States lacks the political capital to convince international partners to restore sanctions against Iran.\nAlthough the United States could restore secondary sanctions on international entities that do business with Iran, those measures would fall well short of the far-reaching global effort that brought Iran to the negotiating table in the first place, Whitlark said.\n\u201cReimposing the sanctions regime is going to be incredibly difficult, especially on the scale that it was prior to the JCPOA\u2019s negotiation,\u201d she said.\nWhitlark also said Trump\u2019s decision will give Iran ammunition to further isolate the United States from its allies, and likely will severely damage U.S. credibility as a negotiating partner ahead of critical upcoming talks with North Korea over its nuclear program.\n\u201cThe point of the JCPOA was to take the nuclear issue off the table, to then allow for discussion on the other relevant issues, such as terrorism, regional turbulence, and Iran\u2019s ballistic missile program,\u201d Whitlark said.\n\u201cScrapping the deal makes that all but impossible, given that this action will fuel hardliners in Iran, drive a wedge between the U.S. and key international partners, and make the United States look untrustworthy,\u201d said Whitlark.\n\u201cThis is a lesson to any other current or future proliferant \u2014 be incredibly wary of negotiating with the U.S. or freezing or halting your nuclear program,\u201d she said.\nWhile Iran\u2019s next steps remain unclear \u2014 perhaps attempting to salvage some remnants of the JCPOA with the remaining participants or possibly even resurrecting its nuclear weapons program \u2014 the implications for the global non-proliferation regime are alarming, Whitlark said.\n\u201cDenuclearizing North Korea is already a herculean challenge,\u201d she said. \u201cSimultaneously combatting an Iranian nuclear weapons program and Middle East arms race add dizzying nuclear complications.\u201d\nWhitlark is an assistant professor in the Sam Nunn School of International Affairs.
