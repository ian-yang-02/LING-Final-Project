(Photo by Allison Carter)\nNov 08, 2021\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nLaura Czyzewski is the associate director of Graduate Programs for the M.S. in Quantitative and Computational Finance (QFC) program. Graduates of the QFC program work on the quant side of the financial services industry in various sectors such as investment banks, hedge funds, proprietary trading firms, asset management firms, consulting firms, and government or regulatory agencies.\n\u201cI describe my job as a bit of Jack-of-all-trades for this program,\u201d said Czyzewski, who oversees admissions, student services, and operations. The interdisciplinary program has faculty from the Ernest Scheller Jr. College of Business, the H. Milton Stewart School of Industrial and Systems Engineering, and the School of Mathematics. It is supported by four full-time staff members, one part-time staff member, and Faculty Director Sudheer Chava.\nCzyzewski previously served as a program coordinator for the Graduate Office (MBA and PhD) in the Scheller College of Business. She has served in various roles across campus, beginning as a Tech Temp in the Bursar\u2019s Office in 2005. She holds a B.A. in theater and a B.S. in psychology from DeSales University in Center Valley, Pennsylvania, and an M.Ed. in higher education administration from Georgia Southern University.\n\u201cA typical day depends on the time of year,\u201d she said. \u201cIf we\u2019re in the middle of our admission cycle, a lot of times I\u2019m doing marathon interviewing of applicants. And there are days where I get up at 5 o\u2019clock in the morning because I\u2019m virtually interviewing people from around the world.\u201d\nBefore the pandemic Czyzewski would travel to other universities to present information sessions about the program. Because of Covid-19 travel restrictions the staff turned to virtual meetings for recruiting students and for engaging with companies.\n\u201cIn a way, it put us on an even playing field,\u201d she said. \u201cObviously Atlanta is not one of the larger financial centers like New York or Chicago. Programs in those cities could invite professionals to just hop on a train and come over to meet with their students. We couldn\u2019t do that.\u201d\nDuring the pandemic Czyzewski and her colleagues began asking company representatives to just hop online and have an information session with the students.\n\u201cThey\u2019re more willing to do that now rather than spend time and money to send somebody to Atlanta. It definitely created some opportunities that we didn\u2019t see coming.\u201d\nLike almost everyone else, Czyzewski said working during the pandemic has been challenging.\n\u201cWe pride ourselves on fostering a true sense of community among the faculty, the staff, and the students,\u201d she said. \u201cNot being able to actually interact in person really did affect that. I interviewed people [virtually] a year ago that I don\u2019t recognize now because I didn\u2019t get to actually meet them and develop a relationship. So, it has been difficult to get to know the students because everybody was remote.\u201d\nThe most rewarding part of her job is working with students from around the globe.\n\u201cWe just completed our five-year academic program review. One of the statistics I was most excited about is that in the past five years we had students from 21 different countries attend our program,\u201d she said. \u201cWe had students from Nigeria, the Netherlands, Guatemala, China, the UK, Brazil, and others. It was a rewarding experience to learn from them and get to support students from all around the world. That\u2019s pretty big.\u201d\nIn her time away from Georgia Tech, Czyzewski is the lead vocalist of metro Atlanta rock cover band named Yesterday Calling. The four-member band includes Czyzewski, two guitarists, and a drummer, and they perform classic rock songs from the \u201860s through 2000.\n\u201cWe cover bands and solo artists like Fleetwood Mac, Heart, Led Zeppelin, REM, and Pat Benatar,\u201d said Czyzewski, whose favorite song to perform is \u2018Me and Bobby McGee\u2019 by Janis Joplin.\n\u201cI absolutely adore Janis Joplin because she\u2019s a legend, an icon. The song is also very vocally challenging, so it\u2019s one that I\u2019ve worked on over the years.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nRead More Staff Stories\nContact\nVictor Rogers\nInstitute Communications\nEmail\nvictor.rogers@comm.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
