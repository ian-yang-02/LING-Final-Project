It provides strategies for mitigation, adaptation, climate education, and research, while finding equitable, cost-effective solutions. \u00a0 The CAP is a deliverable of\nSustainability Next , Georgia Tech\u2019s 10-year strategic sustainability plan, and it is aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, the Institute\u2019s strategic plan, and the Comprehensive Campus Plan. \u00a0 \u201cAs one of the world\u2019s leading research universities, Georgia Tech has the opportunity, and the obligation, to create and share solutions that can help curb climate change and mitigate its harmful impact on our planet and our lives,\u201d said President \u00c1ngel Cabrera. \u201cOur Climate Action Plan is bold and ambitious, aiming for 100% clean ground transportation by 2030 and 100% clean energy by 2050. These goals are not easy, but they reflect the seriousness of the challenges before us.\u201d\u202f\u202f\u202f\u00a0 The CAP was led by Georgia Tech\u2019s\nOffice of Sustainability , with engagement across the campus community. The CAP Advisory Task Force, comprising experts and Institute leadership, helped guide the effort. Nine working groups in key focus areas developed climate action strategies, and additional stakeholder outreach with students, staff, faculty, and the Atlanta community took place at workshops, events, town halls, and webinars. \u00a0 The plan\u2019s nine focus areas and guiding principles are: \u00a0 Community, Equity, and Accessibility : We seek to ensure that fair and just climate policies and strategies are in place at Georgia Tech and that they prioritize affordable climate change solutions that support our internal and external community.\u00a0 Building Energy : We are committed to reaching net-zero emissions by 2050.\u00a0\u00a0 Renewable Energy and Offsets : We prioritize clean energy technologies to eliminate emissions.\u00a0 Mobility : We optimize campus mobility through a variety of transportation modes that are accessible, affordable, and low- to no-emissions, considering environmental and human health impacts when determining and implementing transit and land use actions. \u00a0 Materials Management : We support a thriving circular economy that focuses on upstream systems for achieving zero waste, ensures sustainable\u00a0procurement, and supports our local community. \u00a0 Water Management : We adapt our water infrastructure to be resilient to the impacts of climate change.\u00a0\u00a0 Education : We prepare all students, regardless of discipline, to address climate-related challenges in their personal and professional lives.\u00a0 Research : We expand support for faculty, staff, and students to advance innovative research and projects to address climate-related issues. \u00a0 Carbon Sequestration : We leverage the natural and physical resources of our campus to sequester and store carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.\u00a0 The plan has 30 strategies for reaching net-zero emissions by 2050 and advancing climate research and education. The most ambitious strategies include:\u00a0 Transition to electrification of combustion-based heating systems.\u00a0 Increase energy efficiency in building operations.\u00a0 Increase on-site renewable energy production, and procure energy generated from renewable and zero-emissions sources.\u00a0\u00a0 Transition the campus vehicle fleet to zero-emissions vehicles and increase sustainable and affordable commuting options.\u00a0 Implement blackwater reuse systems and increase water efficiency and conversation.\u00a0 Become a Zero Waste campus.\u00a0 Prioritize climate education across Georgia Tech\u2019s curriculum.\u00a0 Identify and shape future climate research opportunities in which Georgia Tech aspires to lead.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cGeorgia Tech is committed to sustainability and the environmental stewardship of our campus community,\u201d said Jennifer Chirico, associate vice president of Sustainability and chair of the CAP Advisory Task Force. \u201cThe CAP was developed in partnership with leadership and with our own experts from within Georgia Tech. As we move toward implementation, it will require a whole-community approach, and we will continue to work together to reach our goal of net-zero emissions by 2050.\u201d \u00a0\u00a0 To read or download the full plan, visit the Office of Sustainability\u2019s webpage\nhere .
