This commitment translates into streamlining processes and roles, and hiring additional employees at all levels, including 19 new positions for fiscal year 2023 in research administration, grants and\u00a0contracts accounting, and research integrity and compliance. Additional positions may be added in coming years as the need arises. A more robust workforce with improved levels of servicing will allow Georgia Tech to better implement the strategic goals set by the Commission on Research Next, as well as further the Institute\u2019s mission to develop leaders who advance technology and improve the human condition.\n\u201cThe investments being made in the people and processes that drive research forward here at Tech will enable us to fully serve the strategic research endeavors of the Institute and ensure our enterprise can innovate and scale to its full potential,\u201d said Tech\u2019s Executive Vice President for Research Chaouki Abdallah. \u201cI am confident that the positive changes we are enacting will help the whole research enterprise to grow at a healthy rate.\u201d\nFollowing recent internal reviews, the EVPR\u2019s team worked in partnership with the Office of the General Counsel and the Office of the Vice President for Administration and Finance to review the Institute\u2019s research administration functions. Consulting firm Deloitte also conducted an assessment that covered research administration, grants and contracts accounting, contracting, compliance, and pre- and post-award functions \u2014 centrally and across units \u2014 to help inform how to support growth of the research enterprise.\nTo increase the visibility of research, ensure research integrity, streamline processes, and improve the functionality of the EVPR office overall \u2014 and in addition to the 19\u00a0positions mentioned above \u2014 a new leadership reporting structure and corresponding positions will be created.\nA chief research operations officer (CROO) will join the EVPR office. That role will manage the newly created associate vice president of Research Integrity Assurance and the vice president of Research Development and Operations. The current position of vice president and general manager of the Georgia Tech Research Corporation (GTRC) and Georgia Tech Applied Research Corporation (GTARC) will be split into two positions: associate vice president of Research Administration (also reporting to the CROO) and general manager for GTRC and GTARC (reporting to the Institute vice president for Finance and Planning).\n\u201cAt Georgia Tech, it\u2019s our people that make the innovative and groundbreaking research possible,\u201d said Abdallah. \u201cBy investing in our research infrastructure and creating more efficient processes, we ensure that all faculty and staff are fully supported as they carry on the work to improve the human condition.\u201d\nSearches for the newly created positions will be announced in the coming weeks.\nAdditional Images\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
