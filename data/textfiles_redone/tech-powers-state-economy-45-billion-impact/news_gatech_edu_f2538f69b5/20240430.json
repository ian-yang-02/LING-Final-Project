We will continue to do our part to produce the talent, innovation, and economic development that drives our state forward.\u201d\nIn the past fiscal year, USG accounted for 159,034 full- and part-time jobs \u2013\u2013\u00a0the same\nemployment impact statewide as Georgia\u2019s top five employers combined.\nTech directly supported 9,617 on-campus jobs in FY 2022 and an additional 20,666 jobs that exist due to\ninstitution-related spending.\nThe study, conducted by the Selig Center for Economic Growth, finds that each job created by USG generates two additional jobs in local communities.\nIn FY 2022, Tech received\n$375 million in state appropriations , providing a twelvefold return on investment to the state.\nThe USG study finds that graduates in the past fiscal year, including the 9,952 Tech graduates, will earn on average over $1 million more in their lifetime than they would have without their college degrees. The 71,731 total graduates are predicted to accumulate combined lifetime earnings of $183 billion.\n\u201cUSG\u2019s 26 public colleges and universities, individually and collectively, make a significant economic impact across the state, helping to put Georgians to work while spending money in local communities and helping their regional economies support Georgia\u2019s growth,\u201d USG Chancellor Sonny Perdue said. \u201cAt the same time, our graduates are the real winners with this million-dollar deal. We\u2019re focused on continuing to help all our students be successful as they use their degrees to prepare themselves for their future prosperity.\u201d\nThe full\neconomic impact report\nand\nlifetime earnings reports\nare available on USG\u2019s website.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nSteven Gagliano\n- Communications Officer\nInstitute Communications\nEmail\nSteven.gagliano@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
