The prestigious fellowship has freed the evolutionary biologist\u2019s mind to think beyond the previous horizons of his lab\u2019s experimental goals.\nPackard formally announced on Friday, October 14, that the annual fellowship was being awarded to 18 scientists nationwide. They will receive $875,000 each, paid out over a five-year period.\nRatcliff, who studies\nthe evolution of single-cell organisms into multicellular groups\nat the Georgia Institute of Technology, found out he was one of the recipients a few days prior. And when he did, it sent his head reeling.\n\u201cThe first night after I heard about it, I had these waves of thoughts like, \u2018Hey, we could do\nthis\ncool experiment!\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThen I\u2019d go to bed and another one would jolt me awake, \u2018Woah, and we could do\nthis! \u2019\u201d\nFast-forward movie of life\nSince then, a legacy goal has crystalized. \u201cI want us to rewind the tape of life and watch it on fast-forward,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI want to see how unicellular organisms evolve into bona fide multicellular organisms with\u00a0robust division of labor, and multiple cell types. I want to see how development evolves from scratch,\u201d said\nthe assistant professor\nat Georgia Tech\u2019s\nSchool of Biological Sciences .\nRatcliff has gained notoriety among biologists for producing conditions that have accelerated the evolution of yeast and algae cells from single cells into cell clusters\u00a0that then grow in complexity and begin to specialize in cell function. One of his signature achievements is\nyeast cell groups called \u201csnowflakes.\u201d\nIn August, two months before the Packard announcement, the\nmagazine\nPopular Science\nrecognized Ratcliff in its\nannual list \u201cThe Brilliant 10,\u201d\nwhich applauds a select group of up-and-coming scientists and engineers.\nPopSci\ncited his work demonstrating how an\nevolutionary leap may have occurred\nthat was\u00a0key to the advent of plants and animals,\u00a0but also arduous, since single cells had to forfeit much of their own fitness for the greater good of creating viable cell groups.\nEvolutionary long game\nRatcliff thinks he may be able to shepherd a recapitulation of the evolutionary path that led to first complex beings\u00a0within his lifetime by hyper-accelerating natural selection in the lab. And he believes the accomplishment would be valuable to science for a long time to come.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve never actually seen that process in real time,\u201d Ratcliff said. \u201cI want to put that movie of the tape of life on fast-forward in my laboratory to be able to understand the general rules that govern this evolutionary process. It would have profound implications of how complex life arises not just on Earth, but also elsewhere in the universe.\u201d\nRatcliff says the Packard Fellowship will allow him to take the long view, and not only due to the award\u2019s ampleness. \u201cIt\u2019s very flexible in that they want you to be creative and feel free to pursue the research you find most exciting.\u201d\nUnlike most grants, this one\u2019s not tied to specific research milestones.\n\u201cIt\u2019s designed to nurture you,\u201d Ratcliff said. \u201cThey\u2019re investing in the researcher, and as a result, I\u2019m stepping back and taking stock of my research thinking in a way I never have before,\u201d he said.\n(READ: Georgia Tech's proud Packard Fellows through the years.)\nLegacy research in future science\nRatcliff sees the fellowship as an opportunity to make an impactful contribution to evolutionary science, and has been inspired by the work of\nbiologist Rich Lenski at Michigan State University .\nLenski has run a 28-year experiment viewed as classic in the field, evolving of\nE. coli\nbacteria in the lab for nearly 60,000 generations. The work has been an endless source of information and created a continuing legacy.\n\u201cOne of the great things about experimental evolution is that you can create a living record of the entire experiment by live-archiving your populations in the freezer at regular intervals,\u201d Ratcliff said. As decades pass, scientific and technological advances come along and allow researchers to exponentially boost the usefulness of that archive.\n\u201cIn Lenksi\u2019s experiment, for example, the recent revolution in genome sequencing means that they can examine the evolutionary dynamics of his entire experiment in ways they never would have expected,\u201d Ratcliff said.\nRatcliff envisions using some of the Packard funding to establish evolutionary lines that he would continue throughout his career. \u201cHopefully for 20 or 30 years,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d love to take these simple multicellular things we have already and push them to see how complex we can actually get them.\u201d\nHe would like to end up with a library of simple multicellular beings across multiple evolutionary phases.\nGeorgia Tech collaboration\nBut before he lays down details, Ratcliff wants to consult with his collaborators, particularly\nGeorgia Tech physicist Peter Yunker . He\u2019s been helping Ratcliff solve problems that organisms encounter as they become more complex.\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking at the materials properties of our (yeast) snowflakes,\u201d Ratcliff said. \u201cEvolving novel physical properties \u2013 bodies with specific functionality \u2013 is an often overlooked but major challenge facing nascent multicellular critters.\u201d\nWorking with scientists from a different discipline has\u00a0changed Ratcliff\u2019s perspective by creating thought synergies, a legendary\u00a0Georgia Tech strength. \u201cThe level of collaboration here is really unreal, actually,\u201d Ratcliff said.\n\u201cFrom the president through the ranks, there is an ethos of collaboration,\u201d he said. \u201cThat helps the science be better in the long term.\u201d\nA rare honor shared\nA Packard Fellowship is a rare honor that starts with the foundation narrowing down to 50 the number of universities prompted to provide applicants. The universities are then instructed to nominate two scientists each, who write a two-page research proposal describing their future work.\n\u201cMy faculty advisor told me, \u2018This may be the most important two pages of your life,\u2019\u201d Ratcliff said. \u201cI took that to heart and spent close to a month only writing the proposal.\u201d\nAnd he reached out to colleagues for help.\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty confident that I wouldn\u2019t have gotten it, if we didn\u2019t have so many smart faculty here who are so eager to collaborate. I got feedback from about a dozen colleagues in the School, and that made the proposal stronger.\u201d\nDisclaimer:\u00a0Any opinions, findings and conclustions or recommendations expressed in this material are those of the author(s) and/or researcher(s) and do not necessarily reflect the views of any sponsoring agencies.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nWriter and contact: Ben Brumfield\nResearch News\n(404) 660-1408\nEmail\nben.brumfield@comm.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
