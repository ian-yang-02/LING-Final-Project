Descriptions of their papers and their work follow.\nSaad Bin Nasir\nwon the top award in the Power Management Session for his paper, \"Hybrid Linear Regulator Featuring Switched Model Control with 6ns/8.6mA Response Time and 98.64% Current Efficiency.\u201d Nasir works in the Integrated Circuits and Systems Research Lab with ECE Associate Professor Arijit Raychowdhury.\nThe research described in this paper brings together novel control techniques and their circuit implementations in hybrid linear regulators for digital load circuits. The principal aim of this research task is to demonstrate ultra low voltage linear regulators with high gain and bandwidth, taking advantage of digital topologies that have been previously developed by Nasir and his fellow researchers. Silicon measurements have demonstrated best-in-class response times and energy efficiencies.\nParts of the ongoing research have been previously published in publications and conferences such as the\nInternational Solid State Circuits Conference ,\nJournal of Solid State Circuits , and the\nIEEE Transactions on Power Electronics , and the work has gained significant traction with SRC\u2019s member companies.\nDivya Madapusi Srinivas Prasad\nwon the top honor in the Interconnect/Dielectric Materials I Session for her paper, \u201cInterconnect Technology Optimization Based on Circuit Performance of FINFET CMOS and Beyond.\" Prasad works in the Nanoelectronics Research Laboratory and is advised by ECE Associate Professor Azad Naeemi.\nThis paper presents a paradigm shift in interconnect technology design to best serve state-of-the-art CMOS transistors. The advent of multi-gate transistor technology (i.e. FinFETs) has offered a lower device resistance at the expense of a higher device capacitance, when compared with the traditional CMOS planar technology.\nThis paper, for the first time, highlights the impact of this shift on the importance of interconnect resistance over interconnect capacitance and proposes a novel scaling regime for interconnects as compared to the one proposed by the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS). This approach reduces the interconnect resistance, at the cost of increased interconnect capacitance, to enable an optimum circuit performance.\nThe proposed design-technology co-optimization has enabled the circuits that were chosen for the case study to run ~1.5x times faster in a best-case scenario. This paper also presents the first rigorous study on the impact of variability in interconnect dimensions on circuit performance at a GDSII-level for various patterning approaches and shows that the new interconnect scaling reduces the performance variability.\nWilliam Wahby\nwon the top award in the Packaging and 3D IC Integration Session for his paper, \"Impact of alternate wiring materials on sequential monolithic 3DICs.\" Wahby works in the Integrated 3D Systems Group and is advised by ECE Professor Muhannad Bakir.\nThis work focuses on quantifying the impact of the use of tungsten (or other high-resistivity metals or alloys) as an on-chip wiring material in monolithic 3D ICs. Copper is unsuitable for use as an on-chip interconnect in serially-fabricated monolithic 3D ICs for any logic tier below the topmost, as the fabrication of each logic tier exposes all lower tiers to temperatures far in excess of what copper interconnects can withstand.\nThrough extensive modeling of 2D and 3D wiring networks, Wahby was able to show that the use of high-resistivity metals in monolithic 3D ICs typically increases the number of metal levels required for signal routing on each logic tier, which impacts the fabrication cost and performance of these systems.\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nGeorgia Tech\nSchool of Electrical and Computer Engineering\nIntegrated Circuits and Systems Research Lab\nNanoelectronics Research Lab\nIntegrated 3D Systems Group\nSemiconductor Research Corporation\nSRC TECHCON 2016\nContact\nJackie Nemeth\nSchool of Electrical and Computer Engineering\nGeorgia Tech\n404-894-2906\nEmail\njackie.nemeth@ece.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
