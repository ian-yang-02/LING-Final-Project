Now, scientists have taken early steps toward adding a stinging punch to clinicians\u2019 repertoire.\nWith a novel targeted therapy\u00a0researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology have purged ovarian tumors in limited,\u00a0 in vivo \u00a0tests in mice. \u201cThe dramatic effect we see is the massive reduction or complete eradication of the tumor, when the \u2018nanohydrogel\u2019 treatment is given in combination with existing chemotherapy,\u201d said chief researcher John McDonald.\nThat nanohydrogel,\u00a0a type of nanoparticle, is a minute gel pellet that honed in on malignant cells with a payload of an RNA strand. The RNA entered the cell, where it knocked down a protein gone awry that is involved in many forms of cancer.\nIn trials on mice, it put the brakes on ovarian cancer growth and broke down resistance to chemotherapy. That allowed a common chemotherapy drug, cisplatin, to drastically reduce or eliminate large carcinomas, with very similar speed and manner. The successful results treating four mice with the combination of siRNA and cisplatin showed little variance.\nChink in the armor\nThe therapeutic short interfering RNA (siRNA) developed by McDonald and Georgia Tech researchers Minati Satpathy and Roman Mezencev, thwarted cancer-causing overproduction of cell structures called epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFRs), which extend out of the wall of certain cell types. EGFR overproduction is associated with aggressive cancers.\nThe researchers from\u00a0 Georgia Tech\u2019s School of Biological Sciences \u00a0published their results on Monday, November 7, 2016,\u00a0 in the journal\nScientific Reports . Research was funded by the National Institutes of Health\u2019s IMAT Program, the Ovarian Cancer Institute, the Deborah Nash Endowment Fund, the Curci Foundation and the Markel Foundation.\nThe new treatment has not been tested on humans, and research\u00a0 would be required by science and by law \u00a0to demonstrate consistent results \u2013 efficacy \u2013 among other things, before preliminary human trials could become possible.\nThe current\u00a0 in vivo \u00a0success strengthens the idea that knocking out EGFR at the RNA level may be a worthy goal to explore in the fight against\u00a0 carcinomas \u00a0in general. The same\npatented nanohydrogel packed with other types of therapeutic RNA is currently being tested\nfor the treatment of other types cancers.\nHelper turned killer\nEGFRs are receptors found in epithelial cells, which line organs throughout the body: Lungs, mouth, throat, intestines and others. In women, it also lines reproductive organs: Ovaries, uterus and cervix.\nThey are long proteins that poke through the cell membrane, connecting the cell\u2019s interior with the outside. They look like squiggly worms with tiny mouths on the outside that take up a\u00a0 messenger protein .\nIn a healthy cell, those messenger molecules cause EGFRs to trigger long chains of biochemical reactions that lead to the activation of genes involved in a variety of cellular functions. In carcinoma cells, the number of EGFRs present typically skyrockets.\n\u201cIn many cancers, EGFR is overexpressed,\u201d\u00a0said McDonald, who\nheads Georgia Tech's Integrated Cancer Research Center . \u201cThe problem is that because of this overexpression, many cellular functions, including cell replication and resistance to certain chemotherapy drugs, are dramatically cranked up.\u201d\nThe cell goes haywire, metabolizes too much sugar, divides too much, and resists chemotherapy. The cancer grows into a tumor and can spread through the body.\nAn overabundance of EGFRs found in a biopsy is usually a sign that\u00a0cancer\u00a0patient prognosis is poor. \u201cIn 70 percent of ovarian cancer patients, EGFR is overexpressed at very high levels,\u201d McDonald said.\nCell suicide: apoptosis\nEGFR overexpression also makes cancer cells resistant to chemotherapy by thwarting a natural defense mechanism.\n\u201cThe platinum-based chemotherapies used to treat ovarian cancers cause DNA damage, which switches on apoptosis,\u201d McDonald said. Apoptosis is cell suicide. When cells can\u2019t repair DNA damage, they\u2019re programmed to kill themselves to keep the damaged cells from spreading.\nThe primary chemotherapy used to treat ovarian cancer works by coaxing cancer cells to trigger the suicide program, but having too many epidermal growth factor receptors gets in the way.\n\u201cEGFR overexpression hinders apoptosis; they won\u2019t die. By knocking down EGFR, we make the cell hypersensitive to the drug. Apoptosis is reactivated,\u201d McDonald said.\nExisting EGFR targeted drugs called tyrosine-kinase inhibitors disrupt an EGFR function, but their success in treating ovarian cancer has been limited. \u201cClinicians have tried EGFR inhibitors to treat ovarian cancers for some years, and they only get about 20% of patients responding to it,\u201d McDonald said. \u201cApparently, the particular EGFR function inhibited by these drugs is not critical to ovarian cancer.\u201d\nGuided brass knuckles\nThe short interfering (si) RNA designed by the Georgia Tech researchers attacks the cancer much closer to its root.\nTo make the protein for EGFR, RNA has to transfer its genetic code from DNA. The researchers\u2019 siRNA binds to the cell\u2019s RNA and stops it from working.\n\u201cWe\u2019re knocking down EGFR at the RNA level,\u201d he said. \u201cSince EGFR is multi-functional, it\u2019s not exactly clear which malfunctions contribute to ovarian cancer growth. By completely knocking out its production in ovarian cancer cells, all EGFR functions are blocked.\u201d\nThe nanohydrogel that delivers the siRNA to the cancer cells is a colloid ball of a common, compact organic molecule and about 98 percent water. Another molecule is added to the surface of the nanohydrogel as a guide. It makes the pellets adhere to the cancer cells like sticky cluster bombs.\nCancerous tissue may also be aiding the nanohydrogel in targeting it. \u201cWhen you get into a tumor, there are a lot of blood vessels, and many are broken,\u201d McDonald said. \u201cThis may help the nanoparticles get passively trapped in the neighborhood of tumorous tissues.\u201d\nIn the\u00a0 in vivo \u00a0trials, the siRNA, which contained a fluorescent tag, allowed researchers to observe nanoparticles successfully honing in on the cancer cells. Fortuitous victory\n\u201cWe originally selected to target the EGFR gene because its activity is easily measured, and we wanted to use it simply as an indicator that our nanoparticle siRNA delivery system was working,\u201d McDonald said. \u201cThe fact that the EGFR knockdown so dramatically sensitized the cells to standard chemotherapy came as a bit of a surprise.\u201d\nAt first, his team observed how the tumors responded to chemotherapy alone. Then they combined it with the nanoparticle treatment.\n\u201cWhen we gave the chemotherapy alone, the response was moderate, but with the addition of the nanoparticles, the tumor was either significantly reduced or completely gone,\u201d McDonald said.\nBut he tempered enthusiasm with caution. \u201cFurther work will be required to see if the treatment completely destroyed every trace of cancer cells in the tumors that disappeared, or if future recurrence is possible.\u201d\nIf the researchers\u2019 continuing studies further prove to be consistent, the combination of the nanohydrogel with other therapeutic RNAs could represent a significant advancement in the treatment of a wide spectrum of cancers.\nGeorgia Tech\u2019s Lijuan Wang and Dr. Benedict Benigno from Atlanta\u2019s Northside Hospital coauthored the paper.
