Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering.\n\u201cHardly a day goes by that there\u2019s not something in the news \u2014 a health concern or a recent breakthrough or societal challenge \u2014 that\u00a0doesn\u2019t involve neuroscience,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a growing field with so many\u00a0opportunities, and it\u2019s inspired a lot of interest from our students.\u201d\nOne of them is\u00a0 Yeseul\u00a0Heo .\n\u201cI got really excited when I learned about the new major,\u201d the rising second-year student says. \u201cI think I was one of the first to turn in my paper to switch.\u201d\nHeo\u2019s original major was psychology \u2014 and she is keeping that as a minor, along with a double major in international affairs \u2014 but she sees neuroscience as a way to put her studies on a more quantitative footing.\n\u201cAlong with psychology, I wanted to focus more on hard research, specifically on brain activity, and working with quantitative data,\u201d she says.\nHeo has gotten a taste of neuroscience already as a student assistant in the lab of Associate Professor of Psychology Eric Schumacher, whose research uses functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and other experimental techniques to investigate the neural mechanisms for vision, attention, memory, learning, and cognitive control.\nA Research Community\nSchumacher is one of more than 50 faculty members from disciplines across Georgia Tech who are involved in\u00a0 neuroscience research \u00a0\u2014 and have been for years. But however collaborative, widespread, and even world-renowned these neuroscience efforts have been, what they have lacked, Cope suggests, is \u201ccommunity.\u201d\nHe and many others anticipate this new undergraduate degree will build that necessary component, for both faculty and students. \u201cIt\u2019s a very important, symbolic event in the development of neuroscience on this campus,\u201d he says.\nNeuroscience is \u201cthe perfect incarnation of an interdisciplinary subject,\u201d says College of Sciences Dean and Sutherland Chair Paul M.\u00a0Goldbart.\n\u201cIt\u2019s also a subject of deep intellectual interest.\u00a0Who couldn't be curious about how the brain and nervous systems work at the most basic level?\u201d\nGoldbart\u00a0\u201ccouldn\u2019t be more excited\u201d about the new degree, because \u201cIt opens up a marvelous new channel to a wide variety of career paths and will make Georgia Tech even more appealing\u00a0to prospective undergraduates in the sciences.\u201d\n\u201cI am grateful to everyone who worked so hard to create a program that defines 21 st -century neuroscience education for a 21 st -century technological research university.\u201d\nNeuroX\u00a0Factor\nGetting from neuroscience activity to neuroscience community at Georgia Tech has been something of a journey, starting with the formation of a \u201cNeuroX\u201d committee back in 2014 and ending with Board of Regents approval for the new undergraduate degree in February 2017.\nTo reach this place, certain boxes had to be checked. It was not enough that faculty were engaged in neuroscience and students wanted it, although that was clearly the case.\nEvery time the Institute offered a neuroscience course, it maxed out, and professors were constantly asked if there would be more courses, or if they could open up another section.\nStill, Cope points out, \u201cIt\u2019s a legitimate thing for the administration to think about these things exceedingly carefully. No university can be everything \u2014 there\u2019s a limit to resources and we have to be strategic with our planning.\u201d\nBasically, the key questions were: Is there a demand for this major from employers? Is there a demand for this degree from students? How would a neuroscience degree program advance Georgia Tech\u2019s strategic plan? And would the program be redundant within the University System of Georgia?\nThis last question sent Cope over to Georgia State University \u2014 the only other USG school with an undergraduate neuroscience degree \u2014 to meet with the leadership of their\u00a0 Neuroscience Institute .\n\u201cI said, \u2018Here\u2019s what we\u2019re planning to do,\u2019\u201d Cope recalls.\n\u201cThey said, \u2018Oh, this is fantastic, with Georgia Tech\u2019s traditions and resources, you bring something unique to the table,\u2019 and they wrote a letter for me right on the spot \u2014 they endorsed our plan 100 percent.\u201d\n'Kind of Pulsing'\nWhile every neuroscience program has its \u201cmultiplication tables,\u201d as Cope terms them \u2014 certain facts every neuroscientist has to know \u2014 the bigger challenge is, where do students take it from there?\nHeo eventually wants to take her neuroscience focus into the study of first impressions. \u201cYou develop this first impression within two seconds in your brain, and you don\u2019t control that, ever,\u201d she says.\n\u201cSo, I want to figure what\u2019s the reason behind it, and if we learn the reason, is there a way to, not eliminate it, but maybe try to understand each other better, avoid racism and discrimination, and bring about more peace.\u201d\nAs a neuroscience undergraduate, Heo will learn what Cope calls \u201cthe three flavors of neuroscience\u201d \u2014 cell and molecular, behavioral, and systems.\nBeyond these basics, Heo can branch out into one of 10 different specializations \u2014 biochemistry, biology, chemistry, computer science, engineering, health and medical, physics, physiology, or psychology.\nIn her case, completing the psychology specialization will qualify her for a minor in that field.\nStudents are coming into the program from disciplines all over campus, and all these areas can and do intersect with neuroscience, notes Cope. \u201cTo have a degree in neuroscience means you have to be conversant in wide-ranging concepts,\u201d he says.\n\u201cIn my mind\u2019s eye, I have the sense of neuroscience kind of pulsing \u2014 it borrows concepts and technologies from all the fields, but it\u00a0doesn\u2019t only take, it gives back.\u201d\nThe undergraduate neuroscience degree will \u2014 as with all Georgia Tech disciplines \u2014 culminate in a senior research or capstone project.\n\u201cWe want to leave our students with an experience that really gets their creative juices going and gives them a tantalizing view of what they might do next,\u201d Cope says.\nThe\u00a0 program website \u00a0lists 50 occupations for which neuroscience can serve as preparation or grad school foundation, and then, of course, there\u2019s entrepreneurship.\nAmong the many other student startup and business incubators in and around Georgia Tech, there\u2019s even one called\u00a0 NeuroLaunch , which introduces itself as \u201cthe world\u2019s first neuroscience startup accelerator.\u201d\nProving It\nGeorgia Tech\u2019s Bachelor of Science in Neuroscience launched this fall.\nAs the community builds and the degree program gains visibility, Cope expects Georgia Tech to carve its niche among neuroscience programs as only Georgia Tech can.\n\u201cWe\u2019re especially mindful of active learning here, of inquiry-based education, where the students are led to discovery, not just have the discovery dumped in their laps,\u201d he says.\n\u201cWhat we\u2019d like to bring to neuroscience is the strong analytical, deep understanding of concepts and methods that Tech brings to its curriculum in all fields.\u201d\nDown the road, Cope sees the undergraduate degree program leading to more and bigger grants for neuroscience research at Tech, and ultimately a Ph.D. program.\nIn the meantime, he says, there\u2019s much to learn and do, quoting a fortune cookie slip he\u2019s kept in his wallet for more than 25 years now: \u201cIt says, \u2018You are respectable, you are intelligent, you are creative \u2014 prove it.\u2019\nI think that applies here. We\u2019ve got a lot of what we need to do some really great things in neuroscience. Now we\u2019ve got to prove it.\u201d\nNeuroscience Research in the College of Sciences\nNeuroscience is \u201cthe perfect incarnation of an interdisciplinary subject,\u201d says College of Sciences Dean and Sutherland Chair Paul M.\u00a0Goldbart. \u201cIt\u2019s also a subject of deep intellectual interest. Who\u00a0couldn\u2019t be curious about how the brain and nervous systems work at the most basic level?\u201d\nNeuroscience majors interested in\u00a0research have a broad array of options. Researchers at Tech seek to understand the mechanics of brain function and the emergence of normal, aberrant, or developmental behavior from the components of the nervous system at multiple scales of complexity.\nThe details of every faculty member\u2019s research are diverse, but they all aim to address one or more of the following overarching questions:\nHow does the brain perceive the world, learn new information, express emotions, and produce behaviors?\nHow does the nervous system cooperate with the body it lives in?\nHow does the brain compute responses and commands?\nHow do behaviors emerge from molecules, cells, and systems?\nHow can genetic and environmental factors impact neural functions?\nHere are examples of research led by College of Sciences faculty members.\nThe Reorganization Problem of Neurons: Addressing the\u00a0neurotoxicity\u00a0of chemotherapy\nBy A. Maureen\u00a0Rouhi\nEven as a child, Tim Cope was fascinated by how physically disabled people move. Why can\u2019t they move normally? That fascination led to scientific curiosity about why it can be so difficult to recover normal movement after disease or damage.\nOne path of inquiry Cope has pursued is the organization of sensory signals to the spinal cord. Over more than two decades of research, he and others have shown that sensory signals can be restored to normal\u00a0 when damaged sensory nerves regenerate and reconnect with muscle; however, their connections in the central nervous system reorganize.\nCentral reorganization changes the flow of sensory information, so some neurons completely lose sensory signals, while others receive twice as much input. Thus, regeneration is not synonymous to recovery, says Cope, a\u00a0 professor in the School of Biological Sciences \u00a0and in the\u00a0 Wallace H. Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering \u00a0and member of the Parker H. Petit Institute for\u00a0Bioengineering and Bioscience (IBB).\nAnother condition that may cause peripheral nerve damage, and subsequent reorganization is chemotherapy. \u201cWe have peripheral nerve regeneration after chemo, but we don\u2019t regain normal function,\u201d Cope says. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s this reorganization problem again.\u201d\nTo explore this possibility, researchers in Cope\u2019s lab recorded sensory signals of rats after chemotherapy. In this case, the sensory signal itself showed long-lasting abnormality. However, they also found that even when nerves are not structurally damaged by chemotherapy, the sensory signal remains atypical.\nThese puzzling findings led to the discovery that chemotherapy affects cellular mechanisms responsible for translating mechanical stimuli \u2014 for example, muscle stretch \u2014 into sensory signals. As with peripheral nerve trauma, sensory information changes, but for a very different reason.\nCope relishes this unexpected turn of the research. \u201cOur chemo studies led us to a way of restoring the signals to normal, and I think our findings may have some translation to humans,\u201d he says. \u201cWe believe if we can fix the signal, then we can improve the daily movement activity in patients who otherwise might experience disability long after chemotherapy is discontinued.\u201d\nFixing the signal means restoring the damaged proteins, or just bypassing them. Cope\u2019s team has identified a drug to do the latter. \u201cBut a better solution is to find out exactly what protein is damaged and restore it through genetic therapy or other molecular techniques.\u201d\nNext, Cope hopes to do genetic screening to try to get a comprehensive list of the proteins damaged by chemotherapeutic\u00a0neurotoxicity, particularly those involved in generating sensory signals. This work would be in collaboration with\u00a0 John McDonald , a cancer expert, professor in the School of Biological Sciences\u00a0and member of IBB.\nMeanwhile, other work goes on in the Cope lab. \u201cIf you\u2019re interested in how we generate movement and how sensory information is required to generate that movement, and what goes wrong in various disease and damage situations, then whether you\u2019re a chemist, an engineer, or interested in behavioral science, there is an entry level for you in my lab to study those things,\u201d he says.\nMemory, Emotion, and Aging: Exploring \u201cmemory clutter\u201d and the neuroscience of human cognition\nBy\u00a0Renay\u00a0San Miguel\nForget where you parked your car? Misplaced your keys? Can\u2019t remember what a restaurant dinner companion\u00a0 just\u00a0 said to you? All signs of early-onset dementia, right?\nNot quite, says\u00a0 Audrey Duarte , associate professor in the School of Psychology and principal investigator in Georgia Tech\u2019s\u00a0 Memory and Aging Lab . \u201cThere are memory changes we think of as being associated with dementia, and that\u2019s\u00a0very concerning, but that\u2019s not really what we\u2019re talking about,\u201d Duarte says. \u201cJust by getting older, we experience more memory impairment.\u201d\nTake that restaurant dinner, for example. When you\u2019re younger, people coming in and out of the dining room, nearby conversations, and any other distractions are easier to tune out. \u201cAs we get older and we have that impaired ability to ignore distracting information, it gets incorporated into our memories,\u201d Duarte says. \u201cThat information is there even at the subconscious level, and that creates what we call memory clutter.\u201d\nThat clutter gums up the brain and forces older adults to work harder than before to recreate that restaurant experience in their minds in the hopes of remembering information.\nDuarte\u2019s 2016\u00a0 study \u00a0on memory clutter is the latest example of her focus on human cognition. How does the brain process new information, and how is that tied to emotions and behaviors?\n\u201cI\u2019m a memory person, so I always think memory is the most important thing,\u201d she says. The information we take into our brains has to be processed by our sensory systems \u2014 what we see, hear, etc. \u2014 and then filtered through our past experiences. \u201cThose memories have emotional associations with them, some positive, some negative. If it comes down to why a particular emotion is stronger than others, we don\u2019t really understand why the brain is organized that way.\u201d\nDuarte\u2019s research involves exploring which areas of the brain are necessary for emotional processing. She and her team in the Memory and Aging Lab use electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to determine which parts of the brain make those connections between memory and emotion.\nIt\u2019s known that the amygdala, located within the brain\u2019s medial temporal lobes, is associated with processing emotions. Duarte says her research shows that \u201cif you see something that\u2019s negative, the amygdala is sensitive to that.\u201d But she emphasizes that other brain regions also seem to process stimuli associated with bad emotions such as disgust, sadness, anger, etc.\nDuarte is determined to discover how disease, injury and aging effect all aspects of human cognition. She believes the future of her field will bring an interdisciplinary focus, folding in computational modeling, biology, genetics and biomedical engineering.\nThe research tools she\u2019s using now are noninvasive. \u201cWe\u2019re not implanting electrodes in people.\u201d But to get a complete picture of neural communications \u2014 how that supports human cognition and what happens when that communication breaks down \u2014 \u201cwe\u2019re going to have to drill down to the neuron level itself.\u201d\nProtective Responses: Neurons linked to itch and\u00a0bronchoconstriction\nBy A. Maureen\u00a0Rouhi\nItch. Just seeing the word makes you feel itchy. The sensation that makes you want to scratch your skin does the same to other mammals, amphibians, reptiles and birds. \u201cItch sensation is an evolutionarily conserved way used by many animals to sense environmental irritations and respond accordingly,\u201d says\u00a0 Liang Han , an assistant professor in the School of Biological Sciences.\nHan\u2019s laboratory strives to understand how the nervous system receives, transmits, and interprets stimuli to induce responses. In particular, she is interested in the mechanisms of\u00a0nocifensive\u00a0\u2014 or protective \u2014 responses. She wants to know how alterations in neural pathways that mediate these responses lead to chronic disease. For now, she\u2019s focusing on two protective responses: itch and constriction of the lungs\u2019 airways, or\u00a0bronchoconstriction.\n\u201cEveryone experiences itchy feelings \u2014 when they get a mosquito bite or are wearing a prickly wool sweater.\u201d Han says. In these cases, the itch is relieved by scratching. But imagine if the itchiness goes on and on!\n\u201cChronic itch accompanying disease can be devastating,\u201d Han says. More than 40 percent of patients receiving dialysis for end-stage renal disease suffer from severe itching, as do 60 to 70 percent of patients with advanced liver disease, according to Han. Persistent itching can lead to sleep deprivation and depression. Despite the clinical importance of itch sensation, Han says, the mechanisms governing it are largely unknown.\nA long-standing question is whether itch-sensing neurons are itch specific or also signal other sensations such as pain. In earlier work using molecular genetic approaches, Han discovered a\u00a0 subpopulation of sensory neurons specifically linked to itch sensation . When those neurons are removed from experimental mice, the animals do not sense itch from multiple stimuli, but they continue to sense pain or pressure. Conversely, when these neurons are activated by painful stimuli, they elicit itch, not pain. \u201cThe data demonstrate the existence of the dedicated itch-sensing neurons,\u201d Han says, \u201cand advances our understanding of the cellular mechanisms of itch sensation.\u201d\nNow at Georgia Tech, Han aims to discover the mechanisms of chronic itch and find therapeutic targets for treatment, while also advancing understanding of\u00a0bronchoconstriction.\nThe lungs\u2019 sensory nerves help regulate the respiratory system, for example, by controlling breathing patterns and evoking airway-protective behavior such as coughing, airway constriction, and mucus secretion. Han\u2019s lab recently discovered a subpopulation of sensory neurons that, when stimulated, induce\u00a0bronchoconstriction\u00a0and airway\u00a0hyperresponsiveness, both of which are hallmarks of asthma.\n\u201cCurrent investigations of the pathogenesis of asthma have largely focused on immune responses,\u201d Han says. \u201cHowever, anti-inflammatory treatment only partially controls asthma symptoms. We need to understand the involvement of non-immune systems in the disease.\u201d\nRecent studies, including Han\u2019s, indicate an important role for the nervous system in the pathogenesis of asthma. \u201cWe are currently using molecular genetic tools to investigate whether blocking those neurons can inhibit asthma in a mouse model,\u201d she says. \u201cWe hope to obtain insights into the neural mechanisms of asthma and identify neuronal targets for management of asthma symptoms.\u201d\nMuscle-Neuron Connections: Maintaining contact as aging occurs\nBy A. Maureen\u00a0Rouhi\nYoung C.\u00a0Jang \u00a0aspires to understand the aging process, particularly as it relates to muscle loss. An assistant professor in the School of Biological Sciences and the Wallace H. Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering, and member of the Parker H. Petit Institute for Bioengineering and Bioscience,\u00a0Jang\u00a0hopes that therapeutic interventions could be developed to treat muscle loss, whether from aging or disease.\nIn considering scientific questions,\u00a0Jang\u2019s approach is to look at the forest. \u201cYou can be interested in muscle,\u201d he says, \u201cbut you can\u2019t just work on muscle to understand the whole biological process.\u201d\nMotor neurons connect muscles to the nervous system; however, the muscle-neuron connection can be severed by injury or disease. When the muscle is restored to function, the junction can be reconnected.\nWith age, the reconnection between muscle and neuron becomes increasingly difficult. When contact disappears,\u00a0Jang\u00a0explains, \u201cmuscles cannot communicate with the spinal cord and brain, and they start to degenerate.\u201d\u00a0Jang\u00a0studies how to keep these connections going in hopes of developing ways to prevent or treat muscle loss.\nAging and disease have some common pathways,\u00a0Jang\u00a0says. One is oxidative stress. When the body has an excess of reactive, oxidizable species, aging occurs faster than usual.\nJang\u2019s work has shown that oxidative stress contributes to disconnection of the muscle-neuron junction. Oxidative stress is a well-accepted theory of aging,\u00a0Jang\u00a0says. It posits that when the body\u2019s balance of antioxidant enzyme and oxidizing free radicals tilts in favor of free radicals, aging accelerates.\nJang\u2019s early work showed that, in mice, removing the antioxidant enzyme \u2014 which increases reactive oxygen species \u2014 promotes severance of the muscle-neuron junction. In humans,\u00a0Jang\u00a0notes, genetic mutation of the same enzyme leads to\u00a0amyotrophic\u00a0lateral sclerosis (ALS) or Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease, a motor neuron disease.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve found one mechanism that promotes detachment,\u201d\u00a0Jang\u00a0says. \u201cCan we reverse the process or slow it down?\u201d Looking for ways to halt or reverse muscle-neuron detachment has taken\u00a0Jang\u00a0to multiple paths of inquiry, including caloric restriction,\u00a0parabiosis, and organs-on-a-chip.\nJang\u2019s caloric restriction research showed that mice receiving only 60 percent of the normal caloric requirement\u00a0 form fewer reactive oxygen species, and the treatment promotes muscle-neuron attachment . Furthermore,\u00a0 caloric restriction rejuvenates muscle stem cells , which help restore the function of muscles degenerated by aging or disease. With aging, these stem cells\u2019 number and viability diminish, thus making muscle more prone to damage, a trend that slows with caloric restriction.\nIn physiological research,\u00a0parabiosis\u00a0is the physical joining of two individuals.\u00a0Jang\u00a0turned to this approach because blood is a way for cells, tissues, and organs to communicate. When\u00a0Jang\u00a0joined a young mouse to an old one so that they share the same circulating blood, he found that the muscle-neuron junction in the old animal is rejuvenated. However, \u201cif you put two old animals together, that junction detaches,\u201d\u00a0Jang\u00a0says. \u201cSomething in young blood is helping preserve the muscle-neuron junction.\u201d\nIndeed,\u00a0Jang\u00a0has reported\u00a0 a circulating protein in the blood that seems to be an important factor in connecting the muscle-neuron junction . However, this protein \u201cis not the only one,\u201d\u00a0Jang\u00a0says. \u201cWe need more research.\u201d\nMeanwhile, how could\u00a0parabiosis\u00a0be applied to humans? \u201cObviously, we can\u2019t put two humans together,\u201d\u00a0Jang\u00a0says. But it is possible to faithfully mimic\u00a0parabiosis\u00a0of organs on\u00a0microfluidic\u00a0chips.\u00a0Jang\u00a0is collaborating with\u00a0 YongTae\u00a0(Tony) Kim , an assistant professor in the George W. Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering, to design organ-on-a-chip systems for\u00a0parabiosis\u00a0of human organs.\nSensory Input, Neural Networks, and Locomotion: Creating a new rehabilitation paradigm\nBy A. Maureen\u00a0Rouhi\nSo you think walking across a room is easy,\u00a0peasy? Think again.\n\u201cWalking across the room is one of the most complicated things we do,\u201d says\u00a0 T. Richard Nichols, \u00a0a professor in the School of Biological Sciences and the Wallace H. Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering and a member of the Parker H. Petit Institute for\u00a0Bioengineering and Bioscience. Locomotion is complex, he says, the result of networks of nerve cells communicating, processing information, and integrating myriad sensory signals.\nIn studying how sensory information from muscles helps regulate movement, Nichols has focused on the Golgi tendon organs (GTOs). These sensory receptors in the muscle tell the central nervous system \u2014 which consists of the brain and the spinal cord \u2014 the amount of force generated by muscles. The spinal cord then distributes the information to different muscles in the limb. The feedback of muscular forces is thought to help determine how the body responds to obstacles or unexpected circumstances.\nSo far, what we know about\u00a0GTOs\u00a0comes from research on animal subjects. Injury to the spinal cord disrupts communication between the central nervous system and the muscles and causes malfunctioning of the spinal cord\u2019s neural circuits, Nichols says. \u201cMuscle weakness or paralysis can result, as well as loss of balance and stability.\u201d\nWorking with\u00a0 Dena\u00a0Howland\u00a0at the University of Louisville , Nichols has discovered a link between the disruption of the force-regulating system and motor disorders from partial spinal cord injury in animal models. They recently started two projects based on the GTO research.\nOne project, funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), aims to discover how the brain stem controls the\u00a0GTO-generated\u00a0neural circuits in the spinal cord to meet the needs of different movement tasks. The other project, funded by the Department of Veterans Affairs, will help define the extent to which malfunction in the force-regulating system contributes to motor dysfunction in partial spinal cord injury. It will also test the efficacy of a potential new treatment for spinal cord injury in humans that would not require special equipment.\nThe potential new treatment is based on the force-regulating neural networks of cats walking up \u2014 or down \u2014 hill. Researchers in the Nichols lab have shown that these networks are organized for propulsion when cats walk uphill and for suspension and braking when cats walk downhill.\n\u201cIt turns out that in spinal cord injury, the downhill pathway becomes extreme\u201d Nichols says. \u201cAnimals with spinal cord injury tend to crouch; it\u2019s like an exaggeration of walking downhill.\u201d\nSuppose animals with spinal cord injury are rehabilitated by exercising under downhill-walking conditions? The idea is counterintuitive but, Nichols thought, \u201cmaybe the central nervous system has some internal wisdom that will say, okay, now we need to repair this injury.\u201d Could training in this particular way promote recovery from partial spinal cord injury?\nNichols and\u00a0Howland\u00a0proposed this rehabilitation treatment to Veterans Affairs and received funding. \u201cAt the same time, because of our work at Tech, we can find whether the same exercise causes a change in the neural networks of the spinal cord,\u201d Nichols says. Through the NIH grant funding,\u00a0Howland\u00a0and Nichols aim to mechanistically connect the recovery with restoration of normal function in the spinal network.\nBiomechanics of Locomotion: Toward next-generation artificial limbs\nBy A. Maureen\u00a0Rouhi\nResearch in the\u00a0 lab of Boris I.\u00a0Prilutsky \u00a0aims to understand the biomechanics and control of locomotion, which comprises the movements that take two- and four-footed animals from place to place.\nDuring locomotion, sensations from the limbs (called sensory feedback) inform the nervous system about the state of the movement.\u00a0Prilutsky\u00a0studies how this sensory feedback affects locomotion. In particular, he investigates feedback from foot pressure and limb motion.\nDisrupting the feedback, through injury for example, can lead to instability and falls during locomotion. \u201cWe modify sensory pathways in experimental animals and in computational models and observe the effects on locomotion,\u201d says\u00a0Prilutsky,\u00a0 a professor in the School of Biological Sciences \u00a0and a member of the Parker H. Petit Institute for\u00a0Bioengineering and Bioscience.\nA key research tool is a\u00a0 neuromechanical\u00a0model \u00a0the\u00a0Prilutsky\u00a0group developed in collaboration with the group of\u00a0 Ilya\u00a0A.\u00a0Rybak , at Drexel University. This model accurately reproduces the walking mechanics and muscle activity of cats. Computational experiments have pinpointed the sensory feedback pathways that produce mild and severe locomotion defects when interrupted. These predictions have been experimentally tested.\nIn a recent study, for example,\u00a0Prilutsky\u2019s team injected local anesthetic to the paw pads on one side of a cat to block the sense of touch. Under this condition, the animal loses the symmetry of its gait and becomes less stable. The effect can be reversed, however, by electrically stimulating the nerves that convey the sense of touch to the central nervous system. When that happens, the cat\u2019s walk becomes symmetric and stable again.\nIn other experiments, they removed muscle stretch feedback \u2013 or stretch reflex \u2013 from selected muscles and investigated the effects. \u201cWe found that this feedback is task- and muscle-dependent,\u201d\u00a0Prilutsky\u00a0says. For example,\u00a0 loss of feedback from certain muscles of the ankle causes problems only in\u00a0downslope\u00a0walking . More recently, they found that removing the stretch reflex from hip flexors causes profound changes in locomotion, as predicted and explained by their computational model.\n\u201cFrom our experimental and computational studies, we gain insight into how spinal circuits cooperate with the moving body segments during locomotion,\u201d\u00a0Prilutsky\u00a0says.\nThose insights are now propelling\u00a0Prilutsky\u00a0and others toward prosthetic devices that behave like natural limbs. For example,\u00a0Prilutsky\u00a0is applying discoveries about sensory pathways, feedback loops, and natural control signals from the nervous system in the field of\u00a0osseointegrated\u00a0\u2014 or bone-anchored \u2014 limb prostheses. In this approach to attaching prosthetic devices, the artificial limb is directly anchored to the bone through a titanium rod, similar to a dental implant. Potentially this implant can be used as a neural interface between the prosthesis and nerves in the stump.\nAlthough used in Europe, bone-anchored limb prostheses are not approved in the U.S. because of the high rate of skin infections, which develop when skin fails to form a close connection with the bone implant. However,\u00a0Prilutsky\u00a0and others have shown that, in rats,\u00a0 use of porous titanium \u00a0allows skin to grow into the implant, thereby reducing infections.\u00a0 Recently they experimented with cats to test this implant in natural walking conditions to see whether it forms a tight bond with skin and bone and whether and how the animals use a bone-anchored prosthesis for walking. \u00a0\u201cIt works,\u201d\u00a0Prilutsky\u00a0says.\nNow the stage is set for the next phase: using the implant as a neural interface between the prosthetic device and the nerves in the residual limb so that the nerves and prosthesis talk to each other, and the prosthesis is controlled naturally without the person\u2019s attention. If the promise of this approach is fulfilled, it could revolutionize prosthetics.\nMoving in a Complex World: How do insects do it?\nBy A. Maureen\u00a0Rouhi\nHow do animals navigate their environments? That question motivates the research of Simon\u00a0Sponberg. An\u00a0 assistant professor in the School of Physics \u00a0with a\u00a0 joint appointment in the School of Biological Sciences ,\u00a0Sponberg\u00a0studies animals to discover how they move around in a complex world.\n\u201cPerceiving and then navigating the irregular terrain of Earth requires sophisticated processing by the brain,\u201d says\u00a0Sponberg, who received a\u00a0 National Science Foundation Early-Career Award in 2016 \u00a0in recognition of his promise as a teacher-scholar and is a member of the Parker H. Petit Institute for\u00a0Bioengineering and Bioscience. \u201cIt also demands that the brain work in conjunction with an animal\u2019s body and the environment surrounding it.\u201d\nAnimals have evolved to negotiate almost every environment on this planet. To do this,\u00a0Sponberg\u00a0says, their\u00a0nervous systems acquire, process, and act upon information. \u201cYet their brains must operate through the mechanics of the body\u2019s sensors and actuators to both perceive and act upon the environment,\u201d he adds.\nIn\u00a0 Sponberg\u2019s lab , researchers are studying how muscles operate as soft, living matter. They\u2019re trying to understand the physics of moving animal bodies and the computational principles implemented in the sensors \u2014 such as eyes or antennae \u2014 of animals in motion.\n\u201cOur\u00a0research investigates how\u00a0physics and physiology\u00a0enable animals in motion to achieve the remarkable stability and maneuverability we see in biological systems,\u201d\u00a0Sponberg\u00a0says. \u201cWe\u00a0explore how animals fly and run stably even in the face of repeated perturbations, how the\u00a0multifunctionality\u00a0of muscles arises from their physiological properties, and how the tiny brains of insects organize and execute movement. We study how the grace and agility of animal movement arises from the synthesis of its parts. Among these is the brain \u2014 a crucial part, but not the only one.\u201d\nThe\u00a0hawkmoth\u00a0is a frequent subject of\u00a0Sponberg\u2019s investigations. The swift-flying insect typically imbibes nectar while hovering over a flower. Feeding usually takes place at dusk, when light is limited. It\u2019s hard enough to see in dim light and even more when it gets dimmer with time. Yet\u00a0hawkmoths\u00a0also hover in air while following a flower that\u2019s swaying with the wind. How do they do it?\nSponberg\u2019s group has shown that\u00a0hawkmoths\u00a0slow their brain down to improve vision in dim light, much like increasing the exposure on a camera.\u00a0 \u00a0However, this adjustment can cause their motion to blur, so they only slow down to the point where they can still track the wind-blown motions of the flowers they prefer in nature. The behavior demonstrates that their neural circuits adapt exquisitely to the environment.\nMore recent work on three\u00a0hawkmoth\u00a0species \u00a0tracking the group\u2019s \u201croboflowers\u201d suggests that simple models of neuronal processing can account for interspecies differences in adapting to different light intensities, and the moths actually use touch sensors on their proboscis to help feel the flower\u2019s movements.\n\u201cBehavior, especially movement, arises from the context in which the brain acts,\u201d\u00a0Sponberg\u00a0says. \u201cWe start by asking questions like, \u201cIf we know something about the biophysics of how muscles works, how might the brain activate and control muscle to enable an animal to be most agile and versatile?\n\u201cWhat we are finding is that how brains process sensory input and program motor output is intimately coupled to the physics of the surrounding systems and the features of the environment the animal most cares about. Figuring out these coupling principles is a huge task but one that we are confident will help us better understand how we think and act.\u201d\nIntent and Action: Unpacking a little-understood aspect of skilled movement\nBy A. Maureen\u00a0Rouhi\nLewis A. Wheaton \u00a0wishes to play golf like a pro. He could raise his game by watching videos of star players like Rory\u00a0McIlroy. But Wheaton knows from experience \u2014 and his research \u2014 that observation alone\u00a0doesn\u2019t always help motor learning.\nResearch in Wheaton\u2019s lab is explaining why observing people who are highly skilled at motor tasks may not be helpful to those who are far less proficient. Wheaton is interested in unpacking how the brain integrates information to effect motor behavior, particularly highly skilled tasks that involve hands and tools. His findings underscore the importance of intent.\nConsider an array of objects on a table: pens, paper, mug, stapler. \u201cYou need intent to use things together,\u201d Wheaton says. \u201cIf you decide to write a note, you\u2019ll focus attention on the pen and paper.\u201d\nThat\u2019s obvious, yet some people with certain neurological injuries have trouble understanding what they need to do to write a note. \u201cIt\u2019s not automatic that you can string the information together,\u201d Wheaton says. \u201cPart of our work is understanding the relationship between intent and action and how that falls apart in case of neurological injury.\u201d\nUsing brain-imaging techniques, Wheaton identifies neural signals that capture intent.\nRecently he conducted an experiment with people with sound limbs wearing artificial limbs. The participants were asked to learn how to use the prosthetic limbs by watching a video of another prosthetic-device user.\n\u201cThe norm in prosthetic limb rehabilitation is to let people figure it out themselves, with help from physical therapists,\u201d Wheaton says. \u201cBut most physical therapists have two hands. They don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to be an amputee.\u201d\nThe study showed that people who watched other prosthetic-device users became more efficient than those who watched people with sound limbs.\nAnother tool is eye-tracking, based on the well-known correlation of eye and arm movements. \u201cParticularly in tasks that involve reaching, the eyes precede the hand,\u201d Wheaton says. Can we see intent from what the eyes are doing?\nNew research suggests that a key to rehabilitation gains might be rooted in visual strategies that capture specific action intent. The eyes see differently when observing different people do the same task, like bringing an object from one side of a barrier to the other side. When watching a person with sound limbs, the prosthetic-device user\u2019s eyes look only at the task itself: The object starts on one side and ends on the other, Wheaton says.\nWhen watching another prosthetic-device user, the subject\u2019s eyes go over the barrier and are paying attention to the shoulders, which power the prosthetic limb. \u201cThey are paying attention to the motor intent instead of just the task,\u201d Wheaton says. \u201cInstead of training execution, which we do a lot in rehabilitation, perhaps we should be training intent.\u201d\nBack to golf, Wheaton suggests, \u201cIts\u2019 hard to understand the intent of a professional when you are an amateur, until you develop more skill. Instead of watching Rory, take a different approach. You may be more like Joe, who will help you progress to the next step. Then you\u2019ll meet Mary, who\u2019s a bit better than Joe. She\u2019ll take you farther.\u201d\nWhen to Make a Decision: Accumulating and evaluating evidence\nBy A. Maureen\u00a0Rouhi\nWhat was your dinner last night? How about the previous night? How about the week before?\nMark E. Wheeler \u00a0is interested in memories and what happens in the brain that allows us to remember. Part of what he studies is how we make decisions about the accuracy of what we retrieve. \u201cYou can\u2019t remember immediately what you had for dinner a week before because you lack information,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you think about it a bit more, you may remember. How can you evaluate the accuracy of your memory? What is happening in the brain when we decide whether our memories are accurate or not?\u201d\nMemory is difficult to study, however. \u201cPeople are often not good at describing how they remember,\u201d says Wheeler, a professor in the School of Psychology. \u201cSome retrieved information may not be easy to communicate, people may ignore some memories, or they may be unaware of other memories.\u201d\nTo get at memory, Wheeler studies perception, which is easier to manipulate and measure. The hope is that understanding how we evaluate evidence in making decisions based on perception can help us understand what happens when retrieving memories.\nWhen viewed from the brain\u2019s perspective, even simple tasks \u2014 such as deciding whether an object is green or yellow \u2014 consist of a sequence of processing stages, Wheeler says. These stages can be represented by different patterns of brain activity. \u201cIf we understand the process as a system,\u201d Wheeler says, \u201cthen we can ask: What parts of this system are involved when things break down or don\u2019t function well?\u201d\nCentral to Wheeler\u2019s work is the concept of an accumulation-to-boundary mechanism. \u201cIn the midst of gathering evidence, you reach some threshold of evidence: Okay, now I\u2019m going to decide,\u201d Wheeler explains. \u201cThe idea is that brain activity that is thought to reflect evidence builds up, and when it crosses that threshold, that is the signal that you have enough information to commit to a decision. We don\u2019t understand precisely how that works, which is why we\u2019re studying it, but there\u2019s a lot of data that this happens at the neural level.\u201d\nInstead of asking experimental subjects to remember what they had for dinner, Wheeler asks them to lie still while being scanned by a functional MRI (fMRI) machine at the\u00a0 Georgia State University/Georgia Tech Center for Advanced Brain Imaging . Amid the constant beeping of the scanner, participants receive visual stimuli and make decisions about what they see.\nBrain activity data reveal how much evidence participants accumulate before they decide.\u00a0 The basis for this approach was developed a decade ago, when Wheeler and others showed that\u00a0fMRI\u00a0allows identification of distinct neural processes that work together when people make decisions based on perception .\nCurrently Wheeler is interested in how aging affects the way decision-making evidence accumulates and how that manifests in brain activity. His recent work, funded by the National Science Foundation and Georgia Tech, examines how noise \u2014 anything that degrades information \u2014 affects the accumulation of evidence and decision-making as we get older.\n\u201cPerception and decision-making,\u201d Wheeler says, \u201ccan involve a series of stages, where you take in sensory information, analyze the information, and accumulate evidence, until you can make a decision. Suppose that aging affects the first stage most significantly, but the latter two are fine. You could target interventions more precisely, if you know where the problem lies.\u201d\nThe experimental approach, Wheeler notes, can apply to other conditions, such as drug addiction or alcoholism. If one can deconstruct how the brain of an alcoholic takes in and processes information, it may be possible to develop better ways to train alcoholics to avoid that first drink.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nA.
