This often left her feeling isolated and excluded, but she\u2019s found joy through sports and competing in the Special Olympics. She is a huge softball and volleyball fan, and, as it turns out, also a big fan of the Yellow Jackets.\nTogether with the organization\nDream On 3 , Georgia Tech student-athletes and coaches wanted to make sure Sammie had a weekend she would never forget \u2014 so they welcomed her to campus for Homecoming.\nSammie\u2019s weekend started with the\nTech softball\nteam. She took part in practice and warmups with the players. Then it was on to visit with the nationally ranked\nGeorgia Tech volleyball\nteam, and Sammie got to hang out in the locker room before the Jackets played the University of Virginia.\nHomecoming weekend at Georgia Tech wouldn\u2019t be complete without a visit to Bobby Dodd Stadium. Sammie was fitted for her own cheerleading uniform, and joined the\ncheer team\nfor the pregame traditions in Yellow Jacket Alley before being recognized on the field \u2014 where the\nfootball\nteam brought home a victory against Duke.\n\u201cI cannot say enough great things about the Athletics staff that we worked with at Georgia Tech to make Sammie\u2019s dream experience so memorable,\u201d said Amelia White, volunteer and operations manager for Dream On 3. \u201cEach team each took the time to speak with Sammie and spend quality time with her. They all provided Sammie and her family with a lifetime of memories.\u201d\nLearn more about Dream On 3 and their mission to help create memorable experiences for children with life-altering health conditions here .\nAdditional Images\nContact\nSteven Norris\nInstitute Communications\nGeorgia Tech\nEmail\nsnorris@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
