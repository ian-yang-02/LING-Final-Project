Researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology and clinicians at\nEmory University School of Medicine\nare bringing a new understanding to these complicated conditions with the first high-resolution visualizations of stable spiral waves in human ventricles.\n\u201cClinicians have known for decades that spiral waves of electrical activity can occur in the heart, and researchers have done experiments in animal and human hearts before,\u201d said\nSchool of Physics\nProfessor\nFlavio Fenton . \u201cHowever, this is the first time the evolution of relatively stable spiral waves of voltage and calcium in the ventricles of human hearts have been mapped at very high spatial and temporal resolution.\u201d\nStudying live hearts from heart transplant patients gives a rare window into the detailed behavior of the heart during conditions that are difficult to treat like fibrillation. As a result, doctors can gain a better understanding of how spiral waves begin and are sustained, which can lead to new therapies.\nThe present work has been part of a decade-long collaboration between the Georgia Tech School of Physics and the Emory School of Medicine. The researchers published their latest findings, \u201c Direct observation of a stable spiral wave reentry in ventricles of a whole human heart using optical mapping for voltage and calcium \u201d and \u201c Spiral wave breakup: Optical mapping in an explanted human heart shows the transition from ventricular tachycardia to ventricular fibrillation and self-termination ,\u201d in the journal\nHeart Rhythm .\nMapping the Heart\nTo generate the conditions for spiral waves, the researchers applied timed electric shocks to the heart. Then, to visualize and record the spiral waves, they injected florescent dyes for voltage and calcium into the blood substitute that keeps the heart alive. The changes in light intensity enable them to record signals across the heart tissue, a technique known as optical mapping.\n\u201cIn this way we can visualize simultaneously the calcium and electrical waves in the heart by measuring the changes in light intensity as direct changes in calcium and voltage in the cardiac cells,\u201d said\nIlija Uzelac , a physics research scientist at Georgia Tech. \u201cThe amazing thing about this technique is that by using a high-resolution camera, we can obtain measurements of voltage and calcium at very high spatial and temporal resolutions that could not be possible even using thousands of recording electrodes around the heart.\u201d\nEach heart has a slightly different condition leading to the need for a transplant, so the researchers can investigate the dynamics of spiral waves with different types and severities of disease.\nCollaborating with Clinicians\nFenton\u2019s group has been studying spiral waves in hearts for more than two decades. Spiral waves are a good candidate for the physics field of nonlinear dynamics, where systems that appear to be unpredictable are not random but chaotic. Methods can be developed to control and terminate spiral waves to stop fibrillation with little energy, as Fenton\u2019s group\ndemonstrated theoretically\nearlier this year.\nPreviously, the group has worked with fish, reptiles, amphibians, and some mammalian hearts. However, thanks to the partnership with Emory, they have been able to study 10 human hearts from transplant patients who have received a new heart in the past year.\n\u201cWe're very fortunate to have this strong collaboration between Emory and Georgia Tech to perform these experiments,\u201d Fenton said. \u201cThere are very few physicians that, in addition to treating patients, want to partner with physicists to investigate arrhythmias.\u201d\nThe research has also been eye-opening from a medical standpoint.\n\u201cI had a simplistic view of ventricular fibrillation based on what I see in the clinic and what I have read, but actually looking at ventricular fibrillation directly through these experiments gives a different perspective of the complexity and of what's going on with their dynamics,\u201d said Shahriar Iravanian, an Emory cardiologist in the group.\n\u201cMapping electrical and chemical waves simultaneously in the isolated human heart offers a unique possibility to investigate mechanisms of sudden cardiac death at a new functional level and to associate the dynamic electrical changes characterizing malignant arrhythmias to the specific and individual pathology of patients,\u201d Said Dr. Andr\u00e9 G. Kl\u00e9ber, Professor of Pathology in the Disease Biophysics Group at the A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Harvard University.\nThe researchers are continuing to study explanted hearts and hope to tailor the experiments not only for basic science but improving treatments. For example, most arrythmias are treated through ablation, by burning the substrate of faulty circuits, or electric shocks, and this research could make such treatments more targeted and even personalized. \u00a0Such advances could have enormous implications for the future of the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias, a major cause of death in the U.S.\n\"It is difficult to map ventricular fibrillation because of patient instability and complexity of signals,\" said Neal Bhatia, an assistant professor of medicine at Emory and member of the collaboration. \"This research has potential significant clinical complications.\u00a0By detailed mapping of spiral wave dynamics, we can better understand their evolution and ultimately identify if and how the heart can be treated with better catheter ablation strategies.\"\nAdditional Images\nContact\nTess Malone, Research Writer/Editor\nEmail\ntess.malone@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
