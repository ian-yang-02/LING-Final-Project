Recently, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)\nupdated their guidelines on cleaning and disinfection\nof indoor spaces to account for the relatively low risk of infection from touching a surface.\n\u201cWhile we will continue to appropriately clean and disinfect common areas throughout campus, we are scaling back the frequency in low-risk areas as recommended by the CDC,\u201d said Nazia Zakir, interim vice president of Sustainability, Facilities, and Safety.\nBeginning May 10, the following changes to the campus cleaning protocols will go into effect:\nDiscontinuation of fogging of common spaces including hallways, meeting rooms, lobby areas, and classrooms. These types of common areas will be cleaned and disinfected daily by Custodial Services.\nRestrooms and elevators will be cleaned and disinfected once a day. However, heavily used restrooms located in buildings that operate 24 hours a day (such as Clough Undergraduate Learning Commons) will continue to be cleaned and disinfected four times a day.\nCleaning of labs will continue to be performed regularly by research personnel who have been trained in proper cleaning methods.\nAlso, consistent with previous protocols, if an employee is diagnosed with or tests positive for Covid-19, areas occupied by the affected employee will be closed for 24 hours when possible. If a 24-hour closure is not feasible, the area will remain closed for as long as possible without disrupting campus operations.\u00a0Custodial Services\u00a0will clean and disinfect all areas used by\u00a0the Covid-19-positive person.\nEnvironmental Health and Safety will continue to issue disinfectant, tissues, dry wipes, and hand sanitizer for common spaces and individual offices.\n\u201cIn addition to getting a vaccine, one of the best ways to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus and other illnesses is to regularly wash your hands and use hand sanitizer,\u201d Zakir said.\nDetailed cleaning procedures are posted on the\nFacilities Management website .\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nCovid-19 Facilities Operational Procedures\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
