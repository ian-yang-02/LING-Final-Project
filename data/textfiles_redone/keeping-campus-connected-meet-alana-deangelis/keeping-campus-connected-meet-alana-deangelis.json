We make sure you have the tools that you need to do your job.\u201d\nThe team works directly with customers across campus as well as with IT support professionals in the units so they can support their customers.\nDeAngelis\u2019 entire career has been in higher education, beginning as a student at Georgia Southern University in 2003, where she also worked for many years before coming to Georgia Tech in 2015 as an IT service delivery manager.\n\u201cI was looking for other opportunities, and Georgia Tech had a position that intrigued me,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was such a great opportunity to come up here, work on totally new software with new people, and just get a chance to grow my career in the IT profession.\u201d\nHer first project was helping to change the campus email system from Zimbra to Office 365. She moved into her current position after filling in when her manager left.\n\u201cI went from being part of the team to leading the team, and I couldn\u2019t have been happier,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was such a great move for me.\u201d\nBecause of the increase in online instruction during the pandemic, the work of DeAngelis and her team has become even more critical.\n\u201cWe have to make sure that these services are up and running and stable for the learning environment. It was long hours in the beginning, but now we have helped our vendors make so much progress in the features that they offer and the services that we can support and provide to campus,\u201d she said.\nDeAngelis enjoys working in higher education. The most rewarding part of her job is getting to interact with many different people.\n\u201cI will have a conversation with a literal rocket scientist one minute, and the next minute I\u2019m talking to the facilities manager of our building making sure they have what they need,\u201d she said.\n\u201cI love hearing people\u2019s stories. So, being able to sit down with them, hear their stories, hear their problems, and be able to work for resolution is what I want to do in life. I want to be that helper person.\u201d\nAway From Work\n\u201cWhen I'm not working, I usually spend my time being a nerd about everything,\u201d DeAngelis said. She participates in a live action role-playing game, LARPing, where the players physically portray their characters.\n\u201cDon't believe the movies that you see,\u201d she said, laughing. \u201cI would recommend everyone give it a try. You get to dress up as your favorite person, and go pretend. Why would you not want to do that for a little while?\u201d\nDeAngelis also knits, crochets, and sews. She practices handwriting, loves baking cupcakes, and enjoys playing video games.\n\u201cI usually play farming simulator games like Animal Crossing,\u201d she said. \u201cSuper Mario Brothers 3 is my favorite game. I still play on my original Nintendo.\u201d Sometimes she likes to watch others play. \u201cIf I\u2019m watching somebody else play I don't have to make decisions, and they can progress the story.\u201d\nHer sewing skills come in handy when creating costumes for herself and for friends.\n\u201cWe go to Dragon Con every year, so I make costumes for that. I\u2019ve also sewn pillows,\u201d she said. And she has knitted and crocheted blankets, shawls, and little stuffed animals.\nDeAngelis believes handwriting is a lost art, and she describes her handwriting as \u201catrocious.\u201d\n\u201cI love pens and I\u2019m a huge fan of all writing utensils,\u201d she said. \u201cSince the pandemic started I have expanded my pen collection, and I just practice handwriting. It\u2019s a form of faux calligraphy. You have pretty words on the page, but it\u2019s not cursive.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nRead More Staff Stories\nContact\nVictor Rogers\nInstitute Communications\nEmail\nvictor.rogers@comm.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
