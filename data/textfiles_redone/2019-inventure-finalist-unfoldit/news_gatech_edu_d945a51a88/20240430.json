You then punch a hole in the corner of the folded piece of paper. When you unfold the paper there would be two holes \u2013 one in each corner. The game reenacts this folding and hole-punching and quizzes respondents on the positioning of resulting holes. The team developed an interactive version of this question and turned it into a 250-level game.\n\u201cSome people pick up the game and know exactly what to do without a tutorial,\u201d explains Unfoldit developer Cliff Panos.\nThe brain-training game also has some slick design.\u00a0\u201cWe use a lot of fun colors and there are a lot of interactive features. It will vibrate when you get an answer correct,\u201d says Michael Xu, a computer science major.\nIn fact, everyone on the team is a computer science major. They built the game from scratch and spent a lot of time on user experience \u2014 \u201cEven to the small details of how big the arrow was between stages,\u201d says team member Max Brauer.\nThe programming minds behind Unfoldit are working on a way to automate the design of levels, in hopes of adding even more gameplay.\u00a0You can currently find Unfoldit in the Android and iTunes app stores.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nSteven Norris\nInstitute Communications\nEmail\nsnorris@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
