Members of the Board of Elections from DeKalb, Fulton, Gwinnett, and Lowndes counties will be present for the hour-long event, hosted by the Student Government Association\u2019s government relations committee.\nThe panel comes after Georgia spent much of the fall and winter in the national spotlight for the November general election and January runoff. Election officials across the state dealt with unprecedentedly high turnout, including a huge increase in the number of absentee and early votes cast, all in the midst of the pandemic. Thursday\u2019s event will allow panelists to discuss what such an experience was like and how to encourage future voter engagement.\nThe panel will also discuss proposed voting legislation in Georgia. Several pieces of legislation are currently being debated in the Georgia General Assembly that could change anything from identification requirements for absentee ballots to allowing same-day voter registration. Panelists span both major political parties and will be able to give their opinions about how such changes could affect their work, as well as the voting process.\nThe event will be streamed live on\nBlueJeans Events\nand will be moderated by members of the government relations committee.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nGrace Wyner\nInstitute Communications\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
