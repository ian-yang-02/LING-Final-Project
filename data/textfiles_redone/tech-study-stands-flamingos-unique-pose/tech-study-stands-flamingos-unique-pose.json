Ting is a professor in the\nWallace H. Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering\nat Emory University and Georgia Tech who studies\u00a0balance control in humans and mammals.\nTheir findings, published this week in\nBiology Letters , suggest a reason that differs from most previous suggestions: it\u2019s about reducing muscular effort.\nPotential applications stretch from better robotics, orthopedic braces, and artificial limbs, to more focused treatments for neurological or balance problems.\nBut Chang argues that simply providing clarity to long-standing questions about long-standing flamingos has great value as well.\n\u201cThere\u2019s something to be said for just scientific curiosity and learning how nature works,\u201d he says. Flamingos aren\u2019t the only birds that stand on one leg, he adds, but \u201cthe extreme example is the flamingo. It\u2019s precisely from these extreme examples in nature where you can really gain a lot of insight.\u201d\nA firmer foundation for flamingos\nSurprisingly, Chang says, given how long the question about flamingos has been around, \u201cthere hasn\u2019t been a whole lot of research done.\u201d Others have suggested that the birds engage in this behavior to avoid muscle fatigue or to conserve body heat.\nChang and Ting studied live birds at the\nZoo Atlanta\nflock, one of the largest breeding flocks of Chilean flamingos in the U.S. They also used two cadaver birds from the\nBirmingham Zoo\nand flamingo skeletons from the\nUniversity of California at Berkeley\u2019s Museum of Paleontology .\nZoo Atlanta and\u00a0 Georgia Tech Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees \u00a0(IACUCs)\u00a0approved all procedures using live animals. No animal was killed or harmed for the purposes of the study.\nTheir research shows that a \u201cpassively engaged gravitational stay apparatus\u201d helps the birds support their weight and maintain balance while on one reed-thin leg. The bird\u2019s specialized anatomy, clever posture, and gravity combine to give the flamingo this ability, which does\nnot\ninvolve bones locking into position. Chang says it\u2019s more like a hammock or sling than a lock, but it does require the unique anatomy of flamingos.\n\u201cThe biomechanics are such that when they stand on one leg, they become very stable and are able to maintain that posture without activating muscle,\u201d Ting says. \u201cIf they deviate from that posture to two legs, that no longer holds. It\u2019s very posture-specific, a one-legged posture that can support their body weight.\u201d\nThe \u201cpassively engaged\u201d part of the flamingo\u2019s gravitational stay apparatus is exactly as it sounds: It requires minuscule, if any, active muscular or nerve control, Chang adds.\nThose who marvel at a large, fluffy pink lump of flamingo body held up by one slender leg may be surprised to learn that the \u201cjoint\u201d in the middle of that leg is actually an ankle, not a knee. \u201cMost people don\u2019t realize that knee and hip joints are not actually in view in most birds,\u201d Chang says. \u201cThey\u2019re near the body, kind of behind the wing. The flamingo thigh is almost perfectly horizontal.\u201d\nAll that contributes to biomechanics that might actually require greater muscular effort if not for the flamingo\u2019s ability to \u201cstay\u201d in a pose, which flamingos can get out of easily in flight-or-fight situations.\nGiving robots - and people \u2013 stronger legs to stand on\nA one-legged standing test, actually termed a \u201cflamingo test,\u201d is used to diagnose human balance disorders with the help of pressure plates, instruments that measure balance, force, and other data. Humans are usually more than willing to stand on pressure plates. But flamingos? They tend to squawk at things foreign in their environment.\n\u201cThe zoo didn\u2019t want us to interact with the adult flamingos because they don\u2019t handle change in their environment very well,\u201d Ting says. But zoo workers could handle juvenile flamingos and placed them near the plates after they were fed, hoping that postprandial sleepiness would yield measurable data.\nThe cadaver birds actually provided a eureka\u00a0moment for Chang. After putting one into the one-legged pose, \u201cI don\u2019t know what made me do it, but I just kind of grabbed the leg and picked it up,\u201d he says. The bird maintained its posture. \u201cHere we have a non-living animal able to stand on one leg. Obviously, if it\u2019s not alive, then\u00a0the muscles are not activated.\u201d\nCan flamingo biomechanics help treat human movement and balance disorders?\n\u201cIf we know how much is passive mechanics and how much the nervous system has to control, it puts researchers in a better position to treat people,\u201d Chang says. Flamingo biomechanics can mean better wearable artificial limbs and longer battery life for stability supports.\nRobots could also benefit. Getting robots to balance can be difficult; sensing the environment and making adjustments is how they currently do it. \u201cBut if you design the biomechanics of a robot in the right way, not so much sensing but a sort of feedback control,\u201d Ting says, \u201cthen they would have this passive ability, and they would be more robust in uncertain environments.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nContact\nRenay San Miguel\nCommunications Officer/Science Writer\nCollege of Sciences\n404-894-5209\nEmail\nrenay.san@cos.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
