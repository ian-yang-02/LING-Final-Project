Through this expansion, Tech continues to strengthen its commitment to the state of Georgia and accessibility to a Tech education.\n\u201cWe are proud to welcome extraordinary students from all over Georgia every year, but the reality is that financial need is a significant barrier for many students and their families,\u201d said \u00c1ngel Cabrera, president of Georgia Tech. \u201cWe want to do everything we can to continue to remove those barriers. The Georgia Tech Val-Sal Scholarship is another exciting step in our ongoing commitment to expand access and to support even more of the most talented students from all over our state.\u201d\nThe annual $2,500 scholarship will be available to graduating high school valedictorians and salutatorians whose annual estimated family income is $75,000 or less and have demonstrated financial need. For those who also qualify for the Federal Pell Grant, an additional $2,500 can be awarded, bringing the total potential scholarship amount to $5,000 per year.\n\"By design, this award will help students who might not otherwise be able to afford a Tech education while also recognizing their academic achievements,\u201d said Paul Kohn, vice provost for Enrollment Management. \u201cLooking forward, we hope to see more, if not all, highly ranked students apply to, and enroll at Tech, from every corner of the great state of Georgia.\"\nOver the past five years, Tech enrolled 843 graduating valedictorians and salutatorians from the state of Georgia. These students represent 320 different high schools across 108 counties. The Val-Sal Scholarship will further opportunity for top students from across the state to attend Tech.\n\u201cKeeping top talent in state is critical and affordability should not be a barrier to that goal,\u201d said Rick Clark, associate vice provost and executive director of Undergraduate Admission. \u201cCompanies, government, and other organizations look to Georgia Tech to provide graduates from a wide variety of backgrounds \u2014 geographically, academically, and beyond. At this point, Georgia loses too many of our state\u2019s best students because of generous financial offers from colleges and universities outside of our state. Ultimately, this scholarship is an investment in our state\u2019s economic future.\u201d\nThe scholarship adds another route for Georgia residents to receive financial support beyond the existing\nG. Wayne Clough Georgia Tech Promise Program,\nwhich provides complete coverage of the cost of attendance for qualifying Georgia students who come from households with\nincomes of $55,500 or less.\n\u201cImportant initiatives like these would not be possible without the generous support and commitment of alumni, donors, corporate partners, and other friends of the Institute,\u201d said Clark. \u201cSupporting students who could not afford college otherwise is an investment not only in the future of talented young people but also in the future of Georgia Tech.\u201d\nTo learn more about ways to support current and future Tech students, visit the\nTransforming Tomorrow\ncampaign website.\nEditor's Update:\nGeorgia Tech was able to award the Val-Sal scholarship to 25 incoming freshmen for the 2023-2024 school year.\nAdditional Images\nEmail\nabudd7@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
