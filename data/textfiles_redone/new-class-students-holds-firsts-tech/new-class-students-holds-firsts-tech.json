After initial deposits, summer melt, and final drop/add, the class size is 3,760 \u2014 a difference of just 10 students.\nUndergraduate Admission is committed to expanding access in accordance with Georgia Tech\u2019s\nstrategic plan . Since President \u00c1ngel Cabrera set that strategic goal in 2020, the first-year class target has grown by around 700 students. This year\u2019s first-year class is 43% women, and the overall undergraduate population is 40% women. Twenty-five percent of this year\u2019s class is Black, Hispanic, or multiracial.\nOne way Georgia Tech is providing opportunity to more students is through its\ntransfer pathways , which have grown in recent years. Transfer students are at an all-time high, with 1,400 students or about 27% of new undergraduates in 2023.\n\u201cGeorgia Tech is committed to expanding access to more students from more backgrounds,\u201d said Rick Clark, assistant vice provost and executive director of Undergraduate Admission. \u201cWe believe that talent is distributed, but opportunities are not. This is why we are consistently growing our first-year class, and ensuring we have a diverse set of transfer pathways to Tech.\u201d\nFor the first time in Tech history, more than 11,000 degree-seeking undergraduates are from the state of Georgia. In addition, more than 1,000 Georgia high school students are enrolled through dual enrollment offerings.\n\u201cAs a public institution in Georgia, our primary charge is to serve the students and communities in our state,\u201d said Clark, a native Georgian himself. \u201cI\u2019m proud of our economic impact on the state, our research and partnerships that improve the lives of residents, as well as our significant growth in Georgia undergraduate enrollment at the first-year, transfer, and dual-enrollment levels.\u201d\nUndergraduate Admission is already in the thick of the next admission cycle. The Early Action 1 deadline, for in-state students, was Oct. 16. Early Action 2, for non-Georgia students, is Nov. 1.\nApplying to Georgia Tech will be free during the month of November, leading into the Regular Decision application deadline of Jan. 4, 2024.\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nFirst-Year Admission Information\nTransfer Admission Information\nContact\nKristen Bailey\nInstitute Communications\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
