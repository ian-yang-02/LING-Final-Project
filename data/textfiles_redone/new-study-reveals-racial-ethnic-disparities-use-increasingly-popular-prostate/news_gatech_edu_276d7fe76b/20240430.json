The study also found that Hispanic and Asian men with elevated PSA results were significantly less likely to be referred for MRI evaluation.\nWhile biopsies have long been the next treatment step for some men with elevated PSA results, prostate MRIs are increasingly being used to reduce the need for that invasive procedure.\nWhile the reason for the disparities is beyond the scope of the paper, the results are nevertheless concerning, particularly in light of previous research that has shown disparities in how physicians treat patients of color when compared to their white patients, said\nDanny Hughes , professor in the Ivan Allen College of Liberal Arts\nSchool of Economics .\n\u201cWe can\u2019t say definitively if the reason Black, Hispanic, and Asian men did not receive this particular test is that physicians did not refer them for it, or if the patients opted themselves out of further testing,\u201d Hughes said. \u201cRegardless, these disparities do highlight the need to understand what is happening and how to ensure patients of all races and ethnicities receive the best possible care.\u201d\nThe findings are particularly troubling in light of the\nelevated risk\nBlack men face from prostate cancer \u2014 previous studies have found Black men are\nmore likely\nto get prostate cancer, often get the disease earlier in life, and are more likely to die from it.\nBlack, Asian, Hispanic Men from 23.6% to 67.6% Less Likely to Receive MRIs\nThe study was conducted as part of a long-term HEAL research collaboration between Hughes and Dr. Richard Duszak, a professor at Emory University\u2019s School of Medicine. Former HEAL postdoctoral researcher Nino Abashidze, now of the University of Wyoming, Chad Stecher of Arizona State University, and Dr. Andrew B. Rosenkrantz of the NYU Langone Medical Center also collaborated on the project.\nHughes\u2019 lab, HEAL, uses big-data analytics to reveal emerging patterns in healthcare utilization with the aim of benefitting patients and providers. Such work is an increasing emphasis in the\nIvan Allen College of Liberal Arts , of which the\nSchool of Economics i s a unit.\nFor the study, the authors examined anonymous health insurance claims data covering 50 U.S. states looking for men who took PSA blood tests. They identified 794,809 PSA tests that had laboratory results available. They then looked for matching records indicating whether or not the men received a follow-on MRI based on varying levels of PSA identified in each man\u2019s blood. Higher levels are associated with potential cancer.\nAlthough medical standards for the use of prostate MRIs continue to emerge, studies have revealed thresholds that warrant further investigation, and those are the levels the HEAL study examined. They are 4 ng/mL, historically considered the threshold for recommending prostate biopsy; 2.5 ng/mL, a more recently recognized threshold for the early detection of prostate cancer; and 10 ng/mL, a level that has been associated with higher rates of biopsies and cancer diagnoses.\nThe researchers found that:\nBlack patients between the ages of 40 and 54 with a PSA above 4 ng/mL were 39.8% less likely to get a prostate MRI than white patients. Black men between 65 and 74 whose PSA results were above 4 ng/mL were 23.6% less likely to get a follow-up MRI. Those above 10 ng/mL were 43.9% less likely.\nBlack men between the ages of 65 and 74 with results above the 4 ng/mL threshold were 23.6% less likely to get an MRI when compared to white patients. Men in this age group with scores above 10 ng/mL were 43.9% less likely to get the MRI exam.\nAsian patients between 55 and 64 with results above 2.5 ng/mL were 57.3 percent less likely to receive a prostate MRI as compared to white patients. Asian men with scores above 4 ng/mL were 62.9% less likely.\nHispanic men from 55 to 64 with PSA results above 10ng/mL \u2014 the level most closely associated with biopsies and cancer diagnoses \u2014 were 67.6% less likely to get the MRI test.\nUnderstanding the Cause of the Disparities\nHughes and his colleagues are now turning their attention to understanding the cause of the disparities. The data used in the study do not reveal the reasons men did, or did not, receive referrals for MRIs.\nIt could be that patients who did not get the MRIs opted out of the tests, including some who may have instead been referred to receive the invasive biopsy test, despite the problems that can be associated with those tests. Or, Hughes said, the results may be further confirmation of previous studies that have shown significant biases among physicians in how they care for Black, Hispanic, and Asian patients compared to their white patients.\nPrevious studies have shown, for instance, that doctors are less likely to discuss treatment options and side effects with Black patients when compared to their white counterparts.\n\u201cWe need to understand more about the role of decision-making biases in physicians, as well as other potential factors in the health care system that could account for the disparities we are seeing in this study,\u201d Hughes said.\nThe study, \u201cRacial/Ethnic Disparities in the Use of Prostate MRI Following an Elevated Prostate-Specific Antigen Test,\u201d was published Nov. 8, 2021.
