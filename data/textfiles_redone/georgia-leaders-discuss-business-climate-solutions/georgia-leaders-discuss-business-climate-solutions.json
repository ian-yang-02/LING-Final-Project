The conversation, \u201cThe Business of Climate Solutions, Local to Global,\u201d was moderated by\nSaportaReport\neditor\nMaria Saporta\nand CNN national correspondent\nNick Valencia , and hosted at the Georgia Tech Research Institute. The event was part of the\nAtlanta Press Club \u2019s Newsmaker Leadership Series and produced in partnership with the\nDrawdown Georgia Business Compact , an initiative of the\nRay\nC. Anderson Center for Sustainable Business\nat the Georgia Tech Scheller College of Business. Read more for highlights from the discussion.\nUrgent Action Needed\nWhen Saporta asked Cabrera to rank on a scale of one to 10 the degree of urgency with which climate change needs to be addressed, without missing a beat, he responded, \u201c10.\u201d He referred to the latest \u201c sobering\u201d report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , which describes how the perils of climate change are not only in the future but are already here now.\nBastian said, \u201cWe can\u2019t walk out of this timeframe without a renewed commitment to replenishing the Earth \u2026 and creating an opportunity for all of our children going forward.\u201d\nCabrera, hopeful that humanity can find solutions for this present threat, used the lightning-fast development of the Covid-19 vaccine as an example of what can happen when humanity unites to face a global threat. Solving the climate crisis, he said, will require \u201cthe best of our best thinking\u201d from scientists, engineers, policy experts, social scientists, and others in many fields.\nEmbrace Innovative Solutions\nCabrera additionally shared how Georgia Tech and Delta partnered on a project to remove the wiring from certain aircraft entertainment systems to make them wireless devices. That small change, removing kilograms of material from planes, led to improvement on the fleet\u2019s overall efficiency. Cabrera said, \u201cA lot of innovation is not about, \u2018Oh, let\u2019s all stop flying \u2026 or stop living.\u2019 No, it\u2019s, \u2018How can we be\nsmart\nabout doing this?\u2019\u201d He acknowledged Georgia Tech experts in the room who understand what types of combustion technology can be most efficient, and those who are working on carbon capture. He said that while some may think carbon reduction is anti-business, the truth is quite the opposite. Cabrera said that many innovative solutions will, in fact, create more opportunities for business.\nScaling Up\nDeveloping innovative ideas and technologies isn\u2019t the problem. The question is: How are they to be funded and scaled? Bastian said, \u201cNinety-eight percent of [Delta\u2019s] footprint is fossil fuel \u2026 jet fuel.\u201d The airline industry is classified as \u201chard-to-decarbonize.\u201d While Delta is working with Georgia Tech and other organizations on how to replace their energy source, there isn\u2019t presently a viable alternative to jet fuel. Bastian said, \u201cAt Delta, if we acquired all of the sustainable aviation fuel that exists in production today\nin the world,\nit\u2019s enough to fuel our planes for one day.\u201d Even though sustainable aviation fuel\ncan\nbe produced, it\u2019s incredibly expensive, costing anywhere from three to five times a gallon more than jet fuel. \u201cEnergy producers aren\u2019t going to invest the tens of billions of dollars required unless they know they\u2019re going to have somebody on their side,\u201d said Bastian.\nThe speakers expressed hope that our government can intervene the same way it did with electric vehicles (EVs). Incentives and subsidies created the investment for EVs to be produced \u2013 and this segment of the auto industry is now seeing a boom.\nPreparing Business Leaders\nThe Ray C. Anderson Center for Sustainable Business supports corporate sustainability through education, research, and industry partnerships. It is motivated by the example set by sustainable business visionary and Interface founder\nRay C. Anderson\n(IE 1956, Honorary Ph.D. 2011), who understood the role of business in tackling the big challenges the world is facing.\nCabrera said, \u201c[The center] is aligned with this vision that business ... and business leaders have a key role to play. And it all starts when a business leader says, \u2018This is important, and I want to hire someone to lead the effort.\u2019\u201d He also explained that the solutions that are going to be coming forward are not just new technologies but new business models that accompany those technologies.\nClimate Solutions Start at Home\nDrawdown Georgia\nis a multi-university research collaboration led by Georgia Tech, with leadership from the\nRay C. Anderson Foundation . Its research has resulted in a list of 20 proposed carbon solutions tailored to Georgia to help businesses of all sizes understand the importance of their carbon impact.\nCabrera said, \u201cThis is an effort to bring this global problem close to home.\u201d\nDrawdown Georgia takes into consideration the state\u2019s unique economy, population mix, and geography. Delta is one of the 28 (and counting) Drawdown Georgia Business Compact members seeking to reduce their carbon footprint and positively impact \u201cbeyond carbon\u201d issues of equity, economic development, and public health.\nOverall, the discussion underscored the urgent need for businesses, the government, and individuals to take action immediately. Valencia summarized what exactly is at stake. He said, \u201cThis is one of the most important discussions of our time. As a father of two small children, I want to make sure that I leave a good world here behind for my kids, and I know that these individuals here are doing their part to make sure that the future generations have a world to live in.\u201d\nIn addition to the Atlanta Press Club and the Drawdown Georgia Business Compact, other sponsors included Delta Air Lines and Southern Company Gas.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nJennifer Lux\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
