The full-time staff size has stayed nearly the same the past five years, while applications have increased 49% during that time. Full-time staff also meet with high school counselors, \u00a0recruit students, conduct information sessions, and coordinate campus visits. Seasonal staff are essential when \u00a0it comes to crunch time of application review.\nClark hopes for a diverse pool of applicants for the reader positions and encourages the campus community to share this opportunity broadly with their networks.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had former teachers, engineers, lawyers, all different backgrounds,\u201d he said. \u201cDiversity of perspective is critical to helping us create an inclusive community on campus, so we are committed to ensuring this group brings a wide variety of backgrounds to our \u00a0review.\u201d All seasonal staff are trained on Georgia Tech\u2019s holistic admission process.\nThese temporary positions are largely remote and last around six months (September-February), but temporary staff members are integrated into the full-time team as much as possible. Many past seasonal staff members have chosen to return in subsequent years.\n\u201cThey not only read applications, but make notes and have conversations with our full-time staff about applicants,\u201d Clark said. \u201cThey\u2019re integral to getting the work done and also to helping Tech make the best possible selections of candidates. Expanding access is one of our top priorities, and a diverse team of readers will enable us to do that.\u201d\nGeorgia Tech received an additional 4,000 applications just last year, and an increase in applications to all six of its colleges. More than 45,000 students applied to Georgia Tech this year for an enrolling first-year class of 3,450.\nThe part-time positions are open now.\nView the full job description and how to apply .\nAdditional Images\nContact\nKristen Bailey\nInstitute Communications\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
