They used source-based morphometry analysis, which boosts the statistical power for studies with a moderate sample size.\n\u201cScience has shown that the brain\u2019s structure affects its function, and abnormal brain imaging has emerged as a major feature of Covid?19,\u201d said Kuaikuai Duan, the study\u2019s first author, a graduate research assistant at TReNDS and Ph.D. student in Georgia Tech\u2019s School of Electrical and Computer Engineering. \u201cPrevious studies have examined how the brain is affected by Covid-19 using a univariate approach, but ours is the first to use a multivariate, data-driven approach to link these changes to specific Covid-19 characteristics (for example fever and lack of oxygen) and outcome (disability level).\u201d\nThe analysis showed patients with higher levels of disability had lower gray matter volume in the superior, medial and middle frontal gyri at discharge and six months later, even when controlling for cerebrovascular diseases. Gray matter volume in this region was also significantly reduced in patients receiving oxygen therapy compared to patients not receiving oxygen therapy. Patients with fever had a significant reduction in gray matter volume in the inferior and middle temporal gyri and the fusiform gyrus\u00a0compared to patients without fever. The results suggest Covid-19 may affect the frontal-temporal network through fever or lack of oxygen.\nReduced gray matter in the superior, medial and middle frontal gyri was also present in patients with agitation compared to patients without agitation. This implies that gray matter changes in the frontal region of the brain may underlie the mood disturbances commonly exhibited by Covid-19 patients.\n\u201cNeurological complications are increasingly documented for patients with Covid-19,\u201d said\nVince Calhoun , senior author of the study and director of TReNDS. Calhoun is Distinguished University Professor of Psychology at Georgia State and holds appointments in\u00a0the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Georgia Tech and in neurology and psychiatry at Emory University. \u201cA reduction of gray matter has also been shown to be present in other mood disorders such as schizophrenia and is likely related to the way that gray matter influences neuron function.\u201d\nThe study\u2019s findings demonstrate changes to the frontal-temporal network could be used as a biomarker to determine the likely prognosis of Covid-19 or evaluate treatment options for the disease. Next, the researchers hope to replicate the study on a larger sample size that includes many types of brain scans and different populations of Covid-19 patients.\nTReNDS is a partnership among Georgia State, Georgia Tech and Emory University and is focused on improving our understanding of the human brain using advanced analytic approaches.
