It seemed impossible, yet it went swimmingly, and Bray\nhad compelling evidence\nthat the system would have worked as it is today in\u00a0extremely harsh conditions 4 billion years ago when it evolved.\nThe experiment\u2019s success reaffirmed the translational system\u2019s place at the earliest foundations of life on Earth and its robustness through the eons.\nThe translational system\nEvery living thing exists because the translational system receives messages from DNA delivered to it by RNA and translates the messages into proteins. The system centers on a cellular machine called the ribosome, which is made of multiple large molecules of RNA and protein and is ubiquitous in life as we know it.\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing alive without ribosomes,\u201d said\u00a0 Loren Williams, a professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology\u2019s School of Chemistry and Biochemistry . \u201cThe ribosome is about the oldest and most universal part of biology, and its origins go very far back to a time not too long after Earth had formed and cooled.\u201d\nMagnesium linchpins yanked\nThose linchpins that hold it all together and that Bray yanked out and replaced were metal ions (atoms with charges, in this case positive).\nIn today\u2019s ribosome, and in the whole translational system, the linchpins are magnesium ions, and Bray\u2019s experiment replaced them all with iron ions and manganese ions, which were overabundant on primordial Earth. Williams and Jennifer Glass, the principal investigators\nin the new study , also had their doubts the system would hold up without the magnesium.\n\u201cI thought, \u2018It\u2019s not going to work, but we might as well try the moonshot\u2019,\u201d said Williams who has led similar work before but on simpler molecules. \u201cThe fact that swapping out all the magnesium in the translational system actually worked was mind-boggling.\u201d\nThat\u2019s because in living systems today, magnesium helps shape ribosomes and help them work. It is\u00a0needed in addition to the ribosome for some 20\u00a0enzymes of the translational system. It\u2019s one reason why dietary magnesium (Mg) is so important.\n\u201cThe number of different things magnesium does in the ribosome and in the translational system is just enormous,\u201d said Williams. \u201cThere are so many types of catalytic activities in translation, and magnesium is involved in almost all of them.\u201d\nLava-belching Earth\nWhen first life evolved, fissures in Earth\u2019s crust still belched lava and meteor impacts were still common. There was no breathable oxygen and the planet was brimming with iron and manganese.\nThis may have made them attractive for the translational system to use as the dominant ions. Magnesium was likely involved, too, though it was probably less available than today.\nThe researchers wanted to know if the translational system first evolved to function with those other metals as their linchpins. So, Bray, a graduate research assistant in Williams\u2019s and in Glass\u2019s lab, swapped out the magnesium ions for them, tabula rasa.\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t have any substantial reason to believe it would work, and it was a huge surprise to all of us when it did,\u201d Bray said. And it strongly corroborated that the translational system would have thrived under early Earth conditions.\nBray, co-first author Timothy Lenz and co-principal investigators Glass and Williams\npublished their results in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences on November 9, 2018 . The research was funded by the NASA Exobiology program. Glass is an\u00a0 assistant professor in Georgia Tech\u2019s School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences .\n\u2018Textbook-rewriting results\u2019\nAmazingly, the atomic swaps barely changed the shape of the ribosome.\n\u201cIt\u2019s totally unbelievable this would work because biology makes very specific use of things. Change one atom and it can wreck a whole protein,\u201d Williams said. \u201cWhen we probed the structure, we saw that all three metals do essentially the same thing to the structure.\u201d\nWhen they tested the performance of the translational system with iron replacing magnesium, it was 50 to 80 percent as efficient as normal (with magnesium). \u201cManganese worked even better than iron,\u201d Bray said.\n\u201cI think these may be textbook-rewriting results since the whole field of ribosome research involves magnesium,\u201d Bray said. \u201cNow, with what we\u2019ve done, it\u2019s no longer the case that only magnesium works.\u201d\nPrimordial gas tent\nBray incubated ribosomes in the presence of magnesium, iron, or manganese inside a special chamber with an artificial atmosphere devoid of oxygen, like the Earth four billion years ago.\nHe found that the magnesium replacement went far beyond atoms in the ribosome.\n\u201cSurrounding the ribosome is also a huge cloud of magnesium atoms. It\u2019s called an atmosphere, or shell, and engulfs it completely. I replaced everything, including that, and the whole system still worked.\u201d\nEons down the road, the evolution of the translational system in the presence of magnesium may have given it an adaptive advantage. As oxygen levels on Earth rose, binding up free manganese and iron, and making them less available to biology, magnesium probably comfortably assumed the thousands of roles it occupies in the translational system today.\nLike this article?\u00a0 Subscribe to our email newsletter\nAlso READ: \u00a0 Laughing Gas May Have Helped Warm Early Earth and Given Breath to Life\nThese researchers coauthored the study: Jay Haynes, Jessica Bowman, Anton Petrov, Amit Reddi, and Nicholas Hud, all of Georgia Tech.
