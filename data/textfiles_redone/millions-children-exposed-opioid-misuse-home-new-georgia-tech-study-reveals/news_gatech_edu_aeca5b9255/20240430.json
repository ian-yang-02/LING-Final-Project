However, the number of children living with someone with opioid use disorder increased by 30%, rising from 423,000 in 2002 to 548,000 in 2017.\nOpioid misuse is defined as the use, even once, of opioids prescribed for someone else or only for the feeling it causes. Opioid use disorder applies to someone who exhibits symptoms of abuse or dependency.\nThe study, which draws on data from the\nNational Survey of Drug Use and Health\nand the\nAmerican Community Survey , also found that 198,000 children were living with a heroin user in 2017. That number was up 200% from 2002.\nAmong other findings contained in the study:\nAmong children living with an adult who abuses opioids, about a one third likely live with multiple adult abusers of opioids.\nThe decline in opioid misuse is largest among one-child households.\nAmong adults living in childless households, about 52 in every 1,000 misused opioids in 2017. In households with children, about 46 of every 1,000 adults misused opioids. That number fell over 15 years examined in the study.\nOpioid use disorder is much less common. About 8 of every 1,000 adults living in households with children had opioid use disorder in 2017. That number rose between 2002 and 2017.\nThe rate of heroin use in childless households grew from two in every 1,000 adults in 2002 to 5.6 in every 1,000 adults in 2017.\nRecent Georgia Tech Research Examined Opioid Epidemic Costs\nAccording to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, more than\n130 people die each day\nfrom opioid overdoses. The Institute, citing the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, estimates prescription opioid abuse exacts an economic toll of $78.5 billion a year, including the costs of healthcare, lost productivity, addiction treatment, and criminal justice involvement.\nIn 2018, Georgia Tech\nAssistant Professor Scott Ganz , Bullinger\u2019s colleague in the School of Public Policy, published research estimating that the county- and state-level costs related to the opioid epidemic can be as much as $8,734 per resident.\nAmong other findings, Ganz\u2019 and Alex Brill, a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, determined that Iowa and Nebraska had the lowest per resident costs among states, while West Virginia had the highest overall cost.\nTo read more about Ganz\u2019s research, read \u201c School of Public Policy Professor Helps Pin Down County-Level Costs of Opioid Epidemic .\u201d\nBullinger and Wing\u2019s paper, \u201c How Many Children Live with Adults with Opioid Use Disorder ,\u201d is\u00a0in the September 2019 edition of the journal\nChildren and Youth Services Review.\nThe School of Public Policy is a unit of Georgia Tech\u2019s\nIvan Allen College of Liberal Arts .\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nGeorgia Tech Scholar Publishes First-Ever Study of Paid Family Leave\u2019s Impact o\u2026\nContact\nMichael Pearson\nmichael.pearson@iac.gatech.edu\n404.894-2290\nEmail\nmichael.pearson@iac.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
