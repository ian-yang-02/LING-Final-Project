Credit: NOAA (National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration)\nNov 25, 2019\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nEl Ninos have been very\u00a0intense in our times, which stands to worsen storms, drought, and coral bleaching in El Nino years. A\u00a0 new study has found \u00a0compelling evidence in the Pacific Ocean that the stronger El Ninos are part of a climate pattern that is new, strange and appears\u00a0unique to the industrial age.\nThis is the first known time that enough physical evidence spanning millennia has come together to allow researchers to say that\u00a0definitively.\u00a0The\u00a0data show\u00a0demonstrably\u00a0that El Ninos, La Ninas, and the climate phenomenon that drives them have been swinging\u00a0more broadly\u00a0in\u00a0the era\u00a0of human-induced climate change.\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing in the last 50 years is outside any natural variability. It leaps off the baseline. Actually, we even see this for the entire period of the industrial age,\u201d said Kim Cobb, the study\u2019s principal investigator and\u00a0 Georgia Power Chair and ADVANCE Professor in the Georgia Institute of Technology\u2019s School\nof Earth and Atmospheric Sciences. \u201cThere were three extremely strong El Nino-La Nina events in the 50-year period, but it wasn\u2019t just these events. The entire pattern stuck out.\u201d\nThe study\u2019s first author Pam Grothe compared temperature-dependent chemical deposits from present-day corals with those of older coral records representing relevant sea surface temperatures from the past 7,000 years. With the help of collaborators from Georgia Tech and partner research institutions, Grothe identified patterns of in the\u00a0 El Nino Southern Oscillation \u00a0(ENSO), swings of heating and cooling of equatorial Pacific waters that, every few years, spur El Ninos and La Ninas respectively.\nThe team found the industrial age ENSO swings to be 25% stronger than in the pre-industrial records. The researchers published their results\u00a0 in the journal\u00a0 Geophysical Review Letters \u00a0in October 2019. The work was funded by the National Science Foundation.\nHundreds of samples\nThe evidence had slumbered in and around shallow Pacific waters, where ENSO and El Ninos originate, until Cobb and her students plunged hollow drill bits into living coral colonies and fossil coral deposits to extract it. In more than 20 years of field expeditions, they collected cores that contained hundreds of records.\nThe corals\u2019 recordings of sea surface temperatures proved to be astonishingly accurate when benchmarked. Coral records from 1981 to 2015 matched sea surface temperatures measured via satellite in the same period so exactly that, on a graph, the jagged lines of the coral record covered those of the satellite measurements, obscuring them from view.\n\u201cWhen I present it to people, I always get asked, \u2018Where\u2019s the temperature measurement?\u2019 I tell them it\u2019s there, but you can\u2019t see it because the corals\u2019 records of sea surface temperatures are that good,\u201d said Grothe, a former graduate research assistant in Cobb\u2019s lab and now an\u00a0 associate professor at the University of Mary Washington .\n[Ready for graduate school?\u00a0 Here's how to apply to Georgia Tech. ]\nFirst red flag?\nIn 2018, enough coral data had amassed to distinguish ENSO\u2019s recent activity from its natural preindustrial patterns.\nTo stress-test the data, Grothe left out chunks to see if the industrial age ENSO signal still stuck out. She removed the record-setting\u00a0 1997/1998 El Nino -La Nina and examined industrial age windows of time between 30 and 100 years long.\nThe signal held in all windows, but the data needed the 97/98 event to be statistically significant. This could mean that changes in the ENSO activities have just now reached a threshold that makes them detectable.\nWhat is El Nino?\nEvery two to seven years in spring, an El Nino is born when the warm phase of the ENSO swells into a long heat blob in the tropical Pacific, typically peaking in early winter. It blows through oceans and air around the world, ginning up deluges, winds, heat, or cold in unusual places.\nOnce El Nino passes, the cycle reverses into La Nina by the following fall, when airstreams push hot water westward and dredge up frigid water in the equatorial Pacific. This triggers a different set of global weather extremes.\nTropical Pacific corals record the hot-cold oscillations by absorbing less of an oxygen isotope (O 18 ) during ENSO\u2019s hot phases, and progressively more of it during ENSO\u2019s cool phases. As corals grow, they create layers of oxygen isotope records, chronicles of temperature history.\nWaves, repairs, contortions\nExtracting them is adventurous: A research diver guides a chest-high pneumatic drill under the ocean. Its pressure hose connects to a motor on the boat that powers the drill after the diver has taken off her fins and weighed herself down on the reef.\nShe carefully angles the bit down the axis of coral growth to get a core with layers that can be accurately counted back in time. On occasion, waves put her and her safety diver through washing machine cycles.\n\u201cDoing this all underwater adds an extra level of difficulty, even from the simplest tasks like working with wrenches,\u201d Grothe said. \u201cBut the drill slices through underwater corals like butter. Fossil corals are drilled on land, and the drill constantly seizes up and overheats.\u201d\nBlowing models away\nThe physical proof taken from three islands that dot the heart of the ENSO zone has also thrown down scientific gauntlets, starkly challenging computer models of ENSO patterns and causes. A prime example: Previously unknown to science, the study showed that in a period from 3,000 to 5,000 years ago, the El Nino-La Nina oscillations were extremely mild.\n\u201cMaybe there\u2019s no good explanation for a cause. Maybe it just happened,\u201d Cobb said. \u201cMaybe El Nino can just enter a mode and get stuck in it for a millennium.\u201d\nAlso Read:\nAdvanced life forms on other planets look much more likely after this study\nWriter &\u00a0Media Representative : Ben Brumfield (404-272-2780)\nEmail:\u00a0 ben.brumfield@comm.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\n177 North Avenue\nAtlanta, Georgia \u00a030332-0181 \u00a0USA\nThese researchers coauthored the study: Giovanni Liguori, Emanuele Di Lorenzo, Jean Lynch-Stieglitz, Hussein Sayani, Kayla Townsend, Melat Hagos, and Gemma O\u2019Connor from Georgia Tech; Antonietta Capotondi from the NOAA Earth System Research Laboratory; Yanbin Lu and Lawrence Edwards from the University of Minnesota; Hai Cheng from the University of Minnesota and Xi\u2019an Jiaotong University; John Southon and Guaciara Santos from the University of California, Irvine; Daniel Deocampo from Georgia State University; Tianran Chen from the Chinese Academy of Sciences; Diane M.
