Pattanaik, a faculty member at University of California Riverside, and Yongsheng Xu, a faculty member at Georgia State University, appeared in The Review of Income and Wealth. In it, the researchers propose a new approach to measuring inequality in well-being. The paper uses U.S. Census data on three indicators of well-being \u2014 income, education, and health \u2014 to find that multidimensional inequality increased in the United States between 2010 and 2019. Two notable findings include:\n1. The combination of education and income has become increasingly unequal.\nIn 2010, median education levels were relatively evenly distributed across incomes, with median education reported as \"some college, but no degree\u201d for all income brackets. However, by 2019, the top two income brackets saw an increase in median education to \u201cbachelors degree or higher,\u201d while the bottom two income brackets reported a decrease in median education levels to \u201chigh school diploma.\u201d\n2. Multidimensional well-being has increased for everyone except the lowest earners.\nWell-being measurements rose by more than 12% for the top three groups of earners between 2010 and 2019. Earners in the middle five groups also saw an increase in well-being, although less than the 12% that the top brackets enjoyed. In contrast, the bottom two income brackets experienced a decrease in well-being. Although their incomes rose slightly, a decline in educational attainment led to a lower well-being score overall.\nIn conclusion, the paper \"highlights the importance of measuring multidimensional well-being\" for \"a comprehensive picture of changes in the quality of life in a society over time,\" Dhongde and her co-authors write.\n\u201cInequality in Multidimensional Well-Being in the United States\u201d was published in\nThe Review of Income and Wealth.\nIt is available at\nhttps://doi.org/10.1111/roiw.12665 .\nContact\nDi Minardi\nIvan Allen College of Liberal Arts\nEmail\ndminardi3@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
