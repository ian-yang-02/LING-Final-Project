The duo runs the Tech Wreck Summer Camp, an 8-week day camp for children (ages 6 to 13) of full-time Georgia Tech faculty, staff, and students. Harvey is the camp director and Wolfe is the co-camp director.\nAs the competitive sports coordinator of operations for the\nCampus Recreation Center\n(CRC), Harvey oversees intramural sports and sports clubs during the academic year. For the summer camp she oversees all operations, from planning to registration and staff training.\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of those jobs that when you do it right and everything goes well, it doesn\u2019t feel like a job at all,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause my job in the summer is playing games with kids.\u201d\nHarvey gives the camp a new theme each week. For \u201cBeach Week\u201d the sand volleyball court next to Roe Stamps Field became a place for building sandcastles.\n\u201cWe have kids who have been coming to camp here since they were rising first graders all the way through becoming a teenager,\u201d Harvey said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to do the same things over and over. Camp should be a new experience for them every year, so that is a fun challenge for me. I love being creative and coming up with new fun activities. And there is nothing more creative than having a bunch of kids keeping you on your toes.\u201d\nHarvey\u2019s co-camp director, Wolfe, focuses on the staff training side and makes sure the team of 25 camp counselors is prepared to look after the 50 to 70 children who usually attend the camp. Because of the pandemic, Harvey and Wolfe had to alter the camp\u2019s activities.\n\u201cWe used to take the campers on field trips to venues in and around Atlanta,\u201d said Wolfe, who has been at Georgia Tech for four years. \u201cWe\u2019re not doing field trips this year, so we\u2019re bringing entertainment and activities to campus, like ice cream trucks and inflatables.\u201d\nLast year Tech Wreck was open for only a week and a half before closing because of a rise in the number of Covid-19 cases. But Harvey learned a lot from the experience that could be applied this year. She also shared best practices with camp administrators from other universities through the National Intramural-Recreational Sports Association (NIRSA).\n\u201cI became a youth programs leader in this area because we were open when most other camps were not,\u201d said Harvey, who partnered with a colleague from the University of Wisconsin to participate in a series of round tables hosted by NIRSA. \u201cIt was cool to share our experiences and help people across the country get their camps started up again.\u201d\nWolfe enjoys Tech Wreck because it\u2019s a team effort with lots of work done by the camp counselors and support from other CRC staff members. It\u2019s also nice break from his normal role as competitive sports coordinator for staff development at the CRC.\n\u201cI enjoy working with college students throughout the year,\u201d he said. \u201cThe summer camp lets me work with a different age group, and they keep us young. It\u2019s also fun to see the returning kids and their growth and maturity level from year to year. Even though we only see them for the summer, we have an impact on their lives.\u201d\nWhen they aren\u2019t working, Harvey and Wolfe often hang out together and with other CRC staff members.\n\u201cA lot of the coordinators at the CRC are transplants to Atlanta, and we really didn\u2019t know any other people in the city,\u201d Harvey said. \u201cWe became a friend group really fast. On weekends we hang out, play games, and do typical things that friends do. It\u2019s been awesome to have co-workers who are also your friends.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nContact\nVictor Rogers\nInstitute Communications\nEmail\nvictor.rogers@comm.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
