PITUN is supported by the Ford Foundation, New America, and the Hewlett Foundation. The grant is the first of its kind awarded by PITUN.\nThese 16 will split into eight pairs\u2013each with a Georgia Tech computer scientist and a Georgia State social scientist. Each pair will then work to develop interdisciplinary projects addressing historic and continuing inequity challenges in the southeastern United States.\n\u201cThis collaboration is a unique opportunity to showcase the power of computer science to drive meaningful social progress, as well as the impact that interdisciplinary research can have on real-world issues,\u201d said\nEllen Zegura , Georgia Tech computer science professor and co-lead on the fellowship program.\n[RELATED:\u00a0Professor Receives Mozilla Grant to Teach Social Responsibility in Computing]\nSusan Snyder , Georgia State School of Social Work associate professor, and\nScott Jacques , Georgia State Criminal Justice and Criminology Department associate professor, are co-leads with Zegura on the project.\nThe grant is one of 27 awarded today as part of PITUN\u2019s inaugural \u201cNetwork Challenge,\u201d which supports the development of new public interest technology initiatives, especially those that bring together multiple partner schools.\nAt the end of the two-semester program, the eight teams will present their collaborative projects during a public showcase. The projects will also be documented on a program website, and the program\u2019s structure and materials will be made publicly available for use at other institutions.\nAccording to Zegura, who is the Stephen Fleming Chair in Telecommunications at the Georgia Tech School of Computer Science, the progress won\u2019t end when this initial fellowship does.\n\u201cOf course, we can\u2019t solve historic issues of inequity in two semesters,\u201d Zegura said. \u201cBut we can highight current public interest challenges in the region, identify potential solutions, and create resources for those at colleges and universities across the Southeast that are interested in picking up the torch on these important issues.\u201d\nPITUN, which was\nconvened earlier this year , is a partnership of 21 colleges and universities dedicated to building the nascent field of public interest technology, as well as growing a new generation of civic-minded technologists and digitally-fluent policy leaders.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nAlbert Snedeker, Communications Manager\nalbert.snedeker@cc.gatech.edu\nEmail\nalbert.snedeker@cc.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
