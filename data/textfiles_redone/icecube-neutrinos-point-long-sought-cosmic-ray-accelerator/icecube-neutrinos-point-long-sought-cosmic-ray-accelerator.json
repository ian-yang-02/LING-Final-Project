Where do they come from?\nBecause cosmic rays are charged particles, their paths cannot be traced directly back to their sources due to the magnetic fields that fill space and warp their trajectories. But the powerful cosmic accelerators that produce them will also produce neutrinos. Neutrinos are uncharged particles, unaffected by even the most powerful magnetic field. Because they rarely interact with matter and have almost no mass\u2014hence their sobriquet \u201cghost particle\u201d\u2014neutrinos travel nearly undisturbed from their accelerators, giving scientists an almost direct pointer to their source.\nTwo papers published July 13 in the journal\nScience\nhave for the first time provided evidence for a known blazar as a source of high-energy neutrinos detected by the National Science Foundation-supported IceCube observatory. This blazar, designated by astronomers as TXS 0506+056, was first singled out following a neutrino alert sent by IceCube on September 22, 2017.\n\u201cThe evidence for the observation of the first known source of high-energy neutrinos and cosmic rays is compelling,\u201d said Francis Halzen, a University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison professor of physics and principal investigator for the IceCube Neutrino Observatory.\n\u201cThe era of multi-messenger astrophysics is here. Each messenger gives us a more complete understanding of the universe and important new insights into the most powerful objects and events in the sky,\u201d said NSF Director France C\u00f3rdova. \u201cSuch breakthroughs are only possible through a long-term commitment to fundamental research and investment in superb research facilities.\u201d\nA blazar is a galaxy with a super-massive, rapidly spinning black hole at its core. A signature feature of blazars is that twin jets of light and elementary particles, one of which is pointing to Earth, are emitted from the poles along the axis of the black hole\u2019s rotation. This blazar is situated in the night sky just off the left shoulder of the constellation Orion and is about four billion light years from Earth.\n\u201cScientifically, this is very good news,\u201d said Ignacio Taboada, an associate professor in Georgia Tech\u2019s School of Physics and member of the Center for Relativistic Astrophysics also at Georgia Tech. As leader of the \u201cTransients Science Working Group\u201d within IceCube, he oversaw all the studies that inquired on the correlation TXS 0506+056\u2019s gamma ray flare and the neutrino alert of September 22, 2017. \u201cFor years, we\u2019ve had a long list of potential sources for high-energy neutrinos. Now we have a specific source \u2013 blazars \u2013 that we can look at very carefully.\u201d\nSee the\nfull feature article and video\nResearch News\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\n177 North Avenue\nAtlanta, Georgia\u00a0 30332-0181\u00a0 USA\nMedia Relations Contact : John Toon (404-894-6986) (jtoon@gatech.edu).\nAdditional Images\nContact\nJohn Toon\nResearch News\n(404) 894-6986\nEmail\njtoon@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
