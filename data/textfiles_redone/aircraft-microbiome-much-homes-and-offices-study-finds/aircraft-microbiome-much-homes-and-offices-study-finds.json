Believed to be the first to comprehensively assess the microbiome of aircraft, the study found that the bacterial communities accompanying airline passengers at 30,000 feet have much in common with the bacterial communities surrounding people in their homes and offices.\nUsing advanced sequencing technology, researchers from the Georgia Institute of Technology and Emory University studied the bacteria found on three components of an airliner cabin that are commonly touched by passengers: tray tables, seat belt buckles and the handles of lavatory doors. They swabbed those items before and after ten transcontinental flights and also sampled air in the rear of the cabin during flight.\nWhat they found was surprisingly unexciting.\n\u201cAirline passengers should not be frightened by sensational stories about germs on a plane,\u201d said Vicki Stover Hertzberg, a professor in Emory University\u2019s Nell Hodgson Woodruff School of Nursing and a co-author of the study. \u201cThey should recognize that microbes are everywhere and that an airplane is no better and no worse than an office building, a subway car, home or a classroom. These environments all have microbiomes that look like places occupied by people.\u201d\nThe results of the FlyHealthy\u2122 study were reported June 6, 2018, in the journal\nMicrobial Ecology . In March, the researchers reported on a separate part of the study that examined potential routes for transmitting certain respiratory viruses \u2013 such as the flu \u2013 on commercial flights.\nGiven the unusual nature of an aircraft cabin, the researchers hadn\u2019t known what to expect from their microbiome study. On transcontinental flights, passengers spend four or five hours in close proximity breathing a very dry mix of outdoor air and recycled cabin air that has been passed through special filters, similar to those found in operating rooms.\n\u201cThere were reasons to believe that the communities of bacteria in an aircraft cabin might be different from those in other parts of the built environment, so it surprised me that what we found was very similar to what other researchers have found in homes and offices,\u201d said Howard Weiss, a professor in Georgia Tech\u2019s\nSchool of Mathematics\nand the study\u2019s corresponding author. \u201cWhat we found was bacterial communities that were mostly derived from human skin, the human mouth \u2013 and some environmental bacteria.\u201d\nThe sampling found significant variations from flight to flight, which is consistent with the differences other researchers have found among the cars of passenger trains, Weiss noted. Each aircraft seemed to have its own microbiome, but the researchers did not detect statistically significant differences between preflight and post-flight conditions on the flights studied.\n\u201cWe identified a core airplane microbiome \u2013 the genera that were present in every sample we studied,\u201d Weiss added. The core microbiome included genera\nPropionibacterium, Burkholderia, Staphylococcus, and Strepococcus (oralis) .\nThough the study revealed bacteria common to other parts of the built environment, Weiss still suggests travelers exercise reasonable caution. \u201cI carry a bottle of hand sanitizer in my computer bag whenever I travel,\u201d said Weiss. \u201cIt\u2019s a good practice to wash or sanitize your hands, avoid touching your face, and get a flu shot ever year.\u201d\nThis new information on the aircraft microbiome provides a baseline for further study, and could lead to improved techniques for maintaining healthy aircraft.\n\u201cThe finding that airplanes have their own unique microbiome should not be totally surprising since we have been exploring the unique microbiome of everything from humans to spacecraft to salt ponds in Australia. The study does have important implications for industrial cleaning and sterilization standards for airplanes,\u201d said Christopher Dupont, another co-author and an associate professor in the Microbial and Environmental Genomics Department at the J. Craig Venter Institute, which provided bioinformatics analysis of the study\u2019s data.\nThe 229 samples obtained from the aircraft cabin testing were subjected to 16S rRNA sequencing, which was done at the HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology in Huntsville, Alabama. The small amount of genetic material captured on the swabs and air sampling limited the level of detail the testing could provide to identifying genera of bacteria, Weiss said. The extensive bioinformatics, or sequence analysis, was carried out at the J. Craig Venter Institute in La Jolla, Calif.\nIn the March 19 issue of the journal\nProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , the researchers reported on the results of another component of the FlyHealthy\u2122 study that looked at potential transmission of respiratory viruses on aircraft. They found that an infectious passenger with influenza or other droplet-transmitted respiratory infection will most likely not transmit infection to passengers seated farther away than two seats laterally and one row in front or back on an aircraft.\nThat portion of the study was designed to assess rates and routes of possible infectious disease transmission during flights, using a model that combines estimated infectivity and patterns of contact among aircraft passengers and crew members to determine likelihood of infection. FlyHealthy\u2122 team members were assigned to monitor specific areas of the passenger cabin, developing information about contacts between passengers as they moved around.\nAmong next steps, the researchers would like to study the microbiome of airport areas, especially the departure lounges where passengers congregate before boarding. They would also like to study long-haul international flights in which passengers spend more time together \u2013 and are more likely to move about the cabin.\nIn addition to those already mentioned, the paper\u2019s authors include Josh L. Espinoza and Karen Nelson of the J. Craig Venter Institute, Shawn Levy of the HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology, and Sharon Norris of The Boeing Company.\nThis work was supported by contract 2001-041-1 between the Georgia Institute of Technology and The Boeing Company.\nCITATION : Howard Weiss, et al., \u201cThe Airplane Cabin Microbiome,\u201d (Microbial Ecology, 2018).\nhttps://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00248-018-1191-3\nResearch News\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\n177 North Avenue\nAtlanta, Georgia\u00a0 30332-0181\u00a0 USA\nMedia Relations Contact : John Toon (404-894-6986) (jtoon@gatech.edu).\nWriter : John Toon\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nResearchers Determine Routes of Respiratory Infectious Disease Transmission on \u2026\nContact\nJohn Toon\nResearch News\n(404) 894-6986\nEmail\njtoon@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
