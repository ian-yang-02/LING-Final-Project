No matter what your plans, you don\u2019t want to wake up on your first day back feeling more stressed, exhausted, or overwhelmed than when you left.\n\u201cBreaks from class and work are always welcome, but these are also times when we may be in unfamiliar territory, out of our routine, or behaving differently than we normally would,\u201d Joi Alexander, director of the\nWellness Empowerment Center , said. \u201cDuring these times, it\u2019s important to take care of yourself and be mindful of your surroundings to ensure you have the best experience possible.\u201d\nTo make sure you get what you want out of spring break, here are some important safety considerations to keep in mind, whether at home, on the beach, or abroad.\nIf you choose to travel, make sure someone close to you knows the address where you are staying.\nKeep your driver\u2019s license, ID, or passport with you at all times.\nEducate yourself on federal, state, and local laws where you are traveling.\nIf road tripping, don\u2019t drive distracted or while tired.\nIf you are over the age of 21 and choose to drink, set a limit, pace yourself, and alternate alcoholic drinks with water to stay hydrated.\nProtect yourself from the sun by drinking lots of water, eating, and always wearing a broad-spectrum SPF 15 or higher sunscreen (reapply every two hours).\nIf you choose to be sexually active, make sure it\u2019s a consensual experience and always use protection.\nUse a buddy system with a group of people you are familiar with if you choose to go out.\nIf you are not traveling for spring break, staycations are a great budget-friendly option that allows time to practice self-care. Here are a few ways to\nspend the break locally .\nIn addition to sharing best practices, the Wellness Empowerment Center and other Student Engagement and Well-Being departments are also hosting Safe Spring Break, with fun activities, games, and giveaways that educate students about protecting themselves while still having good time.\n\u201cWe do this event every year, and it\u2019s always a hit with the students,\u201d Alexander said. \u201cIt\u2019s just as much fun as it is educational, and it\u2019s the perfect way to kick off a safe spring break.\u201d\nThis year\u2019s event will take place Tuesday, March 12, from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. on Tech Green. Students can RSVP through\nEngage\nor just drop by.\nFor more tips on how to promote health and wellness or to learn more about the Wellness Empowerment Center, visit the department\u2019s\nwebsite ,\nfollow @gtwellnesscenter on Instagram , or\nsign up\nfor the Well Burdell monthly newsletter.\nContact\nAshlie Bowman\nStudent Engagement and Well-Being\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
