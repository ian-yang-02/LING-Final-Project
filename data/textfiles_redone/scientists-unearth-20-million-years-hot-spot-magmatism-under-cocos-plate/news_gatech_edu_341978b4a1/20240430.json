But Naif\u2019s imaging instead showed a clear slice of semi-molten rock:\nlow-degree partial melts , still sandwiched at the base of the plate some 37 miles beneath the ocean floor.\nThen, the observation\nprovided an explanation\nfor how tectonic plates can gradually slide, lubricated by partial melting. The study also \u201craised several questions about\nwhy\nmagma is stored in a thin channel \u2014 and where the magma originated from,\u201d says Naif, an assistant professor in the\nSchool of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences\nat\nGeorgia Institute of Technology .\nFellow researchers went on to share competing interpretations for the cause of the channel \u2014 including studies that argued against magma being needed to explain the observation.\nSo Naif went straight to the source.\n\u201cI basically went on a multiyear hunt, akin to a Sherlock Holmes detective story, looking for clues of mantle magmas that we first observed in the\n2013\nNature\nstudy ,\u201d he says. \u201cThis involved piecing together evidence from several independent sources, including geophysical, geochemical, and geological (direct seafloor sampling) data.\u201d\nNow, the results of that search are detailed in a new\nScience Advances\narticle,\n\u201cEpisodic intraplate magmatism fed by a long-lived melt channel of distal plume origin\u201d , authored by Naif and researchers from the U.S. Geological Survey at Woods Hole Coastal and Marine Science Center, Northern Arizona University, Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University, the Department of Geology and Geophysics at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, and GNS Science of Lower Hutt, New Zealand.\nZeroing in\nA relatively young oceanic plate \u2014\u00a0some 23 million years old \u2014 the Cocos Plate traces down the western coast of Central America, veering west to the Pacific Plate, then north to meet the North American Plate off the Pacific coast of Mexico.\nSliding between these two plates caused the devastating 1985 Mexico City earthquake and the 2017 Chiapas earthquake, while similar subduction between the Cocos and Caribbean plates resulted in the 1992 Nicaragua tsunami and earthquake, and the 2001 El Salvador earthquakes.\nScientists study the edges of these oceanic plates to understand the history and formation of volcanic chains \u2014 and to help researchers and agencies better prepare for future earthquakes and volcanic activity.\nIt\u2019s in this active area that Naif and fellow researchers recently set out to document a series of magmatic intrusions just beneath the seafloor, in the same area that the team first detected the channel of magma back in 2013.\nPlumbing the depths\nFor the new study, the team combined geophysical, geochemical, and seafloor drilling results with seismic reflection data, a technique used to image layers of sediments and rocks below the surface. \u201cIt helps us to see the geology where we cannot see it with our own eyes,\u201d Naif explains.\nFirst, the researchers observed an abundance of widespread intraplate magmatism. \u201cVolcanism where it is not expected,\u201d Naif says, \u201cbasically away from plate boundaries: subduction zones and mid-ocean ridges.\u201d\nThink Hawaii, where \u201ca mantle plume of hot, rising material melts during its ascent, and then forms the Hawaii volcanic chain in the middle of the Pacific Ocean,\u201d just as with the Cocos Plate, where the team imaged the volcanism fed by magma at the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary \u2014 the base of the sliding tectonic plates.\n\u201cBelow it is the convecting mantle,\u201d Naif adds. \u201cThe tectonic plates are moving around on Earth's surface because they are sliding on the asthenosphere below them.\u201d\nThe researchers also found that this channel below the lithosphere is regionally extensive \u2014 over 100,000 square kilometers \u2014 and is a \u201clong-lived feature that originated from the Gal\u00e1pagos Plume,\u201d a mantle plume that formed the volcanic Gal\u00e1pagos islands, supplying melt for a series of volcanic events across the past 20 million years, and persisting today.\nImportantly, the new study also suggests that these plume-fed melt channels may be widespread and long-lived sources for intraplate magmatism itself \u2014 as well as for\nmantle metasomatism , which happens when Earth\u2019s mantle reacts with fluids to form a suite of minerals from the original rocks.\nConnecting the (hot spot) dots\n\u201cThis confirms that magma was there in the past \u2014 and some of it leaked through the mantle and erupted near the seafloor,\u201d Naif says, \u201cin the form of sill intrusions and seamounts: basically volcanoes located on the seafloor.\u201d\nThe work also provides compelling supporting evidence that magma could still be stored in the channel. \u201cMore surprising is that the erupted magma has a chemical fingerprint that links its source to the Gal\u00e1pagos mantle plume.\u201d\n\u201cWe learned that the magma channel has been around for at least 20 million years, and on occasion some of that magma leaks to the seafloor where it erupts volcanically,\u201d Naif adds.\nThe team\u2019s identified source of the magma, the Gal\u00e1pagos Plume, \u201cis more than 1,000 kilometers away from where we detected this volcanism. It is not clear how magma can stay around in the mantle for such a long time, only to leak out episodically.\u201d\nPlume hunters wanted\nThe evidence that the team compiled is \u201creally quite subtle and requires a detailed and careful study of a suite of seafloor observations to connect the dots,\u201d Naif says. \u201cBasically, the signs of such volcanism, while they are quite clear here, also require high resolution data and several different types of data to be able to detect such subtle seafloor features.\u201d\nSo, \u201cif we can see such subtle clues of volcanism here,\u201d Naif explains, \u201cit means a similar, careful analysis of high resolution data in other parts of the seafloor may lead to similar discoveries of volcanism elsewhere, caused by other mantle plumes.\u201d\n\u201cThere are numerous mantle plumes dotted across the planet. There are also numerous seamounts \u2014 at least 100,000 of them! \u2014 covering the seafloor, and it is anyone\u2019s guess how many of them formed in the middle of the tectonic plates because of magma sourced from distant mantle plumes that leaked to the surface.\u201d\nNaif looks forward to continuing that search, from seafloor to asthenosphere.\n###\nFunding:\nNational Science Foundation : OCE-0625178, U.S. Science Support Program\nCitation:\nDOI: 10.1126/sciadv.add3761\nAbout Georgia Tech\nThe\nGeorgia Institute of Technology,\nor\nGeorgia Tech,\nis one of the top public research universities in the U.S., developing leaders who advance technology and improve the human condition.\nThe Institute offers\u202f business, computing, design, engineering, liberal arts,\u202fand\u202fsciences\ndegrees.
