The same techniques, however, have not delivered consistent key findings for climate change.\nThere are a few reasons why. The main one is that previous data mining work in climate science, and in particular in the analysis of climate teleconnections, has relied on methods that offer rather simplistic\u00a0\u201cyes or no\u201d answers.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that simple in climate,\u201d said\nAnnalisa Bracco , a professor in Georgia Tech\u2019s\nSchool of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences . \u201cEven weak connections between very different regions on the globe may result from an underlying physical phenomenon. Imposing thresholds and throwing out weak connections would halt everything. Instead, a climate scientist\u2019s expertise is the key step to finding commonalities across very different data sets or fields to explore how robust they are.\u201d\nAnd with millions of data points spread out around the globe, Bracco said current models rely too much on human expertise to make sense of the output. She and her colleagues wanted to develop a methodology that depends more on actual data rather than a researcher\u2019s interpretation.\nThat\u2019s why the Georgia Tech team has developed a new way of mining data from climate data sets that is more self-contained than traditional tools. The methodology brings out commonalities of data sets without as much expertise from the user, allowing scientists to trust the data and get more robust \u2014 and transparent \u2014 results.\nThe methodology is open source and\ncurrently available to scientists around the world . The Georgia Tech researchers are already using it to explore sea surface temperature and cloud field data, two aspects that profoundly affect the planet\u2019s climate.\n\u201cThere are so many factors \u2014 cloud data, aerosols and wind fields, for example \u2014 that interact to generate climate and drive climate change,\u201d said\nAthanasios Nenes , another\nCollege of Sciences\nclimate professor on the project. \u201cDepending on the model aspect you focus on, they can reproduce climate features effectively \u2014 or not at all. Sometimes it is very hard to tell if one model is really better than another or if it predicts climate for the right reasons.\u201d\nNenes says the Georgia Tech methodology looks at everything in a more robust way, breaking the bottleneck that is typical of other model evaluation and analysis algorithms. The methodology, he says, can be used for observations, and scientists don\u2019t need to know anything about computer code and models.\n\u201cThe methodology reduces the complexity of millions of data points to the bare essentials \u2014sometimes as few as 10 regions that interact with each other,\u201d said Nenes. \u201cWe need to have tools that reduce the complexity of model output to understand them better and evaluate if they are providing the correct results for the right reasons.\u201d\nTo develop the methodology, the climate scientists partnered with\nConstantine Dovrolis\nand other data scientists in Georgia Tech\u2019s\nCollege of Computing . Dovrolis said it\u2019s exciting to apply algorithmic and computational thinking in problems that affect everyone in major ways, such as global warming.\u201d\n\u201cClimate science is a \u2018data-heavy\u2019 discipline with many intellectually interesting questions that can benefit from computational modeling\u00a0and prediction,\u201d said Dovrolis, a professor in the\nSchool of Computer Science , \u201cCross-disciplinary collaborations are challenging at first \u2014 every discipline has its own language, preferred approach and research culture \u2014 but they can be quite rewarding at the end.\u201d\nThe paper, \u201c Advancing climate science with knowledge-discovery through data mining ,\u201d is published in Climate and Atmospheric Science, a Nature journal.\nThe development of the methodology was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy (grant DE-SC0007143) and the National Science Foundation (grant DMS-1049095).
