Abdallah, executive vice president for Research, has convened two search committees to select the new vice president for the Enterprise Innovation Institute (EI 2 ) and the associate vice president for Corporate Engagement (AVP-CE).\n\u201cThese two roles and organizations are critical pieces of Georgia Tech\u2019s strategy to become a leading global engine of innovation, entrepreneurship, and opportunity,\u201d Abdallah said. \u201cI\u2019d like to thank our search chairs and committees, as well as the stakeholders across the Institute who have dedicated their time and energy to building strong candidate pools for these positions.\u201d\nThe two searches will run concurrently and will be supported by search firm Russell Reynolds Associates. The search for the new vice president of EI 2\nwill be chaired by Devesh Ranjan, interim vice president for Interdisciplinary Research and professor in the George W. Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering. The search for the AVP-CE will be co-chaired by Tim Lieuwen, Regents Professor, David S. Lewis Jr. Chair in the Daniel Guggenheim School of Aerospace Engineering, and executive director of the Strategic Energy Institute; and Vivek Sarkar, chair of the School of Computer Science and the Stephen Fleming Chair for Telecommunications in the College of Computing.\nDavid Bridges will serve as the interim vice president for EI 2\nuntil the search is finalized. The AVP-CE is a new role, created as part of Georgia Tech\u2019s reimagined corporate relations structure. In the role, the AVP-CE will oversee Tech\u2019s new integrated model of corporate relations and industry collaborations designed to help the Institute leverage critical partnerships and develop new relationships with industry.\nAs part of stakeholder engagement, Russell Reynolds Associates will conduct meetings for members of the EI 2\ncommunity, as well as corporate relations and industry research staff, to learn about the search processes and timelines and provide feedback on the characteristics of ideal candidates for the respective searches.\nSearch details, including committee rosters and timelines, and ongoing updates can be found at\nresearch.gatech.edu/vp-ei2-search\nand\nresearch.gatech.edu/associate-vp-corporate-engagement-search .\nAdditional Images\nContact\nSusie Ivy , Director\nOrganizational, Academic, and Research Communications\nEmail\nsusie.ivy@comm.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
