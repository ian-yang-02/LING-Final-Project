Under Duckett\u2019s leadership, Georgia Tech Human Resources will build and support innovative staffing models to align with the Institute\u2019s strategic plan and reflect the diversity of the Georgia Tech community. This role will be responsible for anticipating employee needs to proactively improve people-centric practices in a constantly changing environment. Looking forward, Duckett will also help lead a campuswide organizational transformation as transactional, high-volume HR processes move into the Administrative Services Center later this year.\nDuckett joins the Institute from nearly eight years at Atlanta Public Schools, where she most recently served as the chief human resources officer, leading the organization through a dramatic improvement following the testing scandal of 2009. As a committed Atlanta resident, she brings nearly 20 years of experience in HR roles in urban educational settings. Her experience includes implementing ethics programs, launching new HR technology, developing capacity of hiring managers, designing career development pathways, developing comprehensive compensation programs, and supporting employee well-being.\n\u201cGeorgia Tech has an opportunity to become a world leader in utilizing innovative, efficient practices to recruit, develop, and retain the most talented employees across all job types,\u201d said Kelly Fox, executive vice president for Administration and Finance (A&F). \u201cThis transition will enable us to continue the great work of building and fostering a culture consistent with the Institute\u2019s goals and values.\u201d\nDuckett will join Georgia Tech beginning Jan. 31 and will report directly to Fox. Offices reporting to Duckett include Total Rewards and Payroll, HR Business Partners, Employee Relations, Global HR, Talent Acquisition and Employee Services, Student Employment, and several administrative support departments.\n\u201cIt is an honor to be selected to lead the human resources team for such a prestigious organization and have the opportunity to collaborate across all academic, research, and business functions,\u201d Duckett said. \u201cI look forward to leveraging my life and work experiences to build upon the solid foundation that has been laid in order to take human resources into a new era of innovation, efficiency, and work-life balance in support of recruiting and retaining a highly engaged and talented workforce.\u201d\nAs previously announced, Kim D. Harrington, chief human resources officer for Georgia Tech, will assume her new role in A&F as the chief of staff and associate vice president for Special Initiatives. In this new position, she will serve as an advisor to Fox and a liaison to campus leadership \u2014 including faculty, staff, and students \u2014 to help strengthen the workplace culture by building relationships and creating an inclusive and high-performing environment for employees and students.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nRachael Pocklington\nInstitute Communications\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
