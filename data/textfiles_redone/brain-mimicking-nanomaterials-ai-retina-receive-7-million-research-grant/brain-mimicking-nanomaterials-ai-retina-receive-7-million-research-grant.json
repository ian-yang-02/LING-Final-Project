Retina Receive $7 Million Research Grant\nThe dream of computing the way the human brain does comes a step closer thanks to nanomaterials\nFacebook\nTwitter\nEmail\nAt the world's most advanced synchrotron, Brookhaven National Laboratory's newly constructed National Synchrotron Light Source II, Georgia Tech's partners from\u00a0Binghamton University will observe quantum properties in the Georgia Tech neuromorphic computing materials to try to better understand why they work. \u00a0Credit: Brookhaven National Laboratory\nJul 28, 2017\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nA future android brain like that of Star Trek\u2019s Commander Data might contain neuristors, multi-circuit components that emulate the firings of human neurons.\nNeuristors\nalready exist today in labs, in small quantities, and to fuel the quest to boost neuristors\u2019 power and numbers for practical use in brain-like computing, the U.S. Department of Defense has awarded a $7.1 million grant to a research team led by the Georgia Institute of Technology. The researchers will mainly expand work on new metal oxide materials that buzz electronically at the nanoscale to emulate the way human neural networks buzz with electric potential on a cellular level.\nBut to walk expectations back from\nthe distant sci-fi future\ninto the scientific present: The research team has developed\u00a0neuristor materials to build, for now, an intelligent light sensor, and not some artificial version of the human brain, which would require hundreds of trillions of circuits.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to reach circuit complexities of that magnitude, not even a tenth,\u201d said\nAlan Doolittle, a professor at Georgia Tech\u2019s School of Electrical and Computer Engineering . \u201cAlso, currently science doesn\u2019t really know yet very well how the human brain works, so we can\u2019t duplicate it.\u201d\nIntelligent retina\nBut an artificial retina that can learn autonomously appears well within reach of the research team from Georgia Tech and\nBinghamton University . Despite the term \u201cretina,\u201d the development is not\u00a0a medical implant, but it could be used in advanced image recognition cameras for national defense and police work.\nAt the same time, it significantly advances brain-mimicking, or neuromorphic, computing. The research field that takes its cues from what science already does know about how the brain computes to develop exponentially more powerful computing.\nThe retina is\u00a0comprised of an array of\u00a0neuristors, which combines the words \u201cneuron\u201d and \u201ctransistor\u201d to refer to ultracompact circuits. The neuristors sense light, compute an image out of it and store the image. All three of the functions would occur simultaneously and nearly instantaneously.\n\u201cThe same device senses, computes and stores the image,\u201d Doolittle said. \u201cThe device is the sensor, and it\u2019s the processor, and it\u2019s the memory all at the same time.\u201d A neuristor itself is comprised in part of devices called\nmemristors\ninspired by the way human neurons work.\n[Also READ :\nThe Brain, Cosmos in the Cranium -- brain research in a nutshell]\nBrain vs. PC\nThat cuts out loads of processing and memory lag time that are inherent in traditional computing.\nTake the device you\u2019re reading this article on: Its microprocessor has to tap a separate memory component to get data, then do some processing, tap memory again for more data, process some more, etc. \u201cThat back-and-forth from memory to microprocessor has\ncreated a bottleneck ,\u201d Doolittle said.\nA neuristor array breaks the bottleneck by emulating the extreme flexibility of biological nervous systems:\nWhen a brain\ncomputes , it uses a broad set of neural pathways that flash with enormous data. Then, later, to compute the same thing again, it will use quite different neural paths.\nTraditional computer pathways, by contrast, are hardwired. For example, look at a present-day processor and you\u2019ll see lines etched into it. Those are pathways that computational signals are limited to.\nThe new memristor materials at the heart of the neuristor are not etched, and signals flow through the surface very freely, more like they do through the brain, exponentially increasing the number of possible pathways computation can take. That helps the new intelligent retina compute powerfully and swiftly.\nTerrorists, missing children\nThe retina\u2019s memory could also store thousands of photos, allowing it to immediately match up what it sees with the saved images. The retina could pinpoint known terror suspects in a crowd, find missing children, or identify enemy aircraft virtually instantaneously, without having to trawl databases to correctly identify what is in the images.\nIt could even autonomously learn to extrapolate further information, like calculating the third dimension of a face out of data from a two-dimensional image. Even if you take away the optics, the new neuristor arrays still advance\nartificial intelligence . Instead of light, a surface of neuristors could absorb massive data streams at once, compute them, store them, and compare them to patterns of other data, immediately.\n\u201cIt will work with anything that has a repetitive pattern like radar signatures, for example,\u201d Doolittle said. \u201cRight now, that\u2019s too challenging to compute, because radar information is flying out at such a high data rate that no computer can even think about keeping up.\u201d\nSmart materials\nThe research project\u2019s title acronym CEREBRAL may hint at distant dreams of an artificial brain, but what it stands for spells out the present goal in neuromorphic computing: Cross-disciplinary Electronic-ionic Research Enabling Biologically Realistic Autonomous Learning.\nThe intelligent retina\u2019s neuristors are based on novel metal oxide nanotechnology materials unique to Georgia Tech. They allow computing signals to flow flexibly across pathways\nthat are electronic, which is customary in computing, and at the same time make use of ion motion , which is more commonly known from the way batteries and biological systems work.\nThe new materials have already been created, and they work, but the researchers don\u2019t yet fully understand why.\nMuch of the project is dedicated to examining\nquantum states\nin the materials and how those states help create useful electronic-ionic properties. Researchers will view them by bombarding the metal oxides with extremely bright x-ray photons at the recently constructed\nNational Synchrotron Light Source II .\nGrant sub-awardee Binghamton University is located close by, and Binghamton physicists will run experiments and hone them via theoretical modeling.\n\u2018Sea of lithium\u2019\nThe neuristors are created mainly by the way the metal oxide materials are grown in the lab, which has some advantages over building\nneuristors in a more wired way .\nThis materials-growing approach to creating part of the computational structure is conducive to mass production. Also, though neuristors in general free signals to take multiple pathways, Georgia Tech\u2019s neuristors do it much more flexibly thanks to chemical properties.\n\u201cWe also have a sea of lithium, and it\u2019s like an infinite reservoir of computational ionic fluid,\u201d Doolittle said. The lithium niobite imitates the way ionic fluid bathes\u00a0 biological neurons \u00a0and allows them to flash with electric potential while signaling. In a neuristor array, the lithium niobite helps computational signaling move in myriad directions.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like the typical semiconductor material, where you etch a line, and only that line has the computational material,\u201d Doolittle said.\nCommander Data\u2019s brain?\n\u201cUnlike any other previous neuristors, our neuristors will adapt themselves in their computational-electronic pulsing on the fly, which makes them more like a neurological system,\u201d Doolittle said. \u201cThey mimic biology in that we have ion drift across the material to create the memristors (the memory part of neuristors).\u201d\nBrains are far superior to computers at most things, but not all. Brains recognize objects and do motor tasks much better. But computers are much better at arithmetic and data processing.\nNeuristor arrays can meld both types of computing, making them biological and algorithmic at once, a bit like\nCommander Data\u2019s brain .\nLISTEN: How neurons\u00a0make the brain compute --\u00a0audio report\nLISTEN: Wondrous facts about the brain -- audio report\nThe research is being funded through the U.S. Department of Defense\u2019s Multidisciplinary University Research Initiatives (MURI) Program under grant number FOA: N00014-16-R-FO05.
