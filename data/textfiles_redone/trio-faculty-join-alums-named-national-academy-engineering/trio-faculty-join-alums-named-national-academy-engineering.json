Nick Lappos (AE \u201973), was also elected to the NAE Class of 2022. Lappos is a senior technical fellow (emeritus) of Sikorsky Aircraft Corp and serves on the\nGeorgia Tech Aerospace Engineering School Advisory Council (AESAC) . He was honored for \u201cimproving rotary wing flight performance and serving as test pilot, engineer, inventor, technologist, and business leader.\u201d\nNathan Meehan (Phys '75), a member of the\nCollege of Sciences Advisory Board , was also elected. He is president of CMG Petroleum Consulting Ltd. and was recognized for \"technical and business innovation in the application of horizontal well technology for oil and gas production.\"\nThey are among this year\u2019s 133 new members (including international selections).\n\u201cOn behalf of Georgia Tech, I extend my sincere congratulations to Chris, Sandy, and Nick for this incredible honor, which highlights a lifetime of achievement,\u201d said Raheem Beyah, dean of the College of Engineering and Southern Company Chair. \u201cChris and Nick\u2019s research have advanced their respective fields and left an indelible mark on their peers at Georgia Tech and around the world. Sandy, in addition to her service with NASA, is a tireless advocate of raising awareness of STEM and diversity within the aerospace industry in an effort to grow the next generation of the AE workforce. The College of Engineering is tremendously proud of this trio.\u201d\nJones is the John F. Brock III School Chair in the\nSchool of Chemical & Biomolecular Engineering (ChBE) . He has been a faculty member at Georgia Tech since 2000, leading a ChBE research group that works in catalysis and adsorption, with a strong emphasis in materials chemistry. The NAE is honoring him for \u201ccontributions to the design and synthesis of catalytic materials and for advancing technologies related to carbon capture and sequestration.\u201d\nJones is known in the field for his pioneering work on materials that extract carbon dioxide from ultra-dilute mixtures such as ambient air, which are key components of direct air capture technologies that have the potential to reverse climate change.\nMagnus (MSE, 1996) is a professor of the practice with joint appointments in the\nDaniel Guggenheim School of Aerospace Engineering ,\nSchool of Materials Science and Engineering (MSE ), and the\nSam Nunn School of International Affairs . She is currently a principal at\u00a0 AstroPlanetview LLC and is being recognized by the NAE for \u201cnational accomplishments in the U.S. civil space program and in Department of Defense engineering and technology integration.\nAs a NASA astronaut, Magnus flew to space three times and spent 157 days in orbit. Before joining NASA, Magnus worked for McDonnell Douglas Aircraft Company as a stealth engineer. After retiring as an astronaut, she served as executive director of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA). She is now one of three Georgia Tech women in the NAE, joining Marilyn Brown and Susan Margulies.\nSahinidis is the inaugural\u00a0Gary C. Butler Family Chair\u00a0in the\nH. Milton Stewart School of Industrial and Systems Engineering , with a joint appointment in ChBE. In the NAE announcement, Sahinidis was selected for \u201chis contributions to global optimization and the development of widely used software for optimization and machine learning.\u201d His research activities are at the interface between computer science\u00a0and\u00a0operations research, with applications in various engineering and scientific areas.\nDuring his career, Sahinidis developed\nBARON\u00a0(Branch-and-Reduce Optimization Navigator) ,\u00a0a\u00a0global optimization software system that solves\u00a0challenging,\u00a0nonconvex optimization\u00a0problems, including continuous, integer, and mixed-integer nonlinear problems. Sahinidis also\u00a0created\u00a0 ALAMO (Automated Learning of Algebraic Models) , a black-box\u00a0modeling tool that generates simple, yet accurate, algebraic\u00a0models\u00a0from data.\nThe Academy annual inducts new members, recognizing \u201cengineering research, practice, or education, including, where appropriate, significant contributions to the engineering literature.\u201d The Academy also honors engineers for being instrumental in \"the pioneering of new and developing fields of technology, making major advancements in traditional fields of engineering, or developing/implementing innovative approaches to engineering education.\"\nGeorgia Tech now has 45\u00a0NAE members. This year's cohort will be formally inducted during the NAE\u2019s annual meeting in October.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nJason Maderer\nCollege of Engineering\n404-276-1643\nEmail\nmaderer@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
