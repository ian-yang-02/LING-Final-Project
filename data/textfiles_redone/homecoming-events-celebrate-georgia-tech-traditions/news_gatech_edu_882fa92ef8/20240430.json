All participants, whether they run, jog, or walk, receive a cupcake at the end of the race, while the top male and female winners receive a cake and are brought onto the field during halftime of the football game later that day.\nOnce a recruitment tool for the track team, the race has evolved through the years to become one of Tech's longstanding traditions. The event earned its name in 1913 when wives of faculty members and students' mothers baked cakes to reward the winners. It became a standing event in the Homecoming festivities in 1935.\nMore information .\nRamblin' Wreck Parade\nWhen: Saturday, Oct. 28, 9 \u2013 10 a.m.\nWhere: Along Fowler Street, between Eighth Street and Ferst Drive\nBeginning at 9 a.m. Saturday, line the parade route (starting at McCamish Pavilion and ending across Ferst Drive) to see the vehicles showcased in the 2023 Wreck Parade. The event features three categories of vehicles: classic cars, fixed body, and contraption.\nInspired by the Wreck, a 1930 Model A Ford, any restored vehicle more than 25 years old qualifies for the classic car category. The fixed-body vehicles feature displays designed and built by students to reflect the Homecoming theme. Like a traditional parade float, these vehicles are either machine-powered or can be pulled by another vehicle. And further showcasing the ingenuity of the Institute's student body, the contraption category features vehicles designed and built by students that are completely human-powered, emphasizing creativity and engineering skills.\nThe event began in 1929 as a race from Atlanta to Athens but was altered in 1932, due to safety concerns. The parade has taken place each year since, with the exception of 1942 and 1943 due to gas shortages during World War II.\nMore information .\nHelluva Block Party\nWhen: Saturday, Oct. 28, 4 p.m.\nWhere: North Avenue\nHomecoming week features time-honored Tech traditions, and this event is quickly becoming a fan favorite. Four hours prior to each Georgia Tech home football game, three blocks of North Avenue are transformed into the ultimate tailgate zone with live entertainment, games, food trucks, and concessions.\nMore information .\nHomecoming Football Game vs. North Carolina\nWhen: Saturday, Oct. 28, 8 p.m.\nWhere: Bobby Dodd Stadium at Hyundai Field\nThe Yellow Jackets are looking for their third consecutive win over the Tar Heels after erasing a 17-0 deficit in a 21-17 comeback road victory a year ago in Chapel Hill.
