Most general-purpose software includes code that not every user needs, and unused code can create an opportunity for exploit for an attacker. Through this research, users will be able to run software in which unneeded code is removed, thus decreasing the vulnerability of the programs they use.\nLee compares the project to a house. \u201cWhen you build a house, you only really need one door, but the house may still have multiple doors. The number of doors increases the opportunity to break in,\u201d Lee said. \u201cIf you only have one door, your house is more secure.\u201d\nIn order to do this, the researchers are looking at the full stack of software systems, including applications, operating systems, and possibly Internet of Things devices. They are planning to use static and dynamic analysis techniques to determine which pathways through the system different users need. Each researcher has a specific area of expertise:\nPande\u2019s focus on compilers will help determine what essential code must be loaded for each user during application execution.\nHarris\u2019s expertise with static analysis will provide guarantees that the software maintains its integrity despite removed code.\nOrso will use dynamic analysis and testing techniques to confirm the modified system still functions as expected.\nKim will use his expertise in systems to determine which modules can be removed from the operating system without compromising its functionality.\nLee will focus on the aspects related to security and use his expertise to analyze and experiment with malware.\nOverall, the five researchers have the set of complementary skills needed for the project to be successful. Over the five-year life of the grant, the researchers expect to develop a series of approaches for reducing attack surface that anyone can use on complex systems, as well on low-level code.\n\u201cGoing back to the house metaphor, the problem is that different people want to use different doors,\u201d Orso says. \u201cOur research will allow users to customize the house for each person so that it contains only the door that person needs.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nContact\nTess Malone, Communications Officer\ntess.malone@cc.gatech.edu\nEmail\ntess.malone@cc.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
