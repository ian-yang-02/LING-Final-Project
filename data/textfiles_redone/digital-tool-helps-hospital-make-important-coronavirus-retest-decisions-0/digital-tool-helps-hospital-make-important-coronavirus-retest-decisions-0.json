What if they don\u2019t need it, and a retest would use up a scarce test kit and treatments that other patients need?\nSuch challenges led Piedmont Healthcare in Atlanta to establish a paper-based decision tree for ordering COVID-19 retests, and researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology turned it into an automated digital tool. Piedmont further developed the tool and has now built it into the hospital\u2019s electronic medical record, where it influences the ordering of retests.\nA user can answer their \u201cifs\u201d by clicking through questions, and the \u201cif-this-then-do-that\u201d algorithm makes recommendations for best courses of action, ranging from immediately treating a patient for COVID-19 to retesting to consulting a specialist. The final decision remains with the physician.\nThe questions are deceptively simple, but the recommendations are not always obvious. That reflects the algorithm\u2019s usefulness to fill gaps in thinking about the new sickness, which can confront clinicians with surprises.\n\u201cIf a patient has not had close contact with positive patients and the first test came back negative, a physician may think the patient does not need to be retested. But actually, the patient may need a second test because they are in intensive care and also have suspicious chest X-rays,\u201d said Georgia Tech graduate research assistant April Yu, who converted the decision tree into a digital tool.\n\u201cOne of our big worries in using a brand-new test like the coronavirus test is that it will miss real cases, and this tool helps prevent that,\u201d said Dr. Bronwen Garner, who helped develop the original decision tree and is an infectious disease specialist at Piedmont Healthcare.\u00a0\u201cIt also helps reassure physicians when they get a negative result that it is probably a true negative.\u201d\nSuspenseful decision-making\nA physician\u2019s reaction to an initial negative test can mean life or death because the physician not only decides on follow-up testing but also on treatment pathways and quarantine.\n\u201cIf you make a misstep in the thought process, it can lead to cascading impacts not only for the patient but also for healthcare professionals and family members, who may be exposed to the patient,\u201d said Pinar Keskinocak,\nWilliam W. George Chair and Professor in Georgia Tech\u2019s Stewart School of Industrial and Systems Engineering . \u201cThis tool is meant to help doctors easily stay on the decision tree path.\u201d\nMichael O\u2019Toole, executive director of Piedmont Healthcare\u2019s quality improvement department, originally pictured doctors getting an automated version of the decision tree to use on their phones. O\u2019Toole called Keskinocak, and she tapped Yu, a member of her research group.\n\u201cLiterally within four hours they had it ready for us. It was incredible,\u201d said O\u2019Toole, a Georgia Tech alumnus who studied industrial and systems engineering.\n\u201cIt was a very pleasant surprise,\u201d said Dr. Garner, who is also a Georgia Tech graduate. \u201cAutomated tools are better than a paper format because they\u2019re in the same format as orders in our electronic system.\u00a0We get notifications in real time instead of having to remember to check a piece of paper.\u201d\nThe tool is in place in the system where doctors order retests and is specific to Piedmont\u2019s workflow. It may not be directly transferable to other health care systems.\nPiedmont Healthcare simplified the logic even more, and the hospital built its own custom alerts to guide physicians on retesting. For cases that are more ambiguous, Piedmont Healthcare\u2019s final version of the tool also gives physicians inside the hospital guidance to consult with their in-house infectious disease specialists.\nIf-this-then-retest\nIn her original version, Yu had turned the decision tree criteria into a short panel of questions with yes and no answers. It took her six iterations to arrive at her final version.\nYu\u2019s version asked whether the patient:\nhas a relevant ailment\npreviously tested positive for coronavirus\nis now in an intensive care unit\nhas worsening lung conditions\nshows telltale lung damage in imaging\nhas been diagnosed with a different ailment\nthe patient has had contact with someone else who tested positive for coronavirus.\nOn the back end, the algorithm guided the user through risks of coronavirus presence based on the answers.\n\u201cThe steps were easy to follow, and the answers were color-coded for urgency with white, yellow, and red,\u201d said Keskinocak, who also directs\nGeorgia Tech\u2019s Center for Health and Humanitarian Systems .\nOne bright yellow answer read: \u201cThis patient needs re-testing 24 hours after the initial test!\u201d And there were further recommendations on how to handle the case.\nHere's how to\u00a0 subscribe to our free science and technology\u00a0newsletter\nAlso read:\u00a0 Advice on DIY masks\nWriter &\u00a0Media Representative : Ben Brumfield (404-272-2780), email:\u00a0 ben.brumfield@comm.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nAdditional Images\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
