This date is one of two extended deadlines passed by Congress in November to fund the U.S. government into 2024. The second deadline is currently set to expire Feb. 2.\nIf an agreement is not reached by the Jan. 19 deadline, it will result in a partial government shutdown, which will affect many programs, including the federal contracting work performed by Georgia Tech.\u00a0 Currently, Georgia Tech receives more than $85 million per month in federal funding for its research activities.\n\u201cAs we have anticipated in previous scenarios, most Institute operations would not be immediately affected. However, a prolonged federal shutdown would require measures to\npreserve cash and maintain campus operations ,\u201d\nsaid Jim Fortner, vice president for Finance and Planning and interim chief financial officer.\nLeadership continues to monitor the situation and is ready to implement strategies to help ensure business continuity in the event\nof a partial or full federal government shutdown.\nCurrent mitigation strategies include monitoring cash balances, accelerating federal invoicing, and assessing the need to defer major purchases and non-essential travel.\nMore information, including how specific federal agencies are affected, will be provided as the situation develops.\nContact\nRachael Pocklington\nInstitute Communications\nEmail\nrpocklington@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
