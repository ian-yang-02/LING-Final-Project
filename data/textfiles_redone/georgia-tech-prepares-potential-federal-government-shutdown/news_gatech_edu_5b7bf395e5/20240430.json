The Institute continues to monitor the situation to ensure business continuity in the event there is a partial shutdown. More information will be provided as the situation develops.\n***\nUPDATE (March 1, 2024): Lawmakers have passed a continued resolution to extend the deadlines to secure funding for the U.S. government \u2013 temporarily averting a federal government shutdown. The new deadlines are set to expire on March 8 and March 22. The Institute continues to monitor the situation and will provide updates as the situation develops.\n***\nThe United States government is nearing the extended deadlines to finalize an agreement on federal spending for the current fiscal year, which began on Oct. 1, 2023. Congress established two extended deadlines in January to secure funding for the U.S. government through the fiscal year, with a March 1 deadline for some agencies, and a second deadline for the remaining agencies on March 8.\nIf an agreement is not reached by the March deadlines, it will result in a federal government shutdown, which will affect many programs, including federal contracting work performed by Georgia Tech.\u00a0 Of the two deadlines, the March 1 deadline will have a lesser effect on Georgia Tech\u2019s funding sources.\nCurrently, Georgia Tech receives approximately $100 million per month in federal funding for its research activities.\n\u201cWe have been planning for a potential federal shutdown for quite some time. As we have anticipated in previous scenarios, most Institute operations would not be immediately affected,\u201d said Jim Fortner, vice president and deputy chief business officer for Administration and Finance. \u201cHowever, a prolonged federal shutdown would require measures to\u00a0preserve cash and maintain campus operations.\u201d\nLeadership continues to monitor the situation and is ready to implement strategies to help ensure business continuity in the event\u00a0of a partial or full federal government shutdown.\u00a0Mitigation strategies include monitoring cash balances, accelerating federal invoicing, and assessing the need to defer major purchases and non-essential travel.\u00a0More information, including how specific federal agencies are affected, will be provided as the situation develops.\nContact\nRachael Pocklington\nInstitute Communications\nEmail\nrpocklington@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
