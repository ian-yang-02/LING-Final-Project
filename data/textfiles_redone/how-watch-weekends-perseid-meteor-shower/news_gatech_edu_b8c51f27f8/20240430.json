Tiny bits of debris the size of peas hit Earth\u2019s atmosphere at a staggering 132,000 miles per hour. They reach super-hot temperatures as the streak across the sky. There is a good chance you may have already seen a few streaks across the sky.\nSowell, the director of Georgia Tech\u2019s observatory, says the average will be one every three to five minutes.\nDuring the peak hours this Sunday night and into the early morning of August 13 th , you may be able to see up to 60 meteors an hour.\nNature is helping out a bit this weekend. Because we\u2019re starting a new phase, the moon will not be out to brighten the skies. That means the night will be extra dark. Perfect conditions for meteor spotting.\nIf you\u2019re in Atlanta or near a city, you may need to relocate for optimal viewing. Reducing the number of lights and trees around you will make the meteor shower more visible.\n\u201cFind an open field and lie back,\u201d Sowell says.\nNo Telescope? No problem. Sowell says it won\u2019t be necessary to see the blazes across the night sky.\nBut there\u2019s one thing you can\u2019t control: the weather. Clouds and rain could cause a hiccup if you're planning on stargazing. Thankfully, the forecast around the Atlanta metro area is looking pretty clear.\nThe best time for viewing might mean you\u2019ll have to adjust your schedule a bit.\n\u201c3:00 a.m. to twilight,\u201d Sowell says.\nHe recommends bug spray and light blanket or a cot for full enjoyment.\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nGeorgia Tech Observatory\nContact\nSteven Norris\nInstitute Communications\nEmail\nsocialmedia@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
