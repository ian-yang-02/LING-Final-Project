With this agreement, leading researchers and students at Georgia Tech will be able to study and analyze data coming from motorists, cyclists, pedestrians and transit on North Avenue. The City will then be able to use their insights to evaluate the effectiveness of strategies to manage congestion and promote safe, sustainable mobility options on this vital corridor.\u201d\nThe North Avenue Smart Corridor Project involves multiple Smart City technology components designed to: facilitate and promote safety for pedestrian and bicycle traffic; use the latest technology adaptive traffic signals for a safer, more efficient flow of bus and vehicular traffic in real time conditions and prioritize fire engines and ambulances traveling along the corridor on emergency response calls.\n\u201cWe\u2019re very excited about Georgia Tech\u2019s role in Atlanta\u2019s Smart City initiative along the North Avenue corridor,\u201d said Georgia Tech President G. P. \u201cBud\u201d Peterson. \u201cBy collecting and analyzing data and traffic patterns in the area immediately adjacent to\u00a0our campus, our students, faculty, and staff can partner with the City of Atlanta to create a safer and more efficient place to live, work and play, while dramatically improving the overall quality of life in our community.\u201d\nThe expanded agreement will enable Georgia Tech to store and analyze data generated by these Smart City tools, offering professors and students an opportunity to conduct original research and analyze trends. The City will then use the research and analysis in short and long-term transportation planning.\nNorth Avenue was chosen for the Smart Corridor Project because of its prominence as a major east-west artery running through the Georgia Tech campus in Midtown Atlanta and connecting to the Atlanta BeltLine and Freedom Parkway, with a MARTA rail station and multiple bus stops along its length. The road\u2019s unique features offer the City and Georgia Tech an opportunity to study how to improve safety as well as better manage traffic flow during normal traffic conditions and during special events.\nLearn more about the initiative\nhere .\nAdditional Images\nContact\nLaura Diamond\nMedia Relations\n404-894-6016\n@LauraRDiamond\nEmail\nlaura.diamond@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
