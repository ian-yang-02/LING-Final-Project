Now she helps others reclaim their lives.\nOct 15, 2015\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nManufacturing plants are the economic lifeblood of many communities across Georgia. But for Linda Williams, the plant she works for is more than a means for earning a living and providing for her family: It quite literally saved her life. Williams, who was once homeless and a victim of domestic abuse, was also an alcoholic. Williams is the Georgia Manufacturing Extension Partnership\u2019s October Face of Manufacturing, and credits her boss and coworkers at MeadWestvaco (now WestRock) in Atlanta for helping her overcome the darkest periods of her life. \u201cMy boss recognized the situation and reached out to me. MWV gave me the time I needed to get better,\u201d said Williams, who is the plant\u2019s quality supervisor. \u201cThis company saved my life, and I will be eternally grateful.\u201d Manufacturing is a key economic sector in Georgia. For the more than 365,000 Georgians who work in manufacturing, the Faces of Manufacturing series shows how the industry sustains communities and keeps them economically strong. And it also shows how, on a more personal level, they make a difference in peoples\u2019 lives, in ways that aren\u2019t so obvious. Williams, who has been sober for 15 years, said her coworkers\u2019 intervention to help her heal her life is not unlike the manufacturing process. \u201cEverything is inter-connected,\u201d she said. In any manufacturing process, everything needs to work for the entire process to run smoothly. If one part along the process is broken, everything else can be thrown off-kilter. Williams isn\u2019t the only person MVW has helped to overcome personal challenges, and the company\u2019s culture of supporting a team- and family-oriented environment sets it apart, she said. She said she is proud to work in a manufacturing environment where success isn\u2019t only measured by the bottom line, but also by the personal triumphs of its individual employees. Today she shares her story \u2014 speaking openly and publicly about her struggles and how she overcame them \u2014 hoping to empower others who are going through similar challenges. \u201cThey saw something in me worth saving,\u201d Williams said, adding it\u2019s her duty to share her journey with others to show there is hope to overcome whatever struggles they may be facing. \u201cI give people the tools and resources they need to move ahead,\u201d Williams said. \u201cAnd to realize there are other choices in life, and there is light at the end of the tunnel.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nFaces of Manufacturing\nContact\nFor media inquiries contact: Laura Diamond Georgia Tech Media Relations laura.diamond@gatech.edu For more information about GaMEP contact: Katie Takacs GaMEP Marketing Manager katie.takacs@innovate.gatech.edu\nEmail\nperalte.paul@comm.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
