And in order for therapy developers to meet safety and production standards, they must rely on complex and time-consuming analytical approaches that are slow and inaccurate.\nNow, a new startup,\nAndson Biotech , hopes to make the development and production of these therapies easier. Andson was launched from a partnership between the Georgia Institute of Technology and the\nNational Science Foundation Engineering Research Center for Cell Manufacturing Technologies\n(CMaT). The company develops new sensors to discover the next groundbreaking cell and gene therapies.\nAndson\u2019s sensors make it possible to measure important biomolecules rapidly and accurately to ensure drug product quality with a tool called mass spectrometry. Used for decades in the biopharmaceutical field, mass spectrometry\u2019s potential has been severely limited because of how slow and complicated the analysis can be. Andson Biotech\u2019s solutions simplify workflows and enable direct-from-production line mass spectrometry analysis. This means it can serve not only as a discovery tool to identify biomolecules, but also as a sensor to measure the most important biomolecules for feedback control. Traditional mass spectrometry can take hours to days, but Andson\u2019s approach cuts the time down to just minutes.\n\u201cIt really changes the game because it unlocks the capabilities of mass spectrometry to serve as an actual process analytical technology, not just an R&D tool that only Ph.D. scientists can use to do deep characterization,\u201d said Mason Chilmonczyk, a postdoctoral researcher in the\nGeorge W. Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering\nand Andson Biotech\u2019s cofounder and CEO.\nMeasuring Limitations\nSensors are integral to enabling new advanced therapies. They help determine how the therapies function in the lab and control the processes that eventually produce them at scale in factories. Yet measuring these molecules is often so complex that only some specialized laboratories have the capability, which causes delays in drug development due to slow turnaround times and makes in-process measurements for feedback control impossible. To complicate matters further, many sensors are outdated, according to Chilmonczyk.\n\u201cProduction on the next generation of drugs is severely lacking because drug manufacturers are relying on sensors that were generated 20 to 30 years ago,\u201d said Chilmonczyk. \u201cWe\u2019re developing sensors that can rapidly and precisely measure the biomolecules that indicate quality, which is one of the key voids in modern biomanufacturing capabilities as there is a big question around what do we measure and how do we measure it when it matters.\u201d\nWorking with the Mass Spectrometer\nAndson\u2019s innovations enable rapid mass spectrometry, an analytical tool that measures the mass of a biomolecule. Knowing the mass of a biomolecule helps developers identify what the biomolecule is, hypothesize how it might correlate with a drug process, and develop drugs accordingly.\nDuring Chilmonczyk\u2019s Ph.D. studies, he created a microfabrication process in the\nGeorgia Tech Institute for Electronics and Nanotechnologies (IEN)\ncleanrooms that relies on advanced microelectronic processing capabilities, the same technology used to manufacture computers, to create sensors that interface with mass spectrometers. This process enabled him to develop platforms that simplify the sample handling and preparation, making mass spectrometry more accessible for process development and in-process control. The systems are designed with the needs of modern biomanufacturing in mind.\nThe innovation was only possible because of Georgia Tech\u2019s relationship with\nCMaT , a partnership between\nParker H. Petit Institute for Bioengineering and Biosciences\nand the National Science Foundation Engineering Research Center on Cell Manufacturing Technology based at Georgia Tech as a lead institution. The program\u2019s goal is to make cell-based therapeutics manufacturing scalable, robust, and low-cost to expand treatment against incurable chronic diseases. Chilmonczyk was first a Ph.D. trainee and then a post-doctoral trainee within CMaT before spinning out Andson; the collaborative effort has been crucial for the technical development.\n\u201cCMaT essentially bet on us that our technology \u2014 in combination with all the Georgia Tech infrastructure and facilities \u2014 would bring innovation,\u201d said Andrei Fedorov, the cofounder of Andson and a Georgia Tech professor in mechanical engineering. \u201cAnd then they brought in a unique analyzer \u2013 a new mass spectrometer \u2013 into their good manufacturing practice facility so that we could develop our systems in environments that are relevant for industry. So in every single way that they can support us, they pretty much have done it.\u201d\nBy making drug discovery easier, Andson\u2019s sensors could have major impacts on medical treatment and public health. Gene and cell therapies don\u2019t just ameliorate symptoms, but they fundamentally cure diseases. Ultimately, this is what drew the founders of the Andson to the project.\n\u201cI feel a personal responsibility for us to bring it to the market,\u201d said Fedorov, who is also Rae S. and Frank H. Neely Chair. \u201cWe need it to be successful, not just for our own fulfillment as entrepreneurs, but the world needs it to be successful.\u201d What\u2019s Next\nChilmonczyk and Fedorov have worked together since 2014 on the projects that led to the formation of Andson Biotech. The first sign of commercialization was the 2020 backing of the project by the\nBiolocity program\nthen follow-on funding from the\nGeorgia Research Alliance . It was the backing by these programs that allowed Chilmonczyk and Fedorov to develop the technology in partnership with CMaT and the\nMarcus Center for Therapeutic Cell Characterization and Manufacturing\n(MC3M). These partnerships are still significant for Andson Biotech, which has joined CMaT as a member company and continues to collaborate with MC3M in their unique facility.\nNow, the largest and most prestigious accelerator, Y Combinator, has backed Andson Biotech. The company will use this investment to pilot studies with pharmaceutical companies and to scale the company in the next 12 months.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nTess Malone, Research Writer/Editor\nEmail\ntess.malone@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
