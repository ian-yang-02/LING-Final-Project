During the 2020 NFL and NCAA football seasons, there was heightened concern around the risk of Covid-19 spread as a result of attendance at games. Now, researchers from the Georgia Institute of Technology, Harvard University, and Boston Medical Center led a study to explore whether limited in-person attendance of NFL and NCAA football games caused a substantial increase in Covid-19 cases. This research study analyzed data from 528 games that had spectators in the stadiums. It found that games with limited attendance did not cause a spike in Covid-19 cases.\nThe researchers sought to estimate the impact of NFL and NCAA games with attendance by monitoring trends for new reported Covid-19 cases up to 14 days after a game. The effects were quantified by comparing daily changes in Covid-19 cases per 100,000 residents in counties that had held games with limited in-person attendance with those that did not hold games or had no attendance.\nOf the 796 NFL and NCAA games played from August 29, 2020 through December 28, 2020, 528 had in-person attendance. NFL games during that timeframe had a median of 11,133 attendees. Data indicates that only an average of less than five daily new cases of Covid-19 were reported up to 14 days after the sporting events.\nResearchers concluded that the NFL and NCAA games with limited in-person attendance, mask use, and physical distancing measures did not lead to a significant increase in Covid-19 cases in the counties where they were held.\n\u201cBefore conducting the study, our conjecture was that football games would cause an explosion in the number of cases. However, it turns out that this is not the case, and the games did not lead to a major increase in the number of cases,\u201d said\nTurgay Ayer , associate professor and the George Family Foundation Early Career Professor in\nGeorgia Tech\u2019s H. Milton Stewart School of Industrial and Systems Engineering .\nThe study published in\nmedRxiv\nis a preprint and has not been peer-reviewed. It reports new medical research that has yet to be evaluated and so should not be used to guide clinical practice.\nCITATION: Turgay Ayer, Asmae Toumi, et. al., \u201cThe Effect of NFL and NCAA Football Games on the Spread of COVID-19 in the United States: An Empirical Analysis.\u201d (medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.15.21251745v1.full)\nAdditional Images\nContact\nAyana Isles\nGeorgia Tech Media Relations\nEmail\naisles3@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
