In addition to convening the world\u2019s leaders and climate experts, The Exchange will address the social and practical challenges created by climate change \u2014 including commercially viable research and ideas that lead to immediate action on local and global levels.\n\u201cToday's climate issues are urgent, and environmental justice and ecological sustainability necessitate action from leaders across the world,\u201d said Chaouki Abdallah, executive vice president for research at Georgia Tech. \u201cAs a core partner of The Exchange, Georgia Tech will provide research expertise in the areas of energy, urban planning, bi\u00ad\u00adological ecosystems, public policy, and more, and we look forward to playing an instrumental role in bringing its mission to fruition.\u201d\nGeorgia Tech researchers are studying glacial melt, coral growth, sea level rise, and other climate concerns in the state of Georgia and around the world and will share their data and research results with partners at The Exchange.\u00a0Likewise, research at The Exchange will be applicable for towns and cities across Georgia, allowing state leaders to take advantage of economic opportunities that arise when climate change is addressed head on.\nIn addition to contributing critical research across the many areas of climate change, Georgia Tech leads major initiatives that are focused on solving the crises laid out in the UN\u2019s Sustainable Development Goals.\nGeneration 2 Reinvented Toilet (G2RT)\n\u2014 a solution to the world\u2019s water and sanitation problem \u2014 is led by\nShannon Yee , associate professor in the\nGeorge W. Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering\nat Georgia Tech. This cost-effective, globally scalable reinvented toilet with built-in human waste treatment will ensure that drinking water stays clean and will improve public health around the world.\nGeorgia Tech is also a leading partner of the\nOcean Visions\n\u2013 UN Decade Collaborative Center for Ocean-Climate Solutions, an international center headquartered at the Georgia Aquarium that aims to co-design, develop, test, fund, and deliver scalable and equitable ocean-based solutions to reduce the effects of climate change and build climate-resilient marine ecosystems and coastal communities. Championed at Georgia Tech by\nSusan Lozier,\ndean and Betsy Middleton and John Clark Sutherland Chair in the\nCollege of Sciences , the Center also supports opportunities to accelerate ocean-based carbon dioxide removal research and advance sustainable ocean economies.\n\u201cWe are looking forward to contributing and demonstrating some of the engineering sustainability solutions that have been developed at Georgia Tech with New York City and the world,\u201d said Yee. \u201cMany of the technical and economic solutions that serve the state of Georgia, the coastal city of Savannah, and the urban center of Atlanta can also serve the urban harbor of New York City.\u00a0Similarly, the innovations and economic opportunities that address climate change can be shared with and benefit Georgia. This collaboration embodies the concept of an exchange\u00a0where we share with one another.\u201d\nAs The Exchange\u2019s anchor institution, Stony Brook University will build and operate the center which will be located on Governors Island in New York City. The center is slated to open in 2028.\n\u201cIt is becoming clear year after year in New York, and around the world, that the impacts of climate change are real and are here,\u201d said Kevin Reed, associate dean for Research and associate professor in the School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences at Stony Brook. \u201cBy partnering with communities, industries, governments, and universities, The Exchange will help to accelerate the implementation of urban solutions to these climate impacts through an interactive research ecosystem where community engagement is paramount. As a climate scientist, I recognize that New Yorkers need solutions to the climate crisis now, and The Exchange will help to make that a reality.\u201d\nContact\nNews Contact\nGeorgia Parmelee | georgia.parmelee@gatech.edu\nEmail\ngeorgia.parmelee@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
