The award places him in the company of such giants of American poetry as\nRobert Frost ,\nGwendolyn Brooks , and\nTracy K. Smith\nwho are past recipients of the fellowship.\nEstablished in 1936 and given in memory of\nJames Ingram Merrill , with generous support from the\nT. S. Eliot Foundation , the prize recognizes distinguished poetic achievement and carries with it a stipend of $25,000 and a residency at the Eliot summer home in Gloucester, Massachusetts. Fellows are nominated and elected by a majority vote of the\nAcademy\u2019s Board of Chancellors .\nIn announcing the award to Kaminsky,\nAcademy Chancellor Kwame Dawes\nsaid, \u201cIlya Kaminsky is among a few poets that one has to admire for his impact on the wider poetry world through the force of his art, despite his relatively modest publishing output as a poet. Consequently, he is quite easily and rightfully recognized as a vital voice in global poetry and one of the most brilliant poets working today.\u201d\n\u201cHis is a poetics for our moment, as much engaged in understanding the world of Eastern Europe as it is in understanding America today. And yet in his work one suspects a reach that extends beyond our moment\u2014a reach for something urgent and essential\u2014a sense of social justice and a compelling proposition that speaking out against tyranny and abuse perpetuated by governments remains a timeless and necessary imperative of art. The quest for beauty in language is, therefore, an act of resistance and even protest in the face of the ugliness of human oppression. Ilya Kaminsky remains a tremendous broker for the poetic arts in our world today.\u201d\nKaminsky is the author of multiple collections of poetry, including\nDeaf Republic\n(Graywolf Press, 2019). His work has been recognized in the past by a\nLannan Literary Fellowship , a\nWhiting Award , the\nRuth Lily Poetry Fellowship , and a\n2019 Creative Writing Fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) .\nOur heartiest congratulations to Dr. Kaminsky for this distinction, which also brings credit to the Georgia Institute of Technology Ivan Allen College of Liberal Arts and its School of Literature, Media, and Communication which houses the Poetry@Tech program.\nPoetry@Tech\nkicks off its 2019/2020 poetry reading series on October 3.
