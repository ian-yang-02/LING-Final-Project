Among the riskiest moments are inserting and removing breathing tubes, procedures that create a spray of respiratory droplets.\nNow, two Atlanta universities have created barrier protection devices designed to contain that droplet spray and aerosol with a goal of reducing the risk of disease transmission.\nMade of clear polycarbonate material, the four-sided box is placed on a bed over the patient\u2019s head and shoulders. Protected hand openings allow physicians or other health care personnel to reach into the box to perform procedures such as intubating a patient who needs to be placed on a ventilator.\n\u201cIntubation and extubation require a physician to work in extremely close proximity to a patient while simultaneously performing procedures known to generate a large amount of potentially infectious droplets,\u201d said Cinnamon Sullivan, M.D., assistant professor of anesthesiology, Emory University School of Medicine and the director of Global Health Anesthesiology at Emory University Hospital. \u201cThe goal of this box is to block, to a large extent, the amount of droplets being aerosolized and serve as one more layer of protection in addition to our personal protective equipment (PPE).\u201d\nFor more coverage of Georgia Tech\u2019s response to the coronavirus\u00a0pandemic, please visit our\u00a0 Responding to COVID-19 \u00a0page.\nIn recent weeks, a cross-disciplinary team that included anesthesiologists and other physician specialists from Emory University and engineers from the Georgia Institute of Technology has worked quickly prototyping several devices, which were adapted from a basic design distributed widely throughout the medical community as the COVID-19 outbreak grew.\nTwo primary designs emerged from the effort. One of these devices is a fold-flat box, and the other device is a C-shaped frame. Both provide similar functionalities and are designed for dynamic hospital environments, such as in the emergency department.\nThe box that can be folded flat when not in use also has a handle to enable easier transportation and includes more safety measures designed to protect clinicians from aerosols escaping through the access holes. These new features were critical to achieving a box that could be used without taking up as much space.\n\u201cThe medical team that performs intubations moves from unit to unit where we\u2019re needed, so the portability of this design is essential to making it work in actual patient care situations,\u201d said Jeremy Collins, MBChB, FRCA, associate professor of anesthesiology and executive vice chair of anesthesia at Emory. \u201cAs well as protecting the anesthesia team, containment of aerosol and droplets generated can minimize contamination to the whole operating room and surrounding corridors.\u201d\nThe overall goal of the project is to improve protection for medical staff as they work closely with COVID-19 patients, explained Christopher Saldana, associate professor in Georgia Tech\u2019s\nGeorge W. Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering . \u201cThe goal is to shroud the patient and allow the clinicians to do the necessary procedures while adding an additional barrier from potential exposure,\u201d he said.\nThe box also helps shield personal protective equipment (PPE) from contamination, potentially helping to maintain supplies.\n\u201cA need for such a box was identified during daily meetings with leaders of Emory departments responding to the COVID-19 emergency,\u201d said\nSusan Margulies , chair of the\nWallace H. Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering\nthat is shared by Georgia Tech and Emory. From the meeting, Margulies identified problems that might be addressed by Georgia Tech researchers.\n\u201cMy role is to think about how the expertise at Georgia Tech can be brought to bear on the needs of the medical community,\u201d she said. \u201cAs a department truly embedded on both campuses, this collaboration gives us the opportunity to create a direct relationship between the problems and the solutions.\u201d\nMargulies brought the aerosol containment issue to\nSam Graham , chair of the Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering, and Saldana, whose research focuses on manufacturing and materials. Saldana listened to the problem and worked with Margulies to quickly develop a concept that could be evaluated, based on a design used in Asia.\nBased on the initial concept, Saldana and graduate student Kentez Craig quickly built two prototypes and sent them to Emory for Sullivan, Collins and others to inspect and check whether the size of the box would work in an operating room environment. \u201cEmory told us they really needed them,\u201d Saldana said. \u201cThey showed us how this design would be used in practice and we talked about iterations.\u201d\nSullivan and Collins immediately identified the need to make the devices more portable, as well as address how the access holes could be better closed off to prevent aerosols from escaping during use.\nSince these developments, a team of graduate students, including Jaime Berez and Maxwell Praniewicz, quickly designed the final prototypes of the fold-flat box and the C-shaped frame. Review and testing of the C-shaped frame was completed with Russell Gore, M.D., an adjunct associate professor in the Wallace H. Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering, Adam Klein, M.D., a professor in the Department of Otolaryngology at Emory University and David Wright, M.D., a professor and chair of the Department of Emergency Medicine at Emory University. To produce these designs, Siemens Corporation joined the team to lead the production of prototypes; Barry Powell and James Washburn at Siemens implemented an industrial manual assembly process with additional support from Georgia Tech\u2019s Montgomery Machining Mall and the Georgia Tech Research Institute\u2019s Machine Services.\nThe boxes and frames are made from polycarbonate, a clear rigid material. The material was cut in Georgia Tech\u2019s Flowers Invention Studio with a water-jet machine. A laser device was used to cut the hand holes. \u201cYou might need some specialized equipment, but most people could use general shop equipment to produce these,\u201d Saldana said.\nPeople who\u2019ve worked in a research laboratory will recognize the concept behind the devices. \u201cThis is a lot like a glovebox that is used in many laboratories to separate laboratory technician from hazardous materials or environments inside the box or frame,\u201d Saldana said. \u201cThe technician places their hands and arms into the gloves, allowing them to work separate from what\u2019s inside.\u201d\nUnlike the face shields and respirators that are in such high demand, the barrier protection devices will be needed only in small quantities to shield clinicians during the specific procedure. Saldana says hospitals potentially could find it useful in emergency departments, intensive care units and operating rooms.\n\u201cWe hope these barrier protection devices have utility beyond this outbreak,\u201d Sullivan said. \u201cThey may be able to be used for any aerosolized disease, and with the modifications we are making, it could be taken to areas with fewer PPE resources both here in the U.S. and overseas.\u201d\nResearch News\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\n177 North Avenue\nAtlanta, Georgia\u00a0 30332-0181\u00a0 USA\nMedia Relations Contacts : Georgia Tech \u2013 John Toon (jtoon@gatech.edu); Emory Healthcare \u2013 Josh Brown (joshua.g.brown@emoryhealthcare.org).\nWriter : Joshua Brown\nAdditional Images\nContact\nJohn Toon\nResearch News\n(404) 894-6986\nEmail\njtoon@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
