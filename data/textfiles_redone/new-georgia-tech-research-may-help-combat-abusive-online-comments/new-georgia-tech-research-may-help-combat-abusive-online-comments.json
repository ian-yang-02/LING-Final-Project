Five, such as the free-for-all of internet communities 4chan, are rife with abusive behavior from commenters; four, like the heavily moderated MetaFilter, are helpful, positive, and supportive.\nUsing linguistic characteristics from these two types of communities, researchers built an algorithm that can learn from the comments and, when a new post is generated within a target community, it can make a prediction of whether or not it is abusive.\n\u201cMetaFilter is known around the internet as a good, helpful, supportive community,\u201d said\nEric Gilbert , an associate professor in the School of Interactive Computing and a member of the team of researchers on the project. \u201cThat\u2019s an example of how, if your post is closer to that, it\u2019s more likely that it should stay on the site. Conversely, if your post is closer to 4chan, then maybe it should come off.\u201d\nThe researchers provide two algorithms. One is a static model, off the shelf with no training examples from the target community, and can achieve roughly 75 percent accuracy. In other words, with access only to posts from the other nine communities, the algorithm can accurately predict abusive posts in the target community roughly three quarters of the time.\n\u201cA new community that does not have enough resources to actually build automated algorithms to detect abusive content could use the static model,\u201d said Georgia Tech doctoral student\nEshwar Chandrasekharan , who led the team.\nA dynamic model, one that mimics scenarios in which newly moderated data arrives in batches, learns over time and can achieve 91.18 percent accuracy after seeing 100,000 human-moderated posts.\n\u201cOver time, as new moderator labels come in, when it has seen examples of things that have been moderated from the site, it can learn more site-specific information,\u201d Chandrasekharan said. \u201cIt can learn the type of comments that get moderated, and if there is a level of tolerance that is different from what you see in the static model, it could learn that over time.\u201d\nBoth the static and dynamic models outperformed a solely in-domain model from a major internet community.\nAnyone who has managed an online community has encountered problems with abusive content from users. From social media to message boards to comments sections in online news publications, regulating what is and isn\u2019t allowed has become overly costly and taxing on existing human moderators.\nFounders at social media startup Yik Yak spent months of their early time removing hate speech, and Twitter has stated publicly that dealing with abusive behavior remains its most pressing challenge. A number of major news agencies are buried under the demands of strict moderation, and many have shut down comments sections altogether.\nPrior research into abuse detection and online content moderation has focused on in-domain methods \u2013 using data collected from within your own community \u2013 but those face challenges in obtaining enough data to build and evaluate algorithms. In a BoC-based method, algorithms would leverage out-of-domain data from other existing online communities.\nGilbert said that the applications from such a model could be widespread.\n\u201cThis is a core internet problem,\u201d he said. \u201cSo many places struggle with this, and many are shutting comments off because they just don\u2019t want to deal with the trouble they cause.\u201d\nThis research is presented in a paper ( The Bag of Communities: Identifying Abusive Behavior Online with Preexisting Internet Data ) at the\nAssociation for Computing Machinery CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems 2017 .\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nGeorgia Tech @ CHI 2017\nContact\nDavid Mitchell\nCommunications Officer\nEmail\ndavid.mitchell@cc.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
