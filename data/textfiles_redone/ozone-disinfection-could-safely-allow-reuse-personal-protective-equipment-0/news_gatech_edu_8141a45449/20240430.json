The study found that the consistency and effectiveness of the ozone treatment depended on maintaining relative humidity of at least 50% in chambers used for disinfection.\n\u201cOzone is one of the friendliest and cleanest ways of deactivating viruses and killing most any pathogen,\u201d said M.G. Finn, chair of Georgia Tech\u2019s School of Chemistry and Biochemistry, who led the study. \u201cIt does not leave a residue; it\u2019s easy to generate from atmospheric air, and it\u2019s easy to use from an equipment perspective.\u201d\nFindings of the research are described in a paper posted to the medRxiv preprint server and will be submitted to a journal for peer review and publication. Ozone can be produced with inexpensive equipment by exposing oxygen in the atmosphere to ultraviolet light, or through an electrical discharge such as a spark.\nDuring local and regional peaks in coronavirus infection, shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE) can force hospitals and other healthcare facilities to reuse PPE that was intended for a single use. Facilities have used ultraviolet light, vaporized hydrogen peroxide, heat, alcohol and other techniques to disinfect these items, but until recently, there had not been much interest in ozone disinfection, Finn said.\nFor more coverage of Georgia Tech\u2019s response to the coronavirus pandemic, please visit our\u00a0 Responding to Covid-19 page .\nOzone is widely used for disinfecting wastewater, purifying drinking water, sanitizing food items, and disinfecting certain types of equipment \u2014 even clothing. Ozone disinfection cabinets are commercially available, taking advantage of the oxidizing effects of the gas to kill bacteria and inactivate viruses.\n\u201cThere was no reason to think it wouldn\u2019t work, but we could find no examples of testing done on a variety of personal protective equipment,\u201d Finn said. \u201cWe wanted to contribute to meeting the needs of hospitals and other healthcare organizations to show that this technique could work against pathogens similar to the coronavirus.\u201d\nPhil Santangelo, a virologist in the Wallace H. Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering, recommended two respiratory viruses \u2014 influenza A and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) \u2013 as surrogates for coronavirus. The two are known as \u201cenveloped\u201d viruses because, like coronavirus, they are surrounded by a lipid outer membrane. Influenza and RSV are less dangerous than the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, allowing the Georgia Tech researchers to study them without high-containment laboratory facilities.\nSantangelo, Finn, and their team devised a test procedure in which solutions containing the two viruses were placed onto samples of the PPE materials under study. The solutions were allowed to dry before the samples were placed in a chamber into which ozone was introduced at varying concentrations as low as 20 parts per million. After treatment for different lengths of time, the researchers tested the PPE samples to determine whether or not any of the viruses on the treated surfaces could infect cells grown in the laboratory. The entire test procedure required about a day and a half.\n\u201cThe protocol we set up reports very sensitively on whether or not the virus could reproduce, and we found that the ozone was very successful in rendering them harmless,\u201d Finn said. \u201cOxidizing biological samples to a significant extent is enough to inactivate a virus. Either the genetic material or the outer shell of the virus would be damaged enough that it could no longer infect a host cell.\u201d\nLoren Williams, a professor in School of Chemistry and Biochemistry, introduced the research team to a manufacturer of ozone disinfection chambers, which allowed evaluation of the equipment using the test protocol. During the test, the researchers learned that having sufficient relative humidity in the chamber \u2014 at least 50% \u2014 was essential for rapidly inactivating the viruses in a consistent manner.\nAfter subjecting face masks and respirators to ozone disinfection, the team worked with Associate Professor Nga Lee (Sally) Ng from the School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering and the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences to evaluate the filtration capabilities of the items. The ozone treatment didn\u2019t appear to negatively affect the N-95 filtration material.\nBut it did damage the elastic materials used to hold the masks in place. While the elastic headbands could be removed from the masks during ozone disinfection, removing and replacing them on a large scale may make the treatment technique impractical. Otherwise, however, ozone may offer an alternative technique for disinfecting other types of PPE.\n\u201cOzone would be a viable method for hospitals and other organizations to disinfect garments, goggles, and gloves,\u201d Finn added. \u201cIt is inexpensive to produce, and we hope that by sharing information about what we\u2019ve found, healthcare facilities will be able to consider it as an option, particularly in low-resource areas of the world.\u201d\nBeyond those already mentioned, the research involved Emmeline Blanchard from the Wallace H.
