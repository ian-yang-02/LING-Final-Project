Given the chemical complexity of VOC reactions and SOA formation, previous experiments have mostly only studied one VOC compound at a time. In this study, Ng\u2019s team used advanced mass spectrometry techniques to probe chemistry of multi-VOC reactions from the bulk to\u00a0molecular level.\n\u201cOur results highlight that unlike what is currently assumed in atmospheric models, the interaction of products formed from individual VOCs should be accounted for accurately to describe SOA formation and its climate and health impacts,\" Ng said.\nNg explained that one might have expected\u00a0\u03b1-pinene and limonene to have the same potential to form SOA when they are oxidized as mixtures simultaneously compared to when they are oxidized separately. But what the researchers found was approximately a 50% percent enhancement in the formation of SOA from \u03b1-pinene and about a 20% reduction in limonene SOA formation.\n\u201cIn this case, one plus one does not equal two,\u201d Ng said. \u201cWe do not get a linear reaction in the simultaneous oxidation experiment like we do in the sequential experiment. New products are being made by the interaction of the two monoterpenes.\u201d\nNg\u2019s study examined \u03b1-pinene and limonene in a nighttime setting when nitrate radical chemistry prominently happens. Nitrate radicals are produced by traffic emissions and ozone.\n\u201cAerosol chemistry does not stop at night,\u201d Ng said. After sunset, the nitrogen oxide compounds and ozone can react with the emissions from trees to produce organic aerosols. \u201cAt night, oxidation still takes place, but nighttime interactions have not been well studied.\u201d\nNg said she hopes this research will lead to further studies to examine VOCs in the atmosphere and how they interact together. \u201cStudying the interaction of two VOCs is really just the beginning,\u201d Ng said. \u201cIt\u2019s a big step froward, but there\u2019s still a long way to go to understand the complexity of the atmosphere, where hundreds of VOCs are emitted and reacting at the same time.\u201d\nThis work was supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF) CAREER AGS-1555034 (N.L.N), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) NA18OAR4310112 (N.L.N), and the Eckert Postdoctoral Fellowship from the School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at Georgia Institute of Technology (T.B.).
