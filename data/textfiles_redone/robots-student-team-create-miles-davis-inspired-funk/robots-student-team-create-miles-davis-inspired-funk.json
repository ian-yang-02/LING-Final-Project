Mason Bretan, a Ph.D. candidate in music technology, plays the drums, guitar and keyboard. A robot named Shimon listens to the sounds, then generates music on a marimba using its computational knowledge of jazz theory and improvisation. At the same time, a trio of Shimi robots autonomously generates dance choreographies based on a joint analysis of the music and a self-awareness of their physical constraints and abilities. The Shimis also play their own complementing music, based on a combination of Bretan's original compositions and improvisational algorithms.\nThe six-minute, high-energy funk piece\nis called \u201cWhat You Say\u201d and is based on Davis\u2019 \u201cWhat I Say.\u201d It\u2019s the latest project from the lab of Gil Weinberg, Bretan\u2019s advisor and director of Georgia Tech\u2019s Center for Music Technology. Bretan created the composition after listening to Davis\u2019 1971 Live Evil album. \u201cThe brilliance of the musicians on that album is an inspiration to me and my own musical and instrumental aspirations,\u201d said Bretan. \u201cThey also set the standard for the level of musicianship that I hope machines will one day achieve. And through the power of artificial intelligence, signal processing and engineering, I firmly believe it is possible for machines to be artistic, creative and inspirational.\u201d The project was created during a span of several months at Georgia Tech. The Shimi robots analyze the music offline and generate a sequence\u00a0of movements and musical phrases that can then be performed live. Shimon, is given the chord progression prior to the performance, then figures out how to improvise with Bretan. The student will spend the next few months fine-tuning the process to allow real-time analysis and composing.\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nAdditional Information\nContact\nJason Maderer National Media Relations maderer@gatech.edu 404-385-2966\nEmail\nmaderer@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
