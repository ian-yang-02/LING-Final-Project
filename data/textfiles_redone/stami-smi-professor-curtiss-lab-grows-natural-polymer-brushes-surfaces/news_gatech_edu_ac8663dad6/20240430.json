The brushes are visible under the microscope, whereas polymer brushes are usually detected with atomic force microscopes or other non-optical means. The faint, green line at the bottom in this photo is a surface the bristles have grown on. The bristles are seen as a green-black mass reaching up to the red dots from the surface.\u00a0Credit: Georgia Tech / Allison Carter\nJan 17, 2020\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nAdapted from\nGeorgia Tech Research Horizons .\nMedical devices often require sophisticated biointerfaces for biocompatibility and biofunctions\nin situ\nand\nin vivo . Polymer brushes are a class of biomaterials that have been used in a range of applications such as sensors, drug delivery, and implants. In these applications and many others, such polymers are usually desired in high density at the interface, which typically requires synthesizing and growing the biopolymers from the surface. Unfortunately, few methodologies exist for the synthetic catalysis of\nnatural\nbiopolymers from surfaces, and natural biopolymers are often desirable for biomaterials applications to improve biocompatibility and provide natural functions. Overcoming these barriers is part of new work reported from the labs of SMI Professor Jennifer Curtis (School of Physics), which introduces a versatile platform to grow ultra-thick (100 times the usual length), dense hyaluronan (HA) polymer brushes from surfaces. This new method for growing HA brushes provides a path to improved biocompatibility and dynamic control of biointerfaces that potentially can be grown\nin vivo\nor regenerated after wear.\nIn Professor Curtis\u2019s group, a\u00a0lab goof with an enzyme taken from bacteria\u00a0led to the creation of the Leviathan polymer brushes. \u201cWe were putting the enzyme onto a surface to observe it for a totally different experiment, but we put too much on the surface too densely, and \u2013 boom \u2013 we ended up with the thickest, longest polymer brush we\u2019d ever seen or heard of,\u201d said Jennifer Curtis, who led the study and is\u00a0 an associate professor in Georgia Tech\u2019s School of Physics . \u201cThey were so big you could actually see them under an optical microscope instead of having to feel them with an\u00a0 atomic force microscope \u00a0or use other methods needed for more customary polymer brushes.\u201d\nThe researchers diverted attention from the original study to pursue the freakishly large new brush.\nTo bacteria encroaching on them, the brush\u2019s bristles are a virtually impenetrable, squishy thicket that keeps microbes out in lab observations. It hinders the spread of biofilms, bacterial colonies that join together to form a tough material that makes killing the bacteria difficult.\nBiofilm bulwark\n\u201cThe human immune system has a hard time with biofilms. Antibiotics don\u2019t work very well on them either. In water filtration, biofilms can stick tenaciously, too. If you have a hyaluronan brush on a surface, a biofilm can\u2019t stick to it,\u201d Curtis said.\nHyaluronan, the compound in the bristles, is a polysaccharide, a chain of sugar molecules, and is naturally widespread in and around our cells. It is also known to many from its use in cosmetic moisturizers.\nThe enzyme that makes the hyaluronan bristles on the brush is\u00a0 hyaluronan synthase , and it circumvents more tedious chemical synthesis by effortlessly extruding extremely long bristles. The enzymes also can replace bristles when they break off, something chemically synthesized brushes cannot do, which limits those brushes\u2019 durability. Still, use of the synthase is unorthodox.\n\u201cBrush people say, \u2018What are these enzymes doing here?\u2019 because they\u2019re looking for chemistry, and biologists wonder what the brush has to do with biology,\u201d Curtis said.\nThe team published\u00a0 the new study,\u00a0 Self-regenerating giant hyaluronan polymer\u00a0 brushes,\u00a0 in the journal \u00a0Nature Communications \u00a0in December 2019 . The research was funded by the National Science Foundation.\nEngineered\u00a0 E. coli\nThe researchers engineered bacteria to overabundantly produce the enzyme by inserting hyaluronan synthase genes from the bacteria\u00a0 Streptococcus equisimilis \u00a0into\u00a0 E. coli\u00a0 then they harvested the enzyme.\n\u201cWe shattered the bacteria into a bunch of non-living gooey fragments then adhered their membrane to surfaces, and the synthase extruded the brushes,\u201d Curtis said.\nThe enzymes can be switched on and off, and adjusting salt concentration or pH in the solution around the brushes makes the bristles extend to a straight form or curl up into a retracted form. Functional additives like antibacterials could be embedded in brushes.\nSomething like a catheter could conceivably one day be coated with brushes to remain bacteria-free, and the thickness of the wiggly brushes would also act as a lubricant by preventing frictive contact with the surface beneath them. Some human cells key to the healing process are actually able to sink through the bristles, which could have potential for medicine.\n\u201cFor a chronic wound that won\u2019t heal, you may be able to design a bandage that encourages new cell growth but keeps bacteria out,\u201d Curtis said.\nBiophysics research\nThe researchers\u2019 fortuitous detour into the giant brush has expanded possibilities for their original intent of studying enzymatic hyaluronan in isolation.\n\u201cWe constantly deal with the coupling of biochemistry, chemical signaling, and mechanics, so having something that isolates the mechanics from the signaling so we can focus on just the mechanics is really useful,\u201d Curtis said.\nWenbin Wei and Jessica Faubel of Georgia Tech were the study\u2019s first authors.
