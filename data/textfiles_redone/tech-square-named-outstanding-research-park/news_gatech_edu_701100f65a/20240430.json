AURP, which made the announcement Dec. 4 at its 2014 International Conference in Boca Raton, Fla., cited the collaborative efforts of Tech Square\u2019s core partners \u2014Georgia Institute of Technology, Gateway Development Services, and The University Financing Foundation \u2014 as key to getting the award. \u201cFor 10\u00a0years,\u00a0we have all known that Tech Square is an outstanding research park,\u201d said AURP President Kevin Byrne. \u201cI am very pleased that Tech Square has been recognized and now joins the AURP Academy of Outstanding Research Parks.\u201d Since launching 10 years ago, Tech Square has emerged to become among the premier research and innovation centers in the country and a model for others to follow. It also has attracted a number of corporate heavyweights that opened innovation centers to tap into Georgia Tech\u2019s faculty and student expertise, including AT&T Mobility, Panasonic, NCR, and ThyssenKrupp. \u201cWe first saw it as an expansion of the campus, and certainly a connection to the greater community and to the business community,\u201d said Chris Downing, associate vice president of the Enterprise Innovation Institute (EI 2 ), Georgia Tech\u2019s chief statewide business and economic development and outreach unit. \u201cIt\u2019s turned from that mixed-use activity to something much broader and a nexus for innovation in the Atlanta area.\u201d This recognition follows the \u201cInnovation\u201d award the Association of Public Land Grant Universities gave to Georgia Tech on Nov. 3 for its statewide economic development efforts across a host of sectors.\u00a0 \u2014 By P\u00e9ralte C.
