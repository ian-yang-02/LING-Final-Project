Researchers at Georgia Institute of Technology will link their technology for systems thinking with IBM Watson and the Encyclopedia of Life at the Smithsonian. Scientists will then be able to use the information to create their own models about the environment and efficiently test them.\nThe project is one of\n10 \u201cBig Data Spokes\u201d announced by the National Science Foundation (NSF) . The NSF\u2019s $10 million initiative was created to improve the ability to solve the nation\u2019s most pressing challenges with the use of big data. The Georgia Tech, Smithsonian and IBM \u201cSpoke\u201d will receive $1 million from NSF. IBM will also provide in-kind gifts. Overall, the project engages 24 researchers from 14 institutions from academia, industry, government and non-profit organizations.\n\u201cEnvironmental sustainability is a growing concern for our country. Scientists and citizens needbetter tools and data to rapidly build and test conceptual models of ecological phenomena,\u201d said Ashok Goel, a Georgia Tech professor who is the principal investigator of the collaboration. \u201cWe want to empower them.\u201d\nThe Encyclopedia of Life (EOL), headquartered at the Smithsonian Institution, is an online, open-access database that gathers information about all biological species on Earth.\n\u201cModelers tell us that predicting an ecosystem's response to global changes requires knowledge of things like the mass of an algal cell, the lifespan of a copepod and the ecological partners of a reef-building coral,\u201d said Bob Corrigan, EOL\u2019s director of operations. \u201cEOL is surfacing, structuring and sharing hundreds of years of careful measurements by generations of biologists. Combining these assets with the capabilities of Georgia Tech and IBM will give scientists and students alike the ability to model and study our biosphere at scales that have not been possible before.\u201d\nAs part of the Spoke project, Watson Developer Cloud\u2019s Language and Vision services will be trained to deeply understand the specialized ecology domain represented in the EOL webpages and images.\n\u201cUnlocking all of this unstructured information from the Smithsonian\u2019s Encyclopedia of Life, bringing it into the context of other relevant structured knowledge, and making it available for further human and machine reasoning holds tremendous potential,\u201d said Lisa Amini, director, Cognitive Computing: Knowledge and Reasoning at IBM Research. \u201cThe possibilities are endless.\u201d\nUsers will then take that information and plug it into Georgia Tech\u2019s Modeling & Inquiry Learning Application (MILA) system. The interactive tool allows scientists to rapidly generate conceptual models, evaluates them through simulation and provides results.\nThe NSF grant will allow the team to seamlessly link EOL, Watson and MILA. The goal is to build a working system that enables ecological modeling by early 2018.\n\u201cYou can have all the information in the world, but if you can\u2019t easily find the knowledge, you can\u2019t build a model,\u201d said Goel. \u201cAnd if you can\u2019t build a good model, the information is useless. Our project uses artificial intelligence to address these concerns.\u201d\nThe Big Data Spokes program is supported and organized by the NSF\u2019s Big Data Regional Innovation Hubs (BD Hubs). The four Hubs (South, Northeast, Midwest and West) foster multi-sector collaborations among academia, industry and government. Georgia Tech co-leads the South Hub with the University of North Carolina.\n\"The Big Data Spokes advance the goals and regional priorities of each BD Hub, fusing the strengths of a range of institutions and investigators and applying them to problems that affect the communities and populations within their regions,\" said Jim Kurose, assistant director of NSF for Computer and Information Science and Engineering. \u201cWe are pleased to be making this substantial investment today to accelerate the nation\u2019s big data R&D innovation ecosystem.\u201d\nTwo other Spoke awards have ties to Georgia Tech. Santiago Grijalva, Georgia Power Distinguished Professor in the\nSchool of Electrical and Computer Engineering , will study smart grids using big data with Texas A&M. Gari Clifford, an Emory University associate professor with a joint appointment in the\nWallace H. Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering , will investigate how to use data from fitness trackers and environmental monitors to improve patient care.\n\u201cGeorgia Tech\u2019s inclusion in these awards is reflective of the Institute\u2019s unique breadth and depth of expertise that spans all areas of data science and data-driven discovery,\u201d said Srinivas Aluru, co-executive director of Georgia Tech\u2019s\nInstitute for Data Engineering and Science\nand principal investigator of the\nSouth Big Data Hub .\nAdditional Images\nContact\nJason Maderer\nNational Media Relations\nmaderer@gatech.edu\n404-660-2926\nEmail\nmaderer@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
