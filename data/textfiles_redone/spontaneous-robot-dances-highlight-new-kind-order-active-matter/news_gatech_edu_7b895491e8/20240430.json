This type of system \u2014 observed in bird flocks, bacterial colonies, and robot swarms \u2014 goes by the name \"active matter.\u201d\nAs reported in the January 1, 2021 issue of the journal\nScience , a team of physicists and engineers have proposed a new principle by which active matter systems can spontaneously order, without need for higher level instructions or even programmed interaction among the agents. And they have demonstrated this principle in a variety of systems, including groups of periodically shape-changing robots called \"smarticles\" \u2014 smart, active particles.\nThe theory, developed by Postdoctoral Researcher Pavel Chvykov at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology while a student of Prof. Jeremy England, who is now a researcher in the\nSchool of Physics\nat Georgia Institute of Technology, posits that certain types of active matter with sufficiently messy dynamics will spontaneously find what the researchers refer to as \"low rattling\" states.\n\u201cRattling is when matter takes energy flowing into it and turns it into random motion,\u201d England said. \u201cRattling can be greater either when the motion is more violent, or more random. Conversely, low rattling is either very slight or highly organized \u2014 or both. So, the idea is that if your matter and energy source allow for the possibility of a low rattling state, the system will randomly rearrange until it finds that state and then gets stuck there. If you supply energy through forces with a particular pattern, this means the selected state will discover a way for the matter to move that finely matches that pattern.\u201d\nTo develop their theory, England and Chvykov took inspiration from a phenomenon \u2014 dubbed thermophoresis \u2014 discovered by the Swiss physicist Charles Soret in the late 19th century. In Soret's experiments, he discovered that subjecting an initially uniform salt solution in a tube to a difference in temperature would spontaneously lead to an increase in salt concentration in the colder region \u2014 which corresponds to an increase in order of the solution.\nChvykov and England developed numerous mathematical models to demonstrate the low rattling principle, but it wasn't until they connected with\nDaniel Goldman , Dunn Family Professor of Physics at the Georgia Institute of Technology, that they were able to test their predictions.\nSaid Goldman, \"A few years back, I saw England give a seminar and thought that some of our smarticle robots might prove valuable to test this theory.\" Working with Chvykov, who visited Goldman's lab, Ph.D. students William Savoie and Akash Vardhan used three flapping smarticles enclosed in a ring to compare experiments to theory. The students observed that instead of displaying complicated dynamics and exploring the container completely, the robots would spontaneously self-organize into a few dances \u2014 for example, one dance consists of three robots slapping each other's arms in sequence. These dances could persist for hundreds of flaps, but suddenly lose stability and be replaced by a dance of a different pattern.\nAfter first demonstrating that these simple dances were indeed low rattling states, Chvykov worked with engineers at Northwestern University, Prof. Todd Murphey and Ph.D. student Thomas Berrueta, who developed more refined and better controlled smarticles. The improved smarticles allowed the researchers to test the limits of the theory, including how the types and number of dances varied for different arm flapping patterns, as well as how these dances could be controlled. \"By controlling sequences of low rattling states, we were able to make the system reach configurations that do useful work,\" Berrueta said. The Northwestern University researchers say that these findings may have broad practical implications for micro-robotic swarms, active matter, and metamaterials.\nAs England noted: \u201cFor robot swarms, it\u2019s about getting many adaptive and smart group behaviors that you can design to be realized in a single swarm, even though the individual robots are relatively cheap and computationally simple. For living cells and novel materials, it might be about understanding what the \u2018swarm\u2019 of atoms or proteins can get you, as far as new material or computational properties.\u201d\nThe study\u2019s Georgia Tech-based team includes Jeremy L. England, a Physics of Living Systems scientist who researches with the School of Physics; Dunn Family Professor Daniel Goldman; professor Kurt Wiesenfeld, and graduate students Akash Vardhan (Quantitative Biosciences) and William Savoie (School of Physics).
