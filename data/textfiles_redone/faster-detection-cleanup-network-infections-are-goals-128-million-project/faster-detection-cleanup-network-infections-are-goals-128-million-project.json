Using novel machine learning techniques that take advantage of large datasets, the researchers will develop ways to detect network infections within 24 hours \u2013 before invaders can do serious damage.\nThe technical goal for the new system, dubbed \u201cGnomon,\u201d is to detect changes in individual computer systems by analyzing suspicious network traffic that appears weeks or months before any evidence of malicious software \u2013 or malware \u2013 can be identified. As a proof-of-concept, the researchers will work with two major U.S. telecommunication companies and several petabytes of data in basic research aimed at detecting signals of malicious activity on their networks.\nFunded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the four-year award is part of the agency\u2019s Harnessing Autonomy for Countering Cyberadversary Systems (HACCS) program. Beyond rapid detection of infections, the project will also accelerate the cleanup after such infections, creating a clearer pathway in a process known as remediation.\n\u201cA compromise becomes a breach only if the original infection remains undetected long enough for the adversaries to do damage,\u201d said\nManos Antonakakis , an assistant professor in Georgia Tech\u2019s\nSchool of Electrical and Computer Engineering\nand the project\u2019s co-principal investigator. \u201cIf you look at the major breaches that have occurred, you see that the adversaries were in the systems for months. We want to identify them in a matter of hours to contain the infection before any real damage can be done.\u201d\nThe new techniques to be developed will address the realization that network attacks cannot be completely blocked by existing defenses and malware-based detection systems. Dynamic intelligence will be a key feature of the system, with the intent of creating a continuously-updated dossier of every address in IPv4 space.\n\u201cGnomon will search for illicit behavior in computer systems and network signals that indicate the start of an infection,\u201d said\nMichael Farrell , chief strategist at the\nGeorgia Tech Research Institute\n(GTRI), and the principal investigator on the program. \u201cWe\u2019ll use our experience with taking down botnets \u2013 networks of infected computers \u2013 to accelerate the detection and remediation process. It\u2019s imperative to evolve our view of the internetwork infrastructure at the same pace that the threat evolves.\u201d\nTo protect millions of computers on the networks of the two companies, the researchers must find ways to identify troubling behavior on individual IP addresses without endangering the privacy of individuals. Among the signs of trouble are communications with network locations known to house malicious activity. Such communication is necessary for malicious groups to control computers that have been compromised, and to move data stolen from them.\n\u201cIf you know where the infecting groups are located, you can very easily exclude most of the benign activities occurring on the network,\u201d Antonakakis said. \u201cWe need to be able to identify what has changed in computers throughout the network, understand why the change has happened, and determine whether that change can be attributed to benign or malicious activity. This is a groundbreaking new approach to network security that will require tremendous computing power and infrastructure.\u201d\nEver since the first viruses hit computers in the 1980s, cybersecurity has seen rapid evolution of detection and attack tactics. The success of Gnomon will likely drive adversaries to new attack techniques that may be more complex \u2013 and expensive \u2013 than existing activities. Making cyberattacks more costly to launch may reduce the profit from such activities, making them less attractive.\n\u201cIf we can clean up our networks faster and more efficiently, that will increase the cost of the attack, making the adversaries work harder,\u201d Antonakakis said. \u201cIf you raise the cost of an attack, the return on investment becomes smaller, while the risk of getting identified becomes higher. We would like to make the business of an attack so unprofitable and so risky for the adversaries that it will not make sense for them to conduct major operations in our networks.\u201d\nSuccess in developing new techniques with the first two telecommunication companies could open the door for scaling up Gnomon to other large networks in industry \u2013 and to U.S. government systems.\n\u201cNot only will deployment have an obvious benefit of improved hygiene for a significant portion of the U.S. internet infrastructure, but the public-private partnership will allow us to provide valuable feedback throughout the HACCS program on the sort of prototypes that will be necessary to have true business and mission impact in the real world,\u201d Farrell said. \u201cThe goals are very ambitious, but if we\u2019re successful, we\u2019ll be able to close the gap between an infection and remediation.\u201d\nThis program is the latest interdisciplinary research collaboration in cybersecurity at Georgia Tech, orchestrated by the\nInstitute for Information Security & Privacy\n(IISP). In addition to the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering and GTRI, the project will include Professor Brian Kennedy from Georgia Tech\u2019s School of Physics.\nAttribution of malicious cyber activity is an established research thrust at Georgia Tech, and this new contract builds on the early success of another Department of Defense (DoD) sponsored program to enhance attribution. The \u201c Rhamnousia \u201d program is now a $25.3 million contract being led by the same research team of Farrell and Antonakakis.\nThis material is based upon work supported by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) under contract number HR001118C0057.
