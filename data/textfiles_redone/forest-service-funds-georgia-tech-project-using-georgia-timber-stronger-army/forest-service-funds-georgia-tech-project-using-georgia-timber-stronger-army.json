Lauren Stewart, principal investigator on the project and an assistant professor in the Georgia Tech School of Civil and Environmental Engineering, and Russell Gentry, associate professor of architecture and civil engineering at Georgia Tech, saw the products \u2014 called cross-laminated timber, or CLT \u2014 as an ideal material for both constructing the short-term structures and creating a new market for Georgia\u2019s timber industry, the largest in the country.\n\u201cWith 22 million acres of working forests and a $32 billion economic impact, Georgia is blessed to be the No. 1 forestry state in the nation,\u201d said Andres Villegas, president and CEO of the Georgia Forestry Association. \u201cThat\u2019s why we at the Georgia Forestry Association are fully supportive of the research that Georgia Tech is doing with cross-laminated timber through the USDA\u2019s Wood Innovation Grant.\nThe Forest Service was looking for new uses for the CLT products, a wood panel typically consisting of three, five, or seven layers of lumber oriented at right angles to one another and then glued together.\nThe United States Department of Defense (DoD) spent more than $150 million over the past five years to design lightweight bunkers, or \u201cb-huts,\u201d for troops, which were an improvement from the tents typically used in combat. Georgia Tech is proposing CLT as a way to make the barracks more durable than previous building materials and ultimately safer for the troops.\nThe proposed CLT designs use less energy for heating and cooling, and the bunker will be far easier to disassemble and relocate. Both are key attributes for military housing, along with providing adequate protection for troops.\n\u201cNew markets for wood are critical for the future of our state\u2019s forests, and I can think of no better way to utilize our state\u2019s sustainable timber resources than in a way that benefits both our brave men and women in uniform and our state\u2019s economic vitality,\u201d Villegas said.\nThis project could be used worldwide, but the research team has proposed it for the southern United States. The wood they\u2019ll use will be mostly indigenous to the South, allowing for less harmful forest management and lower costs. The Georgia Tech team aims to motivate new fabrication facilities and spur economic development in the region.\n\u201cThis project is a unique opportunity to bring together the USFS, state agencies, military, and academia to advance the state of knowledge of CLT, promote forest health, and develop an application that can enhance troops\u2019 safety, security, and comfort,\u201d said Stewart.\nCLT has the potential for broader applications, too, as more and more designers look for low-carbon alternatives to traditional construction materials. The research team, along with the Georgia Forestry Foundation and WoodWorks Wood Products Council, hosted a symposium Sept. 26 at Georgia Tech on design and construction using mass timber from the Southeast. They highlighted hotels, mid- and high-rise buildings, and other projects around the country that are using wood products.\nStewart and Gentry were assisted by Ph.D. student Kathryn Sanborn, who\u2019s also a major in the U.S. Army. The three-year project\u2019s total cost will be nearly $375,000, including $125,000 that the Institute has contributed as a match. Other significant contributions to the project came from the Army Research Laboratory, West Point, and the Army Corps of Engineers.\nBy Jonathan Bowers\nAdditional Images\nContact\nlance.wallace@comm.gatech.edu\nEmail\nlance.wallace@comm.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
