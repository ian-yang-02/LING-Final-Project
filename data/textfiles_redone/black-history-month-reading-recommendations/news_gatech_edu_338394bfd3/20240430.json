We asked several avid readers to recommend books that explore race and identity, history and memory. These books range from the autobiography of a young Black woman finding her voice in the Jim Crow era to Stacey Abrams\u2019 guide to succeeding as an outsider.\nComing of Age in Mississippi: The Classic Autobiography of a Young Black Girl in the Rural South\nBy Anne Moody, Delta (Reprint edition 2004, first published in 1968)\n\u201cThis autobiography written by Anne Moody has special significance to me because the author was raised near my hometown and deeply revered, and I was very young when I first read her book. Moody describes what it was like to grow up as a young Black female activist in the era of Jim Crow. Her poignant memoir presents a personal and raw snapshot of the pre-civil rights era through her eyes starting from her upbringing in a family of sharecroppers and through the time when she graduated from Tougaloo College in Jackson. A defining moment in the book was when, in May 1963, Moody participated in a sit-in at Woolworth\u2019s lunch counter\n\u2014\nan event that was the most violently attacked sit-in in the 1960s. The book shows the fierce strength, intellect, passion, and resilience of this Black woman trailblazer during the civil rights movement.\u201d\n\u2014 Tiffiny Hughes-Troutman, director of the Center for Assessment, Referral, and Education (CARE)\nThe Venus Hottentot: Poems\nBy Elizabeth Alexander, University of Virginia Press (1990)\n\u201cMany people know Elizabeth Alexander as the 2008 inaugural poet, an accomplishment and poem (\u201cPraise Song for the Day\u201d) justly heralded. However, her debut collection,\nThe Venus Hottentot,\nis the work I recommend to anyone seeking sublime poetry and a rich lesson in Black history. The title poem focuses on Sarah (\u201cSaartjie\u201d) Baartman, an enslaved Khoikhoi woman brought from South Africa to Europe in the early 19th century, her body exhibited for the entertainment of fair-goers.\u00a0Baartman died at 26; her remains\n\u2014\nshe was dissected and displayed even after death\n\u2014\nwere not returned to South Africa until 2002.\u00a0Alexander\u2019s poem seeks to reveal the world from Baartman\u2019s perspective,\u00a0refusing any reductive portrayal of a victim and instead imagining\u00a0how Baartman would have asserted her humanity in a society that denied it.\u201d\n\u2014 Ruthie Yow,\u00a0service learning and partnerships specialist, Center for Serve-Learn-Sustain, and adjunct faculty, School of History and Sociology\nCaste: The Origins of Our Discontents\nBy Isabel Wilkerson, Random House (2020)\n\u201cIn a time where America\u2019s ghosts of racial animus are loose and tearing at the chords of our democracy,\nCaste\ngives us a framework to process why we\u2019re being haunted. Wilkerson outlines cultural adherence to social hierarchy and how easily and uncritically we can fall into those patterns. In the United States, the presumption that white people are the dominant caste destined to have dominion over Black people and all others is simply part of the national definition. Her charge is for us to see that pattern and be courageous enough to not accept cultural norms and traditions as immutable.\u201d\n\u2014 Kamau Bobb, senior director, Constellations Center for Equity in Computing, College of Computing\nNotes of a Native Son\nBy James Baldwin, Beacon Press (1955)\n\u201cI first became aware of James Baldwin when I was in college\n\u2014\nhaving grown up in a pretty sheltered white suburb, my reading for the first time about Black experience in America was through Baldwin.\u00a0There is something in his writing that grabbed me\n\u2014\ncomplexity, honesty and the ability to pull many into his writing and the issues he confronts:\u00a0race, sexuality, his father, the view from Europe. Reading it now, his work has remained timely and the honesty and courage he showed then is even more remarkable.\u201d\n\u2014 Steven W. McLaughlin, provost and executive vice president for Academic Affairs\nLose Your Mother: A Journey Along the Atlantic Slave Route\nBy Saidiya Hartman, Farrar Straus & Giroux (2006)\n\u201cHow do you mine an archive built upon the erasure of your history? How do you access a ruptured past? Hartman\u2019s memoir of her journey to Ghana\n\u2014\nthe site of \u2018more dungeons, prisons, and slave pens than any other country in West Africa\u2019\n\u2014\nis an intimate reckoning with the romance of origins. Unlike her close kin, whose present was too urgent to dwell in search of unnamed ancestors, Hartman confesses she thought \u2018the past was a country to which I could return.\u2019 But as she realizes and gorgeously renders: For the descendants of those who survived those earlier crossings, made without consent, \u2018the rupture was the story.\u2019\u201d\n\u2014Nihad M. Farooq, associate professor, School of Literature, Media, and Communication\nLead From the Outside: How to Build Your Future and Make Real Change\nBy Stacey Abrams, Macmillan (2018)\n\u201cStacey Abrams\u2019 mission in this book is to push all people to know that their greatness and worthiness is a birthright. She shows readers from any marginalized society how to become their own advocates. The book is for anyone who has faced challenges while pursuing their dreams, and it helps people left out of traditional ladders to success build one for themselves.\u201d\n\u2014 Etta Pittman, director of corporate development, College of Engineering\nAfro-Vegan: Farm-Fresh African, Caribbean, and Southern Flavors Remixed\nBy Bryant Terry, Ten Speed Press (2014)\n\u201cOne way to understand and gain deep appreciation for diverse cultures is through food. I offer this cookbook for our colleagues to experiment with and enjoy new flavors, spices, and colors. By the way, I rarely cook (my husband is way better at it than I am), but growing up in a West Indian home meant that I appreciate rich flavors from many cultures.\u201d\n\u2014 Kaye Husbands Fealing, dean and Ivan Allen Jr. Chair, Ivan Allen College of Liberal Arts\nThe Warmth of Other Suns: The Epic Story of America\u2019s Great Migration\nBy Isabel Wilkerson, Vintage (part of Penguin Random House), (2011)\n\u201cThe story of the Black migration within the United States is not something most people hear about. But Isabel Wilkerson masterfully tells the personal stories of three people and documents how families that reside in various parts of the North or West all come from a certain origination point in the South. The detailed stories begin in 1937 and move all the way to the present. This book opened my eyes to a little bit of history that most Black Americans aren\u2019t privy to or even think about. Even though it wasn\u2019t my family, I still felt a connectedness learning about the Black migration.\u00a0\u201c\n\u2014 Candice Bovian, program manager, Human Resources\nAdditional Images\nContact\nVictor Rogers\nInstitute Communications\nEmail\nvictor.rogers@comm.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
