Recent rollbacks of U.S. energy regulations may speed climate change, keep pollutants coming, and thus slow the fight against harmful ozone, according to\u00a0 a new study .\nCurrently, 30% of the U.S. population lives with ozone levels that exceed government health standards. Though past environmental regulations have vastly helped clean the air and put the U.S. on a positive trajectory to reduce pollutants \u2014 including ozone \u2014 policy rollbacks back could slow the progress and even reverse it, researchers from the Georgia Institute of Technology said.\nContinuing progress against ozone would pay off in better health and finances: The more ozone in the air, the more cases of respiratory illness and the higher the cost of meeting ozone level targets.\n\u201cAdditional ozone is tough to control technologically. The costs would be very high \u2014 tens of billions of dollars,\u201d said\u00a0 Ted Russell, a principal investigator on the study . \u201cIn the meantime, more people would die than otherwise would have.\u201d\nThe researchers\u00a0 published their results in\u00a0 One Earth,\u00a0 a\u00a0 Cell Press \u00a0journal on Friday, October 25, 2019 . The research was funded by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and by the National Science Foundation.\nThe study focuses on ground-level ozone people breathe to the detriment of their health, which should not be confused with the stratospheric ozone that protects us from the sun\u2019s harmful radiation.\nGoodbye environmental policies\nIn the last three years, various energy policies have been loosened, which should result in raised CO 2 \u00a0emissions and continued emissions of ozone precursors in years to come, the study\u2019s authors said.\n\u201cIncentives are being retired like production and investment tax credits, which have been very influential in solar and wind,\u201d said Marilyn Brown,\u00a0 a Regents Professor in Georgia Tech\u2019s School of Public Policy \u00a0and a principal investigator on the study. \u201cThe Investment Tax Credit gives a 30% tax reduction for investments in solar or wind farms or the purchase of solar rooftop panels by homeowners. The Production Tax Credit for utilities reduces tax liabilities by 23 cents for each kilowatt-hour of electricity generated by solar, wind or other renewable energy sources.\u201d\nBut one policy move in particular stands to keep more ingredients in the ozone-making cauldron: courts preventing the\u00a0 Clean Power Plan (CPP) \u00a0from going into effect and its replacement with the Trump administration\u2019s\u00a0 Affordable Clean Energy \u00a0(ACE) plan.\nACE, which also has not been implemented, would make it easier to continue burning fossil fuels, particularly coal, according to Brown, who was a member of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change,\u00a0 which received a Nobel Peace Prize in 2007 . CPP would have phased out those generators, reducing nitrogen oxide gases, or NO X , key reactants in the production of ozone.\n[Ready for graduate school?\u00a0 Here's how to apply to Georgia Tech. ]\nFrom NO X \u00a0to noxious\n\u201cThe major target of the CPP was CO 2 , but it had side effects on the reduction of NO X \u00a0because it shifted coal use to natural gas as well as to renewable sources,\u201d said\u00a0 Huizhong Shen , a postdoctoral researcher in Russell\u2019s group and one of the study\u2019s first authors.\nThe study modeled atmospheric chemistry that produces O 3 \u00a0around\u00a0 commonly predicted trajectories for greenhouse gas emissions \u00a0and climate change paired with anticipated pollutant emissions, particularly of NO X . The model\u2019s output depicted \u201cnon-attainment\u201d scores, which refer to the number of U.S. counties exceeding ozone targets and by how much.\nThe study modeled against official targets for ozone levels and in addition, against cleaner standards widely held to be attainable and much healthier for people. Models built around rolled-back environmental regulations and increased warming initially showed the current trajectory of progress against ozone levels continuing \u2014 but later reversing. Ozone levels then rose again, putting many more counties in non-attainment by or before 2050.\nNature\u2019s surprise ingredient\nAlongside human-produced NO X , nature contributes ozone-making ingredients that aren\u2019t harmful per se and often smell great, like the aroma of cut grass or of a pine tree. They are examples of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), of which nature produces hundreds.\nVOCs get into the air easily and react readily with other chemicals. The warmer the air and the sun, the more vegetation produces VOCs that meet with raised levels of NO X \u00a0emissions to make ozone. It forms downstream from emissions sources, making it hard to regulate.\n\u201cThere are no ozone emissions, just precursor emissions,\u201d Shen said. \u201cSo, emission controls for ozone have to mainly target NO X \u00a0emissions.\u201d\nFeedbacks and pile-ons\nKeeping ozone around as the world warms will be more than just the sum of power plants still emitting NO X \u00a0plus boosted VOC emissions.\n\u201cIf you heat up the air, it also speeds up photochemical reactions involved in ozone production,\u201d Shen said.\n\u201cOzone is a greenhouse gas, so it adds some climate change feedback, too,\u201d said Russell, who is\u00a0 Howard T. Tellepsen \u00a0Chair and Regents Professor in Georgia Tech\u2019s School of Civil and Environmental Engineering. \u201cYou can also have increased vegetation emissions of ammonia. Some of this goes on to form particulate matter, which is also harmful to the lungs.\u201d\nPassing the buck\nWhen coal-fired power plants emit NO X , the ozone strikes miles away.\n\u201cOzone can occur hundreds of miles away, so if controls are loosened in one state to save industry money there, a state downstream may have to spend even more to try to meet ozone targets. You transfer the problem and the costs,\u201d Russell said. \u201cMost U.S. cities are already not in attainment, and this will likely make it harder for them to get there.\u201d\nAlso READ the companion piece on policy:\u00a0 U.S. Carbon and Pollution Emissions Policies are \u2018Up in the Air\u2019\nThe co-authors of the research are: Yilin Chen, Yufei Li, Yongtao Hu, Mehmet Odman, Momei Qin, Abiola Lawal, Gertrude Pavur, and Marilyn Brown of Georgia Tech; Zhihong Chen of Georgia Tech and the Chinese University of Hong Kong; Jhih-Shyang Shih and Dallas Burtraw of Resources for the Future; Lucas Henneman of Harvard University; Shuai Shao and Charles Driscoll of Syracuse University; and Haofei Yu of the University of Central Florida.
