(Photo by Christopher Moore)\nMar 15, 2018\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nInduja Kannan is majoring in finance, but that doesn\u2019t mean she knows how to manage her own finances.\nTo fix that she signed up for Georgia Tech\u2019s\nnew personal finance course . The one-credit elective shows students how to set a budget and manage expenses. It includes a focus on investing at an early age.\n\u201cI really hadn\u2019t put a lot of consideration into my own finances and thinking about everything that goes into setting my budget and balancing my current expenses and putting away for the future,\u201d said Kannan, a third-year student. \u201cI just wasn\u2019t aware of everything I didn\u2019t know.\u201d\nIncreased awareness is just one lesson students get from the class, said Jonathan Clarke, associate professor of finance in the Scheller College of Business.\nWhile most students wanted to jump to the sections on investing, Clarke structured the course to open with fundamental lessons on budgeting, setting financial goals and managing debt.\nClarke has experience teaching personal finance. He\u2019s taught the subject for the National Football League and developed the\nWall Street on West Peachtree\nsummer program for high school students.\nThe elective is open to students from all majors.\n\u201cI thought I could design a course for Tech students that touched on all of the basics of personal finance,\u201d said Clarke, associate dean of undergraduate programs in the Scheller College. \u201cIt\u2019s important material. Being financially secure can lower stress and improve mental health.\u201d\nSteven Girardot, associate vice provost for undergraduate education, approached Clarke about developing the class after hearing students wanted more information on this subject. Financial literacy among students is also a priority of\nComplete College Georgia , he noted.\nDuring a recent class, they discussed the volatile stock market and Clarke advised students not to panic. He reminded them to look at what will happen over the course of 50 years, not five days.\nDuring other classes they weighed the questions that should be asked when determining whether it\u2019s better to buy or rent a home. They reviewed car buying tips, such as negotiating the car purchase price and trade-in value separately. They discussed retirement investments and how to choose a health insurance plan.\nJordan Bergenfeld, a fifth-year mechanical engineering major, signed up for the course after asking his advisor about a class on investments.\n\u201cI\u2019m getting job offers and I don\u2019t know how to evaluate them when they\u2019re talking about stock options and other benefits,\u201d he said. \u201cI really just want to make sure I\u2019m doing what I can to have a good financial future. I\u2019ve already recommended this class to a bunch of friends.\u201d\nThe class will be offered again this summer, Clarke said. He\u2019s exploring ways to offer the class online and to make it a permanent fixture at Georgia Tech.\nApurva Kasam, a fourth-year business administration major, will graduate this fall and appreciated learning how to balance expenses and savings.\n\u201cThis should be a required class for everyone,\u201d she said. \u201cGeorgia Tech does a good job preparing us for our careers. This class is about giving us the personal preparation for our lives.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nContact\nLaura Diamond\nMedia Relations\u00a0 laura.diamond@gatech.edu\n404-660-2927\nEmail\nlaura.diamond@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
