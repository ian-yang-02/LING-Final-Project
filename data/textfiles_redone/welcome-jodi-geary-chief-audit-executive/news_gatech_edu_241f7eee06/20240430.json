She joined the Institute after 16 years with KPMG, an audit, tax, and advisory firm.\nGeary is new to Georgia Tech, but she isn\u2019t new to higher education.\n\u201cAt KPMG I had many years of experience with clients in the higher education, not-for-profit, and government sectors,\u201d Geary said. \u201cI knew that when I transitioned from the firm I wanted to go into higher education. And, being in Atlanta, I wanted to go to a top-notch school. Some of the things that attracted me to Tech are its research arm and the fact that it is a large institution but still has a community feel.\u201d\nFrank Neville, Tech\u2019s senior vice president for Strategic Initiatives, chief of staff, and chair of the national search that yielded Geary, said she was the right person for the position.\n\"Jodi brings a wealth of experience to Georgia Tech and we are pleased to welcome her to the Yellow Jacket community,\u201d said Neville. \u201cHer breadth of perspective, her excellent communications skills, and her track record of leadership will serve her well in her role here. We are excited to be able to attract such a skilled and experienced professional to lead our Internal Audit team and I am confident that she will be a great asset to Georgia Tech.\nBefore KPMG, Geary was an auditor with the Comptroller of the Treasury of the state of Tennessee. She grew up in Morristown, Tennessee, outside of Knoxville, and earned a Bachelor of Sciences in accounting from Tennessee Technological University in Cookeville. She is a certified public accountant in Georgia and New Hampshire, and a certified government financial manager. She has been married to Alex, her college sweetheart, for 23 years. They have a daughter, Alli, who is a first-year student at the University of Georgia, and a son, Brady, a high school sophomore.\nAt Georgia Tech, her job is to oversee the Internal Audit Department.\n\u201cI think the Tech community will see I am heavily involved in every audit,\u201d she said. \u201cI also interact with the Legal Department and their investigations team, as well as reaching out to perform various advisory and consulting engagements across campus.\u201d\nGeary said that in addition to performing audits, the Audit Department provides guidance on the implementation of new policies and procedures and acts to proactively address issues that could arise.\n\u201cWe\u2019re actually there to try to prevent people from getting into trouble,\u201d she said. \u201cThe audit reports are crafted more or less to identify gaps in internal control structures or in the way some operating procedures are happening. The purpose is to identify those gaps so you can correct them and not run into issues down the road.\u201d\nAfter only a few weeks at Tech, Geary is starting to identify challenges and opportunities for her department.\n\u201cI see opportunities for the department to offer more advisory services. I would like to hire an IT audit specialist to look at how our systems work together or don't work together, and what controls are put in place over those systems such as access controls, change management, and disaster recovery,\u201d she said. \u201cThe challenge is going to be getting the funding, given the current economic environment.\u201d\nGeary said that her new colleagues have helped ease the stress of starting a new job during the coronavirus pandemic.\n\u201cI\u2019ve had a phenomenal transition team,\u201d she said. \u201cMelissa Hall, who was filling my position in the interim, came in to meet with me, and we speak almost every day. Everyone in my department has jumped in to get me up to speed. Someone from the University System of Georgia talked me through the new auditing software that was installed last spring. And, my administrative assistant has been setting up meetings all over campus for me to meet people. Some of them were on my interview panel, so instead of meeting them it\u2019s more of a \u2018get reacquainted\u2019 type of conversation. It\u2019s been very nice.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nContact\nVictor Rogers\nInstitute Communications\nEmail\nvictor.rogers@comm.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
