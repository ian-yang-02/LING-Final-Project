She recently had a double replacement knee surgery and depended on a cane chair to get around.\nHer walking cane came with an attached folding seat, but McMichael questioned its sturdiness. The seat was small and uncomfortable. The legs wobbled.\nMcMichael, a student in the George W. Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering, thought he could design something better. Enter The Capable Cane, a walking cane that unfolds into a portable, stable chair.\nHis invention is one of six competing for Georgia Tech\u2019s 2017\nInVenture Prize . \u00a0The annual contest encourages and supports interest in innovation and entrepreneurship by rewarding students with cash prizes for inventions that have the potential to solve the world\u2019s problems. The finale takes place Wednesday night at the Ferst Center for the Arts.\n\u201cThe idea for the Capable Cane came to me about a year and a half ago, but it was the InVenture Prize that gave me some motivation to get it done,\u201d said McMichael, who is from Atlanta.\nHe set out to create a walking cane that included a full-sized, four-legged chair. He wanted the chair to include a seatback and armrests, knowing his mother-in-law didn\u2019t have much leg strength to get up and sit down.\nHis big challenge was how to design the seat so it could collapse into the cane. He struggled for months until a solution hit him in class.\n\u201cSomeone in class had a large umbrella wrapped up and it inspired me,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought \u2018Why not wrap it?\u2019 After all, everyone knows how to use an umbrella.\u201d\nHe made the seat and back from rip stop nylon that could wrap around the base of the cane when not in use. He worked on the device in the Invention Studio, using machines to cut and fasten the aluminum alloy parts, which makes the cane light and study.\nAbout 6.5 million people in the United State use an assistive device, including canes.\nMcMichael took the prototype to two senior citizen homes to gauge their interest. Residents suggested he add a height adjustment to make the cane and chair taller and shorter, a design modification he plans to add eventually. The senior citizens also requested the ability to customize the seat fabric to match their personal style.\nAs for his mother-in-law, she\u2019s a fan.\n\u201cShe\u2019s given me feedback every step along the way,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s ready to try it out.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nGeorgia Tech's InVenture Prize\nContact\nLaura Diamond\nMedia Relations\n404-894-6016\n@LauraRDiamond\nEmail\nlaura.diamond@gatech.edu\nAdditional information\nThe winning InVenture Prize team will take home $20,000 and represent Georgia Tech in the annual ACC InVenture Prize, taking place on campus much March 31.\nThe second-place team earns $10,000.\nBoth first- and second-place finishers will receive free U.S. patent filings by Georgia Tech\u2019s Office of Technology Licensing and a spot in Georgia Tech\u2019s startup accelerator program, Flashpoint.\nA $5,000 People\u2019s Choice Award will go to the fans\u2019 favorite invention.
