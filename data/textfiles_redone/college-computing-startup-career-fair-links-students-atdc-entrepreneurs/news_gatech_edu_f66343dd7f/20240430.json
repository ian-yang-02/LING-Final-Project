The College of Computing and the\u00a0 Advanced Technology Development Center \u00a0(ATDC) partnered to give students an idea of opportunities available to them with respect to full- or part-time jobs or internships at ATDC Select and Graduate companies, said Joy Hymel, campus outreach catalyst at ATDC. As campus outreach catalyst for ATDC\u2019s Campus Connect program, Hymel is the liaison between the Select companies\u2019 needs and Tech\u2019s resources and expertise. Startups given the ATDC \u201cSelect\u201d designation are considered the most ready to be successful and viable businesses. The fair featured 17 Select companies, including\u00a0 Predikto ,\u00a0 Clean Hands Safe Hands ,\u00a0and\u00a0 Sideqik . Two ATDC Graduate companies,\u00a0 Patientco \u00a0and\u00a0 CardioMEMS , also participated. \u201cSideqik believes in stewarding a portion of our time to help grow the next generation of\u00a0entrepreneurs\u00a0and help fill the skills gap that often occurs between the classroom and a student\u2019s desired full-time position,\u201d said Kurt Uhlir, Sideqik\u2019s founder and chief executive. \u201cCampus Connect provides a\u00a0focused way for us to connect with those students looking to make an impact and help them reach their goals.\u201d In addition to the College of Computing, students from Tech\u2019s School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Startup Exchange and Startup House participated in the fair. The event is held twice a year and is offered as an exclusive benefit to ATDC Select and Graduate companies, Hymel said. ATDC, an economic development program\u00a0of\u00a0Tech\u2019s Enterprise Innovation Institute, is one of the nation\u2019s oldest and largest university-based technology startup incubators.\nContact\nP\u00e9ralte C.
