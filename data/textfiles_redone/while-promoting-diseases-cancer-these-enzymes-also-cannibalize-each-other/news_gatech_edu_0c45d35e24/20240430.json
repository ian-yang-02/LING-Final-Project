This study is a new beginning to understanding them.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nEmail\nManu Platt stands outside his lab at Georgia Tech.

A new study reveals details of their mutual foils in the hopes that these behaviors can be leveraged to fight the enzymes\u2019 disease potential.\nThe bandits are cathepsins, enzymes that normally dispose of unneeded protein in our cells. But in unhealthy scenarios, cathepsins can promote illnesses like cancer, atherosclerosis, and sickle cell disease. Many experimental drugs that inhibit them, while effective, have failed due to side effects that could not be well explained, so researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology abandoned the common focus on single cathepsins to model three key cathepsins as a system.\nThe researchers found that the cathepsins, denoted by the letters K, L, and S, not only degrade extracellular structures \u2013 proteins outside of cells that support cells \u2013 but also cannibalize, distract, and deactivate each other. Cathepsins are proteases, enzymes that degrade proteins, and since the cathepsins are themselves proteins, they can degrade each other, too.\nCathepsin\u00a0 Three Stooges\n\u201cAuto-digestion is my personal favorite. Think about it: You take a group of cathepsin Ks, and they eat each other. Why? Because they\u2019re just closer to each other than to what they would otherwise eat,\u201d said the study\u2019s principal investigator Manu Platt,\u00a0 an associate professor in the Wallace H. Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering at Georgia Tech and Emory University .\nIn disease, cathepsins appear to be like\u00a0 The \u00a0 Three Stooges \u00a0in a porcelain shop, tearing the shop down while they torment each other. As a result, early on, when the Georgia Tech researchers tried to influence a single cathepsin in the group, outcomes were puzzling, and the researchers felt they might be onto something relevant to past mysterious drug failures.\nThrough lab experiments and mathematical calculations, they arrived at a computational model that showed how single influences ripple through the system. They published the\u00a0 model as a tool online \u00a0that other researchers can use to jigger the three cathepsins in group settings, their levels of available targets, and inhibitor chemicals. The tool contrasts cathepsin bungling with cathepsin effectiveness.\nThe researchers publish their research results in the journal the\u00a0 Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences \u00a0in the week of January 20, 2020. The research, which took a systems biology approach, was funded by the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health.\nQ&A\nHow do cathepsins go wrong?\nThe three cathepsins in this study are best known for their activity in cell organelles called lysosomes under healthy conditions, where they work like molecular woodchippers to cut protein down to amino acids.\n\u201cThey also serve functions in specific cell types, such as\u00a0 cathepsin S \u00a0helping the immune system to recognize what to attack and what not to,\u201d Platt said.\n\u201cProblems happen when cathepsins get overexpressed and end up in the wrong places. They\u2019re crazy powerful and degrade the structural proteins elastin and collagen that make up arteries, tendons, the endometrium, and many tissue structures.\u201d\n\u201cIn healthy settings,\u00a0 cathepsin K \u00a0breaks down old bone to recycle calcium. But when breast cancer comes, those cancerous cells make cathepsin K to destroy collagen around the tumor. And that allows the cells to escape and metastasize to the bone,\u201d Platt said.\n[Ready for graduate school?\u00a0 Here's how to apply to Georgia Tech. ]\nHow is this research relevant to drug development?\n\u201cI study cathepsins in illnesses like tendinopathy, endometriosis, atherosclerosis, cancer, and sickle cell disease,\u201d Platt said. \u201cSo, having a drug on the market to handle cathepsins would be a big deal.\u201d\n\u201cMany cathepsin inhibitor drugs that have failed clinical trials were very finely targeted but caused big side effects, and some of those cathepsin inhibitor drugs did not even cross-react with other cathepsins they were not targeting \u2013 which is usually a good thing \u2013 so the cause of the side effects was a mystery,\u201d Platt said. \u201cBy modeling a system of cathepsins, we think we have a good start toward uncovering that mystery.\u201d\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t know how these cathepsins are working with and against each other in complex systems, similar to how they exist in our bodies, then we are going to have a hard time getting anything into the medicine cabinet to inhibit them.\u201d\nThe study floats ideas on new approaches to drug research. For example, cathepsin S could be strategically boosted in situations where it is not the culprit to break down cathepsins K and L.\nWhat can other researchers expect from the online model?\n\u201cThey can set up their own experiments and make predictions, including what inhibitors will do, so they can test inhibitors at varying strengths in this system,\u201d Platt said. \u201cThey can ask questions that they can\u2019t answer yet experimentally then test the model\u2019s predictions in the lab.\u201d\nThe model processes varying inputs into resulting changes in cathepsin levels and outcomes of degradation and indicates whether they have been deactivated or demolished. Scenarios can be exported as a report and a data spreadsheet.\nAlso read:\u00a0 Chemical Octopus Catches Sneaky Cancer Clues, Trace Glycoproteins\nLike this article?\u00a0 Get our email newsletter here.\nThese researchers coauthored the study: Meghan Ferrall-Fairbanks, a former graduate research assistant in Platt\u2019s lab; and Chris Kieslich, a former research engineer in Platt\u2019s lab.
