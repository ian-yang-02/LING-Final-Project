The other grew out of experience with one of the trickiest parts of military medical airlifts.\nNow both are among the\n10 finalists in the Collegiate Inventors Competition\norganized by the National Inventors Hall of Fame. Two teams of Georgia Tech students and recent graduates will present their ideas in October to a panel of Hall of Fame inductees and officials from the United States Patent and Trademark Office.\nOne will detail a medical device that automatically ties 12 sutures during a prostatectomy. The other is a stabilizer to make emergency medical airlifts safer for patients and helicopter crews.\n\u201cCompetitions like this are incredible learning opportunities for us, and the Collegiate Inventors Competition, in particular, constitutes an unmatched opportunity to receive feedback about both the design of our device and how to successfully take it to market,\u201d said Rachel Mann, who finished her Georgia Tech biomedical engineering degree in May and helped create the SecURO suturing device. \u201cWe take great pride in representing Georgia Tech and the Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering on a national stage.\u201d\nSimplifying Sutures\nMann and Fall 2018 graduate Bailey (Klee) Eaton worked with fourth-year undergraduate Jared Brown to develop a device that standardizes the sutures doctors use when they remove a patient\u2019s prostate. With the simple pull of a trigger, the device automatically rotates and stitches together two tube-like structures to reconnect the bladder and urethra.\nThe device, which helps reduce postoperative complications, started as Eaton and Mann\u2019s senior design project a year ago.\n\u201cWe were sponsored by the Mayo Clinic, and they asked us to improve the prostatectomy surgery, specifically the part of the procedure that requires meticulous suturing around the urethra,\u201d Eaton said. \u201cSecURO is a rotational suturing device that does just that.\u201d\nThe team continues to refine their design and currently is working to scale down and optimize their prototype for mass production. And they\u2019re no strangers to invention competitions: They\nwon the advanced health care track at the Johns Hopkins Healthcare Design Competition\na few months ago.\n\u201cThe preparation for these competitions helped us refine our pitch, and, by now, we know it frontwards, backwards, and sideways,\u201d Brown said. \u201cSeeing other student projects and startups has also helped us iterate on our pitch over time because we have seen what works and what doesn\u2019t.\u201d\nHoisting Help\nComputer science master\u2019s student Mahdi Al-Husseini brought both parts of his life together for the other Georgia Tech invention in the finals.\nAlongside his first-year roommates Joshua Barnett and Anthony Chen, Al-Husseini developed a stabilization system for helicopter hoist operations \u2014 the rescue or medical evacuation procedures that usually happen under the worst of circumstances.\n\u201cPatients often must be evacuated over water, above sloping terrain, and in hostile territory,\u201d said Al-Husseini, a U.S. Army officer and helicopter pilot who flies medical evacuation missions. \u201cHelicopter hoist operations are some of the most dangerous work Army aviation crews perform.\u201d\nUsually, aircrews must lower a stretcher-like basket called a litter to carry the patient. Then the patient is lifted through the air to the helicopter cabin. But it\u2019s no simple task.\n\u201cThe rotor blades of a hovering helicopter force a turbulent downwind deflection of air known as downwash. Downwash, in conjunction with low-wind conditions and poor helicopter control, can cause a hoisted load to rotate quickly \u2014 up to several full revolutions per second,\u201d Al-Husseini said. \u201cIn addition to psychological trauma and disorientation, uncontrolled spin like that can result in physical injury or even death.\u201d\nThe team\u2019s solution is the Stabilizing Aerial Loads Utility System, or SALUS (pronounced SAL-us, and derived from the Latin word for safety), a reaction-wheel stabilizer that stops the litter from spinning out of control. They\u2019re close to signing a research and development agreement with the military for a battery of tests, including on a live UH-60 Blackhawk helicopter.\nThe team has been working from opposite sides of the continent since they all finished their bachelor\u2019s degrees at Georgia Tech in 2018. Barnett and Chen are pursuing doctorates at Stanford University while Al-Husseini, who earned bachelor\u2019s degrees in biomedical engineering and public policy, works full-time in the Army and finishes his master\u2019s degree in Atlanta. No matter; they\u2019ve developed a proof of concept and five ever-more-advanced prototypes in a year.\n\u201cWe developed SALUS to allow hoist operators to focus their efforts on the already risky process of extracting a patient,\u201d Al-Husseini said. \u201cSoldiers complete their missions with valor knowing that, should they be wounded, medical evacuation crews will expedite their treatment and facilitate their return home. SALUS seeks to support those efforts as seamlessly as possible.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nCollegiate Inventors Competition\nGeorgia Tech Capstone Design\nContact\nJoshua Stewart\n404.894.6016\nEmail\njstewart@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
