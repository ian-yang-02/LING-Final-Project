In at least one area of materials chemistry, the answer may be yes \u2014 but only 80 percent of the time.\nThe replicability of results from scientific studies has become a major source of concern in the research community, particularly in the social sciences and biomedical sciences. But many researchers in the fields of engineering and the hard sciences haven\u2019t felt the same level of concern for independent validation of their results.\nA new study that compared the results reported in thousands of papers published about the properties of metal organic framework (MOF) materials \u2013 which are prominent candidates for carbon dioxide adsorption and other separations \u2013 suggests the replicability problem should be a concern for materials researchers, too.\nOne in five studies of MOF materials examined by researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology were judged to be \u201coutliers,\u201d with results far beyond the error bars normally used to evaluate study results. The thousands of research papers yielded just nine MOF compounds for which four or more independent studies allowed appropriate comparison of results.\n\u201cAt a fundamental level, I think people in materials chemistry feel that things are reproducible and that they can count on the results of a single study,\u201d said\nDavid Sholl , a professor and John F. Brock III School Chair in the Georgia Tech\nSchool of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering . \u201cBut what we found is that if you pull out any experiment at random, there\u2019s a one in five chance that the results are completely wrong \u2013 not just slightly off, but not even close.\u201d\nWhether the results can be more broadly applied to other areas of materials science awaits additional studies, Sholl said. The results of the study, which was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy, were published November 28 in the ACS journal\nChemistry of Materials.\nSholl chose MOFs because they\u2019re an area of interest to his lab \u2013 he develops models for the materials \u2013 and because the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E) had already assembled a database summarizing the properties of MOFs. Co-authors Jongwoo Park and Joshua Howe used meta-analysis techniques to compare the results of single-component adsorption isotherm testing \u2013 how much CO 2\ncan be removed at room temperature.\nThat measurement is straightforward and there are commercial instruments available for doing the tests. \u201cPeople in the community would consider this to be an almost foolproof experiment,\u201d said Sholl, who is also a Georgia Research Alliance Eminent Scholar in Energy Sustainability.\nThe researchers considered the results definitive when they had four or more studies of a given MOF at comparable conditions.\nThe implications for errors in materials science may be less than in other research fields. But companies could use the results of a just one or two studies to choose a material that appear to be more efficient, and in other cases, researchers unable to replicate an experiment may simply move on to another material.\n\u201cThe net result is non-optimal use of resources at the very least,\u201d Sholl said. \u201cAnd any report using one experiment to conclude a material is 15 or 20 percent better than another material should be viewed with great skepticism, as we cannot be very precise on these measurements in most cases.\u201d\nWhy the variability in results? Some MOFs can be finicky, quickly absorbing moisture that affect adsorption, for instance. The one-in-five \u201coutliers\u201d may be a result of materials contamination.\n\u201cOne of the materials we studied is relatively simple to make, but it\u2019s unstable in an ambient atmosphere,\u201d Sholl explained. \u201cExactly what you do between making it in the lab and testing it will affect the properties you measure. That could account for some of what we saw, and if a material is that sensitive, we know it\u2019s going to be a problem in practical use.\u201d\nOther factors that may prevent replication include details that were inadvertently left out of a methods description \u2013 or that the original scientists didn\u2019t realize were relevant. That could be as simple as the precise atmosphere in which the material is maintained, or the materials used in the apparatus producing the MOFs.\nSholl hopes the paper will lead to more replication of experiments so scientists and engineers can know if their results really are significant.\n\u201cAs a result of this, I think my group will look at all reported data in a more nuanced way, not necessarily suspecting it is wrong, but thinking about how reliable that data might be,\u201d he said. \u201cInstead of thinking about data as a number, we need to always think about it as a number plus a range.\u201d\nSholl suggests that more reporting of second, third or fourth efforts to replicate an experiment would help raise the confidence of data on MOF materials properties. The scientific publishing system doesn\u2019t currently provide much incentive for reporting validation, though Sholl hopes that will change.\nHe also feels the issue needs to be discussed within all parts of the scientific community, though he admits that can lead to \u201cuncomfortable\u201d conversations.\n\u201cWe have presented this study a few times at conferences, and people can get pretty defensive about it,\u201d Sholl said. \u201cEverybody in the field knows everybody else, so it\u2019s always easier to just not bring up this issue.\u201d\nAnd, of course, Sholl would like to see others replicate the work he and his research team did. \u201cIt will be interesting to see if this one-in-five number holds up for other types of experiments and materials,\u201d he added. \u201cThere are other certainly other areas of materials chemistry where this kind of comparison could be done.\u201d\nThis research was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy through grant DE-FE0026433 and by the Center for Understanding and Control of Acid Gas-Induced Evolution of Materials for Energy (UNCAGE-ME), an Energy Frontier Research Center funded by U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Basic Energy Sciences under Award #DE-SC0012577.
