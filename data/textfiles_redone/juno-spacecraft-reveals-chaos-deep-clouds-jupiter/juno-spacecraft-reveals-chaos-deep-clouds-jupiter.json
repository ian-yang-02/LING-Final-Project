In a paper that now appears in the journal\nScience , the researchers describe a chaotic scene of ammonia, cyclones and bands of storms that extend far deeper beneath the planet\u2019s clouds than previously thought.\nJuno has been circling Jupiter since entering its orbit on July 4, 2016, and has completed six passes of the planet so far. The paper outlines findings from Juno\u2019s first pole-to-pole orbit on August 27, when the basketball court-sized spacecraft skimmed within nearly 2,000 miles of Jupiter\u2019s equatorial cloud tops.
