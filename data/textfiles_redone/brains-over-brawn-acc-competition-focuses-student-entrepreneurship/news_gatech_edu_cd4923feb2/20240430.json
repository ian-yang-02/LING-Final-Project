The contest will reward undergraduate students with cash prizes for innovations that aim to solve the world\u2019s big problems. The inaugural competition will be held April 5 and 6 at the Georgia Institute of Technology. Teams of students representing each of the ACC\u2019s 15 universities will pitch their inventions or startups before a live audience and a panel of judges. The competition is sponsored by the ACC Academic Consortium, which supports academic initiatives among member universities. The tournament taps into the entrepreneurial spirit growing at college campuses. It is modeled after Georgia Tech\u2019s InVenture Prize, which started in 2009 to leverage the maker culture and encourage students to push their ideas even further. \"The Inventure Prize at Georgia Tech has proven to be a unique tool to promote educational objectives like creativity, innovation, and entrepreneurship, all within a fun and friendly competitive environment that attracts participants and observers alike,\u201d said Rafael L. Bras, Georgia Tech\u2019s provost and executive vice president for Academic Affairs. \u201cThe ACC provosts agreed that we shared the same educational objectives, and the InVenture format could serve all of us. I am proud that we will be the first to host the conference and share our expertise in what hopefully will be a popular new 'academic sport' for the benefit and enjoyment of ACC students and fans.\" During the two-day program, students will tour Atlanta incubators and accelerators and meet with entrepreneurs and venture capitalists. Representatives from each college will share strategies their campuses use to foster innovation, said Chris Reaves, director of Undergraduate Research and Student Innovation at Georgia Tech and one of the contest organizers. \u201cThe time is right to help students who have the energy, resources, and technology to grow the next business,\u201d Reaves said. \u201cThis competition will increase the chance of success for all the teams.\u201d Teams will be judged in four areas \u2014 entrepreneurship; business model; quality of the idea; and the probability of becoming a successful business. First-place wins $15,000 and the second place finisher earns $10,000. A $5,000 People\u2019s Choice Award goes to the fans\u2019 favorite, which will be determined by online and text voting during the televised final round. The 15 participating colleges are: Boston College, Clemson University, Duke University, Florida State University, Georgia Institute of Technology, North Carolina State, University of Notre Dame, Syracuse University, University of Louisville, University of Miami, University of North Carolina \u2013 Chapel Hill, University of Pittsburgh, University of Virginia, Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University, and Wake Forest University.\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nACC InVenture Prize\nThe InVenture Prize web site\nContact\nLaura Diamond\u00a0 Georgia Tech Media Relations 404-894-6016\nEmail\nlaura.diamond@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
