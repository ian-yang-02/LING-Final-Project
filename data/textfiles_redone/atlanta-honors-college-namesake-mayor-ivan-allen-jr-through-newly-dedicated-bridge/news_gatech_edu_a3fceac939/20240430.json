Cox Foundation \u00a0to fund the project with hopes of helping younger generations understand Mayor Allen\u2019s role in forging a new era in Atlanta, pushing forward civil rights for African Americans and creating the foundations for the modern city we know today. Among those quoted in the bridge exhibit is\u00a0 former Ivan Allen College Dean Jacqueline Royster .\nPart of Atlanta's extensive Path system, the newly dedicated Ivan Allen Jr. Legacy Bridge\u00a0connects\u00a0Marietta Street and the Westside\u00a0symbolizing\u00a0Mayor Allen\u2019s example in risking everything to break down the barriers of Jim Crow laws, and revitalize Atlanta as a city where all its citizens could flourish together. The bridge was designed by Mad Dworschak, Signature Design, and Perez Planning + Design who spent months researching Mayor Allen's life and accomplishments.\nA series of placards runs the length of the bridge under colorful ribbons, which creates a linear timeline for visitors as they walk by. The story is divided into several themes including Allen's character, his civil rights record, his business pragmatism, his vision for the city's cultural institutions, and his collaboration with other leaders.\nThe bridge also offers onlookers a multimedia experience as the placards include mobile hyperlinks and QR codes that visitors can scan with their smart phone to access supplementary video content. The colors used in the display mirror Mayor Allen's story, beginning on the Marietta Street side of the bridge with traditional reds, white, and blues to signify when Mayor Allen took office. They morph into an intense palette of varied bright colors to signify the radical change of the 1960s and Atlanta's transition into an international city under Mayor Allen's leadership.\nThe Ivan Allen Jr. Legacy Bridge is now one of many remembrances of Mayor Allen and his impact on Atlanta that can be found around the city. Georgia Tech's Ivan Allen College of Liberal Arts is the steward of the Allen Legacy which underpins the school's research, teaching, and public engagement.\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nThe Allen Legacy\nIvan Allen Jr. Prize for Social Courage\nContact\nRebecca Keane\nDirector of Communications\nrebecca.keane@iac.gatech.edu\n404.894.1720\nEmail\nrebecca.keane@iac.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
