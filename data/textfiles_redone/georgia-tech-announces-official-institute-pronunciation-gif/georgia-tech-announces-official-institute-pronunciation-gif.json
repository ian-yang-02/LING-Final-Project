The implementation of the soft \u2018g\u2019 in GIF will be an institute wide initiative and will be strictly enforced.\nThe Graphics Interchange Format, commonly shortened to an acronym as \u201cGIF\u201d and awarded the file extension .gif, has been at the center of global controversy since it was developed in 1987. The pronunciation of GIF has been widely contested and fervently argued in online discussion forums ever since.\n\u201cThe soft \u2018g\u2019 is an important literary element here at Georgia Tech,\u201d said Dr. Anita Jeff. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t pronounce it \u2018Georgia Tech\u2019 would you? That just sounds silly. The same goes for GIF. \u2018GIF\u2019 is so much better than \u2018GIF\u2019 and we felt it was time to address this issue and form a unified front.\u201d\nThe arduous and detailed process to approve the formal stance began in the spring of 2015 after the suggestion was made by Georgia Institutional Phonetics, better known as GIPH. Over the course of two years, countless GIPH meetings were held and the debate was intense.\n\u201cThose were some difficult days in the office,\u201d recalled Steven Norris, Georgia Tech\u2019s coordinator of social media and one of the most active users of GIFs on campus. \u201cThe hard \u2018g\u2019 supporters were centered around the fact that the \u2018G\u2019 in \u2018GIF\u2019 represents \u2018Graphics\u2019. The exchanges got heated and we even had some people threaten to start using PNG files or JPEGs.\u201d\nDuring the process, notable alumni were contacted for input. As a proponent of the soft \u2018g\u2019, consultant George P. Burdell was invited to campus and he provided a unique perspective for decision-makers.\n\u201cThe word \u2018graphics\u2019 does start with a hard \u2018g\u2019. There is no disputing that point,\u201d said Burdell. \u201cBut I\u2019ve always been the type of person that embraces the opportunity for duality and the unconventional.\u201d\nThe new GIF pronunciation rules will go into effect immediately. Georgia Tech has assembled a GIF Task Force to monitor the usage of the acronym GIF and report any instances of an infraction. The first transgression can result in a fine up to $256, but offenders may be able to come to a reasonable resolution and avoid compressing issues.\nTo view the first GIF posted by Georgia Tech in 1988, click here.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nGeorgia Tech Social Media Team\nsocialmedia@gatech.edu\nEmail\nsnorris@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
