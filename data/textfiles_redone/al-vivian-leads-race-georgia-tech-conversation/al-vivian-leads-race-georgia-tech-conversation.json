Vivian, was the keynote speaker for\u00a0the Race at Georgia Tech: A Call to Action conversation on Thursday, Jan. 21. The virtual discussion was the second in a series of campus discussions on race.\n\"Talking about issues of race and racism is hard,\" said Vice President for Institute Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Archie Ervin during the conversation. \"Over the past year, in the wake of last summer\u2019s national racial turmoil, marked by the sensless killings of George Floyd, Breonna\u00a0Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery\u00a0and others, and more recently, the events in our nation's\u00a0Capitol earlier this month, have made these converrsations even more difficult as concerns\u00a0about racism and its impact have intensified and continues to bubble to the surface of our national discourse.\u201d\nVivian heads Basic Diversity Inc., a national full-service cultural diversity training and consulting firm best known for its Race Awareness Workshop. His father, a confidant of Martin Luther King Jr., founded the organization more than 45 years ago.\u00a0The firm has worked with a diverse range of clients and organizations including corporations, nonprofits and, government agencies.\n\u201cI\u2019ll start off with a statement that is just outright true: racism in America is nothing new; it\u2019s our original sin. It\u2019s been with us from the beginning,\u201d Vivian said, beginning his presentation. \u201cIf you don\u2019t understand race, your future success will be limited.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nContact\nCourtney Hill\nCommunications Manager\nInstitute Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion\ncourtney.hill@gatech.edu\nEmail\ncourtney.hill@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
