Credit: BrightFocus Foundation\nOct 19, 2017\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nSo unheard of was a discovery that researchers made in a protein associated with glaucoma that for over two years they ran it\nthrough a gauntlet of lab tests and published a new research paper on it.\nThe tests validated what they initially saw.\nIt was a Y-shape. That made it an extreme oddity significant to science, and possibly someday to medicine, too, particularly in the treatment of certain types of blindness.\n\u201cA protein like this one has never been reported before. There are extremely few Y-shapes in\nprotein s at all,\u201d said Raquel Lieberman, who led the study. Lieberman is a structural biologist at the Georgia Institute of Technology, and an expert on myocilin, a protein sometimes\u00a0 implicated in a form of hereditary glaucoma .\nGlaucoma\nis the second most common cause of blindness globally, and hereditary glaucoma is just one category of the disease. Genetic mutations in myocilin are a major cause of hereditary glaucoma, which can strike at a particularly young age, including in childhood.\n'Absolutely unique'\nThere are other shapes in proteins that look similar to the Y, but there are key differences.\n\u201cAntibodies look a little like this, but\nin antibodies, separate proteins\nthat are the products different genes fit together to make a kind of Y-shape,\u201d Lieberman said. \u201cThis Y is encoded by one single gene sequence. That makes this absolutely unique.\u201d\nIn addition to being the ostensible unicorn of protein structures, it turned out to be the central binding element of myocilin. The Y ties together major components to nail down myocilin\u2019s overall form, overturning previous conceptions about the protein's appearance.\nMyocilin and blindness\nAlthough the Y hasn\u2019t been particularly implicated in glaucoma, its existence could meaningfully alter the way researchers understand myocilin and how it works in the eye. When myocilin\ngoes wrong, or \u201cmisfolds,\u201d\nit makes\nfibrils\nthat damage tissue called the\ntrabecular meshwork\nthat normally allows the fluid inside the eye to drain and relieve interior pressure.\n\u201cIf you kill the cells that make this drainage work, it\u2019s going to clog, and pressure inside the eye will increase,\u201d said Lieberman, who is an\nassociate professor in Georgia Tech\u2019s School of Chemistry and Biochemistry . That pressure can kill parts of the retina or optic nerve, leading to irreversible partial or total blindness.\nBut though myocilin is common in many parts of our bodies, its normal, healthy role in the eye and, for that matter, what functions the protein has in the body at all are still a mystery.\n\u201cI think if we knew what this protein was doing in the\ntrabecular meshwork , we would understand much more about glaucoma in general,\u201d Lieberman said. \u201cThis research lets us know more about what myocilin is.\u201d\nLieberman published her\nresults on October 19, 2017, in the journal\nStructure . \u00a0The research was funded by the National Eye Institute and the National Institute of General Medical Sciences, both at the National Institutes of Health, by the National Science Foundation, and by the U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science.\nPropellers come undone\nThe focus of studies so far has been on a part of myocilin that is\u00a0the main culprit in a form of hereditary glaucoma, a\nprotein structure called the olfactomedin domain , which Lieberman has also studied extensively. It looks like a protein\npropeller\nwith five blades that surround a hole in the center.\n\u201cWhen a myocilin propellor misfolds, it unravels and forms\namyloid fibrils\n(stringy abnormal proteins) that kill cells that maintain the trabecular network,\u201d Lieberman said. \"Until now, our work led us to believe that the propellers floated around individually as independent units, and not bound together in groups.\"\n\u201cAll we knew before was that, in solution, those olfactomedins were just\nmonomers . They didn\u2019t seem to make up anything of a higher order, except when they unraveled into amyloid fibers, stuck together and blocked fluid flow,\u201d Lieberman said.\nAlso READ: A fake virus unleashes immune\u00a0system on an ugly tropical disease\nSuper sticky Y\nThe Y alters the picture.\nIt anchors the propellers in groups of four. Two propellers (olfactomedin domains) each appear to be connected to either tip of the Y\u2019s branches probably by amino acid strings. With the Y, the overall myocilin looks like four pinwheels on strings tied to a slingshot.\nAdding to the new discoveries: The Y\u00a0itself is sticky, like glue. It\u2019s even annoying to handle in the lab.\n\u201cIt was sticking to the plastic, sticking to the glass, sticking to the membrane, to beads,\u201d Lieberman said. \u201cIt\u2019s super sticky. That may serve a biological function.\u201d\nPerhaps the Y fastens the propellers to surfaces. It\u2019s not yet known. \u201cBut we think the main function is to pair and separate out these olfactomedin domains,\u201d Lieberman said.\nRevisiting misfolding\nMutations in the Y aren\u2019t significantly associated with glaucoma. \u201cWhen it mutates, it misfolds, but not in a way that causes all that cell death,\u201d Lieberman said.\nBut in its normal role, the Y just might promote the speed of misfolding of the propeller protein (olfactomedin domain) that\u2019s implicated in hereditary glaucoma. When misfolded proteins come into contact with good proteins, the misfolded ones tend to make the good ones misfold, too.\n\u201cIf these propeller proteins are clustered together because of the Y, and one of them misfolds, it\u2019s going to recruit the others,\u201d Lieberman said. \u201cHaving them tied together in groups will only magnify the contagion.\u201d\nSlinkys make a Y\nThe Y-shape, also termed\u00a0tripartite, is made up of what are called \u201ccoiled coils.\u201d They\u2019re pairs of short protein coils, a bit like two pieces of Slinky or coiled telephone cords, and they can be stretched similarly to a Slinky and then contract back in a similar way.\nCoiled coils are very common in our bodies.\n\u201cCoiled coils represent three to five percent of our genome,\u201d Lieberman said. \u201cThey\u2019re found in muscle contraction, in molecule transport up and down neurons. Lots of extracellular proteins (proteins that function outside of cells) also have them.\u201d\nThe Y\u2019s branches are each a pair of coiled coils, each called a dimer, and in the trunk, they come together to form a group of four coiled coils called a tetramer.\nAlso READ: New nano-fight against #1 killer clogged arteries\nCoauthors of this study were Shannon Hill, Elaine Nguyen, Rebecca Donegan, Ath\u00e9na Patterson-Orazem, Anthony Hazel, and James Gumbart.
