I routinely encourage employees to double-check matters such as their financial institution\u2019s routing number and their account number provided for direct deposit and instruct students how to detect suspicious emails and text messages.\u201d\nThe Office of Information Technology offers the following tips to stay safe online this season and beyond:\nAlways STOP, THINK, and CHECK. Shop reliable websites of retailers you know and trust and visit their sites directly by entering a known, trusted URL into the address bar instead of following a link. Do research on retailers that you are not familiar with, such as looking for and examining consumer reviews, and verify that the retailer has\u00a0a legitimate mailing address and phone number for sales or support questions.\nBe mindful of package tracking emails, fake ecards, charity donation scams, or anything that requests confirmation of purchase information. Double-check email links that appear to be from major retailers and shipping companies such as FedEx and UPS.\nIf you receive an email, text message, or call with a deal that\u2019s too good to be true, it\u2019s probably a scam. Follow up with your own research.\nIn your Georgia Tech accounts,\ndon\u2019t :\nReset passwords via links sent in emails. Instead, go directly to BuzzPort ( buzzport.gatech.edu ) or Passport ( passport.gatech.edu)\nURLs to change your passwords.\nRespond to job solicitations that you did not apply for or expect.\nClick DUO prompts when you have not attempted a login.\nEngage with suspicious emails that are sent to your Georgia Tech email account. Instead, immediately forward the email to\nphishing@gatech.edu .\nRelated links\nGeorgia Tech Cyber Security\nEmail\ncourtney.hill@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
