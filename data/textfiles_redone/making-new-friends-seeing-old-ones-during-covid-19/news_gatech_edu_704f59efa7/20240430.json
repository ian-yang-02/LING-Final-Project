Whether you want to take advantage of increasingly warm weather or are simply trying to make new friends, opportunities abound.\nGetting Started Socializing\nIt can already be difficult to make friends in college, and that can be worsened by students feeling isolated during the pandemic.\n\u201cFeeling shy or experiencing some level of social awkwardness is nothing to feel ashamed about, and for many students, the pandemic has amplified those feelings,\u201d said Tiffiny Hughes-Troutman, director of the Center for Assessment, Referral, and Education (CARE). \u201cStart by seeking out environments that suit you.\u201d\nSome suggestions for how to do this include attending residence hall events for students who live on campus, as well as developing social media networks. Volunteering can also help students make friends while giving back to their local communities, and\npen pal networks\nare regaining popularity in light of the pandemic.\nIf you know someone is new to campus, or could use a connection, ask them to join you to do something outdoors. This, too, can be uncomfortable \u2014 but everyone needs a friend, especially these days.\nYou can also find student organizations across a wide variety of topics on\nEngage . Many organizations are operating fully online, while others have occasional in-person events as well. View a list of upcoming events from student organizations\nhere . Once you\u2019ve found someone to hang out with, whether they\u2019re a new friend or an old one, there are plenty of ways to have socially distanced \u201cfriend dates.\u201d\nSporting Events\nSeveral Georgia Tech sports are in the middle of their spring seasons, and many of them are competing outdoors. Students can attend baseball, softball, track and field, and tennis events for free. The 8-3 baseball team is currently climbing after taking down the ACC\u2019s top-seeded Louisville; their next home series runs March 12 \u2013 14 against Pittsburgh.\nVolleyball also just started its 10-match spring season. The Yellow Jackets finished the fall semester ranked 17th in the country and look to continue their streak and lock in their first NCAA tournament berth since 2009. Both men\u2019s and women\u2019s basketball are also looking to continue their postseason runs, with the men playing in the quarterfinals of the ACC Tournament on Thursday. View the full schedule of sports at\nramblinwreck.com .\nAtlanta\u2019s Outdoor Spaces\nAtlanta also boasts several outdoor areas for people to enjoy the weather away from others. On campus, Tech Green, Burger Bowl Field, and the new EcoCommons are some of the many places to hang out. Off campus, places such as the BeltLine and Piedmont Park are easily within driving or biking distance. If you\u2019re looking for a little more adventure, visit one of the Atlanta area\u2019s many\nhiking trails .\nGeorgia Tech Arts Skyline Series\nFor those missing live performances, Georgia Tech Arts is here to help. From March 26 to May 18, there are 25 performances\u00a0scheduled\u00a0for the outdoor stage being built on the W21 parking lot at the intersection of Ferst Drive and State Street, ranging from the Atlanta Ballet to student musicians.
