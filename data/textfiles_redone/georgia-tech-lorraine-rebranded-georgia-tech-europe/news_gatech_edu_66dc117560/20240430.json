The rebrand will create a more recognizable name and expand the Georgia Tech brand in the region and greater Europe. That expansion will mean greater partnerships with European institutions and opportunities for increased student involvement with European industry.\n\u201cGeorgia Tech-Europe is a strategic evolution in the Institute\u2019s international presence and global reach,\u201d said Steve McLaughlin, Georgia Tech\u2019s provost and executive vice president for Academic Affairs. \u201cThe rebrand allows us to further grow our footprint and expand our education, research, and innovation throughout the region, greater Europe, and the world.\u201d\nSince 1990, Georgia Tech-Lorraine has served more than 11,000 students from all over the world and proudly played host to some of the finest academic programming, schools, and research centers in Europe. Located in Metz, France, the Georgia Tech-Europe campus is strategically located in an area that borders Luxembourg, Germany, and Belgium.\nThe campus is in proximity to several European Union (EU) institutions, including the judicial body of the EU and many European Commissions located in Luxembourg, and the headquarters of the European Parliament in Strasbourg, France. Additionally, Brussels is home to the seat of the European Commission, Council of the EU, European Council, and the European Parliament.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nAndrea Gappell, Communications Program Manager\nGeorgia Tech-Europe\nSusie Ivy, Director\nOrganizational, Academic and Research Communications\nEmail\nagappell3@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
