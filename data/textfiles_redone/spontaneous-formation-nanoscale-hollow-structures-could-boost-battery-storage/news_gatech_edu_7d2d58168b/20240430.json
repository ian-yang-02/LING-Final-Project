The reversibly hollowing structures could allow lithium ion batteries to hold more energy and therefore provide more power between charges.\nFlow of lithium ions into and out of alloy battery anodes has long been a limiting factor in how much energy batteries could hold using conventional materials. Too much ion flow causes anode materials to swell and then shrink during charge-discharge cycles, causing mechanical degradation that shortens battery life. To address that issue, researchers have previously developed hollow \u201cyolk-shell\u201d nanoparticles that accommodate the volume change caused by ion flow, but fabricating them has been complex and costly.\nNow, a research team has discovered that particles a thousand times smaller than the width of a human hair spontaneously form hollow structures during the charge-discharge cycle without changing size, allowing more ion flow without damaging the anodes. The research was reported June 1 in the journal\nNature Nanotechnology .\n\u201cIntentionally engineering hollow nanomaterials has been done for a while now, and it is a promising approach for improving the lifetime and stability of batteries with high energy density,\u201d said\nMatthew McDowell , assistant professor in the\nGeorge W. Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering\nand the\nSchool of Materials Science and Engineering\nat the Georgia Institute of Technology. \u201cThe problem has been that directly synthesizing these hollow nanostructures at the large scales needed for commercial applications is challenging and expensive. Our discovery could offer an easier, streamlined process that could lead to improved performance in a way that is similar to the intentionally engineered hollow structures.\u201d\nThe researchers made their discovery using a high-resolution electron microscope that allowed them to directly visualize battery reactions as they occur at the nanoscale. \u201cThis is a tricky type of experiment, but if you are patient and do the experiments right, you can learn really important things about how the materials behave in batteries,\u201d McDowell said.\nThe team, which included researchers from ETH Z\u00fcrich and Oak Ridge National Laboratory, also used modeling to create a theoretical framework for understanding why the nanoparticles spontaneously hollow \u2014 instead of shrinking \u2014 during removal of lithium from the battery.\nThe ability to form and reversibly fill hollow particles during battery cycling occurs only in oxide-coated antimony nanocrystals that are less than approximately 30 nanometers in diameter. The research team found that the behavior arises from a resilient native oxide layer that allows for initial expansion during lithiation \u2014 flow of ions into the anode \u2014 but mechanically prevents shrinkage as antimony forms voids during the removal of ions, a process known as delithiation.\nThe finding was a bit of a surprise because earlier work on related materials had been performed on larger particles, which expand and shrink instead of forming hollow structures. \u201cWhen we first observed the distinctive hollowing behavior, it was very exciting and we immediately knew this could have important implications for battery performance,\u201d McDowell said.\nAntimony is relatively expensive and not currently used in commercial battery electrodes. But McDowell believes the spontaneous hollowing may also occur in less costly related materials such as tin. Next steps would include testing other materials and mapping a pathway to commercial scale-up.\n\u201cIt would be interesting to test other materials to see if they transform according to a similar hollowing mechanism,\u201d he said. \u201cThis could expand the range of materials available for use in batteries. The small test batteries we fabricated showed promising charge-discharge performance, so we would like to evaluate the materials in larger batteries.\u201d\nThough they may be costly, the self-hollowing antimony nanocrystals have another interesting property: they could also be used in sodium-ion and potassium-ion batteries, emerging systems for which much more research must be done.\n\u201cThis work advances our understanding of how this type of material evolves inside batteries,\u201d McDowell said. \u201cThis information will be critical for implementing the material or related materials in the next generation of lithium-ion batteries, which will be able to store more energy and be just as durable as the batteries we have today.\u201d\nIn addition to McDowell, the paper\u2019s authors include Matthew Boebinger from Georgia Tech; Olesya Yarema, Maksym Yarema, and Vanessa Wood from the Department of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering at ETH Z\u00fcrich , and Kinga Unocic and Raymond Unocic from the Center for Nanophase Materials Science at Oak Ridge National Laboratory.\nThis work was performed at the Georgia Tech Materials Characterization Facility and the Institute for Electronics and Nanotechnology, a member of the National Nanotechnology Coordinated Infrastructure, which is supported by the National Science Foundation (Grant ECCS-1542174).
