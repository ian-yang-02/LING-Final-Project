Communities from throughout Georgia were selected to ensure impact across the state.\u201d\nEach of the projects will receive financial and technical assistance to support and continue the work of implementing applied research from university partners, as well as assistance from the Partnership for monthly meetings, community engagement,\u00a0and promotion of project outcomes.\n\"Georgia Tech is a proud member of the Partnership for Inclusive Innovation,\u201d \u00c1ngel Cabrera, president of Georgia Tech, said. \u201cWe\u2019re truly committed to creating opportunities for all Georgians to drive innovation and to make Georgia the Tech Capital of the East Coast.\nCabrera congratulated the Georgia Smart winners and added, \u201cThis work is sure to create lasting transformative change, not just for the winning communities, but also for their neighbors and everyone who benefits from this research in the future.\u201d\nThe 2022 cohort communities and projects are:\nCity of Atlanta : The project will use innovative diagnostic techniques to perform energy audits in Atlanta\u2019s Thomasville Heights community, with the goal of achieving significant cost savings compared to traditional building energy auditing practices. The audits are done with minimally invasive drones equipped with remote sensing instruments to analyze building exteriors. The method holds promise for overcoming homeowner hesitancy about weatherization programs and can be replicated in distressed neighborhoods throughout the city. The project is especially timely in the Thomasville Heights community, where ongoing challenges such as acute unemployment and\u00a0poverty will soon be compounded by the closure of long-neglected subsidized housing. Researchers from Georgia Tech and Morehouse College, and representatives from Focused Community Strategies will work with the city of Atlanta on this project.\n\u201cWe are currently supporting neighborhood stabilization in Thomasville Heights,\u201d said Dr. Latrice Rollings,\u00a0assistant professor for community health and preventive medicine at Morehouse School of Medicine. This project will allow \u201cus to use utility rebates and bulk purchasing as solutions for poverty amelioration and will reduce the cost of energy.\u201d\nAthens-Clarke County : The Climate Resilience Project through Technology and Transportation Innovation will evaluate and improve community preparedness in response to the growing severity of environmental disaster and the region\u2019s increasing population.\u00a0The project will include the development and deployment of a survey to gauge existing disaster preparedness and resident interest in improving preparedness in their communities. Leaders will engage with the community to create an all-hazards mitigation plan, neighborhood disaster playbook template, and strengthened neighborhood-level resource and relationship network. The goal is to minimize risk and work toward providing equitable outcomes for all members of the community in the event of a catastrophic\u00a0disaster. Researchers from the University of Georgia, Augusta University, and Kennesaw State University will work with Athens-Clarke County on this project.\n\u201cAthens-Clarke County is dedicated to building a culture of readiness and resiliency for all of our residents,\u201d said Mayor Kelly Girtz. \u201cThrough this partnership, I believe we will make Athens-Clarke County a safer, strong, and adaptable place to live.\u201d\nThe\u00a0 Henry County \u00a0Smart Resilience Decision Support Tool (DST) will be an interactive web-based tool to assist county planners, policymakers, and county officials as they assess and explore the impact and potential of new greenspace, warehousing, and freight-related infrastructure projects. The tool will help county officials answer the question: How can Henry County reconcile community economic development objectives with quality of life and energy resilience\u00a0concerns? Researchers from Georgia Tech and Clayton State University will work with Henry County on this project.\n\"We are so excited and honored that Henry County has been chosen to receive the Georgia Smart Award,\u201d said Carlotta Harrell, chair of the Henry County Board of Commissioners. \u201cWe continue to look for ways to improve and enhance transportation for Henry County residents and this continued partnership with Georgia Smart allows us to do just that.\"\nCity of Warner Robins :\u00a0 The project will develop and test a Citizen Safety Digital Twin for Community Resilience through the integration of a dynamic license plate reader solution with police department investigation practices. The project team will build on previous work to refine an interface that enables the police department to see where crimes are predicted to occur and suggest placement of license plate readers to detect them. The team will engage with the community and key stakeholders to collect and analyze feedback about the system. This project will help Warner Robins to maximize both deterrence and detection, with the aim of lowering crime rates\u00a0across the city. Researchers from Georgia Tech and Middle Georgia State University will work with the city of Warner Robins on this project.\n\u201cPolice departments are under-resourced and understaffed around the nation,\u201d Warner Robins Mayor LaRhonda Patrick said. \u201cThe use of technology has been\u00a0a force multiplier to reduce crime. This grant will give Chief [John] Wagner and the entire police department team the tools they need to provide public safety for our city. This is proactive crime prevention.\u201d\nThe Georgia Smart Communities Challenge has a strong track record of success. Alumni have implemented their projects and garnered additional funding and technical assistance to continue projects beyond the two-year program period, allowing them to continue serving their residents and meeting community goals.\n\u201cAs an initial Georgia Smart partner and long-time supporter of the Partnership, Georgia Power is proud to support innovation across the state through this announcement of a new cohort of Georgia Smart communities,\u201d Chris Womack, chair, president and CEO of Georgia Power said at the event. \u201cThis cohort of Georgia Smart community projects is unique because it is inclusive, it supports multi-disciplinary and multi-university projects, and it fosters collaboration, with all communities working toward\u00a0smart resilience initiatives.\u201d\nAbout the Georgia Smart Communities Challenge (GA Smart) program:\nWhen municipalities experience 21st century challenges that require strategic planning, Georgia Smart is an award-winning program that assists leaders in identifying solutions that are researched, tested, and evaluated by subject-matter experts. Often referred to as simply \u201cGeorgia Smart\u201d this community research assistance program empowers communities on their journey to innovation by helping them to envision a smart and connected future. This program has served 20 communities across the state of Georgia, helping to activate over 140 technologies and facilitate over 30 community engagement meetings. Alumni of the program have gone on to experience wide-ranging success, including recognition on a national and international scale.\nAbout the Partnership for Inclusive Innovation:\nLaunched in 2020, the\u00a0Partnership for Inclusive Innovation\u00a0is a public-private organization that was created to lead coordinated, statewide efforts to position Georgia as the leader for innovation, opportunity, and shared economic success.
