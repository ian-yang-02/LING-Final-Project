She is one of several customer service representatives in the\nAdministrative Services Center , the front door for all Human Resources and IT inquiries, which launched last fall.\n\u201cOne of the main reasons people come to HR is to complete their onboarding as a new hire or as a current employee changing positions,\u201d Person said. \u201cOthers come for interviews, or perhaps they\u2019re having a problem accessing the system. The Administrative Services Center can help with all of those issues.\u201d\nPerson also helps employees get a BuzzCard, the Tech ID card that provides access to campus buildings and can be used to purchase meals. \u201cNew employees get everything they need here. Once you leave this building, you\u2019re ready to work.\u201d\nThe most rewarding aspect of her job is meeting a variety of people every day. \u201cThere are people from all over the world at Georgia Tech, and I get to meet everybody,\u201d she said. \u201cIn just a few minutes I get to learn a little bit about their culture and language. I\u2019m from Bogot \u00e1a,\nColombia, and I get very happy any time I see someone else from Colombia.\u201d\nThe most challenging part of her job is resolving whatever problem an employee is having. \u201cSome of the problems are easy to solve, but others are a little more complex,\u201d she said. \u201cI always try to put myself in other people\u2019s shoes, so I can empathize with them and help resolve the issue by providing the best customer service possible.\u201d\nAway From Work\nWhile growing up in Colombia, Person played tennis and dreamed of a career as a professional player. \u201cIn my mind, I was going to be the next Serena Williams. In high school I trained every day after school and all weekend.\u201d\nHer dream of playing professional tennis did not come to fruition. But she played for four years at Benedict College, a private, historically Black college, in Columbia, South Carolina. She chose to major in art because of a passing interest in the subject.\n\u201cI was a little nervous at the beginning because the other students majoring in art really wanted to be artists, while I wanted to play tennis,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen I was little, I liked drawing, but I thought it was something that everyone does because I come from a family of artists. My grandmother draws, and my dad is a musician. I didn\u2019t think about being an \u2018artist.\u2019 But, after I began taking classes, I found this passion for art.\u201d\nWhenever she got an assignment, she recalled, \u201cIdeas would pop into my brain, and after class I would immediately start working on it. It wasn\u2019t easy, because it still required effort, but I didn\u2019t mind because I actually wanted to do it.\u201d\nAfter graduating with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in 2015, she continued painting and drawing. Her works express emotions connected to her ancestral home and her current cultural environment. Her home is her studio, and her living room is filled with paintings.\n\u201cArt is my tool of communication,\u201d she said. \u201cI am lucky to have a beautiful family that has taught me a lot of principles that helped guide me. I feel that I can use my art to communicate my ideas and beliefs about life.\u201d\nPerson\u2019s works have been shown in gallery and museum exhibitions, and in magazines. She recently entered a painting in the\nIBB Art Show\non campus. \u201cI try to put my art out there as much as I can,\u201d she said. \u201cOf course, being on social media helps.\u201d She promotes her art on Instagram at belab_art, and on her\nwebsite .\nShe is happy when her plan falls neatly into place. \u201cBefore I begin working on a piece, I like to have a clear idea of what I want. And when I can create what I envisioned, I think that\u2019s great.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nAdministrative Services Center\nThe Administrative Services Center Launches\nRead More Staff Stories\nContact\nVictor Rogers\nInstitute Communications\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
