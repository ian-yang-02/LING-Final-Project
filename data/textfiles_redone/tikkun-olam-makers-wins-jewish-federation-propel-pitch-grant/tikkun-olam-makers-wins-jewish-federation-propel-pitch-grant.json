The group, co-sponsored by Hillel at Georgia Tech, was awarded $35,000 to help people around Atlanta, as well as expand TOM.\n\u201cThe moonshot goal of TOM is to help 250 million people, so our pitch focused on how we, as one of the 70 current TOM communities around the world, can help achieve that goal,\u201d said Teddy Lambert, manager of Georgia Tech TOM.\nWith this grant, TOM will have the opportunity to help establish more groups across the state, using connections with Hillels at other Georgia colleges and universities.\nAnother portion of the prize money will go toward TOM\u2019s virtual makeathon, which will take place March 12-14. At the makeathon will be two groups of people: Need-Knowers, or members of the local community who have personal experience with an issue, and makers, who develop open-source and publicly available solutions for those issues.\nFor the makeathon, TOM aims to have 10 Need-Knowers and 75 students participate. The Need-Knowers will represent Atlanta\u2019s disabled community. Those interested in being makers can apply\nhere\nby Thursday, Feb. 11.\n\u201cTOM is a great initiative that empowers students to apply their skills, knowledge, and passions to creating real-life solutions for those with different abilities,\u201d said Elliot Karp, CEO of Hillels of Georgia. \u201cIn Judaism, Tikkun Olam literally means \u2018repair the world.\u2019 Through TOM, our students are doing just that.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nContact\nGrace Wyner\nInstitute Communications\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
