Now she's back to earn a master's in mechanical engineering.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nEmail\nJasmine and her late father.\nNov 04, 2021\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nWhen Jasmine Hornbeck and her mother, Junko, hit the road from Jacksonville, Florida, one evening during her senior year of high school, to tour the Georgia Tech campus, she didn\u2019t think about where they would stay that night.\n\u201cWe got [to campus] around 1 a.m. and I was like, \u2018Mom, did you not get a hotel?\u2019\u201d remembered Hornbeck. \u201cShe pulled into the Coca-Cola building parking lot, and I realized that she had pillows and blankets back there and I was like, \u2018Wow, so this is what we\u2019re doing.\u2019\u201d\nThe two created a makeshift bed in the back of the family SUV and settled in for the night.\n\u201cMy back hurt the next morning, but I didn\u2019t care about sleeping in the car at all,\u201d said Hornbeck. She didn\u2019t mind because, that morning, she was getting the opportunity to visit her dream school.\nShe wanted to pursue a college career at Georgia Tech in mechanical engineering and had already been accepted after applying during the Early Decision phase, but out-of-state tuition would place a heavy financial burden on her family back in Florida. So, Hornbeck and her mom agreed that they would go to visit the campus and see if Tech was the place for her. Neither had ever been to Atlanta.\n\u201cWe weren\u2019t the type of family that traveled very often,\u201d she said. \u201cThe longest road trip we\u2019d ever been on was like two hours.\u201d\nAfter multiple hours on I-75 and an impromptu car campout, she finally got her first glimpse of campus. While on the tour, Hornbeck and her mom shared a moment.\n\u201cWe looked at each other, and we just kind of knew. My mom simply stated, \u2018This is where you belong,\u201d recalled Hornbeck.\nReturning to Jacksonville after the tour, Hornbeck and her parents came up with a plan for her to attend Georgia Tech. She enrolled and completed the fall semester then spent the holidays at home. But when she returned to Tech in January she received some difficult news.\n\u201cMy Dad was diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer during my senior year of high school,\u201d said Hornbeck. \u201cI couldn\u2019t comprehend the gravity of what was going on, so when I left home, it didn\u2019t register that this decision would impact the rest of my life, having such limited moments with him and still choosing my studies.\u201d\nAt the start of spring classes, Junko sent a text to Hornbeck about her father\u2019s worsening condition.\n\u201cWhen she told me to come home, I was so selfishly caught up in how it would affect my studies that I almost didn\u2019t,\u201d Hornbeck remembered. But, she booked a ride on a megabus and made it home to see her father hours before he passed away. Within 24 hours, Hornbeck was on another bus back to Georgia Tech.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I felt the full effect of grief for six, seven, eight months,\u201d she said. \u201cI was in a bubble of disbelief.\u201d\nDuring that spring semester, Hornbeck, a first-generation college student, worried about her future. Her father was the main source of income for the family. So, she now faced the reality that she may not have been able to stay at Tech.\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t wrap my head around that. I worked so hard to get here, and, suddenly, it seemed as if my circumstance was going to prevent me from reaching my dreams,\u201d recalled Hornbeck.\nPicking up multiple jobs on and off campus, she was unwilling to give up. She went to financial aid every day for two weeks after her father\u2019s death, seeking possible solutions. Meanwhile, she kept her father\u2019s passing mostly to herself, electing not to tell professors, and leaning only on a handful of friends. She felt alienated from the rest of the Georgia Tech community. She waited until May for the financial aid packages to be released, continuing to work and attend classes without knowing her future at Georgia Tech.\n\u201cEverything was out of my hands,\u201d said Hornbeck. \u201cThat was a concept I struggled to grasp. I\u2019d like to think that I can solve any problem, but, for once, I had no idea how to help myself.\u201d\nAt the end of the semester, help arrived. Hornbeck had earned enough scholarships to remain at Tech. She\u2019ll never know, for sure, why she was awarded the aid but credits her perseverance.\nAfter a tumultuous first year, Hornbeck continued her collegial path in the wake of her father\u2019s death, but toward the end of her undergraduate studies found a sector of campus that could identify with her journey.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t realize that other people [at Georgia Tech] were struggling with similar situations, until I found out about grief counseling my senior year,\u201d she said. \u201cThat was so helpful. These people actually understand how the gravity of such a loss can affect your life, implicitly, for years to come. I found comfort in that community.\u201d\nThis past summer, Hornbeck completed her degree in mechanical engineering and is now pursuing a master\u2019s degree at Georgia Tech.\nFor a long time, she felt as if talking about grief was taboo, but she now feels sharing her story has been cathartic.\n\u201cTelling this heals me in a way. I feel like I\u2019ve come to terms with all of this,\u201d she said. \u201cIn his last months, my dad would always tell me that he knew he made the right decision in letting me come here and that he was proud of me. I hold on to that dearly. There is no right way or timeline in which I was supposed to process this, which I didn\u2019t understand at the time. With or without what was going on in my personal life, I was at Georgia Tech because I loved engineering. Once I realized that, I had my fire back.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
