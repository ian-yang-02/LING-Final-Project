It\u2019s more than half of Pluto\u2019s diameter and orbits only 12,000 or so miles away. To put that into perspective, picture our moon three times closer to Earth, and as large as Mars.\nA new study from the Georgia Institute of Technology provides additional insight into this relationship and how it affects the continuous stripping of Pluto\u2019s atmosphere by solar wind. When Charon is positioned between the sun and Pluto, the research indicates that the moon can significantly reduce atmospheric loss.\n\u201cCharon doesn\u2019t always have its own atmosphere,\u201d said Carol Paty, a Georgia Tech associate professor in the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences. \u201cBut when it does, it creates a shield for Pluto and redirects much of the solar wind around and away.\u201d\nThis barrier creates a more acute angle of Pluto\u2019s bow shock, slowing down the deterioration of the atmosphere. When Charon doesn\u2019t have an atmosphere, or when it\u2019s behind or next to Pluto (a term scientists call \u201cdownstream\u201d), then Charon has only a minor\u00a0effect on the interaction of the solar wind with Pluto.\nThe study\u2019s predictions, performed before the New Horizons probe collected and returned data to Earth, is consistent with the measurements made by the spacecraft about Pluto\u2019s atmospheric loss rate. Previous estimates at the time of the study were at least 100 times higher than the actual rate.\nThe research is currently published in a special Pluto issue of the journal Icarus .\nJohn Hale is the Georgia Tech student who co-led the study with Paty. He says the Pluto system is a window into our origins because Pluto hasn\u2019t been subjected to the same extreme temperatures as objects in closer orbits to the sun.\n\u201cAs a result, Pluto still has more of its volatile elements, which have long since been blown off the inner planets by solar wind,\u201d Hale said. \u201cEven at its great distance from the sun, Pluto is slowly losing its atmosphere. Knowing the rate at which Pluto\u2019s atmosphere is being lost can tell us how much atmosphere it had to begin with, and therefore what it looked like originally. From there, we can get an idea of what the solar system was made of during its formation.\u201d\nHale and Paty also say their study affirms a popular hypothesis of Charon. The areas of discoloration near its lunar poles are likely caused by magnetized particles that have been shorn from Pluto\u2019s atmosphere. These particles have accumulated and settled on Charon over billions of years, particularly when it is downstream of Pluto.\nThe project is supported by NASA grant NNX11AM40G.
