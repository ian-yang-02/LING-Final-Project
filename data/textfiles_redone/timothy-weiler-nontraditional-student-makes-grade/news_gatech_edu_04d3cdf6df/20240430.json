(Photo courtesy of TJ Weiler)\nDec 14, 2020\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nTimothy \u201cTJ\u201d Weiler, 43, was a nontraditional student with an unusual educational background. He graduated over the weekend with a Georgia Tech degree in civil engineering with a focus on structural theory.\nWeiler, whose hometown is Athens, Greece, grew up traveling the world with his parents, who were engaged in missionary projects. As a result he did not get a chance to regularly attend school. When he was in his thirties he decided he wanted to get a proper education and become a structural engineer.\n\u201cI began my academic journey by getting my GED, enrolling in community college, and teaching myself basic math,\u201d he said. He worked his way up to advanced engineering classes and eventually transferred to Georgia Tech.\n\u201cI am beyond grateful that I was accepted into Georgia Tech, the number 1 college for civil engineering in the country. It\u2019s truly been a dream come true,\u201d Weiler said.\nHis time at Tech overlapped with his nephew, Derek Weiler, who graduated last spring with a degree in computer science. His niece, Cherish Weiler, has a master\u2019s degree from Tech.\nHe said that any time he would tell someone he was at Tech, they would ask if he was a professor. His reply? \u201cNo, I\u2019m just a very old student,\u201d he laughed.\nAnd although he is relieved to be completing his degree, he will miss the intense academic challenges he faced \u2014 and overcame \u2014 at Tech. He, like his fellow students, also had to deal with the isolation caused by the pandemic. \u201cThere certainly was a lot more stress involved, even though I did not want to admit it at the time,\u201d he said. \u201cI missed the interaction with my classmates, and group projects were not the same on BlueJeans. The regular group dynamic was really missed.\u201d\nBut Weiler persevered. He said he was most looking forward to hearing his name announced during the ceremony.\nWeiler, who has a background in construction, will pursue a career as a structural engineer.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nVictor Rogers\nInstitute Communications\nEmail\nvictor.rogers@comm.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
