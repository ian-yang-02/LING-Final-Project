It\u2019s another example of the lack of females in the field.\n\u201cIt always surprises me,\u201d said Howard, the Linda J. and Mark C. Smith Chair Professor in the\nSchool of Electrical and Computer Engineering . \u201cThe medical and biomedical fields are just as technical as robotics, but they don\u2019t have as major of a gender gap.\u201d\nThe good news? While nationwide numbers for robotics aren\u2019t available, the number of females getting undergraduate degrees in computer science is increasing. It was nearly 14 percent in 2009. It\u2019s up to almost 16 percent as of 2015. This past fall, 23 percent of Georgia Tech\u2019s computer science students were female.\nDoes diversity in robotics truly matter? Howard and fellow females are quick to say yes.\n\u201cIf robots are truly being built so everyone can use them, how can roboticists figure out what\u2019s needed for half the population if women aren\u2019t represented very well in the design process?\u201d Howard asked. \u201cOur field must be reflective of the consumer market.\u201d\nIn a world dominated by men, here are 10 Georgia Tech women changing the field of robotics.\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nCreating the Next in Robotics\nGeorgia Tech Robot Baseball Cards\nA Robot Class for the Masses\nContact\nJason Maderer\nNational Media Relations\nmaderer@gatech.edu\n404-660-2966\nEmail\nmaderer@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
