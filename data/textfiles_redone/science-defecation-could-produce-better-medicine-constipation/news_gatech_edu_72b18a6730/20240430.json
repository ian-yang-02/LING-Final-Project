Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering and the School of Biological Sciences.\nApr 27, 2017\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nA new study led by researchers in the George W. Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering finds that all mammals, from humans to elephants to cats, defecate in the same amount of time: about 12 seconds. That\u2019s despite the fact that the length of their rectums can vary widely. For instance, an elephant\u2019s is 10 times the length of a cat\u2019s (40 centimeters vs. four).\nThe study suggests that the time is consistent because of mucus. The substance covering the the large intestine is very thin for small animals and much thicker for larger ones. According to the paper, mucus allows feces to move through the intestine \u201clike a sled sliding through a chute.\u201d\nThe extra fluid allows larger animals to defecate at higher speeds than smaller animals, even though both use the same amount of pressure to relieve themselves. In other words, defecation might not be possible without this previously unknown mucus layer.\nThe research also found that the length of feces is double that of the rectum, which means the rectum and the colon both store feces.\nThe study, \u201c Hydrodynamics of defecation ,\u201d is published in the journal Soft Matter. It covers a topic that hasn\u2019t been heavily researched within the scientific community. Professor\nDavid Hu\n(also in the School of Biological Sciences) and his mechanical engineering student Patricia Yang are the lead authors.\nDaniel Chu , an assistant professor and colorectal surgeon at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, is one of the co-authors. Georgia Tech spoke with each of them about their findings.\nWhy was it important to study defecation?\nDavid Hu : Talking about, let alone studying, defecation is taboo. But that\u2019s to the detriment of our society because we don\u2019t have a good physical understanding of digestion or defecation.\nAfter reading the literature, I was convinced that we could make progress in this area. We decided on an approach combining a mathematical model and numerous measurements from the zoo to provide validation to our model.\nThe study of the heart began in a similar fashion. Thirty years ago, there was no physics of the cardiovascular system. Now we have computer models personalized to people\u2019s profiles. The same thing could be true for the digestive system.\nOne of my goals is to use physics and math to understand things that aren\u2019t studied enough but should be .\nYour lab\nearned a 2015 Ig Nobel Prize for Improbable Research\nfor a published paper showing\nall mammals urinate for roughly the same duration of time . In what ways did this additional attention foster new or unexpected connections with industry or the research community? Patricia Yang : That study reached further than I expected. After the paper was published, an association in Spain invited us to present at an international urology conference. The hosts remarked that \u201cit\u2019s difficult that a paper on functional urology is known beyond the specialist field.\u201d\nThe study also linked the science community and general audiences. We were asked to create a\nvideo lesson about the fluid mechanics of urination for MIT\u2019s BLOSSOM program , a video series that teaches math and science lessons to high school students around the world.\nWe\u2019ve also started a collaboration with a Japanese urologist to study the duration of urination for humans.\u00a0This follow-up\u00a0research will hopefully explain how age and gender affect the function of the urinary system.\nQuestion: What applications does this study have for the medical community?\nDaniel Chu : As clinicians, I think we underappreciate the role of mucus within the intestinal tract. We know it\u2019s there, but few studies have paid much attention to it. This study demonstrates a physical, and mathematical, reason why it\u2019s there.\nIf mucus plays a role in normal physiology of defecation, which this study shows, then abnormalities in mucus may play a role in abnormal physiology. This possibility is intriguing and could expand our current understanding of how gastrointestinal disorders, like constipation or infectious colitis, may occur.\nOne line of thinking for why constipation occurs is because the nervous system of the colon is out of sync. That messes up the propulsion process. We often have to treat it with medications, like laxatives and other pro-motility agents, to essentially force the column of stool out of the body. Perhaps people who are constipated don\u2019t have enough mucus for whatever reason. If we think that mucus is playing a role, then could we develop new treatment strategies based on medications, including enemas or oral agents, that more closely resemble mucus? These possibilities would be novel.\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nRead More About Why They Chose This Topic\nContact\nJason Maderer\nNational Media Relations\nmaderer@gatech.edu\n404-660-2926\nEmail\nmaderer@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
