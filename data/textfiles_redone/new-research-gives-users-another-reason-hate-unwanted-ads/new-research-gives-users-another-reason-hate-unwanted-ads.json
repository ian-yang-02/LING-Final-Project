These cookies allow advertisers to create extensive profiles of internet users, however as the researchers found, this system can be influenced by bad actors.\nOnce an attacker knows a user\u2019s email address, they can tap into the information being collected by any third-party advertiser observing a specific user\u2019s targeted ad stream. This could allow bad actors insight into to an individual\u2019s detailed browsing history, such as online retailers and travel websites.\n\u201cThird party ad networks have no direct relationship with users. Thus, if they want to track user activity across devices, they must rely on identity information, such as email addresses, given to them from other various websites,\u201d said\nPaul Pearce , assistant professor in the\nSchool of Cybersecurity and Privacy\n(SCP) at Georgia Tech. \u201cOur work shows the way that information is passed to the ad networks is both insecure and hard to verify. If an attacker knows a victim\u2019s email address, they can lie to the ad network pretending to be a user, leading to very real privacy problems.\u201d\nThe researchers describe this susceptibility as advertising identity entanglement and it happens when attackers confuse ad networks into correlating the attacker\u2019s tracking cookies with a targeted person\u2019s email address, looping them into the data being gathered by third parties. As Pearce and his colleagues state in their paper, adversaries can also leverage the process to send ads of any kind to their targets.\n\"When I use the Internet on my own private device, like a phone or a laptop, I don't expect that anyone who knows my personal email could manipulate what I see,\u201d said\nChris Kanich , associate professor at UIC. \u201cThis attack is particularly disturbing, and I am relieved that I use ad and tracking blockers in my web browsers.\"\nTo test the scale of this problem, researchers created an artificial users and profile for their experiment, at no time was a real person targeted. By knowing only, the experimental user\u2019s email address, the team was able to Identify specific items and websites the victim interacted with.\nAlong with shopping habits, the test also showed retargeted advertisements can contain sensitive location information. For example, if a victim interacted with some hotel and travel websites, the attacker could then receive retargeted ads for the specific hotel the victim viewed.\n\u201cAn ad network potentially leaking travel plans to anyone with a target\u2019s email address is a significant privacy threat and potentially dangerous to people being stalked,\u201d said\nDamon McCoy , associate professor at NYU.\nThe researchers indicate that combatting this problem without the support of ad networks is challenging, but ad blockers provide a reasonable initial option to limit exposing a user\u2019s private data. Mitigation of this threat shouldn\u2019t just fall on the users, however. The team also suggests that if third party ad networks encrypted the process of exchanging identity information and ensured the data was verified and correct it would help mitigate the threat.\nThe research was presented at ACM CCS\u201922. The paper,\nCart-ology: Intercepting Targeted Advertising via Ad Network Identity Entanglement , is co-authored by SCP Ph.D. student\nChangSeok Oh , Kanich, McCoy, and Pearce. In accordance with ethical research guidelines, the threat was disclosed to Criteo, one of the largest third-party ad networks on the market, as well as Yahoo.\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nCart-ology: Intercepting Targeted Advertising via Ad Network Identity Entanglem\u2026\nContact\nJohn Popham\nCommunications Officer for School of Cybersecurity and Privacy\nEmail\njpopham3@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
