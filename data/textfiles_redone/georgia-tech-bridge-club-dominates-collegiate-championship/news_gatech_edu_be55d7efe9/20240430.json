The event consists of two tournaments, a Teams Championship and a Pairs Championship, and is organized annually by the American Contract Bridge League (ACBL), the premier bridge organization in North America.\nIn the Teams Championship, after a preliminary round of matches, Tech defeated teams from Washington University in St. Louis in the quarterfinals and from the University of California at Santa Barbara in the semifinals. The finals pitted Georgia Tech against Carnegie Mellon University. After trailing slightly halfway through the match, Tech regained the lead and won the match 70-59. This is the second North American Collegiate Teams Championship won by Georgia Tech in a face-to-face tournament. Tech had previously won the title in\n2017 in Toronto .\nSpurred on by the victory, Tech players dominated the Pairs Championship. Bo Han \u201cBruce\u201d Zhu and Vincent Zhu (no relation) came in first overall. This is an encore for Bo Han, who won the\nPairs Championship last year\nplaying with Richard Jeng. Additionally, two other Georgia Tech players, Weilong Shen and Alan Yu, came in second overall and first in the 0-99 MP bracket. When combined, these results make the 2023 Collegiate Bridge Championships the most successful ever in the history of the Bridge Club at Georgia Tech.\n\" It was really gratifying to win,\u201d said Vincent Zhu. \u201cAfter not doing well the last two years, seeing all my training and practice pay off was super rewarding.\u201d\nZhu has been playing bridge since he discovered the game at his local library the summer before fourth grade. \u201cI was instantly hooked, and I have been playing on and off ever since.\u201d\nWhat he enjoys most about the game is meeting new people. \u201cBridge is played in multiples of four, so there are always opportunities to make new friends every time I play.\u201d\nThe mission of the Bridge Club at Georgia Tech is to promote the game to Tech students. Some students play bridge to relax, while others play as a competitive sport. The Bridge Club welcomes all players, as well as anyone who may not be familiar with the game and would like to learn.\n\u201cI\u2019d like students to know that bridge isn\u2019t just a cliche game for old folks, and that plenty of young people also play,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ll never know if you\u2019ll like bridge until you try it, so give it a shot!\u201d\nDuring fall and spring semesters, the club hosts twice-weekly casual games on campus (Thursdays, 6-9 p.m., and Fridays, 3-6 p.m.).
