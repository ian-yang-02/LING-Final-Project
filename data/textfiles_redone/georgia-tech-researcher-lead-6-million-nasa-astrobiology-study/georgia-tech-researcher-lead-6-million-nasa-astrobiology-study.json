Over time, evolving cells enriched the living world with an astonishing diversity of new shapes and biochemical innovations, all made possible by compartments.\nCompartmentalization is how all\u00a0living systems\u00a0are organized today\u00a0\u2014\u00a0from proteins and small molecules sharing space in separate phases\u00a0to\u00a0dividing labor and specialized functions\u00a0within and among cells.\nNow, with $6 million in support from\nNASA , a team of researchers led by Georgia Tech\u2019s\nFrank Rosenzweig\nwill study the organizing principles of compartmentalization in a five-year project called Engine of Innovation: How Compartmentalization Drives Evolution of Novelty and Efficiency Across Scales .\nIt's one of seven new projects selected recently by NASA as part of its\nInterdisciplinary Consortia for Astrobiology Research (ICAR) program . ICAR is embedded among NASA\u2019s five\nAstrobiology Research Coordination Networks (RCNs).\nRosenzweig is co-lead for the RCN launched in 2022,\nLIFE: Early Cells to Multicellularity .\n\u201cWe\u2019re excited by the prospect of exploring this fundamental question through the interplay of theory and experiment,\u201d said Rosenzweig, professor in the\nSchool of Biological Sciences , whose team of co-Investigators includes biochemists, geologists, cell biologists, and theoreticians from leading NASA research centers: Jeff Cameron, Shelley Copley, Alexis Templeton, and Boswell Wing from the University of Colorado Boulder; Josh Goldford and Victoria Orphan from California Institute of Technology; and John McCutcheon from Arizona State University. Collaborating with them is Chris Kempes, professor at the Santa Fe Institute.\nRosenzweig is also eager to eventually collaborate with existing ICAR teams, such as\nMUSE , led by the University of Wisconsin\u2019s Bet\u00fcl Ka\u00e7ar, a former Georgia Tech postdoctoral researcher, and newly selected teams, such as Retention of Habitable Atmospheres in Planetary Systems, led by Dave Brain at University of Colorado Boulder.\nMeanwhile, he plans to build upon Georgia Tech\u2019s outstanding reputation in astrobiology, where a cluster of researchers, such as\nJen Glass ,\nNick Hud ,\nThom Orlando ,\nAmanda Stockton , and\nLoren Williams , among others, is engaged in a diverse range of work supported by NASA.\n\u201cThis is just the latest chapter in a long history of excellence in NASA research at Georgia Tech, one written by my colleagues across the Institute,\u201d Rosenzweig said.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nJerry Grillo |\u00a0 jerry.grillo@ibb.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
