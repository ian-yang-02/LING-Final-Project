A tiny mutation in a roundworm says they may well.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nEmail\nPatrick McGrath holds up dishes with two lab strains of the C. elegans roundworm. Strain LSJ2 (dish on right) dramatically changed its survival strategy to live longer and have fewer offspring due to a tiny mutation on its NURF-1 gene. Researchers at Georgia Tech confirmed the effects of the mutation by duplicating it in lab strain N2 (dish on left) via an injection with CRISPR Cas9.\nJul 28, 2016\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nIn tough times, humans aren\u2019t the only species that think twice about having children.\u00a0 Consider roundworm strain LSJ2. Though it can\u2019t think \u2013 much less think twice -- about anything, the laboratory worm underwent a surprising mutation that made it prioritize the survival of adults over creating abundant offspring.\u00a0 Researchers noticed the sweeping change in behavior, and the mutation, after LSJ2 had faced hardship for 50 years. Such so-called life history trade-offs have been described in many living things from mice to elephants, but now, for the first known time, researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology have pinned some to a specific mutation. \u201cThis is a great hint at how life history trade-offs could be regulated genetically,\u201d said lead researcher Patrick McGrath, an assistant professor in Georgia Tech\u2019s School of Biological Sciences. The researchers confirmed the link in LSJ2, a strain of the\nC. elegans\nspecies, by duplicating the mutation in another strain, which reproduced the mutation\u2019s effects to a very high degree. The researchers published their results\nin the journal PLOS Genetics\non Thursday, July 28, 2016.\u00a0 Their work has been funded by the National Institutes of Health and the Ellison Medical Foundation. Snowball to avalanche The mutation in the LSJ2 strain amounted to a small deletion in its DNA.\u00a0 As a result, a large protein changed by a meager 10 of its roughly 3,000 amino acids. But that triggered a huge behavioral overhaul that boosted lifespan and slowed down reproduction.\u00a0 The contrast between the minor genetic tweak and its transformative ramifications might compare well with a toddler knocking loose an avalanche with a snowball. The new discovery also has a tangential connection to human genetics.\u00a0 The roundworm shares with us the NURF-1 gene, on which the mutation occurred.\u00a0 And an associated human protein is involved in, among other things, reproduction. Evolve faster, please All at once, LSJ2 did a lot of peculiar things, and that got the attention of McGrath and his team. And that\u2019s what the lab roundworms are there for. Since 1951, generations of scientists have been speeding up the evolution of lab-bound\nC. elegans\nby forcing the microscopic species of roundworms to adapt to new, mostly stressful, conditions.\u00a0 Then, when researchers have noticed changes, they\u2019ve worked to trace them to the animals\u2019 genes. McGrath points to a thin, glass slide standing vertically under a light with tubules of fluid connected to it.\u00a0 Inside the slide, is a different lab strain of\nC. elegans . \u201cWe\u2019re raising those in fluid with gravity pulling them down to see if mutations will give them the ability to swim,\u201d McGrath said. 50 years of bread and water In the case of LSJ2, researchers came up with a different challenge to accelerate its evolution. They fed it bland food for 50 years. \u201cIt\u2019s a diet of watery soy extract with some beef liver extract,\u201d said Wen Xu, a graduate student who researches with McGrath.\u00a0 Sounds yucky enough to humans, but to the roundworm, it's worse. It equates to a regimen of bread and water. Mutations eventually took hold to promote LSJ2\u2019s survival in the scanty broth, and they were head-turning. Fewer kids, less sleep \u201cThe stark thing that we noticed first was the propensity to no longer enter the state called dauer,\u201d McGrath said.\u00a0 It\u2019s a kind of hyper-hibernation.\u00a0 \u201cDauer is something most\nC. elegans\ndo to extend their lives, but LSJ2 did not.\u00a0 And it lived longer in spite of it.\u201d Then the list of anomalies grew, and grew. \u201cWe found that almost everything was affected \u2013 when they started reproducing, how many offspring they made, how long they lived,\u201d McGrath said.\u00a0 Some even survived exposure to drugs and heavy metals. \u201cEventually we realized that the worms were prioritizing individual survival over reproductive rate.\u201d Mutation sleuthing In many species, sex dries up when food is scarce, resulting in fewer progeny to compete for it.\u00a0 In addition, many organisms are well-equipped to manage their energies to survive dearth. But\nC. elegans\nLSJ2 had to mutate into those abilities, and so many mutation-based behavioral changes all at once is uncommon. \u201cWhat you usually find is mutations that play narrow, very specific roles,\u201d McGrath said.\u00a0 \u201cThey only affect egg laying, or they only affect life span, or they only affect dauer formation.\" McGrath and Xu went sleuthing for DNA alterations by mapping quantitative trait loci, which matches up changes in characteristics to genetic changes.\u00a0 They dug in for a long investigation, anticipating multiple suspects among LSJ2\u2019s many mutations. \u201cThere were hundreds of genetic differences between roundworm strain LSJ2 and the one we were comparing it to,\u201d McGrath said. \u2018Smoking gun\u2019 The comparison laboratory strain is called N2, and it has led a pampered existence with a diet of\nE. coli\n-- optimal food for\nC. elegans .\u00a0 (Both the\nE. coli\nand the roundworms are strains that are not harmful to humans.) So, N2 hadn\u2019t been pushed to mutate so much. In addition, to avoid confusion in their research results, the researchers reset some of the mutations N2 did happen to undergo. The comparison led to swift evidence in LSJ2.\u00a0 \u201cEvery single time, it pointed us to the same genetic region on the right arm of chromosome 2,\u201d McGrath said.\nC. elegans\nhas six chromosomes. \u201cThere were only five genes that were candidates.\u00a0 One of the mutations was a smoking gun -- a 60-base-pair deletion just at the end of the NURF-1 gene.\u201d NURF-1 has the function of remodeling chromatin, which pairs DNA with proteins to wrap them into chromosomes.\u00a0 The resulting configurations strongly influence which genes are expressed. It appears the tiny mutation in the remodeling gene may have led to a massive change in the expression of other genes. There are missing pieces needed to understand the pathway from the mutated gene to the massive real-life changes, and the researchers are working to fill them in. Worm whoopy To confirm the mutation as the trigger of the changes, Xu deployed a CRISPR Cas9 gene editor into N2 worms to make the deletion that LSJ2 had received via mutation, and the results left little doubt. \u201cIt had a lot of the same effects \u2013 longer life, dauer formation,\u201d Xu said.\u00a0 \u201cThe main difference was the reduction of reproduction rates. It was only about half as much in the comparison worm that got the gene editing.\u201d By the way, as sex goes,\nC. elegans\nare mostly hermaphrodites that produce eggs and their own sperm to fertilize them with.\u00a0 But there are also males that copulate with the hermaphrodites to add new sperm and with it genetic diversity.
