Anemones usually sting,\u00a0kill and eat fish, but not clownfish. Georgia Tech researchers found that the microbial colonies in the slime covering clownfish shifted markedly when the nested in an anemone. Could the microbes be putting out chemical messengers that pacify the fish killer?

That rubbing leads the makeup of microbes covering the clownfish to change,\u00a0 according to a new study .\nHaving bacterial cooties in common with anemones may help the clownfish cozily nest in anemones\u2019 venomous tentacles, a weird symbiosis that life scientists - including now a team from the Georgia Institute of Technology - have tried for decades to figure out. The marine researchers studied how populations of microbes shifted on clownfish who mixed and mingled with fish-killing anemones.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the iconic mutualism between a host and a partner, and we knew that microbes are on every surface of each animal,\u201d said Frank Stewart,\u00a0 an associate professor in Georgia Tech\u2019s School of Biological Sciences . \u201cIn this particular mutualism, these surfaces are covered with stuff that microbes love to eat: mucus.\u201d\nSwabbing mucus\nClownfish and anemones swap lots of mucus when they rub. So, the researchers brought clownfish and anemones together and analyzed the microbes in the mucus covering the fish when they were hosted by anemones and when they weren\u2019t.\n\u201cTheir microbiome changed,\u201d said Zoe Pratte,\u00a0 a postdoctoral researcher in Stewart\u2019s lab \u00a0and first author of the new study. \u201cTwo bacteria that we tracked in particular multiplied with contact with anemones.\u201d\n\u201cOn top of that, there were sweeping changes,\u201d said Stewart, the study\u2019s principal investigator. \u201cIf you looked at the total assemblages of microbes, they looked quite different on a clownfish that was hosted by an anemone and on one that was not.\u201d\nThe researchers chased 12 clownfish in six fish tanks for eight weeks to swab their mucus and identify microbes through gene sequencing. They published their results\u00a0 in the journal\u00a0 Coral Reefs . The research was funded by\u00a0 the Simons Foundation .\nQuestions and Answers\nHere are some questions and answers about the experiment, which produced some amusing anecdotes, along with fascinating facts about anemones and clownfish. For example, fish peeing on anemones makes the latter stronger. Clownfish change genders. And it was especially hard to catch one fish the researchers named \u201cHoudini.\u201d\nDoes this solve the mystery about this strange symbiosis?\nNo, but it\u2019s a new approach to the clownfish-anemone conundrum.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a first step that\u2019s asking the question, \u2018Is there part of the microbial relationship that changes?\u2019\u201d Stewart said. The study delivered the answer on the clownfish side, which was \u201cyes.\u201d\nAn earlier hypothesis on the conundrum held that clownfish mucus was too thick to sting through. Current ideas consider that mucus swapping also covers the clownfish with anemone antigens, i.e. its own immune proteins, or that fish and fish killer may be exchanging chemical messages.\n\u201cThe anemone may recognize some chemical on the clownfish that keeps it from stinging,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cAnd that could involve microbes. Microbes are great chemists.\u201d\nGoing forward, the researchers want to analyze mucus chemistry. They also don\u2019t yet know to what extent the microbes on the fish change because of bacteria the fish gleans from the anemone. It\u2019s possible the fish mucus microbiome just develops differently on the fish due to the contact.\nWhat do anemones normally do to fish?\nKill them and eat them.\n\u201cThe anemone evolved to kill fish. It shoots little poison darts into the skin of a fish to kill it then pull it into its mouth,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cThe clownfish gets away with living right in that.\u201d\nBy the way, the tentacles are not harmful to people.\n\u201cIf you touch an anemone, it feels like they\u2019re sucking on your finger,\u201d Pratte said. \u201cTheir little harpoons feel like they\u2019re sticking to you. It doesn\u2019t hurt.\u201d\nWhat do the anemones and clownfish get out of the relationship?\nFor starters, they protect each other from potential prey. But there\u2019s lots more. Some clownfish even change genders by living in an anemone.\n\u201cWhen they start being hosted, the fish make a big developmental switch,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cThe first fish in a group that establishes itself in an anemone in the wild transitions from male to female, grows much bigger and becomes the dominant member of the group.\u201d\nShe is then the sole female in a school of smaller male mates.\nAnemones appear to grow larger and healthier, partly because the clownfish urinate on them.\n\u201cWhen the fish pee, algae in the anemone take up the nitrogen then secrete sugars that feed the anemone and make it grow,\u201d Pratte said. \u201cSometimes the fish drop their food, and it falls into the anemone which eats it.\u201d\nAny fun anecdotes from this experiment?\nPlenty: It was scientifically straightforward but laborious to carry out, partly because the researchers were taking meticulous care of the fish at the same time.\n\u201cYou have to get fish and anemones to pair up, and the fish can host in other places, like nooks in the rock,\u201d Pratte said.\n\u201cClownfish are smarter than other fish, so they\u2019re harder to catch, especially when we want to minimize stress on the animals,\u201d said Alicia Caughman, an undergraduate research assistant in the\u00a0 School of Biological Science\u2019s Fast Track to Research \u00a0program. \u201cWe named one fish \u2018Houdini.\u2019 He could wiggle between nets and tight spaces and usually outsmart whoever was trying to catch him.\"\n\u201cWe also had 'Bubbles,' who blew a lot of bubbles, 'Biggie' and 'Smalls,' 'Broad,' 'Sheila,' 'Earl,' and 'Flounder,' who liked to flounder (flop around),\u201d Pratte said. Clownfish have differing sizes and details in their stripes, which allow people to tell them apart.\nThe anemone side of the microbial question may prove harder to answer because for all Houdini's wiles, anemones, which are squishy non-vertebrates, are even more trying. They can squeeze into uncomfortable niches or plug up the aquarium drainage, and they also have temperamental microbiomes.\nLike this article?\u00a0 Subscribe to our email newsletter\nAlso\u00a0READ:\u00a0 When boy fish build castles to impress girl fish, boy genes get a rise\nAlso READ: \u00a0 Teeny bacteria do a dirty job to clean a huge fish tank\nThe following researchers coauthored the paper: Nastassia V.
