A soil-erosion solution that mimics a kingfisher\u2019s eyelid. A mosquito-control device that functions like carnivorous plants. These technologies are among the eight finalists in a global competition that asks innovators to create radically sustainable climate-change solutions inspired by the natural world.\nAmong the finalists is Team FullCircle,\na multidisciplinary team from Georgia Institute of Technology . The team wanted to find a more resilient way to harvest renewable energy, so they created a nature-inspired energy generator that produces clean renewable electricity from underwater sea currents.\nThe design was informed by the bell-shaped body of jellyfish, how schools of fish position themselves, how heart valves move liquid, and how kelp blades adapt rapidly to flowing water to maximize photosynthesis. Their goal is to create a more efficient way to generate power, decrease cost, and make this approach available to areas vulnerable to electricity shortage.\nMembers of Team FullCircle are students from the College of Sciences and College of Engineering:\nAnanya Jain, research leader, School of Materials Science and Engineering (MSE)\nKenji Bomar, School of Physics\nHeyinn Rho, MSE\nAnmbus Iqbal, School of Mechanical Engineering\nSara Thomas Mathew, School of Mathematics\nJos\u00e9 Andrade, School of Aerospace Engineering\nSavannah Berry, School of Biological Sciences\nSchool of Biological Sciences Professor Jeannette Yen served as primary faculty mentor.\u00a0 Yen is also director of\u00a0the\nCenter for Biologically Inspired Design at Georgia Tech .\u00a0MSE Professors Preet Singh and Zhong Lin Wang also served as official research mentors. In addition, the team had access to second and third lines of researchers, graduate student advisors, and investors.\nThe team acknowledges the assistance, guidance, and support of various units of Georgia Tech, including:\nCREATE-X at Georgia Tech\nGeorgia Tech Library\nGeorgia Tech Communication Center (CommLab)\nGeorgia Tech LMC CoLab\nMaterials Innovation & Learning Laboratory (MILL)\nScheller College of Business\nSchool of Aerospace Engineering\nSchool of Materials Science and Engineering\nSchool of Mechanical Engineering\nOver 60 teams from 16 countries entered the\nBiomimicry Global Design Challenge , submitting nature-inspired inventions to reverse, mitigate, or adapt to climate change. Finalist teams\u00a0\u2013 four from the U.S. and one each from the Netherlands, Taiwan, Israel, and China\u00a0\u2013\u00a0receive cash prizes and an invitation to the 2018-19 Biomimicry Launchpad, an accelerator that supports the path to commercialization. They will compete for the $100,000\nRay C. Anderson Foundation\nRay of Hope Prize\u00ae.\nRead more about the winners and their innovations here .\nWatch Team FullCircle describe its proposal here.\n\u201cI am so, so, so thrilled!\u201d Yen says. \u201cI can't wait to see what happens next.\u201d\nAccording to Jain, the team will coordinate the engineering project and assemble a prototype remotely, from different parts of the world \u2013 India, Japan, Pakistan, Spain, and the U.S. \u201cWe have a great challenge to be working from different time zones and schedules,\u201d Jain says. \u201cBut we will do our very best and work even harder moving forward.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nContact\nA.
