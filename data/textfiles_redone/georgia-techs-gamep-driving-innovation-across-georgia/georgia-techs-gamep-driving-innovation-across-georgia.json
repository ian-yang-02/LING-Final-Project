For a company in Georgia, that adage became very real when damage to a key piece of machinery threatened its operation. The group helping with the stitch in time was the\nGeorgia Manufacturing Extension Partnership (GaMEP) , a program of Georgia Tech's\nEnterprise Innovation Institute \u00a0that \u2014 for more than 60 years \u2014 has been helping small- to medium-sized manufacturers in Georgia stay competitive and grow, boosting economic development across the state.\nSilon US, a Peachtree City manufacturer that designs and produces engineered compounds used to create a wide range of products \u2014 from automotive applications to building materials, such as PEX piping and wire and cable, was experiencing problems with their extrusion line during a time of increasing customer demand. Problems with the drive mechanism on that extrusion line, a piece of equipment critical to the company\u2019s ability to produce, threatened to shut them down.\u202fWith replacement parts several weeks away, was it safe to continue operating? At what throughput rates? How much collateral damage might be incurred if they continued to operate?\nThat\u2019s when Silon managers turned to GaMEP for help.\nAfter working through ideas with GaMEP\u2019s manufacturing experts, the team installed wireless condition monitoring sensors that provide continuous, real-time insights on their manufacturing assets\u2019 health. With the sensors, Silon was able to find a sweet spot that not only allowed them to continue operating but also kept them from overexerting the equipment, preventing further damage.\nThe solution to that problem has now become a routine part of Silon\u2019s process, as company technicians continue to use this sensor technology for early detection of any deviations or anomalies in the machinery\u2019s health, allowing the company\u2019s maintenance team to proactively respond by adjusting scheduled maintenance to avoid costly downtime.\nGaMEP\u2019s Sean Madhavaraman says, \u201cSilon is more productive than ever and on track for growth.\u202fThe strong results in this challenge are a great example of the decades-long focus of GaMEP to educate and train managers and employees in best practices, to develop and implement the latest technology, and to work together with businesses to find solutions.\u201d\nDaniel Raubenheimer and Matt Gammon, Silon\u2019s general managers, also lauded GaMEP, saying, \u201cGaMEP\u2019s extensive experience within the manufacturing realm has been a great benefit to our company. The wireless condition monitoring sensors allow us to predict future breakdowns and mitigate a potential catastrophe \u2014 allowing us to operate in a safe manner, while saving money, time, and effort.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nContact\nBlair Meeks\nInstitute Communications\nEmail\nBlair.Meeks@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
