The campus representatives were appointed by President \u00c1ngel Cabrera, and the group was tasked with monitoring and assessing the Institute\u2019s progress toward becoming a model campus community for diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). In the months ahead, it will also submit recommendations to\u00a0Cabrera and the Institute\u2019s executive leadership team for consideration in developing strategic actions.\nEnhancing diversity has been one of Cabrera\u2019s top priorities.\u00a0\u201cOur Diversity and Inclusion Council is one of several action steps announced this past summer to deliver on our promise of inclusion,\u201d\nCabrera said in 2020 . \u201cAs outlined in our\u00a0 new strategic plan , we are striving to remove barriers to access and success, and to build an inclusive community where people of all backgrounds have the opportunity to learn and contribute to our mission.\u201d\nSince that initial November meeting, the GTDEIC has launched three working groups comprised of Council members and issue-area experts from across the campus: Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Plan; Campus Climate Assessment; and Covid-19 Impacts on Faculty.\n\u201cA diverse and inclusive campus is an empowered and engaged campus,\u201d said Archie Ervin, vice president for\nInstitute Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion\nand GTDEIC chair. \u201cA focus on diversity helps improve productivity, recruitment, and retention. Through these working groups, we will address immediate areas for DEI improvement.\u201d\nPearl Alexander, executive director of Staff Diversity, Inclusion, and Engagement and GTDEIC vice chair, added, \u201cOne of our groups is crafting a comprehensive DEI plan that will be a blueprint with actionable strategies for implementation within the next five years. Another is redesigning our climate assessment to align with Institute goals for culture transformation, while the third is addressing the impacts of Covid-19 on women faculty and faculty of color. Each working group\u2019s co-leads are working methodically and inclusively to identify strategies that will close gaps and deliver the greatest DEI impact possible. There will be many opportunities for leading, modeling, and living our values to make significant and lasting change.\u201d\nThe Working Groups\nThe Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Plan Working Group is developing a blueprint that mobilizes the DEI-related objectives of the new strategic plan, which include: amplify our impact, champion innovation, connect globally, expand access, cultivate well-being, and lead by example. The group will work across three focus areas: creating an inclusive and equitable community; recruiting, retaining, and developing a diverse community of students, faculty, and staff; and supporting innovative and inclusive scholarship and teaching. The final draft of the blueprint will be submitted to Cabrera for review by the beginning of June. The group\u2019s efforts will be supported by\nGeorgia Tech Strategic Consulting\n(GTSC).\n\u201cDiversity today unlocks innovation tomorrow and creates unlimited opportunities for our students, faculty, and staff,\u201d said Rashaad Owens Sr., GTSC consultant. \u201cI believe Georgia Tech is poised for a brighter future with its renewed commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion in the new strategic plan.\u201d\nThe Campus Climate Assessment Working Group will be led by Keona Lewis, associate director of Institute Diversity Research, and Joseph Ludlum, assistant director for Academic Effectiveness.\n\u201cOne of the most enlightening tools we have for identifying racial and gender\u00a0disparities\u00a0is our campus\u00a0climate survey,\u201d Lewis said. Originally developed between 2011 and 2013, the survey has provided\u00a0valuable information on individual and community\u00a0experiences\u00a0and their impact on people\u2019s sense of belonging at Tech. \u201cOver the past eight years, we have used what we have learned to address\u00a0issues such as racial discrimination and bias and\u00a0the lack\u00a0of opportunities for the\u00a0professional development of women\u00a0staff \u2014 and launching Leading Women@Tech,\u00a0the Inclusive\u00a0Leader's\u00a0Academy,\u00a0and workshops\u00a0to address bias in hiring promotion retention.\u201d\nThe group\u2019s\u00a0goal is to create new research questions\u00a0to capture data\u00a0needed to measure the\u00a0strategic plan\u2019s DEI goals as well as the impact of current initiatives and programming. The Campus Climate Assessment group has formed three sub-teams for survey revisions: faculty, staff, and students. \u201cThis will allow us to measure our progress on achieving many of the new DEI objectives in the strategic\u00a0plan through an exploration of the lived experiences of the Georgia Tech community,\u201d Lewis said.\nThere are many reasons to be concerned about the short-and long-term impacts of Covid-19 on the well-being and advancement of faculty. \u201cData strongly suggest that the pandemic might exacerbate existing structural inequities in academia, as the burden of caregiving, differential access to resources, and mental health challenges exact a higher toll on women and underrepresented minority groups,\u201d said Dana Randall, ADVANCE Professor for the College of Computing. \u201cFor this reason, the\nADVANCE Professors\nformed this working group to develop a systemic approach to mitigating the impacts of the pandemic on the well-being and career progression of women faculty at Tech.\u201d\n\u201cThe overarching themes and outcomes we expect from a working group are twofold,\u201d Kim Cobb, ADVANCE Professor for the College of Sciences, added. \u201cFirst, our effort will aim to prevent the impending loss of women and underrepresented minority faculty from Georgia Tech, either through recruitment elsewhere, negative tenure or promotion outcomes, or by choice due to dissatisfaction with current working conditions and opportunities for advancement. Second, we will aim to improve the well-being and support for those faculty most negatively affected.\u201d\nThe Covid-19 Impacts on Faculty Working Group will be co-chaired by an ADVANCE Professor and another member of the GTDEIC, with approximately 10 additional tenure-track faculty members. Specific areas the group plans to tackle include: campus climate and workplace satisfaction, promotion and tenure, retention, and the coordination of research and activities around Covid-19 and its impact on faculty.\n\u201cEstablishing the GTDEIC represents the Institute\u2019s commitment to engage all sectors of the Tech community,\u201d Ervin said. \u201cBy identifying opportunities to achieve our aspirations for an inclusive community, and by demonstrating our value to be a community that thrives on diversity as a critical element of campus culture and climate, we are doing just that.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nContact\nCourtney Hill\nCommunications Manager\nInstitute Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion\ncourtney.hill@gatech.edu\nEmail\ncourtney.hill@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
