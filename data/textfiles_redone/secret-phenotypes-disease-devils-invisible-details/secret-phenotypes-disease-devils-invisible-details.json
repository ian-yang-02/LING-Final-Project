Yet, more important findings,\u00a0medically relevant ones,\u00a0may be hiding in traits invisible to the\u00a0eye, even with the best\u00a0microscope.\nResearchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology are exposing these secrets --\u00a0micron-sized bumps and grooves -- and the intricate web of gene mutations possibly behind them in high detail. Their computational genetics\u00a0work using digital optics could prove useful to understanding debilitating disorders.\n\u201cWhen these faint mutations come together, it gives you a ginormous boost in disease risk,\u201d said\nHang Lu, a professor\nwho applies engineering and data science to the study of neurology.\nNeurological\u00a0disorder: Brain often\u00a0looks\u00a0normal\n\u201cIf you look at psychiatric diseases, anything that is relevant to humans, what you see is not that dramatic,\u201d Lu said. \u201cBrains of people who had\nschizophrenia , bipolar disorder, or autism don\u2019t look physically very different from healthy brains. It\u2019s not like they\u2019re missing a chunk.\u201d\nResearchers led by Lu at Georgia Tech\u2019s\nSchool of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering\nhave developed algorithms and special microscope slide\u00a0to expose previously unseen neurological nuances and intricate mutations that may be behind them. But their findings could apply as well to\u00a0computational genetics research pursuing\u00a0other\ndiseases such as\u00a0autoimmune disorders .\nLu and former Georgia Tech researcher\nAdrianna San-Miguel \u00a0published their latest results on Wednesday, November 23, 2016,\nin the journal\nNature Communications . Their research was funded by the National Institute of General Medicine, and the National Institute on Aging, both agencies of the National Institutes of Health.\nSeeing dots: Computers spot subtleties\nLu has replaced the fallible human eye with a\u00a0proficient computer to pin down faintest phenotypes, the geneticist\u2019s term for physical traits based on genes.\u00a0In the latest experiment, nerve proteins were marked to appear as dots on\u00a0roundworms' undersides for the computer to scan.\nWhen mutations occur, the dots can change ever so slightly.\u00a0\u201cTo the naked eye, they\u2019re just dots on a dark background,\u201d Lu said. But the computer sees in them phenotypical shifts.\nRoundworm\nCaenorbabditis elegans ,\nused in the experiment, helps scientists understand what may be\u00a0going on in humans, because its nerves share strong\u00a0similarities with ours.\u00a0Ultimately, Lu wants the insights gained in studying them to lead to localizing\u00a0genetic biomarkers for diseases in humans.\nSynaptic puncta: Glowing green tags\nThe Georgia Tech scientists narrowed their focus to\nsynapses on a single neuron\nwhere it connects to muscles. These \u201c synaptic puncta \u201d were tagged with a glowing green protein to form the dots.\nSome mutations did cause big shifts\u00a0in dot position and size that the naked eye could actually pick up. And traditionally, forward geneticists -- geneticists who follow changes in phenotypes to see if they can find genes that cause them -- have used their eyes and microscopes to pick out such really obvious changes.\nBut natural limitations on human perception have introduced a bias, Lu said. Her research aims to reduce it\u00a0to boost\u00a0the amount of data scientists can gather.\nMutant bias: It looks funny\nHere\u2019s how the bias roughly works. Sorting mutants from non-mutants in the lab is usually tedious with the tiny worms, and that has consequences for science.\n\u201cThe normal way of doing it would be to take a little platinum wire and literally go under the microscope, pick up a worm, drug it, mount it on a slide, and then you have to recover it alive, if you think it's interesting,\u201d Lu said.\nThe tedium plus the limited abilities of the human eye lead researchers looking for mutations to single out worms that are markedly odd. Eye-popping phenotypes are namely likely to be caused by genotypic changes, i.e. mutations, so finding a clear phenotype is likely to lead to a successful research outcome.\nStochasticity: Not a mutant\nAs a result, researchers might overlook subtle samples. In addition, amassing enough of them to determine important nuances may prove too difficult to do, and quirks can get in the way, too. For example, a single weird-looking worm might not be a mutant at all.\n\u201cYou can always find a \u2018 wildtype \u2019 (basically normal worm) that looks nothing at all like a wildtype,\u201d Lu said.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s just a crazy wildtype. Genotypically, it looks like everybody else, but phenotypically it\u2019s so different.\"\nWhy? Because nature can be stochastic \u2013 sort of random -- and mess up an individual worm, even when there\u2019s no mutated gene.\nPhenospace: A world revealed\nLooks can deceive the eye, but they\u2019re less likely to fool a high-resolution camera connected to a computer and an\nalgorithm that statistically examines\nfaint variations in order to sort mutants from non-mutants.\nLu\u2019s technique works via a transparent slide with tiny tubes that suck in one worm at a time under the computer's microscope. \u201cThen we freeze the worm for a moment, so we can take its picture,\u201d Lu said. \u201cThen it unfreezes, and it\u2019s totally okay.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a fork in the tube holding the worm. If the algorithm detects a mutant based on its synaptic puncta pattern in the image \u2013 even if this is not visible to the eye \u2013 the worm gets sucked down the first\u00a0path for further study. If it isn\u2019t a mutant, it gets sucked down the second\u00a0path.\nIn the latest experiment, the algorithm analyzed phenotypic variations in the synaptic\u00a0puncta of large worm populations. Parallel to that, the worms' genomes were analyzed to determine which phenotypical differences may be connected to mutated genes.\nThen the researchers mapped out genotypes in relation to the differences in phenotypes they underpinned. What was so nuanced before that it was virtually invisible, turned out to be a large, filigree web.\nSilent affliction: Poor little worm\nThen there was a particularly lucky find that made for a good metaphor for the study and its potential to advance research. The scientists stumbled upon a very subtle allele \u2013 a variation of a gene caused by mutation.\nThe worms that had the allele\u00a0were real mutants, but no one would have guessed it, because to the eye, they were\u00a0completely\u00a0neat and normal. They even behaved normally at first glance, and the researchers thought the computer may have sorted them out as mutants by mistake -- until a hitch turned up.\n\u201cAfter they swam for about 40 minutes, they got really, really weak and couldn\u2019t swim well anymore,\u201d Lu said. The allele\u00a0seemed to be associated with some kind of neurological disorder.\n\u201cSeen as a metaphor, this is an example of how you might identify something that is relevant to a disease but incredibly subtle,\u201d she said, \u201cand you would never\u00a0have found it using eyes and a microscope.\u201d\nThe research paper was coauthored by Matthew M.
