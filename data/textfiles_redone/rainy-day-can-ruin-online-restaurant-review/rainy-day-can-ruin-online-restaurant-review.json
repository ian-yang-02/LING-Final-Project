Their study shows evaluations written on rainy or snowy days, or very cold or hot days, are more negative than those written on nice days. \u201cPeople love to describe themselves as foodies. But in the end, it looks like we\u2019re all weather people, whether we realize it or not,\u201d said Saeideh Bakhshi, a Georgia Tech College of Computing Ph.D. candidate who led the study. The study\nalso found a nationwide spike in the number of reviews written during the summer, but July and August were the worst months of the year for ratings. November was the best. \u201cThe best reviews are written on sunny days between 70 and 100 degrees,\u201d said Bakhshi. \u201cScience has shown that weather impacts our mood, so a nice day can lead to a nice review. A rainy day can mean a miserable one.\u201d The study covered a period of 10 years of reviews on sites that included Foursquare, Citysearch and TripAdvisor. It also found that demographic factors such as neighborhood diversity, education levels and population density have a significant impact. For instance, areas with a high percentage of people with college degrees (more than 50 percent) average nearly three times more reviews than places where fewer than 10 percent have diplomas. However, higher education levels don\u2019t have much of an effect on ratings. The study shows that population density of cities is closely tied to the expectations of service options. Based on reviews in busy cities, people are more patient with wait times and expect restaurants to have delivery options. In smaller cities, carryout service was rated more positively than places with delivery, but reviewers were harsher on pace of service. \u201cWe also found that restaurants in the Northeast and Pacific get more reviews than places in the South and Midwest,\u201d Bakhshi added. \u201cI think the difference between the South and Pacific comes mostly from the differences in education, diversity and liberal versus conservative. Blue states such as California, Washington and Oregon have a higher number of reviews per restaurant.\u201d The research team also included\nEric Gilbert , an assistant professor in Georgia Tech\u2019s School of Interactive Computing, and Partha Kanuparthy, a Yahoo Labs research scientist and 2012 Ph.D. Georgia Tech graduate in computer science. \u201cOur findings could help consumers better understand online reviews and ratings and help review sites calibrate recommendations,\u201d said Gilbert. \u201cOutside factors apparently introduce bias in online ratings of a highly reviewed restaurant in big cities compared to a similar place in a rural area.\u201d As for the ultimate \u201coutside factor,\u201d Kanuparthy says restaurants face the same challenge as everyone else. \u201cYou can plan the best wedding or birthday party. Restaurants can serve great food and provide spectacular service,\u201d he notes. \u201cBut no one can control the weather. In the end, you can\u2019t beat Mother Nature.\u201d Bakhshi will present the findings on April 10 during the\n23rd\nInternational World Wide Web Conference\nin Seoul, South Korea.\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nMore Eric Gilbert Research\nContact\nJason Maderer Media Relations maderer@gatech.edu 404-385-2966\nEmail\nmaderer@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
