Scientists from engineering, biology, chemistry, and computing won\u2019t discover new vaccines and medical devices \u2014 or advance what we know about diseases \u2014 by working on their own. The next biomedical breakthroughs to provide accessible health care for billions of people worldwide will come from the collaboration between different laboratories and disciplines. That core belief led to the creation of the Engineered Biosystems Building (EBB), the newest building at the Georgia Institute of Technology. The site opened in May and a formal dedication ceremony was held today.\u00a0 EBB houses labs for research in chemical biology, cell and developmental biology, and systems biology. The building allows Georgia Tech to consolidate its biomedical research efforts in the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of cancer, diabetes, heart disease, infections, and other life-threatening conditions. President G.P. \u201cBud\u201d Peterson said the building symbolizes what Georgia Tech is all about \u2014 collaboration and innovation. \u201cThe EBB will drive innovation and have an undeniable impact on biomedical science and human health,\u201d Peterson said. \u201cEBB brings together some of the world\u2019s finest researchers in a collaborative environment, and these collaborations will result in incredible breakthroughs.\u201d The building provides nearly 219,000 square feet of multidisciplinary research space and enhances the Institute\u2019s partnerships with Emory University Hospital and with Children\u2019s Healthcare of Atlanta. \u201cTogether, we are changing the lives of children,\u201d said Donna Hyland, president and CEO of Children\u2019s Healthcare. \u201cThe space within this building helps bring our new Pediatric Technology Center to life and gives researchers another place to combine expertise in clinical care, research, and technology to solve problems that will help make kids better today and healthier tomorrow.\u201d The building is located on 10th Street, at the north end of the existing biotechnology complex. Other buildings in the complex include: the Parker H. Petit Institute for Bioengineering and Bioscience, the U.A. Whitaker Biomedical Engineering Building, the Ford Environmental Science and Technology Building, and the Molecular Science and Engineering Building. More than 140 faculty and nearly 1,000 graduate students from 10 different academic units work in the labs and facilities there. \u201cEBB puts Georgia Tech at the forefront of biosciences and bioengineering research,\u201d said M.G. Finn, professor and chair of the School of Chemistry and Biochemistry. The building\u2019s unique design allows Georgia Tech researchers to expand their work, he said. EBB contains \u201cresearch neighborhoods\u201d designed around a specific focus or topic. These neighborhoods bring together scientists, engineers, and researchers from different disciplines around common themes or areas of interest. They share laboratories, offices, and common spaces. Stairs alternate on various floors, encouraging people to move within the neighborhoods and throughout the building and interact with one another. Small and informal meeting areas are located near the stairwells, to further encourage researchers to talk with one another. \u201cWe will help, influence, and support one another and bring new insights in a way that can\u2019t happen if a building is restricted to a particular department or discipline,\u201d Finn said. \u201cUltimately we are all working to fight disease and save lives,\u201d he said. \u201cEBB is designed to foster the research to do just that.\u201d EBB is the largest building investment in Georgia Tech history. The $113 million building was made possible because of a partnership between the Institute, the Georgia Tech Foundation, and the State of Georgia, Peterson said. State appropriations provided $64 million for the project. Georgia Tech provided $15 million in Institute funds, and private funding raised another $34 million in commitments pledged over five years. EBB will help drive Georgia\u2019s economy, Peterson said. \u201cIt will foster economic development through the formation of startup enterprises, the creation of high-skilled, high-paying jobs, and the commercialization of new devices, drugs, and technologies,\u201d Peterson said.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nLaura Diamond\u00a0 Georgia Tech Media Relations 404-894-6016\nEmail\nlaura.diamond@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
