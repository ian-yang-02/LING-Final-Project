Now, new research published by the Georgia Institute of Technology shows how that smoke could impact the atmosphere and climate much more than previously thought.\nResearchers have found that carbon particles released into the air from burning trees and other organic matter are much more likely than previously thought to travel to the upper levels of the atmosphere, where they can interfere with rays from the sun \u2013 sometimes cooling the air and at other times warming it.\n\u201cMost of the brown carbon released into the air stays in the lower atmosphere, but a fraction of it does get up into the upper atmosphere, where it has a disproportionately large effect on the planetary radiation balance \u2013 much stronger than if it was all at the surface,\u201d said Rodney Weber, a professor in Georgia Tech\u2019s School of Earth & Atmospheric Sciences.\nThe study, which was published May 22 in the journal\nNature Geoscience , was sponsored by the NASA Radiation Sciences Program and the NASA Tropospheric Composition Program.\nThe researchers analyzed air samples collected in 2012 and 2013 by NASA aircraft from the upper troposphere \u2013 about seven miles above the earth\u2019s surface \u2013 at locations across the United States. They found surprising levels of brown carbon in the samples but much less black carbon.\nWhile black carbon can be seen in the dark smoke plumes rising above burning fossil or biomass fuels at high temperature, brown carbon is produced from the incomplete combustion that occurs when grasses, wood or other biological matter smolders, as is typical for wildfires. As particulate matter in the atmosphere, both can interfere with solar radiation by absorbing and scattering the sun\u2019s rays.\nThe climate is more sensitive to those particulates as their altitude increases. The researchers found that brown carbon appears much more likely than black carbon to travel through the air to the higher levels of the atmosphere where it can have a greater impact on climate.\n\u201cPeople have always assumed that when you emit this brown carbon, over time it goes away,\u201d said Athanasios Nenes, a professor and Georgia Power Scholar in the School of Earth & Atmospheric Sciences and the School of Chemical & Biomolecular Engineering.\nAfter the brown carbon is carried by smoke plumes into the lower atmosphere, it mixes with clouds. Then it hitches a ride on the deep convection forces that exist in clouds to travel to the upper atmosphere.\nAlthough the researchers couldn\u2019t explain how, they also found that during the journey through the clouds, the brown carbon became more concentrated relative to black carbon.\n\u201cThe surprise here is that the brown carbon gets promoted when you go through the cloud, compared to black carbon,\u201d Nenes said. \u201cThis suggests that there may be in-cloud production of brown carbon that we were not aware of before.\u201d\nThis material is based upon work supported by the NASA Radiation Sciences Program under grant No. NNX14AP74G and the NASA Tropospheric Composition Program under grant Nos.
