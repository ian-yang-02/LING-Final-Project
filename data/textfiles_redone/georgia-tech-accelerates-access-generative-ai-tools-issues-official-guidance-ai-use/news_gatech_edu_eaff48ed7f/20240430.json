The Office of Information Technology (OIT) has also issued guidance for responsible adoption and use of genAI tools.\nThe Copilot chat tool offers text, graphic, and code generation with commercial data protection. The tool delivers the same GPT 4.0 capabilities as other popular genAI tools like ChatGPT without leveraging Georgia Tech data to train its model. Copilot also provides copyright protection and ensures that any content generated using the tool is the intellectual property of Georgia Tech.\n\u201cAs with the rollout of any new and emerging technology , we want to ensure each tool offers the best protection for our Institute data and intellectual property, while also providing a variety of features and capabilities,\u201d said\nLeo Howell,\ninterim vice president for Information Technology and chief information officer. \u201cWith this in mind, we collaborated with the Office of General Counsel, Cyber Security, and Institute Communications to develop guidance around data privacy and security best practices as well as a set of dos and don\u2019ts when leveraging genAI.\u201d\nThe guidance advises against using tools that have not been reviewed and approved by OIT or sharing various types of data in AI tools. Data includes, but is not limited to, personally identifiable information such as name, social security number, and date of birthday, and FERPA data, which includes any student information. Other dos and don\u2019ts include:\nDO \u00a0verify the accuracy and validity of AI-generated content with reliable sources.\nDO \u00a0regularly review and comply with AI guidance and key Georgia Tech data policies ( Data Privacy Policy ,\u00a0 Personal Information Privacy Policy ,\u00a0 Data Governance and Management Policy , \u00a0and\u00a0 Protected Data Practices ).\nDON\u2019T\u00a0 assume that generated content is free of another entity\u2019s intellectual property. Familiarize yourself with the service\u2019s copyright terms.\n\u201cBecause of the rapidly evolving nature of AI, we expect this guidance to expand over the next several months,\u201d said Howell.\nOIT\u2019s future state road map includes other AI service offerings such as Copilot for Microsoft 365, which integrates with popular Office tools like Word, PowerPoint, and Excel, and the advanced Microsoft Azure OpenAI platform, which allows developers to build and\ntrain their own custom AI models. An interdisciplinary team will investigate other tools, explore AI capabilities within existing technology services, strengthen adoption efforts, and build out governance and ethical frameworks for AI at Georgia Tech.\n\u201cWe have laid the groundwork for rolling out generative AI services through a series of small educational workshops in some of our administrative spaces and the development of general use guidance,\u201d said Howell.\n\u201cThe goal of the interdisciplinary team is to bring together voices from across academic, research, student life, and administrative areas to scale our efforts and explore the enterprise use of other generative AI tools at Georgia Tech.\u201d\nTo view official guidance on AI use or learn more about generative AI tools, visit\noit.gatech.edu/ai .\nContact\nMalynda Dorsey Smith\nSenior Director, IT Organizational Change Management & Communications\nmalynda@gatech.edu\nEmail\nmalynda@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
