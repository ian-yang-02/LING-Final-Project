Before the painting can start, however, students are being asked to complete a\nsurvey\nabout what they think should be included in it. The survey will be open until Wednesday, Sept. 30, with the mural scheduled for completion by the Spring 2021 semester.\nSinet Adous, a fourth-year international affairs major, got the idea for an on-campus mural after spending the spring of her second year working with Living Walls Atlanta, an organization that creates public art displays across the metro Atlanta area.\n\u201cThrough my experience engaging with the murals around Atlanta, I noticed more aggressively than ever just how separate Georgia Tech felt from the city,\u201d said Adous. \u201cI wanted to bridge this culture gap through art.\u201d\nAdous also wants the mural to reflect the diversity of the Georgia Tech experience.\n\u201cI couldn't find many representations of people who looked like me or shared my same interests upon first matriculating at Tech,\u201d she said. \u201cOver time, however, I found our student community is richly diverse in more ways than one: in identities, passions, skills, and interests. I wished this was more obvious to me when I began my journey here.\u201d\nLast spring, the Student Government Association\u2019s Undergraduate House of Representatives approved funding for the mural through the\nMental Health Joint Allocation Committee . After that, the Georgia Tech administration approved the project.\n\u201cI hope this mural can reflect the spirit of our Georgia Tech student community, bring to life all the ways diversity manifests in our community, and bring us closer to the larger city of Atlanta,\u201d Adous said. \u201cWe are a vibrant people. We ought to paint it on a wall.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nContact\nGrace Wyner\nInstitute Communications\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
