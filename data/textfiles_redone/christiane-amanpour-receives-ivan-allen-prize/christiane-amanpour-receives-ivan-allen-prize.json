She has been outspoken in calling out human rights abuses and is renowned for holding powerful leaders accountable. For these reasons Amanpour is the recipient of the 2023\nIvan Allen Jr. Prize for Social Courage .\nBefore attending a luncheon to accept the award, Amanpour participated in candid conversations during a Q&A with Georgia Tech students and a fireside chat with the campus community moderated by CNN correspondent Tom Foreman.\n\u201cWe\u2019re on a university campus,\u201d Amanpour said during the chat, \u201cand around campuses across the United States there has been a tendency toward less openness and more canceled culture. People are shying away or not wanting to hear things that they don\u2019t agree with. I think that\u2019s a shame. And I think that\u2019s a problem in terms of where else you\u2019re going to get this opportunity. When else in your life are you going to get the opportunity to hear a whole range of things that you may or may not agree with?\u201d\nForeman asked Amanpour for her thoughts on the widespread belief that American viewers are not interested in certain international news stories because \u201cthat\u2019s not our fight.\u201d Amanpour disagreed.\n\u201cI believe that our mission as journalists \u2014 once we understand what we\u2019re doing \u2014 is actually to build that relationship between the people and the things that we\u2019re covering,\u201d she said. \u201cTo build the relationship between those stories, those things that are happening, and those who are watching, listening, or reading online. Then, perhaps, they will feel moved to talk to their Congressperson.\u201d\nShe continued, \u201cThe reason the United States and Europe went all in for Ukraine was not because they suddenly saw the light of international law. It is because the people in all those countries, including in this country, were moved to be outraged. It was a grassroots movement that could cause the action. It\u2019s our business to keep these stories alive and I\u2019ve always believed if you tell these stories well, everybody will watch.\u201d\nPresenting the Ivan Allen Jr. Prize for Social Courage\nTwo of her longtime colleagues and friends, Foreman and veteran journalist Parisa Khosravi, spoke about her achievements and delivered a message from Tom Johnson, retired president of CNN.\n\u201cAlmost every world leader has been interviewed by Christiane,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cSome of them, like President Bill Clinton, found her interview with him so tough that he complained to CNN. In recent years, the only interview that I know she has not been able to secure has been with President Putin of Russia. One Russian friend explained why Putin declined. \u2018I simply think he may be afraid of her.\u2019\u201d\nPresenting the award to Amanpour, President \u00c1ngel Cabrera, said, \u201cReporting isn\u2019t her job \u2014 it\u2019s her mission. That mission began just blocks away from our campus at CNN\u2019s world headquarters, during the infancy of the global news network.\u201d\nCalling her \u201ctruly exceptional,\u201d he added, \u201cChristiane refuses to be neutral in the face of horror because, I\u2019m quoting you now, Christiane, \u2018When you\u2019re neutral, you become an accessory.\u2019 She has braved bombings and dodged artillery fire in her quest to shed light on the darkest corners of the world. She uses her platform to do good, to make this planet a better place, to stand up for what is right. Christiane exemplifies both the spirit of the Ivan Allen Jr. Prize and Georgia Tech\u2019s mission to improve the human condition by living our motto of Progress and Service.\u201d\nAccepting the award, Amanpour said, \u201cI am very moved by receiving an award for civil rights and social courage much more than getting an award for a particular story or report. Because as you grow older, you realize that there\u2019s so much at stake, more at stake than just delivering good products.\u201d\nThe Ivan Allen Jr. Prize for Social Courage honors individuals who bravely act to improve the human condition, often in the face of seemingly insurmountable challenges. The award celebrates the alumnus, civic leader, and former Atlanta Mayor Ivan Allen Jr., who was instrumental in integrating Atlanta and supported federal civil rights legislation. The prize is funded in perpetuity by a grant from the Wilbur and Hilda Glenn Family Foundation, and recipients are awarded a $100,000 stipend.\nPast recipients include former U.S. Senator Sam Nunn, civil rights leader and former U.S. representative John Lewis, former President Jimmy Carter and Rosalynn Carter, public health expert Anthony S. Fauci, and others. Last year, the award was presented to the first three Black students to enroll at Georgia Tech and the first Black student to graduate, Ford C. Greene, Ralph A. Long Jr., Lawrence Williams, and Ronald Yancey.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nVictor Rogers\nInstitute Communications\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
