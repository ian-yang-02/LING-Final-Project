A team of researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology is now using what they\u2019ve learned about bio-circuits to lay the groundwork for the future of programmable medicine.\nLooking like any other small vial of clear liquid, these programmable drugs would communicate directly with our biological systems, dynamically responding to the information flowing through our bodies to automatically deliver proper doses where and when they are needed. These future medicines might even live inside us throughout our lives, fighting infection, detecting cancer and other diseases, essentially becoming a therapeutic biological extension of ourselves.\nWe are years away from that, but the insights gained from research in Gabe Kwong\u2019s lab are moving us closer with the development of \u2018enzyme computers\u2019 \u2014 engineered bio-circuits designed with biological components, with the capacity to expand and augment living functions.\n\u201cThe long-term vision is this concept of programmable immunity,\u201d said\nKwong , associate professor in the\nWallace H. Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering\nat Georgia Tech and Emory University, who partnered with fellow researcher Brandon Holt on the paper, \u201c Protease circuits for processing biological information ,\u201d published Oct. 6 in the journal\nNature Communications . The research was sponsored by the National Institutes of Health.\nThe story of this paper begins two years ago when, Holt said, \u201cour lab has a rich history of developing enzyme-based diagnostics; eventually we started thinking about these systems as computers, which led us to design simple logic gates, such as AND gates and OR gates. This project grew organically and we realized that there were other devices we can build, like comparators and analog-digital convertors. Eventually this led to the idea of taking an analog-to-digital converter and using that to digitize bacterial activity.\u201d\nUltimately, they assembled cell-free bio-circuits that can combine with bacteria-infected blood, \u201cwith the basic idea that it would quantify the bacterial infection \u2014 the number of bacteria \u2014 then calculate and release a selective drug dose, essentially in real time,\u201d said Holt, a Ph.D. student in Kwong\u2019s\nLaboratory for Synthetic Immunity\nand lead author of the paper.\nThe researchers sought to construct bio-circuits that use protease activity to process biological information under a digital or analog framework (proteases are enzymes that break down proteins into smaller polypeptides and amino acids). The team built its analog-to-digital converter with a tiny device, made only of biological materials, that changed signals from bacteria into ones and zeroes. Then, the circuit used these numbers to choose the proper dosage of drugs needed to kill the bacteria without overdosing.\nThat\u2019s the traditional approach \u2014 bio-circuits digitizing molecular signals, allowing operations to be carried out by Boolean logic. The second part of the team\u2019s new paper takes a more nuanced approach, with a focus on analog circuits as opposed to digital. \u201cWe treat protease activity as multi-valued, signals between one and zero,\u201d Holt said.\nThat multi-valued approach led to yet another idea, and ultimately to the bigger picture of analog bio-circuits.\n\u201cWe got tempted by this idea of fuzzy logic, where you can think about what happens if there\u2019s a signal between zero and one,\u201d he added. \u201cThat\u2019s more like an analog circuit. We were really inspired by this concept, so we decided to build analog bio-circuits with the same basic materials as before \u2014 proteases and peptides. And we were able to solve a mathematical oracle problem, Learning Parity with Noise.\u201d\nThe ability to process information from the biomolecular environment with an analog framework is critical, according to Kwong.\n\u201cFuzzy logic is interesting because biology doesn\u2019t think in zeroes and ones,\u201d he said. \u201cBiology operates as a spectrum. So if you think about enzymatic activity, it\u2019s never just on and off. It\u2019s on, and the activity can be anywhere between zero and one. So the long term goal is to recognize that biology is not as simple as a digital electronic circuit. You actually need some capacity to work with analog signals.\u201d\nThis work was funded by an NIH Director\u2019s New Innovator Award (Award No. DP2HD091793) as well as an R01 from the NCI (GR10003709).
