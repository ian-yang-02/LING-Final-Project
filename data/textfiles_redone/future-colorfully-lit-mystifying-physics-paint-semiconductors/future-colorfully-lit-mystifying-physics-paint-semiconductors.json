An emergent class of semiconductors, which could affordably light up our future with nuanced colors emanating from lasers, lamps, and even window glass, could be the latest example.\nThese materials are very radiant, easy to process from solution, and energy-efficient. The nagging question of whether hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites (HOIPs) could really work just received a very affirmative answer\nin a new international study\nled by physical chemists at the Georgia Institute of Technology.\nWith significant effort, researchers succeeded in testing an existing HOIP and observed a \u201crichness\u201d of semiconducting physics created by what could be described as electrons dancing on chemical underpinnings that wobble like a funhouse floor in an earthquake. That bucks conventional wisdom because established\nsemiconductors\nrely upon rigidly stable chemical foundations, that is to say, quieter molecular frameworks, to produce the desired quantum properties.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know yet how it works to have these stable quantum properties in this intense molecular motion,\u201d said first author Felix Thouin, a graduate research assistant at Georgia Tech. \u201cIt defies physics models we have to try to explain it. It\u2019s like we need some new physics.\u201d\nQuantum properties surprise\nTheir gyrating jumbles have made HOIPs challenging to examine, but the team of researchers from a total of five research institutes in four countries succeeded in measuring a prototypical HOIP and found its quantum properties on par with those of established, molecularly rigid semiconductors, many of which are\ngraphene -based.\n\u201cThe properties were at least as good as in those materials and may be even better,\u201d said\nCarlos Silva, a professor in Georgia Tech\u2019s School of Chemistry and Biochemistry . Not all semiconductors also absorb and emit light well, but HOIPs do, making them\noptoelectronic\nand thus potentially useful in lasers, LEDs, other lighting applications, and also in photovoltaics.\nThe lack of molecular-level rigidity in HOIPs also plays into them being more flexibly produced and applied.\nSilva co-led the study with physicist\nAjay Ram Srimath Kandada . Their team published the results of their study on two-dimensional HOIPs on March 8, 2018,\nin the journal\nPhysical Review Materials . Their research was funded by EU Horizon 2020, the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, the Fond Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois pour la Recherche, the Research Council of Canada, and the National Research Foundation of Singapore.\nThe \u2018solution solution\u2019\nCommonly, semiconducting properties arise from static crystalline lattices of neatly interconnected atoms. In silicon, for example, which is used in most commercial solar cells, they are interconnected silicon atoms. The same principle applies to graphene-like semiconductors.\n\u201cThese lattices are structurally not very complex,\u201d Silva said. \u201cThey\u2019re only one atom thin, and they have strict two-dimensional properties, so they\u2019re much more rigid.\u201d\n\u201cYou forcefully limit these systems to two dimensions,\u201d said Srimath Kandada, who is a\nMarie Curie International Fellow\nat Georgia Tech and the Italian Institute of Technology. \u201cThe atoms are arranged in infinitely expansive, flat sheets, and then these very interesting and desirable optoelectronic properties emerge.\u201d\nThese proven materials impress. So, why pursue HOIPs, except to explore their baffling physics? Because they may be more practical in important ways.\n\u201cOne of the compelling advantages is that they\u2019re all made using low-temperature processing from solutions,\u201d Silva said. \u201cIt takes much less energy to make them.\u201d\nBy contrast, graphene-based materials are produced at high temperatures in small amounts that can be tedious to work with. \u201cWith this stuff (HOIPs), you can make big batches in solution and coat a whole window with it if you want to,\u201d Silva said.\nFunhouse in an earthquake\nFor all an HOIP\u2019s wobbling, it\u2019s also a very ordered lattice with its own kind of rigidity, though less limiting than in the customary two-dimensional materials.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just a single layer,\u201d Srimath Kandada said. \u201cThere is a very specific perovskite-like geometry.\u201d\nPerovskite\nrefers to the shape of an HOIPs crystal lattice, which is a layered scaffolding.\n\u201cThe lattice self-assembles,\u201d Srimath Kandada said, \u201cand it does so in a three-dimensional stack made of layers of two-dimensional sheets. But HOIPs still preserve those desirable 2D quantum properties.\u201d\nThose sheets are held together by interspersed layers of another molecular structure that is a bit like a sheet of rubber bands. That makes the scaffolding wiggle like a funhouse floor.\n\u201cAt room temperature, the molecules wiggle all over the place. That disrupts the lattice, which is where the electrons live. It\u2019s really intense,\u201d Silva said. \u201cBut surprisingly, the quantum properties are still really stable.\u201d\nHaving quantum properties work at room temperature without requiring ultra-cooling is important for practical use as a semiconductor.\nGoing back to what HOIP stands for -- hybrid organic-inorganic\nperovskites\n\u2013 this is how the experimental material fit into the HOIP chemical class: It was a hybrid of inorganic layers of a lead iodide (the rigid part) separated by organic layers (the rubber band-like parts) of phenylethylammonium (chemical formula (PEA) 2 PbI 4 ).\nThe lead in this prototypical material could be swapped out for a metal safer for humans to handle before the development of an applicable material.\nElectron choreography\nHOIPs are great semiconductors because their electrons do an acrobatic square dance.\nUsually, electrons live in an orbit around the nucleus of an atom or are shared by atoms in a chemical bond. But HOIP chemical lattices, like all semiconductors, are configured to share electrons more broadly.\nEnergy levels in a system can free the electrons to run around and participate in things like the flow of electricity and heat. The orbits, which are then empty, are called electron holes, and they want the electrons back.\n\u201cThe hole is thought of as a positive charge, and of course, the electron has a negative charge,\u201d Silva said. \u201cSo, hole and electron attract each other.\u201d\nThe electrons and holes race around each other like dance partners pairing up to what physicists call an \u201c exciton .\u201d Excitons act and look a lot like particles themselves, though they\u2019re not really particles.\nHopping biexciton light\nIn semiconductors, millions of excitons are correlated, or choreographed, with each other, which makes for desirable properties, when an energy source like electricity or laser light is applied. Additionally, excitons can pair up to form biexcitons, boosting the semiconductor\u2019s energetic properties.\n\u201cIn this material, we found that the biexciton binding energies were high,\u201d Silva said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we want to put this into lasers because the energy you input ends up to 80 or 90 percent as biexcitons.\u201d\nBiexcitons bump up energetically to absorb input energy. Then they contract energetically and pump out light. That would work not only in lasers but also in LEDs or other surfaces using the optoelectronic material.\n\u201cYou can adjust the chemistry (of HOIPs) to control the width between biexciton states, and that controls the wavelength of the light given off,\u201d Silva said. \u201cAnd the adjustment can be very fine to give you any wavelength of light.\u201d\nThat translates into any color of light the heart desires.\nLike this article?\u00a0 Get our email newsletter here.\nALSO read this materials article:\u00a0Turbocharging Fuel Cells with a Multifunctional NanoCatalyst\nCoauthors of this paper were Stefanie Neutzner and Annamaria Petrozza from the Italian Institute of Technology (IIT); Daniele Cortecchia from IIT and Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore; Cesare Soci from the Centre for Disruptive Photonic Technologies, Singapore; Teddy Salim and Yeng Ming Lam from NTU; and Vlad Dragomir and Richard Leonelli from the University of Montreal.
