That\u2019s a rough description of newly discovered cellular mechanisms that eliminate\nT cells\nthat may cause autoimmune disorders.\nAlthough the mechanisms are intertwined with biochemical processes, they also work mechanically, grasping, tugging and clamping, say researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology, who, for a\nnew study in the journal\u00a0 Nature Immunology , measured responses to physical force acting upon these elimination mechanisms.\nThe mechanisms\u2019 purpose is to make dangerously aggressive developing immune cells called thymocytes destroy\u00a0themselves to keep them from attacking the\u00a0body,\u00a0while sparing healthy thymocytes as they mature into T cells. Understanding these selection mechanisms, which ensure T cells aggressively pursue hordes of infectors and cancers but not damage healthy human tissue, could someday lead to new immune-regulating therapies.\nTwo-handed handshake\nUsually, researchers pursue such mechanisms using chemistry experiments, but Georgia Tech\u2019s Cheng Zhu, who led the study, makes atypical discoveries via physical experiments to observe effects of forces between key proteins in living cells.\n\u201cExperiments where the proteins are isolated and used in chemical reactions\u00a0 in vitro \u00a0miss this force dynamic,\u201d said Zhu, a\u00a0 Regents Professor in the Wallace H. Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering at Georgia Tech and Emory University . \u201cBefore our work, force was not considered as a factor in\u00a0 thymocyte \u00a0selection and now it is.\u201d\nIn this study, they discovered a loop of physical signals resembling a double-handed handshake that encourages cell apoptosis. It is described in more detail below.\nThe medical significance of this field of research was highlighted by the\u00a0 2018 Nobel Prize in medicine , which was awarded to other researchers at other institutions, James Allison of MD Anderson Cancer Center and Tasuku Honjo of Kyoto University. Allison and Honjo received the prize for their cancer therapies exploiting T cell regulating mechanisms intertwined with those that the Georgia Tech researchers study.\nGeorgia Tech's Zhu and first authors Jinsung Hong and Chenghao Ge published their new research paper on November 12, 2018. The research was funded by the National Cancer Institute, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. The agencies are part of the National Institutes of Health.\nThymocyte selection gauntlet\nLike blood cells, human thymocytes are born in bone marrow, but they travel to the thymus, a small organ just below the neck, where they run a gauntlet of selection tests. Failing any one selection means cell self-destruction; passing all selections promotes thymocytes to T cells that depart the thymus to battle our bodies\u2019 foes.\nOne selection checks T cell receptors (TCR), which are on the thymocyte\u2019s membrane, to ensure they are properly formed then to see if they recognize self-antigens, i.e. molecules that identify the body\u2019s own cells. Then another selection, called negative selection, tests TCRs to make sure they don\u2019t react too aggressively to self-antigens.\nCells that pass these checks then have TCRs that tolerate self- yet react to enemy antigens.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want the cells with strongly grabbing receptor sites to turn against the body itself,\u201d said Zhu, whose study focused on negative selection.\nSelf-antigen grip\nIn negative selection, other cells extend self-antigens on their membrane to interact with the thymocytes\u2019 T cell receptors. Those interactions seal the thymocytes\u2019 fate: advance or die.\nStudying forces in those interactions revealed a new signaling loop with mechanical properties analogous to a two-handed grip and tug by the thymocyte.\nThe first hand would be the T cell receptor itself, and the other cell presenting the self-antigen would be like someone else\u2019s hand holding a special ball out to the T cell\u2019s first hand. The handshake begins as the self-antigen gives a signal to the T cell receptor.\nIf the TCR reacts too strongly to the self-antigen, the thymocyte adds the second, assisting hand, which comes in from the side to make a two-handed handshake. The additional hand is a lever called CD8 (cluster of differentiation 8), which connects to key mechanisms inside the thymocyte and is considered part of the TCR site.\nDemolition handshakes\nFor about two weeks in the thymus, multiple T cell receptor sites engage in one- or two-handed handshakes, which send signals into the thymocyte that make it either mature into a T cell or begin the process of programmed cell death.\nThe researchers found that the two-handedness markedly\u00a0resisted the force applied to break the grip between the T cell receptor and the self-antigen, thus prolonging the duration of the handshake. A long grip sent signals for the thymocyte to die.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the study\u2019s elegant finding,\u201d Zhu said. \u201cThat the force is significant for the selection to work.\u201d\nNew signaling loop\nThe researchers also made the novel discovery that CD8\u2019s handshake participation constitutes a signal coming from inside the thymocyte back out to the self-antigen in answer to its initial signal.\n\u201cThe inside-out return signal had not yet been reported for this T cell receptor,\u201d Zhu said.\nTogether, the outside-in and inside-out signals create a feedback loop that perpetuates the handshake:\nSelf-antigen touches receptor.\nReceptor fires signal into cell and interacts with self-antigen too aggressively.\nInside cell membrane, signal pulls CD8 closer.\nOutside cell membrane, CD8 strengthens handshake.\nWhen the self-antigen slips a bit, the double-handed grip can coax it back into the receptor, kicking off another signal, restarting the signaling cycle again and again.\nMany feedback loops increase likelihood of programmed cell death.\nLike this article?\u00a0 Subscribe to our email newsletter\nAlso READ: \u00a0 Remote-Control Shoots Laser at Nano-Gold to Turn on Cancer-Killing T Cells\nCoauthors on the study were: Prithiviraj Jothikumar, Zhou Yuan, Baoyu Liu, Ke Bai, Kaitao Li, William Rittase, all of Georgia Tech at the time of the research; Miho Shinzawa and Alfred Singer of the National Cancer Institute at the National Institutes of Health; Brian Evavold, Khalid Salaita and Yun Zhang of Emory University; Amy Palin and Paul Love of the NIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Development; and Xinhua Yu of University of Memphis.
