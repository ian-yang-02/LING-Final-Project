Pettit Chair and a Georgia Research Alliance (GRA) Eminent Scholar\nFeb 10, 2022\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nSuman Datta, one of the nation\u2019s top researchers in semiconductor and nanoelectronic device research, is joining Georgia Tech\u2019s\nSchool of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE)\nas Joseph M. Pettit Chair and a\nGeorgia Research Alliance (GRA) Eminent Scholar . He will also have a joint appointment with the\nSchool of Materials Science and Engineering (MSE) . Datta is currently serving as a Georgia Tech adjunct professor while at the University of Notre Dame and will transition full time to Georgia Tech in the fall.\nDatta is the Stinson Professor of Nanotechnology in Notre Dame\u2019s Department of Electrical Engineering. He is the director of\nASCENT (Applications and Systems-Driven Center for Energy-Efficient Integrated NanoTechnologies) , a $40 million microelectronics research center funded by the Semiconductor Research Corporation (SRC) and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). The center's mission is to provide breakthrough advances in foundational semiconductor materials, devices, and heterogenous integration technologies. ASCENT includes Notre Dame and 13 partner universities.\nDatta\u2019s research involves high-performance, heterogenous computing, brain-inspired computing, and collective state computing using advanced CMOS (complementary metal\u2013oxide\u2013semiconductor) and beyond-CMOS devices. He also focuses on the development of semiconductor technologies for other types of computing, including intermittent computing, cryogenic computing, and harsh environment computing.\n\u201cSuman is a leader in the fields of semiconductors and nanoelectronic device research. His addition to the faculty is a tremendous benefit for our students, research community, and the state of Georgia,\u201d said Raheem Beyah, dean of the\nCollege of Engineering\nand Southern Company Chair. \u201cI welcome him to Georgia Tech and am excited to see him continue to define the future of computing.\u201d\nFrom 2016-2021, Datta served as director of the six-university\nCenter for Extremely Energy Efficient Collective Electronics (EXCEL),\nwhich is funded by the SRC and National Science Foundation (NSF). EXCEL explores the demonstration of an alternate computing platform that leverages continuous-time dynamics of emerging devices to execute optimization, learning, and inference tasks in a collective, cooperative, and scalable way to transcend the current energy efficiency wall by many orders of magnitude.\nGeorgia Tech ECE faculty members have played technical roles in both EXCEL and ASCENT and many have collaborated with Datta in recent years.\n\u201cI have been fortunate to pursue a career in semiconductor science and technology, a field inherently multi-disciplinary that touches many areas of physical sciences. Looking ahead, with new paradigms of computing, communication, and information storage on the horizon, I see traditional boundaries between computing and physical sciences blurring,\u201d said Datta. \u201cThis is why I\u2019m thrilled to join the Georgia Tech family in ECE and MSE. Additionally, as a new member of the Georgia Research Alliance, I look forward to bringing my technology development experience in the private sector and contributing to the larger tech transfer and commercialization ecosystem in the state of Georgia.\u201d\nDatta has been at the forefront of logic transistor research for the past two decades. While at Intel from 1999-2007, two of his most impactful contributions in high-k/metal gate CMOS and Tri-gate CMOS research and development led to commercially successful technologies that allowed transistor scaling from 45nm node to 14nm node and beyond. Datta\u2019s recent research has driven advances in embedded high-performance memory space such as single transistor Ferroelectric transistor memory and capacitorless gain cell (or floating body DRAM) suitable for compute-in-memory (CIM) accelerators. His recent work on using continuous time dynamics of coupled oscillators to solve optimization problems is galvanizing interest in the alterative compute paradigm of \u201clet physics do the computing.\u201d\n\u201cSuman Datta is one of the nation\u2019s leaders in semiconductor research,\u201d said GRA President\nSusan Shows . \u201cHe is a strong collaborator and will continue to make advances in this growing, important industry for Georgia. GRA is pleased to welcome him to its Academy.\u201d\nPrior to Notre Dame, Datta was a professor of electrical engineering at The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, from 2007-2015. Datta has co-authored 11 book chapters and more than 400 refereed journal and conference proceedings papers.\nIn 2013, Datta was named Fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) for his contributions to high-performance advanced silicon and compound semiconductor transistor technologies. Datta holds 185 U.S. patents. In 2016, he was named Fellow of the National Academy of Inventors (NAI) in recognition of his inventions that have made a tangible impact on quality of life, economic development and the welfare of society.\nAdditional Images\nEmail\nmaderer@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
