Navigating traffic in major cities like Islamabad and Rawalpindi can be difficult enough, but it\u2019s even harder for women. Rizvi noticed women dealing with harassment, price gouging, and safety issues during routine commutes, and it made them reluctant to use public options for transportation. That\u2019s when she set to coming up with a solution at a hackathon while studying here at Georgia Tech. \u201cI was always into using technology to improve lives,\u201d Rizvi says.\u00a0 Rizvi launched\nShe\u2019kab , a shared taxi service just for the women of her country. The company uses existing taxi services to build a network of safe, affordable, and reliable transportation for women. Launching a startup in Pakistan as a female presents some unique challenges. Rizvi is boss to an all-male work force. While there have been some challenges, she says she works to turn her gender in her favor and says many people are more courteous because she\u2019s a female supervisor. \u201cI really want to make a difference in the lives of girls like me,\u201d Rizvi says. \u201cIt\u2019s my way of giving back to Pakistan.\u201d Learn more about She'Kab.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nSteven Norris Social Media Manager snorris@gatech.edu\nEmail\nsnorris@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
