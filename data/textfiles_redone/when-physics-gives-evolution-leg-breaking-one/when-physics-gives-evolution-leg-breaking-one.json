Physics can be a powerful co-pilot, sometimes even setting the course.\nIn\na new study , physicists and evolutionary biologists at the Georgia Institute of Technology have shown how physical stress may have significantly advanced the evolutionary path from single-cell to multicellular organisms. In experiments with clusters of yeast cells called snowflake yeast, forces in the clusters\u2019 physical structures pushed the snowflakes to evolve.\n\u201cThe evolution of multicellularity is as much a matter of physics as it is biology,\u201d said biologist\u00a0 Will Ratcliff, an assistant professor in Georgia Tech\u2019s School of Biological Sciences .\nThe bigger they are\u2026\nLike the first ancestors of multicellular organisms, in this study the snowflake yeast found itself in a conundrum: As it got bigger, physical stresses tore it into smaller pieces. So, how to sustain the growth needed to evolve into a complex multicellular organism?\nIn the lab, those shear forces played right into evolution\u2019s hands, laying down a track to direct yeast evolution toward bigger, tougher snowflakes.\n\u201cIn just eight weeks, the snowflake yeast evolved larger, more robust bodies by figuring out\u00a0 soft matter physics \u00a0that took humans hundreds of years to learn,\u201d said\u00a0 Peter Yunker, an assistant professor in Georgia Tech\u2019s School of Physics . He and Ratcliff collaborated on the research that documented the evolution and measured the physical properties of mutated snowflake yeast.\nThey\npublished their results on November 27, 2017, in the journal\u00a0 Nature Physics . The work was funded by the NASA Exobiology program, the National Science Foundation, and a\u00a0 Packard Foundation Fellowship to Ratcliff .\nQuestions and answers\nHere are some questions and answers to illuminate the study and its significance.\nBut first, some background: Baker\u2019s yeast, which was used in these experiments, is usually a single-cell organism. Yeast cells\u00a0 with a well-known mutation stick together \u00a0in groups called snowflakes.\nThat was not the focus of the experiments, but the yeast snowflakes were the starting point in this study on the evolution of multicellularity.\nWhy is this study significant?\nSuch a cell cluster like a yeast snowflake is not a well-integrated multicellular organism yet. To make it\u00a0 to even simple multicellularity \u00a0like that of some algae is a very long evolutionary haul.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a journey of a thousand steps,\u201d Ratcliff said. \u201cThe key change is for this group of cells not to evolve as a gang of single cells but as one multicellular individual.\u201d\nIn this work, the researchers showed how snowflake yeast took first steps in that direction by evolving more resilient multicellular bodies that sustained growth. The process was mainly driven by physical forces, as the simple snowflakes did not have complex inner biological workings that were capable of being the main drivers.\n\u201cThis is an amazing example of multicellular adaptation around physical constraints well before the evolution of a cellular developmental program,\u201d Yunker said.\nHow does this evolution via physical stress work?\n\u201cYeast snowflakes grew by adding cells end to end to form branches kind of like those of a bush,\u201d Yunker said. \u201cBut the branches crowded each other, and the stresses that result made some break off.\u201d\nThe breakage chopped down the size of individual yeast snowflakes, but after multiple generations, the snowflakes evolved to reduce the crowding of branches by elongating its individual cells.\nAs a result, the overall snowflakes were less stressed and could grow larger and more robust.\nIn addition, Georgia Tech researchers discovered that physics made the snowflakes basically have babies. Specifically, the pieces that broke off became\u00a0 propagules \u00a0that grew into snowflakes of their own.\nThis reproduction was created by physical force and not by a biological program. Ratcliff published a separate study about the reproduction aspect on October 23, 2017, in the journal\u00a0 Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B .\n\u201cPhysics does a lot for multicellularity,\u201d Ratcliff said. \u201cIt also gives it a lifecycle.\u201d Lifecycle refers to birth, growth, reproduction, and death.\n\u201cA consensus is forming that for something to really evolve to multicellularity, very early on, a multicellular lifecycle has to develop.\u201d\nAlso READ: Evolution, What was the Primordial Stew?\nHow did the experiments select for these specific adaptations?\nRatcliff and Yunker streamlined evolution in the lab by creating a consistent selection regime for the yeast snowflakes to evolve in. In this case, they\u00a0 selected for snowflakes that were best at sinking .\nThe snowflakes that sank better were heavier, because they grew larger than others in the manner described above, giving them more mass. \u201cThe clusters that evolved to grow bigger were therefore also heavier,\u201d Ratcliff said.\nThis experimental selection setup befitted natural evolution, which also had to select for size to arrive at complex multicellular bodies, which are much, much larger than single cells.\nMutation of branches is genetic. Is physics really so important here?\nThat\u2019s correct: Random genetic mutations resulted in the better, longer branches in some yeast snowflakes giving them a cumulative weight advantage.\nBut the propagation of the superior snowflake mutations was the result of physical stresses not breaking the snowflakes until they had grown larger.\nThe pieces that eventually did break off, due purely to physical force, were the propagules. Some of them carried mutations forward that made the new snowflakes even better at sinking.\nAnd that was a critical step in the multicellular evolution.\nHow was stress corroborated as the cause of snowflakes splitting apart?\nThe researchers put the material properties of the snowflakes to the test under an\u00a0 atomic force microscope . \u201cWe squished the clusters and measured how much force and energy you needed to break them,\u201d Yunker said.\n\u201cThe physical measurement indicated closely the size the clusters would attain before they broke off a branch due to stress,\u201d Ratcliff said.\nAlso READ: 'Cavemen' had better mental health genes?\nCoauthors of this study were Shane Jacobeen, Jennifer Pentz, Elyes Graba, and Colin G.
