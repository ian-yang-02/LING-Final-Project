That\u2019s how it\u2019s supposed to go, and it looks like it went pretty much as planned,\" Stewart said.\nIn her\nblast, shock and impact laboratory on campus , Stewart tests\u00a0steel structural columns, steel stud wall systems and high performance concrete panels using blast simulator testing.\nGeorgia Tech graduate John Aderhold (Electrical Engineering, 1945) played a pivotal role in the development and building of the Georgia Dome. He put together the business deal that made it a reality as chairman of the Georgia World Congress Center nearly 30 years ago.\nWhen the Dome opened in 1992, it was the largest covered stadium in the world, eventually hosting Super Bowls, the 1996 Summer Olympics and Final Four basketball tournaments. Its final event, this past March, had a connection to Georgia Tech. Mechanical engineering sophomore Rosalee Ramer participated in Monster Jam, driving her 12,000-pound monster truck for the building\u2019s finale.\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nLauren Stewart's Structures Lab\nContact\nJason Maderer\nNational Media Relations\nmaderer@gatech.edu\n404-660-2926\nEmail\nmaderer@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
