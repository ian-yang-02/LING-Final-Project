The fault lies in the numbers.\nAfter considering the Powerball system of drawing five white balls out of a drum with 69 balls and one red ball out of a drum with 26 red balls, Lefton calculated more than 292,201,338 possible winning combinations.\nTo explain your odds, Lefton says if iPhone 7s were laid end to end around Interstate 285 in Atlanta, there would be about 745,000 phones in total.\nIf only one of those iPhones were blue and you were asked to pick it out, your chances of succeeding would be 400 times more likely than winning tonight's jackpot.\n\"You should play anyway,\" Lefton says. \"Two dollars is a great price for a dream.\u201d\nThere is a bit of a silver lining despite having no way to improve your odds.\n\u201cPlay numbers higher than 31,\u201d Lefton says.\nIt improves your chances of winning the jackpot and not having to share it.\nMany people play birthday numbers, so choosing higher, less-popular numbers decreases the chances of sharing the pot.\nAlso, people statistically choose odd numbers more often. Choosing high, even numbers is your best bet, according to Lefton.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nSteven Norris\nGeorgia Tech Social Media\nEmail\nsnorris@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
