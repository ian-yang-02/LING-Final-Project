What should you read?\nWe asked several Georgia Tech Library staff members for recommendations. The books range from a graphic novel series on how disinformation can become reality to a memoir by longtime\nJeopardy!\nhost Alex Trebek.\nThe Department of Truth\nBy James Tynion IV, author, and Martin Simmonds, artist, Image Comics (2021 and ongoing)\n\u201cCole Turner has always been a bit of a conspiracy theorist: JFK assassination, lizard people, shadowy government superagencies, and the like. He had no idea that he was right. This ongoing graphic novel series details what goes on when Cole gets recruited into the government agency that helps determine what reality is. This series is a dystopian contemporary science fiction take on how disinformation can become reality \u2014 and it is both farfetched and a little too real. The first three trade collections are currently out and will make quick reading for those without lots of spare time over the break.\u201d\n\u2014John Mack Freeman, head of public services librarian\nBlack Cake\nBy Charmaine Wilkerson, Ballantine Books (2022)\n\u201cEstranged siblings, Benny and Byron, reunite when their mother passes away, leaving them just two things: an eight-hour voice recording (and a stipulation that they must listen to the whole thing together, in the presence of their family lawyer), and a black cake (a traditional Caribbean dessert). Listening together, they hear the story of a determined Caribbean girl named Covey who loves to swim. They learn long-kept family secrets, turning what they thought they knew about their mother on its head. This evocative and beautifully written story traces the extraordinary journey of a family forever changed by the choices of its matriarch.\u201d\n\u2014Alex McGee, university archivist\nThe Secret to Superhuman Strength\nBy Alison Bechdel, Mariner Books (2021)\n\u201cWhat compels some of us to time every mile we run, track our resting heartrate, or buy the coolest new workout gear?\u00a0Alison Bechdel\u2019s incisive, funny\nThe Secret to Superhuman Strength \u00a0is a memoir focused on exercise and the aging body. Anyone who takes an obsessive interest in a sports hobby only to pick up a new favorite a few years later will see themselves\u00a0affectionately skewered here. Bechdel\u2019s illustrations are lovely and sardonic; the details and small gags throughout reward repeat readings.\u201d\n\u2014Liz Holdsworth, librarian for STEM disciplines and digital learning objects\nThe Guest List\nBy Lucy Foley, William Morrow (2020)\n\u201cThis mystery novel is set on an island off the coast of Ireland with a cast of characters thrown together for a wedding. The characters narrate chapters from their own perspective, and their complex web of relationships is revealed while the plot advances. As the festivities begin, old resentments, feelings, and traditions begin to surface, and eventually someone turns up dead. This novel reads like a classic Agatha Christie novel \u2014 full of clues and a bit dark, yet cozy.\u201d\n\u2014Catherine Manci, public programming and community engagement specialist\nThe Midnight Library\nBy Matt Haig, New York: Viking (2020)\n\u201cThe Midnight Library \u00a0tells the story of Nora Seed, a woman who may be at the end of a life full of regrets and resentments. Before she goes, however, she passes through a liminal space full of books (overseen by a librarian) that tell the story of her life\u2019s choices and how things might have otherwise turned out. The librarian acts as a spirit guide, but at heart, she is a true librarian \u2014 not giving Nora the answer but providing the tools Nora needs to find her own way toward happiness.\u201d\n\u2014Marlee Givens, librarian for modern languages and Library learning consultant\nLeading Up: How to Lead Your Boss So You Both Win\nBy Michael Useem, Soft Cover: Three Rivers Press, Hard Cover: Crown Business\u00a0(2001)\n\u201cThis book explores the role of leadership from several different levels. The author uses historical events that most readers would be familiar with, such as the Rwandan genocide, and cleverly weaves them into a compelling leadership story and coaching session. \u2018The complete disconnect between the front line in Kigali and the executive suite in New York was a reminder that getting an unwanted message up to the top can be one of the most challenging but also one of the most important actions for the upward leader.\u2019\u201d\n\u2014Garth Milford, IT service delivery manager\nThe Answer Is\u2026: Reflections on My Life\nBy Alex Trebek, Simon & Schuster (2020)\n\u201cThe book is a quick and easy read and touches on everything about Alex Trebek\u2019s life. It includes lots of photographs and short chapters on life, humility, courage, conscience, camaraderie, teamwork, work-life balance, and of course,\nJeopardy!\nTrebek delicately managed the art of writing an engaging memoir on his life, even with his own impending mortality. His writing is humorous, philosophical, optimistic, self-effacing, and engaging. The audience will enjoy reading his stories about celebrities (Queen Elizabeth),\nJeopardy!\nchampions, and his favorite books (by Bronte and Maugham). It is a real treat for\nJeopardy!\nand non- Jeopardy!\nfans alike.\u201d\n\u2014Anu Moorthy, electronic resources librarian\nRobert L. Jordan Jr., facility manager for the Library and Clough Undergraduate Learning Commons, recommended two books:\nRead Until You Understand: The Profound Wisdom of Black Life and Literature\nBy Farah Jasmine Griffin, W. W. Norton & Company (2021)\n\u201cThis, by far, has been my favorite read of year. The journey that these 10 chapters take you on, as Professor Griffin recounts her personal story of growing up in Philadelphia and providing insights and lessons from the Black American writers, is amazing. In the introduction she writes, \u2018This book begins with a girl and ends with grace. Along the way, through a combination of memoir and readings of African American literature, it touches upon the question of mercy, the elusive quest for justice, the prevalence of\u00a0 beauty, even in the presence of death and throughout, hope in the face of despair.\u2019 I enjoyed this book because it gives insight through the readings of literature and music on the themes that we face and struggle with daily. Not only read until you understand, but also listen.\u201d\nAntagonistic Cooperation: Jazz, Collage, Fiction, and the Shaping of African American Culture\nBy Robert O\u2019Meally, Columbia University Press (2022)\n\u201cAlthough this book deals with a little heavier subject matter, I still found it entertaining and informative. Professor O\u2019Meally explains how the concept of antagonistic cooperation is modeled in jazz performance through friendly competition, challenge, and support to create beautiful musical experiences. Through the works of artists such as Romare Bearden and Jean-Michel Basquiat, the literature of Ralph Ellison and Toni Morrison, and the music of Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington, he provides illuminating examples of antagonistic cooperation. When we face challenges when cooperating with others as colleagues and leaders, antagonistic cooperation can help us to grow, develop, and mature. Through the author\u2019s eyes, \u2018antagonistic cooperation is a form of community building competition and coordination with a jazz player\u2019s spirit of love.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nContact\nVictor Rogers\nInstitute Communications\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
