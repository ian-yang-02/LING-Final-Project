The findings are drawn from an analysis of 5,575 survey responses from researchers in the natural sciences, medicine, engineering, social sciences, and professional fields.\nAccording to the study, women were significantly more likely than men to report disagreements about who was named on a paper and in the order of authorship. The researchers found this to be particularly true in natural sciences and engineering, where women researchers reported significantly higher rates of disagreement than their colleagues in other disciplines.\n\u201cAuthorship is central for the attribution of credit in science,\u201d said\nSugimoto , Tom and Marie Patton Chair in the\nSchool of Public Policy . \u201cThis study demonstrates that women do not receive the credit they deserve and that their scientific labor is often devalued. Furthermore, it suggests gendered differences in how research teams allocate credit, suggesting that there are cultural dimensions to the distribution of authorship that should be addressed.\u201d\nIn academic publishing, the inclusion and ordering of names on a journal article is an important marker of productivity and prestige. The first author is typically a junior scholar who is leading the research, whereas the last author is typically a senior author providing funding and supervision for the project.\nAccording to Sugimoto and her co-authors, men and women approach authorship decisions differently, with women more often initiating collaborative authorship discussions early in a project. In contrast, men tend to discuss it at the end, if at all.\nThe disputes that arise from authorship disagreements often result in retribution, the study states. Men were more likely to say they had \u201cengaged in undermining the work of colleagues\u201d following such a dispute. At the same time, women researchers reported that authorship disputes often resulted in fewer opportunities for future collaboration on research projects. Due to limitations of the survey, however, it was unclear whether the respondents were shut out of future collaborations or chose to avoid future work with colleagues with whom they had experienced such a dispute.\nEither way, fewer opportunities for future collaboration are a troubling outcome, Sugimoto said.\n\u201cThe isolation of women from scientific teams has strong consequences,\u201d Sugimoto said. \u201cEvidence suggests that sociodemographic diversity leads to innovation and that there are homophilic effects in research, that is, that people tend to study items that relate to their lived experiences. Given this, the chilling effect on collaboration will lead to a constraint on the knowledge produced.\u201d\nThe authors call for standardization in authorship decisions and for universities to provide pathways for researchers to communicate authorship concerns. For instance, Sugimoto said, some senior researchers have begun posting authorship statements for team members as a starting point for discussions.\n\u201cSenior colleagues should discuss authorship openly in their teams at the initiation and throughout the scientific process,\u201d Sugimoto said. \u201cThey should signal that they are willing to listen to concerns about equitable attribution of credit and make changes accordingly.\u201d\nOf course, such changes are unlikely to happen overnight.\n\u201cThis is a massive shift in scientific culture, where we give greater voice to all members of a lab,\u201d said Sugimoto.\nIn the meantime, Sugimoto suggests junior researchers should speak up.\n\u201cThey should advocate for themselves and their peers and seek and build collaborations with greater transparency and equity,\u201d said Sugimoto.\nSugimoto co-authored the paper, \u201cThe Gendered Nature of Authorship,\u201d with Chaoqun Ni of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, Elise Smith of the University of Texas Medical Branch, Haimiao Yuan of the University of Iowa, and Vincent Larivi\u00e8re of the University of Montreal.\nIt appears in the September edition of\nScience Advances.\nLarivi\u00e8re received funding from the Canada Research Chairs program (950-231768).
