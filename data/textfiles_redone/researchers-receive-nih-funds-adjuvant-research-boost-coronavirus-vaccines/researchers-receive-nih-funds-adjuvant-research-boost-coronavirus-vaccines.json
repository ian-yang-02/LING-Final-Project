Milton Chair in the\nWallace H. Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering at Georgia Tech and Emory University . \u201cMost viruses have several of these molecules in them, and we are trying to mimic that multi-adjuvant structure.\u201d\nAdjuvants are used with some vaccines to help them create stronger protective immune responses in persons receiving the vaccine. The research team will screen a library of various adjuvant combinations to quickly identify those that may be most useful to enhance the effects of both protein- and RNA-based coronavirus vaccines under development.\n\u201cWe are trying to understand how adjuvant combinations affect the vaccine response,\u201d Roy said. \u201cWe will look at how the immune system shifts and changes with the adjuvant combinations. The ultimate goal is to determine how to generate the most effective, strongest, and most durable immune response against the virus. There are more than a hundred vaccine candidates being developed for the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19, and it is likely that many will generate initial antibody responses. It remains to be seen how long those responses will last and whether they can generate appropriate immunological memory that protects against subsequent virus exposures in the long-term.\u201d\nThe parent grant to Georgia Tech is part of a program called \u201cMolecular Mechanisms of Combination Adjuvants (MMCA).\u201d For the past four years, the agency has been supporting Roy and his research team to pursue studies to understand how adjuvants work, and this additional funding will allow them to apply their research to potential coronavirus vaccines.\nFor more coverage of Georgia Tech\u2019s response to the coronavirus\u00a0pandemic, please visit our\u00a0 Responding to COVID-19 \u00a0page.\n\u201cIt has been difficult to develop safe and durable vaccines against respiratory viruses,\u201d explained Roy, who also directs the Center for ImmunoEngineering.\u00a0 \u201cOver the past several years, we have been looking mostly at the basic science and understanding how the immune system integrates signals from multiple adjuvants to create a unified immune response in mammals. This new funding will allow us to pursue more translational aspects related to COVID-19 and provide the scientific community with potentially new tools to fight this devastating pandemic.\u201d\nThe team has developed a technique that uses micron- and nanometer-scale polymer particles to present both the vaccine antigen and adjuvant compounds to the mammalian immune system. The medical polymer that is the basis for the particles is used for other purposes in the body.\nThe synthetic particles, which Roy\u2019s team calls pathogen-like particles (PLPs), are designed to mimic real pathogens in terms of how they elicit immune responses \u2013 without causing infection. \u201cThey have an antigen and multiple synergistic adjuvants on a particle-structure that is very similar to how native pathogens present these molecules to our immune system,\u201d he said.\nThe PLPs combined with adjuvants encourage the immune system to develop antibodies and T cell responses that can battle the real pathogen if it attacks. Having existing antibodies and the appropriate virus-fighting T cells to the novel coronavirus will enable the body\u2019s immune system to respond quickly to the threat of infection and potentially destroy the virus quickly.\nThe researchers will first evaluate how the adjuvants affect the interaction of specific immune cells, called dendritic cells and macrophages, with T cells \u2013 a key component of generating immune system response \u2013 and then follow up with animal studies using the promising combinations. Whether or not a vaccine can be created that will provide long-term protective immunity against the coronavirus is still an open question in the research community, and Roy said the research into adjuvants will help provide new tools to answer that question.\n\u201cPart of the knowledge gap right now is that we don\u2019t know how the immune system is influenced by various adjuvants,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to look at how the vaccine formulations, our particles and the adjuvants affect T cell proliferation and T cell response, and how we can optimize that response to generate durable immunity.\u201d\nThe adjuvant Alum has been used since the 1930s to boost the action of the immune system as it responds to antigens in vaccines that elicit protection against many pathogens. However, for those pathogens that require alternative adjuvants, only a few other adjuvants are currently used in commercial vaccines. Research on modern adjuvants aims to understand the way they specifically activate our immune systems and can be designed to protect against infections. Another approach is to find out if combinations of adjuvants are safe and more effective than a single adjuvant providing highly effective and long-lasting protective immunity.\nRoy and his team will be evaluating existing adjuvants in combination, along with potential protein and RNA-based antigens currently under evaluation. The goal is to develop novel combinations of current adjuvants, including adjuvants approved for use and others that are still in development. \u201cIn this work, the strategy is to take existing platforms and see how we can pivot them to understand how to make the COVID vaccines better, and do it rapidly.\u201d\nAs with other research into potential coronavirus vaccines, the work is being accelerated with the goal of creating a safe and effective vaccine against the pandemic virus as soon as possible.\n\u201cThere are multiple efforts that the NIH and others are funding to really accelerate the pace of the work to see how many different approaches we can come up with and to evaluate the differences,\u201d Roy said. \u201cThe goal is to determine what data we can generate very quickly to move toward a successful vaccine that is safe, durable, affordable, scalable, and effective. Evaluating different approaches will help increase the likelihood that we\u2019ll find one or more that meet these criteria.\u201d\nThis research is supported by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases of the National Institutes of Health under supplemental funding to award number U01AI124270.
