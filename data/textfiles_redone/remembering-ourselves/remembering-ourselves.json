Vacation pictures might also remind us of details that have nothing to do with a specific experience. For example, the picture of the bicycle ride might remind me that dusk is my favorite time of day.\nThese reminiscences are called autobiographical memories. They can be episodic, referring to experiences of events, or semantic, referring to personally relevant information that transcends any specific event.\n\u201cAutobiographical memories are the mind\u2019s record of our daily life,\u201d says\nThackery Brown , an assistant professor in the School of Psychology. \u201cThese memories help define the very nature of who we are. Knowing how these distinct memories are processed differently across the brain can help us understand why we remember \u2013 or fail to remember \u2013 our lives with different degrees of detail.\u201d\nIn a recent study published in\nScientific Reports , Brown and others advanced our understanding of autobiographical memories. Using brain imaging and an innovative memory test using images from people\u2019s actual lives, they have shown that different regions of the brain process episodic and semantic autobiographical memories differently.\nThe findings open a window into the brain processes that give rise to memories with different degrees of detail. \u201cThis knowledge can help us understand what memory impairments to expect from different types of brain damage,\u201d Brown says. \u201cThey advance our understanding how factors such as aging and disease can affect what we remember from our lives,\u201d Brown says. \u201cFor example, when aging impacts some areas of the brain more than others, our ability to remember facts from our lives in a general way could be left intact, but our ability to vividly relive details of an experience could be impaired.\u201d\nThe findings may have other relevance, such as in the use of neuroscience methods in lie detection or in evaluating the accuracy of courtroom testimony.\n\u201cTo study how memory works \u2013 and to ask questions like \u2018How vivid is a memory?\u2019 \u2013 our lab and others use tools from computer science and machine learning to get a read-out from patterns of brain activity\u00a0 for signatures of the type of information people are remembering,\u201d Brown says. \u201cBut these techniques have limitations, which we need to understand before they are used to, for example, support a criminal conviction.\u201d\nIn fact the findings suggest that the ability to discriminate between semantic (dusk is my favorite time of day) and episodic (the sand was scorching that particular day on the beach) memories may be limited. \u201cHowever, our work identifies areas of the brain where this distinction can be made,\u201d Brown says. \u201cTherefore, this study helps focus our lens on the brain regions where the different types of memories be teased apart with brain imaging.\u201d\nINNOVATIVE EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN\nAccording to Brown, many laboratory studies of memory are limited in their ability to reveal the brain processes involved specifically in autobiographical memories because they require participants to create memories in the laboratory from experimental stimuli -- such as pictures, words, or sounds on a computer. How the brain processes these relatively simplistic and synthetic experiences may be different from how the brain handles detailed, real-world personal experiences that have personal significance to the participant.\nBrown and coworkers took a different approach. They combined brain imaging with memory tests using images of events from people\u2019s lives that were captured by wearable camera technology.\nParticipants wore digital cameras around their necks for three weeks. During that period, the cameras automatically captured\u00a0photographs\u00a0when people were active. Then brain activity was measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging while participants made memory judgments about the photographs taken by the cameras they wore.\nThe experimental design allowed Brown and his colleagues to figure out which brain regions are involved in recognizing personal images and which ones enable people to remember events from their lives with different degrees of detail \u2013 that is, remembering personal facts (semantic) or remembering experiences as detailed events (episodic).\nWHY MEMORY RESEARCH\nThe ability to form and retrieve memories is essential for survival. \u201cWe flexibly draw on memories of our experiences to avoid repeating past mistakes and to plan for the future,\u201d Brown says. \u201cWhen memory fails, we may find ourselves hopelessly lost in the city streets, incorrectly planning an event, or even providing incorrect information to a jury.\u201d\nAn overarching goal of Brown\u2019s research is to understand the neural mechanisms that support human memory and goal-directed behavior and that enable avoidance of such errors.\u00a0The recent study shows how memories can vary in specificity and detail.\n\u201cWe show that not all autobiographical memories are created equal,\u201d Brown says. \u201cFrom prior research, we know that knowledge of non-personal facts can be spared in many cases of amnesia. One future direction is to study when memory for personal facts can rely on brain systems that are different from those associated with amnesia and diseases like Alzheimer\u2019s. Knowing those circumstances could tell us more about what memories could be spared.\u201d\nAnother question is whether some forms of autobiographical memory are more susceptible to errors than others. When are we more likely to misremember someone else\u2019s story as our own?\n\u201cData from our current study suggest that memory for both personal facts and experiences are resistant to being confused with other peoples\u2019 facts or events,\u201d Brown says, \u201cbut systematic work examining this issue is needed.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nContact\nA.
