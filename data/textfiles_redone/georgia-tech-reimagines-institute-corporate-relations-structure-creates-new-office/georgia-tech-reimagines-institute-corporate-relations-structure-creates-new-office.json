The launch of the new office is the first of two phases that will reimagine Georgia Tech\u2019s corporate and industry engagement\u00a0ecosystem, including a refined organizational structure, over the next several months.\n\u201cContinued engagement with industry is a critical part of realizing Georgia\u2019s Tech mission to develop leaders who advance technology and improve the human condition,\u201d said President \u00c1ngel Cabrera. \u201cA renewed, streamlined organizational approach is essential to welcoming and meeting the demands of these growing opportunities.\u201d\nThe refinements follow a recently completed holistic review of Georgia Tech\u2019s existing corporate, business, and industry engagement structure and activities. At the request of President Cabrera, the Office of the Executive Vice President for Research (EVPR) and the Office of Development completed a strategic examination of previous reports and studies, and a comprehensive assessment of engagement points for internal and external stakeholders.\nTheir analysis looked closely at how and where faculty and students in academic and research units interact with Tech\u2019s industry contacts and sponsors across various service areas: recruitment, research, intellectual property, philanthropy, economic development, and education and training. Common issues centered around coordination, fragmentation of services, and communication.\n\u201cThe analysis spotlighted many of our strengths but also discovered pain points, as these industry engagements have grown in number and complexity,\u201d said Executive Vice President for Research Chaouki T. Abdallah. \u201cWith our phased approach, I believe we can better clarify these points of engagement, boost the organizational structure, and create an even stronger customer-focused approach.\u201d\nStarting in April, Phase 1 will establish the new Office of Corporate Engagement and a new position:\nAssociate Vice President for Corporate Engagement . Dually sponsored by the EVPR and the Office of Development, the new office will serve as the central clearinghouse and hub for all partner relationships and transactional activities, such as recruitment, research, intellectual property, philanthropy, economic development,\u00a0and education\u00a0and training. The office will coordinate and collaborate with relevant campus units including, but not limited to: Technology Licensing, Venture Lab, Industry Contracting, Economic Development, Career Services, Georgia Tech Professional Education, and the Enterprise Innovation Institute.\n\u201cOur new strategy is grounded in the development of a cohesive, collaborative culture that will allow us to best manage existing relationships and set the standard as we develop new relationships,\u201d said Barrett Carson, vice president for Development. \u201cEffective coordination and transparent exchange of information will provide maximum\u202fefficiency and support to our valuable partners and Georgia Tech.\u201d\nAnticipated in July, as part of Phase 2, the Office of Corporate Relations and the Office of Industry Research \u2014 both of which have significant business engagement and relationship management responsibilities \u2014 will become part of the Office of Corporate Engagement. Over the next few months, additional stakeholder meetings will be held across affected units to further inform the organizational model and design of the new office.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nSusie Ivy\nOrganizational, Academic, and Research Communications\nEmail\nsusie.ivy@comm.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
