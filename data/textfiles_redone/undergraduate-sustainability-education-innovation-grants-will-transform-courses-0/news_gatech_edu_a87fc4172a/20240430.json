Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) through our education, research, and service.\u201d In response,\u00a0Sustainability Next\u00a0 developed a plan \u00a0to\u00a0expand SDG concept and skill integration across the undergraduate curriculum. In support of the plan, 21 projects representing all six colleges and 15 schools were presented at the Undergraduate Sustainability Education Jamboree, held on April 26 in the Kendeda Building auditorium. With many winning projects featuring high enrollment and core courses, this first round of sustainability education \u201cseed grants\u201d will significantly expand the reach of Georgia Tech\u2019s sustainability-across-the-curriculum initiatives.\n\u201cOur Strategic Plan commitment to bring the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) into our teaching is part of our vision for transformative teaching and learning more broadly,\u201d explains Larry Jacobs, Senior Vice Provost for Education and Learning. \u201cHelping students identify connections between disciplinary concepts and skills and complex societal challenges enhances learning and supports Georgia Tech\u2019s mission to equip students to improve the human condition.\u201d\nThe Jamboree featured lightning presentations from the award winners, as well as presentations about related initiatives at Georgia Tech to help instructors, students, and staff better understand the landscape of sustainability education innovation on campus. Instructors engaged in course design or re-design through the awards will have opportunities to collaborate with and learn from their peers through a Community of Practice on Transformative Teaching with the SDGs and a SoTL (Scholarship of Teaching and Learning) research group. Many began identifying potential collaborators at the event, as they heard from other award winners. \u201cT he afternoon of lightning presentations by fellow faculty was exhilarating,\u201d Sabir Khan, Associate Professor, Schools of Industrial Design and Architecture, shared. \u201cI came away impressed and excited at the range of projects and have already invited a few instructors to join my class in the fall to discuss their approaches to tackling the UN SDGs.\"\nPresenter Kate Williams, Interim Director, \u00a0 Transformative Teaching and Learning, Faculty Initiatives,\nshared connections between the Sustainability Innovation Awards and Georgia Tech\u2019s Transformative Teaching and Learning (TTL) strategic initiative. \u201cThe success of the first round of Sustainability Education Innovation Grants demonstrates our faculty's commitment to creating innovative experiential learning opportunities for students,\u201d Dr. Williams noted.\nFor more information about future award opportunities or the communities of practice described above, please contact Jennifer Leavey ( Assistant Dean for Faculty Mentoring, College of Sciences) or Rebecca Watts Hull (Assistant Director, Faculty Development for Sustainability Education Initiatives, Center for Teaching and Learning).\nReview all 21 awarded\nUndergraduate Sustainability Education Innovation projects .\nAdditional Media\nRelated links\nUndergraduate Sustainability Education Innovation projects\nCenter for Teaching & Learning\nEmail\nrhull8@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
