They also modeled a more modest $25 per-ton tax. Each scenario would reduce carbon emissions, the primary driver of climate change, while creating more jobs than would be generated should emissions remain on their current trajectory, according to the analysis. But the more modest $25 tax would create more jobs across the country than the $60 tax proposed by GND advocates, while still significantly reducing emissions, Brown and Ahmadi estimate.\nWhile jobs would undoubtedly be lost in the energy supply sectors in either scenario, Brown and Ahmadi wrote in\nScientific American,\nemployment in clean-energy industries would more than make up for those losses.\nAnother proposal contained in the GND\u2014tax rebates funded by revenues generated by carbon taxes\u2014would offset higher utility bills for consumers resulting from the transition to less carbon-dependent energy sources, according to Brown and\nAhmadi .\n\u201cBy using the clean technologies that a GND carbon tax would promote, Americans do not have to travel less, freeze in the winter, take cold showers, or cut the output of their manufacturing plants to reduce U.S. carbon emissions,\u201d Brown and Ahmadi wrote. \u201cOur independent analysis, along with a growing body of research, suggests that a low-carbon economy would promote innovation, open up new markets, and produce an economy with more jobs\u2014a greener economy worth investing in.\u201d\nThe CEPL, which is located in the School of Public Policy, administers the\nMaster of Sustainable Energy and Environmental Management . Its researchers use a multidisciplinary quantitative approach to forecast the speed and market penetration of new and improved energy technologies and the ability of alternative policies to accelerate the adoption of clean energy technologies and practices.\nThe School of Public Policy is a unit of Georgia Tech\u2019s\nIvan Allen College of Liberal Arts .\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nClean Energy: Modeling Platform Developed at Georgia Tech Powers Atlanta Project\nGeorgia Tech Climate Conference Showcases Ivan Allen College Climate Change Exp\u2026\nAlliance to Save Energy Honors Public Policy Professor Marilyn Brown\nContact\nMichael Pearson\nmichael.pearson@iac.gatech.edu\n404.894.2290\nEmail\nmichael.pearson@iac.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
