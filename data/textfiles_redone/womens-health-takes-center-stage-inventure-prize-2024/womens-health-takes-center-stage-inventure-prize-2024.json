The team's invention, an at-home, non-invasive menstrual blood screening tool, proposes an alternative to traditional practices in women\u2019s health while making testing more accessible to the uninsured.\nTeammates Rhea Prem, Netra Gandhi, and Ethan Damiani have known each other since their first year and embarked on this transformative journey as a capstone project. Recognizing the significant gap in access to care and preventive health measures, especially in women's health, the team set out to develop a solution that would empower individuals with greater control over their health.\nLilypad Health offers less invasive testing for a range of crucial health indicators, including HPV, cervical cancer, HbA1C, hormones and fertility health, PCOS, and endometriosis. By enabling women to conduct these tests in the comfort and privacy of their own homes, Lilypad Health is poised to revolutionize the way women approach their health and wellness.\nTheir efforts are not just about developing a product \u2014 the team is actively working to break down stigmas surrounding menstruation and period-related health issues, fostering a more open and inclusive dialogue around women's health. Their work has been recognized with an AIDS Research Award and was featured in\nWomen\u2019s Health\nearlier this year.\nWith two prototypes already in development and testing underway for preserved biomarkers for sample presentation, Lilypad Health is making significant strides toward bringing their innovative solution to the masses. And they aren\u2019t the only ones who feel their invention is urgently needed \u2014 the United States Patent and Trademark Office granted the team a patent acceleration certificate and they are currently in talks with menstrual pad manufacturers about partnering to make their product even more widely available. When asked what they would do with the $20,000 InVenture Prize money, Rhea replied, \u201cWork on getting our product to market.\u201d\nLilypad Health\u2019s vision of becoming a leading women's health company is well within reach. In addition to the award money, the team has gained a coveted spot in Georgia Tech\u2019s\nCREATE-X\nStartup Launch, a 12-week summer program where they will receive coaching and mentorship from experienced entrepreneurs and have the opportunity to pitch their model to investors.\nYou can learn more about Lilypad Health and their transformative invention on their\nwebsite .\nSecond place and $10,000 went to Makr Papr, a team of computer science, computer engineering, and mechanical engineering students who have developed an innovative, patent-pending technology that promises to replace name tags and event apps at conferences with an easy-to-use, tap-and-go printable paper.\n\u201cWe want to show others that it doesn't matter where you come from or your background,\u201d says the team. \u201cIf we can do it, you can do it.\u201d\nThe People\u2019s Choice Award, selected through audience voting during the live show, went to team Candor. Comprising four computer science majors, this team invented what they call a \u201cConstituent Relationship Management (CRM)\u201d platform that aims to make \u201cdemocratic participation more accessible and effective for everyone.\u201d The platform offers a streamlined reporting and tracking process to expedite infrastructure maintenance for city governments and municipalities.\nLearn more about all of the 2024 finalists on the\nInVenture Prize\nwebsite, and if you missed the live show, check back for a link to the recording.\nAdditional Media\nInVenture Prize 2024 Second Place Winners, Makr Papr.
