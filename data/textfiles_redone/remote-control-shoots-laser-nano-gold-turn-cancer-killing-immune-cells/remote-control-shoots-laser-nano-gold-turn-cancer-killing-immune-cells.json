The ability to mobilize, from outside the body, targeted cancer immunotherapy inside the body has taken a step closer to becoming reality.\nBioengineers at the Georgia Institute of Technology have installed a heat-sensitive switch into\nT-cells\nthat can activate the T-cells when heat turns the switch on. The method, tested in mice and\npublished in a new study , is locally targeted and could someday help turn immunotherapy into a precision instrument in the fight against cancer.\nImmunotherapy\nhas made headlines with startling high-profile successes like saving\u00a0 former U.S. President Jimmy Carter \u00a0from brain cancer. But the treatment, which activates the body\u2019s own immune system against cancer and other diseases,\nhas also, unfortunately, proved to be hit-or-miss .\n\u201cIn patients where radiation and traditional chemotherapies have failed, this is where T-cell therapies have shined, but the therapy is still new,\u201d said principal investigator Gabe Kwong. \u201cThis study is a step toward making it even more effective.\u201d\nCancer is notoriously wily, and when T-cells crawl into a tumor, the tumor tends to switch off the T-cells\u2019 cancer-killing abilities. Researchers have been working to switch them back on.\nLaser, gold,\u00a0and T-cells\nKwong\u2019s remote control has done this in the lab, while also boosting T-cell activity.\nIn\nthe study , Kwong\u2019s team successfully put their remote-control method through initial tests in mice with implanted tumors (so-called tumor phantoms, specially designed for certain experiments). The remote works via three basic components.\nFirst, the researchers modified T-cells, a type of white blood cell, to include a genetic switch that, when switched on, increased the cells\u2019 expression of specific proteins by more than 200 times. That ability could be used to guide T-cells\u2019 cancer-fighting activities.\nThe T-cells, with the switch off, were introduced into the tumor phantom which was placed into the mice. The tumor phantom also included\ngold nanorods , just dozens of atoms in size. The researchers shone pulses of a gentle laser in the near-infrared (NIR) range from outside the mouse\u2019s body onto the spot where the tumor was located.\nThe nanorods receiving the light waves turned them into useful, localized mild heat, allowing the researchers to precisely warm the tumor. The elevated heat turned on the T-cells\u2019 engineered switch.\nHyper-activated T-cells\nThis study honed the method and confirmed that its components worked in living animals. It was not the intention of the study to treat cancer yet, although undertaking that is the next step, which is already on its way.\n\u201cIn upcoming experiments, we are implementing this approach to treat aggressive tumors and establish cancer-fighting effectiveness,\u201d said Kwong, who is an\nassistant professor in the Wallace H. Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering at Georgia Tech and Emory University .\nThe researchers published their results\nin the current edition of the journal ACS Synthetic Biology . The study\u2019s first author was graduate research assistant Ian Miller. The research was funded by the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, the Burroughs Wellcome Fund, and the Shurl and Kay Curci Foundation.\nBetter immunotherapy\nBioengineers have been able to do a lot with T-cells already when they\u2019re outside of the body.\n\u201cRight now, we\u2019re adept at harvesting a patient\u2019s own T-cells, modifying to target cancer, growing them outside the body until there are hundreds of millions of them,\u201d Kwong said. \u201cBut as soon as we inject them back into a patient, we lose control over the T-cells\u2019 activity inside the body.\u201d\nThe on-switch changes that.\nT-cell toxicities\nHaving an off-switch is also important. If T-cells were engineered to be always-on and hyper-activated, as they moved through the body, they could damage healthy tissue.\n\u201cThere would be off-target toxicities, so you really want to pinpoint their activation,\u201d Kwong said. \u201cOur long-term goal for them is to activate site-specifically, so T-cells can overcome immunosuppression by the tumor and become better killers there.\u201d\nWhen the heat remote is turned off, so are Kwong\u2019s engineered T-cells, because customary body temperatures are not high enough to activate their switch.\nHeat-shock switch\nThe switch is a natural safety mechanism in human cells that has evolved to protect against heat shock and turns on when tissue temperatures rise above the body\u2019s normal operating range, which centers on 37 degrees Celsius (98.6 F). But the researchers re-fitted T-cells with the switch to make it turn on other functions, and it could be used to hyper-activate the cells.\nThe Georgia Tech bioengineers found that the switch worked in a range of 40 to 42 degrees Celsius (104 - 107.6 F), high enough to not react to the majority of high fevers and low enough to not damage healthy tissue nor the engineered T-cells.\n\u201cWhen the local temperature is raised to 45 degrees (113 F), some cells in our body don\u2019t like it,\u201d Kwong said. \u201cBut if heating is precisely controlled in a 40 to 42 degrees window with short pulses of the NIR light, then it turns on the T-cells\u2019 switch, and body cells are still very comfortable.\u201d\nImmuno-goals and dreams\nThe researchers want to combine the switch with some additional cancer-fighting weapons they envision engineering into T-cells.\nFor example, secreted molecules called cytokines can boost immune cells\u2019 ability to kill cancer, but cytokines, unfortunately, can also be toxic. \u201cOur long-term goal is to engineer T-cells to make and release powerful immune system stimulants like cytokines on command locally and sparingly,\u201d Kwong said.\nIn other studies,\ngently heated gold nanorods have been shown to kill tumors or hinder metastasis . But T-cell treatments could be even more thorough and, in addition, hopefully, one day give patients treated with them a long-lasting memory immune response to any recurrence of their cancer.\nLike this article?\u00a0 Get our email newsletter here.\n[Note: This experimental method is in laboratory stages in mice and is not available as a treatment of any type for human patients.]\nThe study was co-authored by Marielena Castro, Joe Maenza and Jason Weis of Coulter BME at Georgia Tech.
