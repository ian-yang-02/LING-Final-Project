The CS principles course is on par with a college-level intro course for non-CS majors, so it is more accessible to more people,\u201d said Ericson.\nOfficials had estimated nearly 20,000\nAP CS P\nexams would be taken this year. However, Ericson said the actual number topped 40,000.\n\u201cAlthough overall growth in female and minority participation in the AP CS A exam was relatively flat this year, we\u2019re hopeful that the introduction of the P exam will help swell A exam participation rates in the next few years.\u201d\nAP Computer Science A\nDespite marginal growth among underrepresented students, overall participation in the\nAP CS A exam\ngrew by 11.2 percent year-over-year in 2017. A record 60,519 U.S. high school students took the exam with an overall pass rate of 61.8 percent, up more than a percentage point from the previous year.\n\u201cIt\u2019s great to see growth across the board, but there\u2019s still a long way to go before AP computer science is as available in U.S. classrooms as, say, AP Physics or Calculus,\u201d said Ericson.\nMore than 170,000 students took the AP Physics 1 exam this year, while more than 316,000 took the AP Calculus AB exam.\nNegative stereotypes impacting outcomes\n\u201cIncreasing the penetration rate for CS is critically important to the U.S. remaining competitive in an international marketplace increasingly reliant on computing and hungry for highly skilled and well-trained computer science talent,\u201d said Ericson.\nDespite some positive movement this year, the analysis shows that more needs to be done to improve outcomes for female and underrepresented students. The CS A exam had the lowest participation rate among female students than any other AP exam this year.\nThe pass rate nationally for women taking the AP CS A exam was 64 percent, which was lower than males by 3.8 percent. The pass rate for African American females was 26.1 percent. In 12 states, no African American females took the exam.\nComprising just 16 percent of all exam takers, the pass rate for underrepresented students was 44 percent.\n\u201cMany of these students have less exposure and less confidence in their ability to do computer science,\u201d Ericson said. \u201cThey also encounter negative stereotypes about computer science, either people telling them CS is not for them or that CS is boring, antisocial, and doesn\u2019t help anybody.\u201d\nAP Computer Science P\nIn its initial year, 43,780 AP CS Principles exams were given following the 2016 introduction of the new course offering.\nFemale students represented 30 percent of AP CS P exam takers, while 26 percent were from underrepresented groups, which include American Indian/Alaska Native, Black, Hispanic/Latino, and Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islanders. This was the second highest rate of underrepresented minority participation for all STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) AP exams.\nOpportunity to build on success\nOverall, the pass rate for the AP CS P exam was 75.1 percent. However, the same disparity that exists between majority and minority outcomes on the AP CS A exam is also evident in the P exam.\nThe pass rate for women was 70 percent, lower than their male counterparts by 6 percent. At 53 percent, the pass rate for underrepresented students was nearly 30 percent lower than the majority on the CS principles exam.\n\u201cThe goal of the CS P course is to provide an engaging and rigorous introduction to computer science to a broad diversity of students. While the CS P exam takers are more diverse than those who took the CS A exam, the percentage of females is still low and under-represented students have a lower pass rate on both exams,\" said Ericson.\n\u201cMore work needs to be done to recruit and support females and minorities in computer science. Hopefully, as a nation, we can build on the initial success of CS P to truly offer computer science for all students.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nContact\nAlbert Snedeker, Communications Manager\nalbert.snedeker@cc.gatech.edu\nEmail\nalbert.snedeker@cc.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
