We are honored to work with Georgia State on yet another collaboration.\u201d\nThe AGSC will engage college students throughout Atlanta \u2014 including science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) students; community college students; and minority, first-generation and low-income students \u2014 with a goal to serve areas of national needs in educating these college students for careers in business, education, security and defense, and public and governmental sectors.\n\u201cAll students must engage in international education to succeed during the 21st century, both in the job market and as well-informed citizens,\u201d said Risa Palm, provost and senior vice president for academic affairs at Georgia State. \u201cThe new center will help to provide more opportunities for students from underrepresented backgrounds in the region to gain this vital knowledge that is critical for their future success, and for our region and nation.\u201d\nAGSC will foster specialized instruction in international education and less commonly taught languages, such as Arabic, Korean, Portuguese and Hindi. In addition, the AGSC will manage FLAS fellowships for undergraduate and graduate students.\u00a0Prospective Fellows must enroll in language programs and will receive a full-tuition waiver and stipend.\n\u201cThe AGSC is an important step in further innovation of global curriculum, and I am thrilled about the enrichment it will provide to students and community,\u201d said Anthony Lemieux, director of the Georgia State Global Studies Institute and co-director of AGSC.\nAccording to Anna Westerstahl Stenport, chair of the Georgia Tech School of Modern Languages who spearheaded the grant proposal, AGSC priorities will encompass curriculum enhancement, faculty professional development, public events, conferences, language instruction, and kindergarten through 12th grade and community outreach.\n\u201cOur mission is to enhance access to advanced language learning and deepen knowledge of global and intercultural issues for the benefit of Atlanta region students, faculty and the public,\u201d said Stenport, co-director of the AGSC. \u201cThis will be facilitated through robust collaborations in research and instruction with Atlanta universities and with international organizations, consulates, refugee organizations and institutions of public service and higher education in the Southeast and nationally.\u201d\nThe AGSC proposal team from Georgia Tech included professors Stenport, Vicki Galloway, Lizanne DeStefano and Yves Berthelot, who also is the vice provost for international initiatives.\u00a0The Georgia State team included professors Lemieux, William Nichols, and Wolfgang Schl\u00f6r, associate provost for international initiatives.\nThe AGSC will be housed in the Global Studies Institute in Georgia State\u2019s College of Arts & Sciences and the School of Modern Languages in the Georgia Tech Ivan Allen College of Liberal Arts.
