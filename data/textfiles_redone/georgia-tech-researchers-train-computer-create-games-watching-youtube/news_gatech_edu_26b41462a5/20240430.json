An artificially intelligent system watched gameplay video of Super Mario Brothers from streaming video (e.g. YouTube, Twitch) to learn how to design game levels, a first-of-its-kind approach.\nJun 24, 2015\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nGeorgia Institute of Technology researchers have developed a computing system that views gameplay video from streaming services like YouTube or Twitch, analyzes the footage and then is able to create original new sections of a game. The team tested their discovery, the first of its kind, with the original Super Mario Brothers, a well-known two-dimensional platformer game that will allow the new automatic-level designer to replicate results across similar games. The system focuses on the gaming terrain (not the playable character) and the positioning between elements on-screen \u2013 be it pipes, blocks, coins or Goombas \u2013 and it determines the required relationship or level design rule. For example, pipes in the Mario games tend to stick out of the ground, so the system learns this and prevents any pipes from being flush with grassy surfaces. It also prevents \u201cbreaks\u201d by using spatial analysis \u2013 e.g. no impossibly long jumps for the hero. \u201cAn initial evaluation of our approach indicates an ability to produce level sections that are both playable and close to the original without hand coding any design criteria,\u201d says Matthew Guzdial, lead author and Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Georgia Tech. Key to the process is watching the players in action to see where they actually spend most of their time in the game. After recording on-screen locations of sprites, Georgia Tech\u2019s algorithms determine what are high-interaction areas \u2013 those spots where players spend more time to collect bonus items or master a challenge. The automatic-level designer specifically targets these areas to gain design information. The system is then able to build a new level section, element by element. \u201cOur system creates a model or template, and it\u2019s able to produce level sections that have never been seen before, do not appear random and can be traversed by the player,\u201d says Mark Riedl, the study's primary investigator and associate professor of Interactive Computing. \u201cOne could say that the system \u2018studies\u2019 the design of Mario levels until it is able to create new playable areas.\u201d The Georgia Tech system output 151 distinct level sections from 17 samples in the original game, controlling for overall playability and style variables. Output increased to 334 level sections as the system lessened the constraints. The new levels can be played easily by porting them into a game engine. Riedl says this is the first time he is aware of a gameplay video being used to design levels for a Mario game. By applying the technique across a number of different platformer games, a system can theoretically learn genre knowledge, which can be beneficial for procedurally creating games of a given genre. The technique may also extend to other game genres beyond platformers. The researchers next plan to develop full-scale levels and evaluate how gamers interact in those levels compared to the original gameplay videos. The research, \u201cToward Game Level Generation from Gameplay Videos,\u201d is featured June 22-25 at the Foundations of Digital Games Conference in Pacific Grove, Calif.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nJoshua Preston\nGVU Center, College of Computing\n678.231.0787\nEmail\njpreston@cc.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
