(Photo by Allison Carter)\nMar 10, 2023\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nAlex McGee is the university archivist for the\nGeorgia Tech Library . \u201cI am responsible for thinking about what is considered Georgia Tech history and what should be documented in the archives,\u201d she said. Her goal is to document the diverse experiences of the Georgia Tech community, from students to faculty, staff, and alumni.\nMcGee and her colleagues are often contacted by Tech alumni and relatives of deceased alumni who want to donate Tech memorabilia. The archives cannot accept everything, so they must weigh the research and historical value of what is being offered, noting there is much more to the archives than memorabilia.\n\u201cI ask a lot of questions about what they have, how they acquired it, and its condition,\u201d she said. \u201cIf they have a Georgia Tech yearbook, we probably already have multiple copies of it. But if theirs is in better shape than ours, I may be inclined to take it.\u201d\nThe Library Archives , located in Crosland Tower, maintains a digital archive as well as stacks of research material on a wide variety of subjects and a reading room for viewing it. There is also an assortment of artifacts ranging from movie scripts to an Olympic torch designed by Georgia Tech researchers for the 1996 Games held in Atlanta.\n\u201cWhen we take in something for the archives, it is in perpetuity \u2014 as long as Georgia Tech exists. So, we want to make sure that we are good stewards of what comes into our care. That means making decisions about how we arrange, describe, and preserve things so they are accessible and will stand the test of time.\u201d\nMcGee has a bachelor\u2019s degree in history and women\u2019s studies from the University of Georgia, and a master\u2019s in history from Georgia State University. Her first job as an archivist was with the Portman Archives in downtown Atlanta, collecting and documenting material to preserve the architectural legacy of John C. Portman Jr., artist, architect, developer, and Georgia Tech alumnus. After that, she worked at MIT for almost four years as the archivist for the\nWomen@MIT project .\n\u201cWhile at MIT, I also took on the role of interim head of Public Services, focusing on outreach exhibits, instruction, and community engagement with the archives collections,\u201d said McGee, who came to Georgia Tech in 2022. \u201cBeing from Atlanta, I was really keen to come back. When this job became available, I jumped at the opportunity, and thankfully, they thought I was a good fit.\u201d\nAs university archivist, McGee is eager to serve as a resource for anything related to Georgia Tech\u2019s history, assisting a wide range of users with needs regarding Tech history. She enjoys talking to people about their research projects and hearing their excitement when she assists them.\n\u201cIt's rewarding to see how folks end up using the material in their work, such as research, instruction, and exhibits,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is the ultimate goal \u2014 not just to save things, but to have people use them.\u201d\nAway From Work\nWhen she isn\u2019t working, McGee enjoys attending concerts, reading with her cat, Luxe, working out at Orange Theory, and walking her dog, Sadie.\n\u201cI go to a lot of concerts. Before the pandemic, I probably went to 40 or 50 shows a year,\u201d she said. \u201cI met my husband at a Grizzly Bear concert at The Tabernacle.\u201d\nWhen McGee and her husband, Tyler, lived in Cambridge, Massachusetts, they walked a lot. \u201cSo, now we walk our poor dog everywhere,\u201d she said. \u201cSome days she just looks at us like, \u2018Please don\u2019t make me go.\u2019\u201d\nA couple of little-known facts about McGee are she has a twin brother, and she is a hot tub enthusiast. Because she and her brother don\u2019t look alike, most people don\u2019t think they are related, much less twins.\nShe has also always loved hot tubs. She and her husband even received an inflatable hot tub as a wedding present when they got married in Atlanta. When she took the job at MIT, they returned the hot tub they had just received because they didn\u2019t have room for it.\n\"I made a deal with him that we would get a hot tub the next time we lived somewhere that could accommodate it,\" she said. \"He made good on it last year when we moved back to Atlanta.\"\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nLibrary Archives Aims to Capture Diverse Voices\nHidden Georgia Tech: Library Archives\nRead More Staff Stories\nContact\nVictor Rogers\nInstitute Communications\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
