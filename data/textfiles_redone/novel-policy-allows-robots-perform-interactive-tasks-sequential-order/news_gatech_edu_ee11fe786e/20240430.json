Each newly obtained skill is added to the library and leveraged for more complex skills. A turning motion, for instance, can be learned on top of walking while serving as the basis for navigation skills.\nKumar said CCRL has broken new ground on interactive navigation research. Interactive navigation is one of several navigation solutions that allow robots to navigate in the real world. These solutions include point navigation, which trains a robot to reach a point on a map, and object navigation, which teaches it to reach a selected object.\nInteractive navigation requires a robot to reach a goal location while interacting with obstacles on the way, which has proven to be the most difficult for robots to learn.\nThe key, Kumar said, to get a robot to go from walking to pushing an object is in the joints and the robot discovering the different types of motions it can make with them.\nSo far, Kumar\u2019s policy has reached 10 skills that a robot can learn and deploy. The number of skills it can learn on one policy depends on the hardware the programmer is using.\n\u201cIt just takes longer to train as you keep adding more skills because now the policy also has to figure out how to incorporate all these skills in different situations,\u201d he said. \u201cBut theoretically, you can keep adding more skills indefinitely as long as you have a powerful enough computer to run the policies.\u201d\nKumar said he sees CCRL being useful for home assistant robots, which are required to be agile and limber to navigate around a cluttered household. He also said it could possibly serve as a guide dog for the visually impaired.\n\u201cIf you have obstacles in front of someone who is visually impaired, the robot can just clear up the obstacles as the person is walking, open the door for them, and things like that,\u201d he said.\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nFour-legged robot kicks open door at Georgia Tech\nContact\nNathan Deen\nCommunications Officer I\nSchool of Interactive Computing\nnathan.deen@cc.gatech.edu\nEmail\nnathan.deen@cc.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
