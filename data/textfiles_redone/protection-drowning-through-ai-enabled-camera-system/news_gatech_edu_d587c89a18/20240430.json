With its long, constructed section of rapids, the area of the river through Columbus is well-known in kayaking circles as some of the best whitewater in the state, and its picturesque twists and turns draw visitors to walk its banks and invite them to rock-hop along tiny stone islands that are exposed when water levels are low.\nBut this whitewater also presents a life-threatening problem.\nA dam upstream can increase water levels within minutes, and those who aren\u2019t familiar with the area can be surprised and swept away by rushing water. Civic leaders have put up warning signs, and sirens blare when water levels are rising, but despite the many warnings, there are water rescues and even drownings at this area of the river every year.\n\u201cGrowing up around here, you\u2019re always told, \u2018Don\u2019t get in that river. That river will suck you under. You don\u2019t get in there,\u2019\u201d says Jeremy Miles, assistant IT director for the city of Columbus. \u201cBut now on a pretty day, you\u2019ll see a lot of people in the river and beside the river. It\u2019s a new fad. And we also have this great whitewater course, so it\u2019s an attraction that brings people from all over.\u201d\nFor emergency responders, getting a precise location when someone is in danger is critical to favorable outcomes, and those in Columbus emergency circles say that is difficult on the river.\n\u201cWe will have an emergency on the river, and we\u2019ll have the wrong location given to us, and what happens is we\u2019ll bring the wrong piece of equipment or find out it\u2019s in another part of the river,\u201d says Deputy Chief Daniel Macon of Columbus Fire & EMS.\nThis can waste precious seconds during an emergency, which is why Georgia Tech researchers wanted to find a solution.\n\u201cAfter a year and a half of effort,\u201d said\nJohn Taylor , Frederick Law Olmsted Professor in Georgia Tech\u2019s\nSchool of Civil and Environmental Engineering , \u201cwe\u2019ve created a system that can identify people who might be in trouble on the river and give rescue workers precise information that will allow them to get people out of harm\u2019s way or get them out of the water if they\u2019ve fallen in.\u201d\nCameras mounted on a bridge over the river send a constant signal of activity below. A computer algorithm that\u2019s part of the smart river safety digital twin scans the images, identifying people and placement. Using data from other monitoring devices, the system will predict when rising water will put people in danger. The system sends alerts with precise information on location, and emergency responders immediately know what to do and, more importantly, where they need to do it.\nA yellow alert lets responders know someone is in a danger zone. An orange alert means someone is in a danger zone, and water levels are rising quickly. A red alert tells crews that someone is in the water with no boat or kayak nearby and is at risk of drowning.\nDuring a test with Swiftwater/Flood Search and Rescue Team members in October, researchers and city leaders were able to see the system in action.\nNeda Mohammadi, another Georgia Tech researcher and project lead from the School of Civil and Environmental Engineering says, \u201cWe\u2019ve been testing the system live and in real time, and it\u2019s really rewarding to see that it\u2019s working and that what we\u2019ve anticipated really took place.\u201d\nThe work is part of\nPartnership for Inclusive Innovation , a public-private initiative based out of Georgia Tech that catalyzes innovation for shared economic prosperity. It invests in projects that join researchers with communities to provide advanced technologies to build local capacity and improve the human condition.\nColumbus firefighter Captain Stephen Funk says, \u201cIt means time. It means a matter of life and death. And it means having the right people in the right place.\u201d\nAdditional Media\nColumbus firefighters worked with Georgia Tech researchers to test a drowning prevention system on the river that flows next to downtown Columbus, Georgia.\nContact\nW.
