The donation is Leidos\u2019 third to Tech\u2019s Interoperability & Integration Innovation Lab (I3L) since 2013. It will support the development of a pilot data analytics platform in the I3L designed to improve the quality and efficiency of healthcare through data transparency. I3L, a program of Tech\u2019s Enterprise Innovation Institute, is a virtual and physical laboratory for health information technology. \u201cWe are so appreciative of this third-year gift and Leidos\u2019 commitment to technology in the healthcare and information technology spaces,\u201d said Steve Rushing, I3L\u2019s senior strategic advisor. \u201cThis donation allows us to build out a robust aggregate dataset and better define the information employers want in order to optimize the value of their healthcare expenditures.\u201d The project underscores a statewide effort to ensure a healthier Georgia workforce. I3L is collaborating with the Georgia Department of Public Health, the University of Georgia Public Health Department, and a consortium of employers. \u00a0 Leidos\u2019 donation will continue to support health informatics students working on the collaborative pilot. In turn, that will support I3L\u2019s efforts in the Triple Aim Initiative and its core three areas: making the patient care experience better, improving population health, and reducing the per capita cost of healthcare. \u201cThis gift further advances the notable research and work underway at Georgia Tech,\u201d said Doug Barton, chief technology officer at Leidos Health and member on the I3L Industry Advisory Board. \u201cThese efforts reflect an industry imperative for the work we do every day to optimize data, making it useful for population health and to improve operating efficiencies in healthcare.\u201d Leidos works with customers to develop and implement standards-based solutions to ensure interoperability of healthcare information systems, including electronic health records.\u00a0 These solutions, which include advanced analytics, interoperability solutions, and epidemiological and physical services, help customers improve patient care and reduce healthcare costs.\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nInteroperability & Integration Innovation Lab\nLeidos\nContact\nJason Maderer National Media Relations 404-385-2966 jason.maderer@comm.gatech.edu\nEmail\nperalte.paul@comm.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
