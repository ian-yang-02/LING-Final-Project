The asymptomatic spread of the coronavirus is likely both common and significant, authors of\na new study\nsaid.\n\u201cFor the bulk of possible scenarios that can exist, asymptomatic transmission matters in the spread of Covid-19. You have to make very extreme assumptions about the spread for asymptomatic transmission to be unimportant,\u201d said\nJoshua Weitz , a Georgia Institute of Technology professor and the study\u2019s co-principal investigator.\nHow strongly does asymptomatic spread contribute to the Covid-19 pandemic\u2019s curve? The new study addressed the question with mathematical modeling and concluded that this depends on how asymptomatic spread affects what is called the generation interval for new infections.\nSimply put, the generation interval is how long it takes for a person infected today to infect the next person.\nKnowing where these intervals fall allows researchers to calculate a more accurate value for R0 (R naught), a number that indicates the pandemic\u2019s inherent strength of contagion in the absence of measures like distancing or masks to push it down. R0 is used to project how long the pandemic can last, how high the infection curve can go, and how many people in total could get sick and die.\nFor more coverage of Georgia Tech\u2019s response to the coronavirus pandemic, please visit our\u00a0 Responding to Covid-19 page .\nBut unlike highly visible data such as new cases per day, hospitalizations, or death toll, asymptomatic spread moves in the shadows because those cases very often remain unrecorded. Documenting them would take large-scale virus and antibody testing and meticulous contact tracing.\nAssumption vs. calculation\nThat makes it challenging to accurately measure the real-time impact of asymptomatic spread. In light of this, the researchers calculated how a broad range of asymptomatic spread scenarios would affect the nature of the generation interval and the course of the pandemic.\nThey found that asymptomatic spread\u2019s contributions can reduce or raise the R0 calculation dramatically. That would mean that if current assumptions about asymptomatic spread are significantly inaccurate, R0\u2019s value and the resulting projections of the pandemic\u2019s length and severity would be, too.\n\u201cTo get R0, we make an assumption about how generation intervals are distributed. Not accounting for asymptomatic generation intervals leads to biases in how big R0 is for Covid-19,\u201d said Weitz, who is a professor in Georgia Tech\u2019s\nSchool of Biological Sciences\nand founding director of the Quantitative Biosciences Graduate Program.\nThe team, led by Weitz and Jonathan Dushoff from McMaster University,\npublished their results\nin the June 2020 issue of the journal Epidemics. Sang Woo Park of Princeton University and Daniel Cornforth of Georgia Tech coauthored the study. The research was funded by the Simons Foundation, the Army Research Office, the National Institutes of Health, and the National Science Foundation.\nSpeed vs. strength\nThough the study was not about mitigations like distancing and masks, the authors, like public health officials, said both pushback on the virus\u2019s innate strength of transmission. If a society can push the strength below 1 \u2013 one infected person infecting just one other person on average \u2013 the pandemic starts to fade away, a success a few countries have already achieved.\n\u201cIf a lot of transmission is going the asymptomatic route, masks are really going to work in our favor. We should be prioritizing mask-wearing as a public health intervention irrespective of symptoms,\u201d Weitz said.\nThere are important differences between the speed of contagion \u2013 how steeply the curve is climbing \u2013 and the strength \u2013 how sustained contagion is over time and how high the curve will peak. Speed is highly visible, strength much less so.\nBarring measures to slow it, the innate speed of a pandemic is seen by how quickly the number of new cases per day doubles \u2013 for example, every four days. But the strength of contagion is partly hidden in the yet-obscured frequency of asymptomatic contagion.\nAdding to that stealth, the speed of spread on the upside of the curve looks exactly the same for many strengths, i.e. R0 values.\n\u201cThat is the tricky thing. The difference comes in the long term, and it is big,\u201d Dushoff said. \u201cRight now, we are judging the spread by its speed, but what can make the big difference in the peak and the duration of the pandemic is the strength of the spread.\u201d\nShort vs. long\nA short generation interval can make for a shorter pandemic with a lower peak, and a long interval would expand both. Two polar opposite scenarios illustrate how this works. For the sake of the exercise, let\u2019s assume we know the real value of Covid-19\u2019s generation intervals during a pandemic where case counts double about every four days and symptomatic persons can spread the virus for six days on average.\nLet\u2019s say, hypothetically, that people transmitting the virus asymptomatically, on average, either:\nCan spread the coronavirus for only three days \u2013 a short generation interval, half the duration of symptomatic cases.\nOr, alternatively, spread the virus for 12 days \u2013 a long generation interval, twice the duration of symptomatic cases.\nTo maintain the speed of spread, in the first scenario, the virus is having to pass to more people more quickly, and herd immunity \u2013 when enough people have immunity to stop the spread \u2013 is reached sooner. The R0 is lower; the curve peaks and begins its decline sooner, and that reduces the total number of illnesses and deaths.\n\u201cIf the generation interval is long, that means it takes fewer infected people to maintain the same speed of contagion and that the spread is stronger, more sustained,\u201d Weitz said. \u201cIf asymptomatic people are staying infected longer than we have thought and are infecting more people in the course of their infection than thought, then we are currently underestimating R0.\u201d\nIf so, just when we think we have reached the peak, Covid-19\u2019s climb would keep going, lengthening the pandemic and increasing the number of severe and deadly cases.\nThese researchers coauthored the study: The research was funded by the Simons Foundation (SCOPE Award 329108), the Army Research Office (grant W911NF1910384), the National Institutes of Health (1R01AI46592-01), and the National Science Foundation (grants 1806606 and 1829636).
