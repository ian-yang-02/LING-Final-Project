This initiative will infuse funding into early, innovative technologies to speed development of rapid and widely accessible COVID-19 testing with a mandate that tests be deployed to Americans this fall.\n\u201cThe\nNational Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB)\nis urging all scientists and inventors with a rapid testing technology to compete in a national COVID-19 testing challenge for a share of up to $500 million over all phases of development that will assist the public\u2019s safe return to normal activities,\u201d said Wilbur Lam, M.D., Ph.D., pediatric hematologist and oncologist at\nAflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center of Children\u2019s\nand principal investigator of ACME POCT.\nAs one of only five NIH-funded point-of-care technology centers in the nation within the Point-of-Care Technologies Research Network (POCTRN), ACME POCT will receive a $10 million to $20 million supplement to work closely with relevant technology developers and the medical diagnostics industry across the country to meet the deadline. The technologies will be put through a highly competitive, rapid three-phase selection process to identify the best candidates for at-home or point-of-care tests for COVID-19. The goal is to make millions of accurate and easy-to-use tests per week available to all Americans by the end of summer 2020 and in time for the flu season.\nThe Center will operate on the frontlines assessing, validating and conducting clinical trials as well as advising in manufacturing and scale-up of relevant COVID-19 tests. They expect hundreds of technology developers and companies to apply for the RADx program and will be involved in clinical validation and shepherding successful projects to meet this national need, making Children\u2019s, Emory and Georgia Tech frontline warriors in this effort.\nACME POCT fosters the development and commercialization of microsystems (microchip-enabled, biosensor-based, microfluidic) diagnostic tests that can be used outside the traditional hospital setting, in places such as the home, community or doctor\u2019s office. Lam and his team will evaluate the tests for the NIBIB as they urgently solicit proposals.\nLam is the principal investigator of ACME POCT and also serves as associate professor of the Emory University School of Medicine Department of Pediatrics and the\nWallace H. Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology and Emory University . Greg Martin, M.D., is co-principal investigator along with Oliver Brand, Ph.D., executive director of Georgia Tech\u2019s Institute for Electronics and Nanotechnology and a professor in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering. Together the team makes up the only point-of-care center in the nation dedicated to developing microsystems with sensors, smart phones and wearable technologies. Dr. Martin is also a professor with the Emory University School of Medicine and Chair of Critical Care for Grady Health System.\nAbout Children\u2019s Healthcare of Atlanta:\u00a0 As the only freestanding pediatric healthcare system in Georgia, Children\u2019s Healthcare of Atlanta is the trusted leader in caring for kids.
