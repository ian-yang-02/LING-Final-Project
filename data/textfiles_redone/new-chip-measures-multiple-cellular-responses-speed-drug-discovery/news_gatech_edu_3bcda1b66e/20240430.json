Researchers from the Georgia Institute of Technology have designed a cellular interfacing array using low-cost electronics that measures multiple cellular properties and responses in real time. This could enable many more potential drugs to be comprehensively tested for efficacy and toxic effects much faster. That\u2019s why Hua Wang, associate professor in the\nSchool of Electrical and Computer Engineering\nat Georgia Tech, describes it as \u201chelping us find the golden needle in the haystack.\u201d\nPharmaceutical companies use cell-based assays, a combination of living cells and sensor electronics, to measure physiological changes in the cells. That data is used for high-throughput screening (HTS) during drug discovery. In this early phase of drug development, the goal is to identify target pathways and promising chemical compounds that could be developed further \u2013 and to eliminate those that are ineffective or toxic \u2013 by measuring the physiological responses of the cells to each compound.\nPhenotypic testing of thousands of candidate compounds, with the majority \u201cfailing early,\u201d allows only the most promising ones to be further developed into drugs and maybe eventually to undergo clinical trials, where drug failure is much more costly. But most existing cell-based assays use electronic sensors that can only measure one physiological property at a time and cannot obtain holistic cellular responses.\nThat\u2019s where the new cellular sensing platform comes in. \u201cThe innovation of our technology is that we are able to leverage the advance of nano-electronic technologies to create cellular interfacing platforms with massively parallel pixels,\u201d said Wang. \u201cAnd within each pixel we can detect multiple physiological parameters from the same group of cells at the same time.\u201d The experimental quad-modality chip features extracellular or intracellular potential recording, optical detection, cellular impedance measurement, and biphasic current stimulation.\nWang said the new technology offers four advantages over existing platforms:\nMultimodal sensing:\nThe chip\u2019s ability to record multiple parameters on the same cellular sample gives researchers the ability to comprehensively monitor complex cellular responses, uncover the correlations among those parameters and investigate how they may respond together when exposed to drugs. \u201cLiving cells are small but highly complex systems. Drug administration often results in multiple physiological changes, but this cannot be detected using conventional single-modal sensing,\u201d said Wang.\nLarge field of view:\nThe platform allows researchers to examine the behavior of cells in a large aggregate to see how they respond collectively at the tissue level.\nSmall spatial resolution:\nNot only can researchers look at cells at the tissue level, they could also examine them at single-cell or even sub-cellular resolution.\nLow-cost platform:\nThe new array platform is built on standard complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technologies, which is also used to build computer chips, and can be easily scaled up for mass production.\nWang\u2019s team worked closely with Hee Cheol Cho, associate professor and the Urowsky-Sahr Scholar in Pediatric Bioengineering, whose Heart Regeneration lab is part of the\nWallace Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering\nat Georgia Tech and Emory University. They used neonatal rat ventricular myocytes and cardiac fibroblasts to illustrate the multi-parametric cell profiling ability of the array for drug screening.\nThe recent results\nwere published in the Royal Society of Chemistry\u2019s journal\nLab on a Chip\non August 31, 2018.\nMonitoring cellular responses in multi-physical domains and holistic multi-parametric cellular profiling should also prove beneficial in screening out chemical compounds that could have harmful effects on certain organs, said Jong Seok Park, a post-doctoral fellow in Wang\u2019s lab and a leading author of the study. Many drugs have been withdrawn from the market after discoveries that they had toxic effects on the heart or liver, for example. This platform should enable researchers to comprehensively test for organ toxicity and other side effects at the initial phases of drug discovery.\nThe experimental chip may be useful for other applications, including personalized medicine \u2013 for example, testing cancer cells from a particular patient. \u201cPatient to patient variation is huge, even with the same type of drug,\u201d said Wang. The cellular interface array could be used to see which combination of existing drugs would give the best response and to find the optimum dose that is most effective with minimum toxicity to healthy cells.\nThe chip is capable of actuation as well as sensing. In the future, Wang said that cellular data from the chip could be uploaded and processed, and based on that, commands for new actuation or data acquisition could be sent to the chip automatically and wirelessly. He envisions rooms and rooms containing culture chambers with millions of such chips in fully automated facilities, \u201cjust automatically doing new drug selection for us,\u201d he said.\nBeyond these applications, Wang noted the scientific value of the research itself. Integrated circuits and nanoelectronics are some of the most sophisticated technology platforms created by humans. Living cells, on the other hand, are complex products produced through billions of years of natural selection and evolution.\n\u201cThe central theme of our research is how we can leverage the best platform created by nature with the best platform created by humans,\u201d he said. \u201cCan we let them work together to create hybrid systems that achieve capabilities beyond biology only or electronics only systems? The fundamental scientific question we are addressing is how we can let inorganic electronics better interface with organic living cells.\u201d\nThese researchers also participated in the related studies: Doohwan Jung, Adam Wang, Taiyun Chi, Sensen Li and Moez K.
