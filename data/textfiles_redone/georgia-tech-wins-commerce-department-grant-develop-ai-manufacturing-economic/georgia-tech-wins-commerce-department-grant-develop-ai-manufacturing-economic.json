Commerce Department officials were in\nDec 14, 2021\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nThe Georgia Institute of Technology was awarded a grant from the U.S. Department of Commerce\u2019s Economic Development Administration (EDA) as part of its $1 billion\u00a0 Build Back Better Regional Challenge . Georgia Tech is one of 60 entities to be awarded funding to assist communities nationwide in their efforts to accelerate the rebuilding of their economies in the wake of the pandemic.\nAs a leader in artificial intelligence, manufacturing research, and innovation-led economic development, Georgia Tech will utilize the grant for technical assistance to plan the Georgia Artificial Intelligence Manufacturing Corridor (GA-AIM). Led by Thomas Kurfess and Aaron Stebner in the\u00a0 George W. Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering \u00a0and in collaboration with local partners, GA-AIM will fill existing technology gaps, build a technological opportunity framework that includes underrepresented communities and rural Georgia counties, and better secure the state\u2019s manufacturing infrastructure.\nGeorgia Tech\u2019s partners in the effort include the\u00a0 Russell Innovation Center for Entrepreneurs ,\u00a0 Spelman College , the\u00a0 Technical College System of Georgia , and the\u00a0 Georgia Department of Economic Development .\n\u201cWe are truly honored to be awarded this grant to implement our vision for manufacturing excellence in Georgia with our partners in artificial intelligence research,\u201d said Chaouki T. Abdallah, executive vice president for Research at Georgia Tech. \u201cAlongside\u00a0these important partners, the grant enables us to collaborate to include diverse backgrounds and perspectives in the process of learning, discovery, and creation, furthering Georgia Tech\u2019s mission to expand access.\u201d\nGeorgia Tech and its partners will pair artificial intelligence and manufacturing research innovation to better secure the manufacturing ecosystem, expand opportunity to distressed and rural communities and underrepresented groups, and support business growth across the state.\n\u201cWe are thrilled to help communities work together \u2014 in coalitions of government, nonprofits, academia, the private sector, and others \u2014 to craft ambitious and regionally unique plans to rebuild their communities,\u201d said Alejandra Y. Castillo, assistant secretary of commerce for the EDA. \u201cThese projects will help revitalize local economies and tackle our biggest challenges related to climate change, manufacturing, supply chains, and more. EDA is proud to ignite these plans and help communities nationwide build back better.\u201d\nGA-AIM\u2019s partners have created a complementary network of resources that focus on each partner organization\u2019s expertise and mission.\n\u201cWe have an opportunity to create meaningful impact at the intersection of AI and manufacturing,\u201d said Stebner, who wrote the grant proposal that resulted in the $500,000 grant from EDA.\nKurfess, who serves as the regional economic competitiveness officer for the grant, added, \u201cBringing together AI and manufacturing will ensure a strong manufacturing base for Georgia that will leverage our well-trained workforce and our strong educational institutions that are participating in this effort. What excites me the most is that AI will augment our workforce, making it more valuable and productive, ensuring job growth for Georgia and the U.S. well into the future.\u201d\nThe GA-AIM effort takes a multifaceted approach to address its core goals:\nGeorgia Tech\nFormation of the AI Manufacturing Pilot Facility: \u00a0Georgia Tech\u2019s\u00a0 Advanced Manufacturing Pilot Facility \u00a0will be transformed into the AI Manufacturing Pilot Facility. The new facility allows for government pilot trials, cybersecurity games, and workforce training to innovate, transition, and create a workforce for AI manufacturing technologies without exposing the region\u2019s supply chains to risk.\nCenter for AI Commercialization:\u00a0 Two of Georgia Tech\u2019s commercialization programs \u2014\u00a0 VentureLab \u00a0and\u00a0 I-Corps South \u00a0\u2014 will create a center for the commercialization of AI manufacturing technologies into local and regional startups. Those commercialization efforts will occur through a quarterly cohort-based entrepreneurial training program built on the National Science Foundation\u2019s I-Corps curriculum. The center will also provide training for instructors to build a sustainable workforce and will secure investment funding for these startups.\nAI Manufacturing Community Engagement : The\u00a0 Enterprise Innovation Institute , Georgia Tech\u2019s chief economic development arm, will engage in focused outreach and technical assistance to small and mid-sized manufacturers and minority business enterprises through its Georgia Manufacturing Extension Partnership and Georgia Minority Business Development Agency Business Center programs. A third Enterprise Innovation Institute program, the Economic Development Lab, will focus on outreach and engagement in distressed and underserved parts of the state, create workforce development programs and implementation strategies, and attract outside investment.\nAI Manufacturing Rural Supply Chain : The Supply Chain and Logistics Institute will study the impact of automation technologies, build automation solutions tailored for rural manufacturers, and create programs that lower the barrier for rural manufacturers\u2019 access to use the AI Manufacturing Pilot Facility.\nAI InVenture K-12 Experiences:\u00a0 To ensure a technically capable workforce in the coming years, Georgia Tech\u2019s InVenture Prize and the Center for Education Integrating Science, Mathematics, and Computing will expand their emphasis to rural and underserved areas of the state by piloting a rural regional event with a region-specific prize. They will also create supplemental lessons centered on AI and data science that will be part of a K-12 InVenture Prize curriculum website.\nSpelman College\nVirtual Reality for AI Workforce Training Innovation: \u00a0Spelman\u2019s\u00a0 Innovation Lab \u00a0will develop virtual reality technology for training or retraining the GA-AIM workforce to make workers comfortable with new technologies before deployment in real-world applications.\nRussell Innovation Center for Entrepreneurs\nLaunchPad AI Innovation Studio:\u00a0 The Russell Innovation Center for Entrepreneurs will create the 5,000-square-foot LaunchPad AI Innovation Studio to provide prototyping and proof of concept development of physical products. Black entrepreneurs will be given access to equipment, training, and mentoring. LaunchPad AI will also be open to AI InVenture teams from Atlanta\u2019s K-12 public schools, with special programs designed for startup mentoring and seed funding for K-12 entrepreneurs.\nTechnical College System of Georgia (TCSG)\nAI Manufacturing Technical Workforce Development:\u00a0 As Georgia\u2019s technical college coordinating organization, the TCSG will design, develop, and implement curricula at community colleges that include apprenticeships at AI-MPF and virtual reality modules from Spelman. The TCSG will also provide regional entry points for dual enrollment and traditional students to AI manufacturing technical education at certificate and degree levels. Graduates will have exit points that lead directly to careers in the industry or provide for the continuation of education and higher degree attainment through articulation agreements among GA-AIM members.\nWith this grant, Tech becomes a finalist for significantly more funding to implement projects that support an industry sector and help communities withstand future economic shocks.\n\u201cGA-AIM is in strategic alignment with the EDA\u2019s funding priorities, including manufacturing, workforce development, equity, and technology-based economic development,\u201d said\u00a0 David Bridges , vice president of the Enterprise Innovation Institute at Georgia Tech and co-author of the grant proposal. \u201cWith manufacturing employing more than 400,000 people across the state and contributing more than $61 billion in economic activity, it\u2019s critical that we leverage the best ideas and programs through our coalition of partners.\u201d\n###\nAbout the Georgia Institute of Technology\nThe Georgia Institute of Technology, or Georgia Tech, is a top 10 public research university developing leaders who advance technology and improve the human condition.
