Your DNA is built upon gene fragments from primal ancestors.\nNow researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology have made it more likely that ancestral genes, along with ancestral proteins, can be confidently identified and reconstructed. They have benchmarked a vital tool that would seem nearly impossible to benchmark. The newly won confidence in the tool could also help scientists compute ancient gene sequences and use them to synthesize better proteins to battle diseases.\nFor some 20 years, scientists have used algorithms to compute their way hundreds of millions of years back into the evolutionary past. Starting with present-day gene sequences, they perform what\u2019s called ancestral sequence reconstruction (ASR) to determine past mutations and figure out the genes\u2019 primal forerunners.\n\u201cWith the help of ASR, we can now actually build those ancient genes in the laboratory and express their encoded ancient proteins,\u201d said\u00a0 Eric Gaucher, an associate professor at Georgia Tech\u2019s School of Biological Sciences . In a separate project, his lab is computing ancient proteins that were very effective in blood clotting 80 million years ago,\nin hopes of using them to fight hemophilia\ntoday.\nThat protein comes from a common ancestor humans share with rats.\nTime travel substitute\nBut ASR algorithms have faced logical criticism. Species based on those primal genes are long extinct, and scientists can\u2019t travel back in time to observe mutations that have happened since. So, how can anyone find any physical benchmark to verify and gauge ASR?\nA team of researchers led by Gaucher did it by building an evolutionary framework out of myriad mutations. Then they benchmarked ASR algorithms against it \u2013 no time machine required. Their results have shored up confidence that the widely used algorithms are working as they should.\n\u201cMost of them did a very good job \u2013 98% accurate,\u201d Gaucher said of contemporary algorithms\u2019 ability to compute ancient gene sequences. Their determination of proteins encoded by those sequences was virtually perfect.\nGaucher, research coordinator Ryan Randall and undergraduate student Caelan Radford published their results on Thursday, September 15, 2016,\nin the journal\nNature Communications .\nTheir research has been funded by the NASA Exobiology program, E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company (DuPont) and the National Science Foundation.\nHolographic tree branches\nAncestral sequence reconstruction is like making a family tree for genes.\nThe many twigs and branches at the treetop would be sequences from species alive today. Shimmying down the tree, called a phylogeny in genetics, you would find their common ancestors, millions of years old, in the lower branches.\nThere\u2019s a caveat; none of the lower branches exist any longer. They vanished in the extinction of the species bearing those genetic sequences.\nASR computes them back into place using algorithms based on scientific models of evolution. It\u2019s like replacing missing branches with holographic duplicates.\nAlgorithm horse race\nThe accuracy of those evolutionary models has been a historic sticking point. And doubts about the algorithms based on them linger in some circles that hold on to an old, tried-and-true algorithm.\nSo, Gaucher and researcher coordinator Randall pitted the contemporary model-based, or \u201cmaximum likelihood,\u201d algorithms in a race against the generic, or \u201cparsimony,\u201d algorithm.\n\u201cParsimony follows the simplest notion of evolution, which is that very little mutation occurs,\u201d Randall said. The models behind contemporary \u201cmaximum likelihood\u201d algorithms, by contrast, are laced with filigree, data-packed details.\nFor the race, Randall made a track of sorts by putting a gene sequence that made a single protein through multiple mutations to construct a real-life phylogeny. She used methods that closely mimicked natural evolution, but that were much, much faster.\nRainbow phylogeny racetrack\nIn cells, enzymes called polymerases aid in DNA duplication.\u00a0 They work very efficiently, but their rare mistakes are the most common source of mutations, and Randall took her lead from this.\n\u201cWe used a polymerase that is error-prone to speed up mutations, and speed up evolution,\u201d she said.\nThe genes used at the starting point of the lab evolution made a protein that fluoresced red when placed in bacteria.\u00a0 As significant mutations arose, the proteins began changing color.\u00a0 Bacteria containing green fluorescing proteins popped up among the red ones.\nRandall divided bacteria with major mutations into new groups, creating branches in the phylogeny, as she went. Many mutations produced new colors \u2013 yellow, orange, blue, pink \u2013 and Randall ended up with a gene family tree in rainbow colors.\nShow me the phenotype\nThe colors reflected not only new gene sequences but also new phenotypes \u2013 the actual proteins they produced, the organism\u2019s working molecules.\n\u201cWhat counts is phenotype,\u201d Gaucher said. \u201cWhen you analyze DNA strictly by itself, it ignores the context, in which that DNA is connected to phenotype,\u201d he said.\nDNA can mutate and still encode the same amino acids, protein\u2019s component parts. Then the mutation has no real effect. But when mutations cause DNA to encode different amino acids, they\u2019re more significant.\nA worthy test of ancestral sequence reconstruction algorithms must therefore include phenotype. And Randall took this into account when she selected mutated proteins.\n\u201cI selected for variants to purposely make it hard on the algorithms to infer the phenotypes,\u201d she said. The race ensued, and the algorithms got limited information to infer the evolutionary tree\u2019s many dozens of past mutations.\nASR a sure bet\nThough the tried-and-true parsimony algorithm performed well, maximum likelihood performed better.\u00a0 \u201cEven though it got the same number of residues (DNA sequences) wrong as parsimony, the incorrectly inferred sequences were still more likely to encode the right phenotypes,\u201d said undergraduate student Caelan Radford, who analyzed the experiment\u2019s statistics.\nThe margin of error was so tiny that it would not interfere in the determination of past species.\nThe experiment\u2019s outcome was not too surprising, because prior simulations had predicted it.\u00a0 But the researchers wanted the scientific community to have physical proof that feels trustier than proof from a computer.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s a computer algorithm.\u00a0 It will do what you will tell it to do,\u201d Gaucher said.\nShort history of ASR\nDoubts about ancestral sequence reconstruction -- and maximum likelihood algorithms in particular -- go far back.\u00a0 The idea of performing ASR first came up in 1963, but it didn\u2019t get started until the 1990s, and back then, researchers battled fervently over wide-ranging methods.\n\u201cPeople would come up with the craziest notion as to why one model was best,\u201d Gaucher said. \u201cThey\u2019d say, \u2018Well, if I simulate this weird mode of evolution along these branches here, my algorithm will work better than your algorithm.\u2019\u201d\nThe parsimony algorithm was a way of reigning in the chaos that grew out of a lack of data in evolutionary models at the time.\u00a0 \u201cWhen the model is wrong, \u2018maximum likelihood\u2019 fails miserably,\u201d Gaucher said.\nBut, now, a host of data and analysis give scientists a great picture of how evolution works (and it\u2019s not a parsimony principle): For ages, nothing moves, then change bursts forth, then things stabilize again.\n\u201cYou get this quick evolution, so lots of stuff works and lots of stuff fails, and the stuff that works then goes on and kind of maintains its status and doesn\u2019t change,\u201d Gaucher said.\u00a0 By confirming the high accuracy of the algorithms, the Georgia Tech team has also corroborated the validity of current evolutionary science they\u2019re based on.\nKelsey Roof and Divya Natarajan of Georgia Tech coauthored the paper.
