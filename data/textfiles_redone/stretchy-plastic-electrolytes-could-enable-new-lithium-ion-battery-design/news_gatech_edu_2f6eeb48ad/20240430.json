The ions flow between the electrodes through a liquid electrolyte.\nFor the study, which was published Sept. 9 in the journal\u00a0 Nature Materials \u00a0and sponsored by the Army Research Office, the research team fabricated a new type of cathode from iron fluoride active material and a solid polymer electrolyte nanocomposite. Iron fluorides have more than double the lithium capacity of traditional cobalt- or nickel-based cathodes. In addition, iron is 300 times cheaper than cobalt and 150 times cheaper than nickel.\nTo produce such a cathode, the researchers developed a process to infiltrate a solid polymer electrolyte into the prefabricated iron fluoride electrode. They then hot pressed the entire structure to increase density and reduce any voids.\nTwo central features of the polymer-based electrolyte are its ability to flex and accommodate the swelling of the iron fluoride while cycling and its ability to form a very stable and flexible interphase with iron fluoride. Traditionally, that swelling and massive side reactions have been key problems with using iron fluoride in previous battery designs.\n\u201cCathodes made from iron fluoride have enormous potential because of their high capacity, low material costs and very broad availability of iron,\u201d Yushin said. \u201cBut the volume changes during cycling as well as parasitic side reactions with liquid electrolytes and other degradation issues have limited their use previously. Using a solid electrolyte with elastic properties solves many of these problems.\u201d\nThe researchers then tested several variations of the new solid-state batteries to analyze their performance over more than 300 cycles of charging and discharging at elevated temperature of 122 degrees Fahrenheit, noting that they outperformed previous designs using metal fluoride even when these were kept cool at room temperatures.\nThe researchers found that the key to the enhanced battery performance was the solid polymer electrolyte. In previous attempts to use metal fluorides, it was believed that metallic ions migrated to the surface of the cathode and eventually dissolved into the liquid electrolyte, causing a capacity loss, particularly at elevated temperatures. In addition, metal fluorides catalyzed massive decomposition of liquid electrolytes when cells were operating above 100 degrees Fahrenheit. However, at the connection between the solid electrolyte and the cathode, such dissolving doesn\u2019t take place and the solid electrolyte remains remarkably stable, preventing such degradations, the researchers wrote.\n\u201cThe polymer electrolyte we used was very common, but many other solid electrolytes and other battery or electrode architectures \u2013 such as core-shell particle morphologies \u2013 should be able to similarly dramatically mitigate or even fully prevent parasitic side reactions and attain stable performance characteristics,\u201d said Kostiantyn Turcheniuk, research scientist in Yushin\u2019s lab and a co-author of the manuscript.\nIn the future, the researchers aim to develop new and improved solid electrolytes to enable fast charging and also to combine solid and liquid electrolytes in new designs that are fully compatible with conventional cell manufacturing technologies employed in large battery factories.\nThis material is based upon work supported by the Army Research Office under Grant No. W911NF-17-1-0053.
