Then add a pinch of thickener.\nThat last ingredient may have helped gene-like strands to copy themselves in puddles for the first time ever, billions of years ago when Earth was devoid of life, researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology have found. Their novel discoveries add to a growing body of evidence that suggests first life may have evolved with relative ease, here and possibly elsewhere in the universe.\nAnd they offer a straightforward answer to a gnawing 50-year-old question: How did precursors to the present-day genetic code first duplicate themselves before the existence of enzymes that are indispensable to that process today?\nThe spice of life?\nFor generations, scientists pursuing an answer performed experiments in water but hit a wall.\nGeorgia Tech researchers\nChristine He\nand Isaac G\u00e1llego overcame it by adding an off-the-shelf viscous solvent (the thickener). In separate experiments with DNA then RNA, the copying process proceeded.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s very, very different from anything that\u2019s been done before,\u201d said researcher He.\u00a0\u201cWe can change the physical environment in an easy way, and promote these processes that wouldn\u2019t happen in conditions ordinarily being used.\u201d\nEasy recipe\nEasy is crucial, said\nMartha Grover , a professor who oversaw the research at\nGeorgia Tech\u2019s School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering . Easy reactions are likely to be more productive and more prevalent.\n\u201cA simple and robust process like this one could have operated in a variety of environments and concentrations making it more realistic in moving evolution forward,\u201d she said.\nGrover\u2019s lab and that of Nick Hud at\nGeorgia Tech\u2019s School of Chemistry and Biochemistry\npublished the results on Monday, October 10, 2016 in the journal\nNature Chemistry .\nTheir research has been funded by the National Science Foundation and the NASA Astrobiology Program under the\nNASA/NSF Center for Chemical Evolution.\nNucleotide noodles\nEarliest life was based on RNA, or a similar polymer, according to a hypothesis called the\nRNA World . In that scenario, on the\nevolutionary timeline , the self-replication of RNA strands long enough to be potential genes would roughly mark the doorstep to life.\nThose long nucleotide chains may have been mixed together in puddles with shorter nucleotide chains. Heat from the sun would have made long strands detach from their helix structures, giving short ones a chance to match up with them, and become their copies.\nBut there\u2019s a problem.\nIn water alone, when cooling sets in, the long chains snap back into their helix structure so rapidly that there\u2019s no time for the matching process with the shorter chains. That snapping shut, which happens in both RNA and DNA, is called \u201cstrand inhibition,\u201d and in living cells, enzymes solve the problem of keeping the long chains apart while gene strands duplicate.\nMore like a stew\n\u201cThe problem is a problem in water, which everybody sort of looks at in prebiotic (pre-life) chemistry,\u201d said graduate research assistant He. She felt it was time to rethink that, and her expertise in chemical engineering helped.\nHigh viscosity has been known to slow down the movement of long strands of DNA, RNA and other polymers.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a little like making them swim in honey,\u201d Grover said. Applying that to origin-of-life chemistry seemed obvious, because in prebiotic times, there probably were quite a few sticky puddles.\n\u201cIn that solution, it gives the short nucleotides, which move faster, time to jump onto the long strand and piece together a duplicate of the long strand,\u201d researcher He said. In her experiments, it worked.\nHairpins in the soup\nAnd it produced an encouraging surprise. The DNA and RNA strands folded onto themselves forming shapes called hairpins.\n\u201cIn the beginning, we didn\u2019t realize the importance of the internal structure,\u201d Christine He said. Then they noticed that the shape was helping keep RNA and DNA available for the pairing process. \u201cHairpin formation is integral to keeping them open,\u201d Grover said.\nBut it also could have accelerated chemical evolution in another way. \u00a0\u201cThe solution is selecting here for sequences that fold, and that would have more potential for functional activity \u2013 like a ribozyme,\u201d said researcher He.\nRibozymes are enzymes made of RNA, and enzymes catalyze biochemical processes. To have them evolve in the same solution that promotes genetic code replication could have shortened the path to first life.\n\u201cYou really need to amplify functional sequences for evolution to move forward,\u201d Grover said. The folds were an unexpected side-effect, and finding them paves the way for future research.\nNext ingredient?\nThe Georgia Tech scientists used real gene strands in their experiments, which may sound mundane, but in the past, some researchers have specially engineered DNA and RNA sequences in attempts to arrive at similar results.\nHe and G\u00e1llego\u2019s use of a naturally occurring gene, rather than a specifically engineered sequence, shows that viscosity could have been a very general solution to promote copying of nucleic acids with mixed length and sequences.\nTo facilitate quick, clear outcomes, the Georgia Tech researchers used purified short nucleotide chains and applied them in ratios that favored productive reactions. But they had started out with messier, less pure ingredients, and the experience was worthwhile.\n\u201cConsidering a pre-biotic soup, it\u2019s probably messy; it\u2019s got a lot of impurities,\u201d Christine He said. \u201cWhen we first started out with more impure nucleotides, it still worked. Maybe the same reaction really could have happened in a messy puddle billions of years ago.\u201d\nThe viscous solvent was\nglycholine, a mixture of glycerol and choline chloride . It was not likely present on pre-biotic Earth, but other viscous solvents likely were.\nAlso, after the short strands matched up to each long one, the researchers did apply an enzyme to join the aligned short pieces into a long chain, in a biochemical process called ligation.\nThe enzymes would not have been present on a prebiotic Earth, and although\nthere are chemical procedure for ligating RNA , \u201cno one has developed a chemistry so robust yet that it could replace the enzyme,\u201d Grover said.\nFinding one that could have worked on a prebiotic Earth would be a worthy aim for further research.\nREAD: More about chemical engineering, viscosity and DNA\nREAD: Possible precusor of RNA forms spontaneously in water\nBrandon Laughlin from Georgia Tech coauthored the paper.
