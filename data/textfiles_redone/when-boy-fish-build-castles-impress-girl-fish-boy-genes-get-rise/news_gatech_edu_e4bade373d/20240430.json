The up and down-regulation of genes may actually be steering ritual mating behaviors.

Take boy fish who tirelessly build sand structures to attract girl fish: Researchers have now\u00a0connected gene activity with this instinctive behavior.\nThe scientists at the Georgia Institute of Technology and Stanford University who led\u00a0 the new study \u00a0hope in the future to see if some behaviors are indeed genetic programs and if gene regulation is clicking off neuronal firing patterns in real time to create behavior.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not there yet, but we\u2019re beginning to get a handle on gene regulation patterns that drive the neuronal patterns,\u201d said\nTodd Streelman,\u00a0professor and chair of Georgia Tech\u2019s School of Biological Sciences and also its chair , and a researcher in the Petit Institute for Bioengineering and Bioscience. \u201cWe\nwere\nable to see that there\u2019s a clear connection between gene expression and behavior.\u201d\nBetter understanding autism\nThe research also may contribute\u00a0to a better understanding of autism because the genes behind the fish behavior have human cousins that are implicated in autism spectrum disorder. And some typical autism behaviors like \u201cstacking,\u201d in which a child compulsively arranges objects into neat rows or towers, have parallels in how the fish, called cichlids, repetitively pile up sand to make symmetrical formations.\nBut for now, the researchers explored male cichlids trying to attract a mate in Lake Malawi in Africa and found that the regulation of specific genes and associated repetitive behavior occurred nearly hand-in-glove, a novel discovery.\nThey published their results\nin the journal\nProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences . The research was funded by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, the National Institute on Aging, and the National Institute of General Medicine, all part of the National Institutes of Health.\nDig my castle\nLet\u2019s start with the behavior then go to the matching gene regulation:\nBoy cichlids knock themselves out building stuff out of sand to\u00a0impress girl fish ready to mate. Most of the cichlid species\u2019 guys build a pit, or crater, and other species build a castle.\nBoth pits and castles are known as \u201cbowers\u201d and require the male fish to swim in the same circular way, scooping up sand in one place and spitting it out somewhere else.\nThe difference is that the pit builders scoop up the sand from inside their swimming pattern and deposit it outside, leaving a hole in the middle of the bower with a raised rim surrounding it that makes the bower resemble a crater. Castle builders scoop the sand from outside the circle and deposit it inside. That\u00a0creates a raised structure in the middle of the bower, making it resemble\u00a0a volcano.\nTurning him on\n\u201cA switch goes on once the females become reproductively active. Suddenly, the males begin scooping and spitting thousands of times to build their structure,\u201d said\u00a0 Zachary Johnson, a postdoctoral researcher in Streelman\u2019s Lab . Johnson was a co-author on the new study and Streelman a co-principal investigator.\nScooping and spitting are so incessant that two-inch fish shovel up two-foot-wide structures: pit bowers for some species, castle bowers for others. The difference serves in attracting the right mate.\n\u201cVarious species make their pits and castles in a common area, and structures have to be very specific, so the right female species can see, \u2018This is the guy that I want\u2019 compared to the other guys from other species that build the other thing. And she then has to pick the specific guy she wants from her own species,\u201d said\u00a0 Chinar Patil, a co-first author of the study \u00a0and a graduate research assistant in Streelman\u2019s lab.\nCross-breeding cichlids\nNow for the gene regulation part:\nTo observe the genes connected to either of these building behaviors, researchers have cross-mated pit-building species with castle-building species to make hybrid cichlids that have both sets of genes. These hybrids have delivered a lucky surprise.\nThe hybrid fish performed both behaviors neatly in sequence: first the pit making, then the castle making, always in that order.\n\u201cThat\u2019s amazing,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cYou might expect hybrid behavior to be jumbled, or take on some intermediate form. Instead, they perform one species-specific behavior and then transition to performing the other species-specific behavior.\u201d\nBower genes power up\nThis is useful to research because the hybrids have one full copy of genes from the pit parent and one from the castle parent. The cleanly separated behaviors have allowed for matching each behavior with increased and decreased activation in either set of genes in the fish\u2019s brains.\nThe Georgia Tech and Stanford researchers were able to clearly match pit gene activation with pit behavioral mode as well as castle gene activation with castle behavioral mode.\n\u201cA lot of genes in the pit copy got up-regulated while the fish was in pit-making mode and the castle copy got up-regulated during castle-making mode,\u201d Patil said. The genes and the behavior got visibly \u201cturned on\u201d and \u201ctuned in\u201d in tandem.\nThe difference in expression of either pit vs. castle genes was less of an absolute click-clack-on-off switch and more like inching one set of levers down on an audio mixer while tuning up the other set to a dominant level.\nGene-behavior evolution\nThis was the study\u2019s big achievement, which almost sounds like genes directly creating behavior, but that\u2019s unconfirmed as of yet and could be the topic of future studies.\nThe study also brought new insights into genetic evolution in tandem with behavioral evolution, about which little is known.\u00a0The genetic component may center around gene regulation in response to what\u2019s going on in the animal\u2019s environment\u00a0in this case when females are ready to mate.\nPit making appears to be the evolutionarily older and better-established bower building behavior, and castle making is widely accepted as being the newer evolutionary development. But pit and castle species have very similar genomes, so where\u2019s the evolutionary change?\nWhen the team sequenced the DNA of pit and castle species, it was differences in regulatory genes that stuck out, and many up-regulated specific other genes connected to the respective bower building behaviors when mating time hit. It appeared the evolution of the regulatory genes was linked to the evolution of the behavior.\nLike this article?\u00a0 Subscribe to our email newsletter\nRead MORE:\nOn genetics of neuroscience and behavior\nThe following researchers also co-authored this study: Ryan York, Hunter Fraser and Russel Fernald of Stanford University; Kawther Abdilleh and Patrick McGrath of Georgia Tech; Mathew Conte of the University of Maryland; and Martin Genner of the University of Bristol.
