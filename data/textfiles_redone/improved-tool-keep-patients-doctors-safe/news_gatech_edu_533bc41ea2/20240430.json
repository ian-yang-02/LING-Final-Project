The CauteryGaurd automatically retracts when not in use, and the inventors said this removes any chance of accidental injury caused by the device during procedures.\nThe team won the 2017 Georgia Tech InVenture Prize.\nThe inventors are four biomedical engineering majors \u2013 Jack Corelli from Philadelphia; Hunter Hatcher from Marietta, Ga.;\nMar 13, 2017\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nA medical device used in more than 80 percent of all procedures is getting a much-needed make-over from four biomedical engineering majors.\nDoctors, veterinarians and other other medical personnel use electrocautery devices to remove unwanted tissue and to prevent or stop bleeding. The tool heats to 1200 degrees at the touch of a button and because it remains hot after use, the tip can accidently burn patients or the doctors, said Dev Mandavia, a student in Georgia Tech\u2019s Wallace H. Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering. \u00a0The current design also carries the risk of causing fires because the exposed tip can come into contact with flammable materials, he said.\nThe solution: a retractable tip.\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty simple. We designed the tip so it automatically retracts back when it\u2019s not in use and that eliminates the chance of any accidental injuries,\u201d said Mandavia, who is from Duluth, Ga. \u201cThe new design allows us to improve safety without compromising usability.\u201d\nThe change also earned the invention, CauteryGuard, a spot in the 2017 InVenture Prize finale.\nSix teams are competing in this year\u2019s annual competition, which encourages and supports students\u2019 interest in innovation and entrepreneurship. The winner will be announced Wednesday night.\nCauteryGuard is about the size and weight of a small flashlight. The pieces were 3D printed and it runs on two AA batteries, said Hunter Hatcher, a team member from Marietta, Ga. Hatcher was the lead designer and built much of the device in the BME Machine Shop. He also did some construction in the Invention Studio.\nThe team fine-tuned the CauteryGuard design through a class called Idea to Prototype, where students are assisted by faculty mentors and receive some seed money to build prototypes. The course is part of the CREATE-X umbrella, a Georgia Tech initiative to enhance and support entrepreneurship programs for undergraduate students.\nWhile designing the device, the team surveyed medical professionals. More than 80 percent of the clinicians interviewed had experienced some form of self-inflicted injury from an electrocautery device at least once in the past year, said Devin Li, who is from Corning, N.Y.\nThe team is working on more surveys and is talking with doctors at Grady Memorial Hospital and Emory University Hospital as well as some plastic surgeons in California to learn about what improvements they would like to see to electrocautery devices, said Jack Corelli, who is from Philadelphia, Pa.\nWin or lose the InVenture Prize, the team will continue working on CauteryGuard this summer through the CREATE-X Startup Launch program.\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nGeorgia Tech's InVenture Prize\nContact\nLaura Diamond\nMedia Relations\n404-894-6016\n@LauraRDiamond\nEmail\nlaura.diamond@gatech.edu\nAdditional information\nThe winning InVenture Prize team will take home $20,000 and represent Georgia Tech in the annual ACC InVenture Prize, taking place on campus much March 31.\nThe second-place team earns $10,000.\nBoth first- and second-place finishers will receive free U.S. patent filings by Georgia Tech\u2019s Office of Technology.\nA $5,000 People\u2019s Choice Award will go to the fans\u2019 favorite invention.
