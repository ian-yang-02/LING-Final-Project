Just as too many cooks in a kitchen get in each other\u2019s way, having too many robots in tunnels creates clogs that can bring the work to a grinding halt.\nA study published August 17 in the journal\nScience\nshows that in fire ant colonies, a small number of workers does most of the digging, leaving the other ants to look somewhat less than industrious. For digging nest tunnels, this less busy approach gets the job done without ant traffic jams \u2013 ensuring smooth excavation flow. Researchers found that applying the ant optimization strategy to autonomous robots avoids mechanized clogs and gets the work done with the least amount of energy.\nOptimizing the activity of autonomous underground robots could be useful for tasks such as disaster recovery, mining or even digging underground shelters for future planetary explorers. The research was supported by the National Science Foundation\u2019s Physics of Living Systems program, the Army Research Office and the Dunn Family Professorship.\n\u201cWe noticed that if you have 150 ants in a container, only 10 or 15 of them will actually be digging in the tunnels at any given time,\u201d said\nDaniel Goldman , a professor in the\nSchool of Physics\nat the Georgia Institute of Technology. \u201cWe wanted to know why, and to understand how basic laws of physics might be at work. We found a functional, community benefit to this seeming inequality in the work environment. Without it, digging just doesn\u2019t get done.\u201d\nBy monitoring the activities of 30 ants that had been painted to identify each individual, Goldman and colleagues, including former postdoctoral fellow Daria Monaenkova and Ph.D. student Bahnisikha Dutta, discovered that just 30 percent of the ants were doing 70 percent of the work \u2013 an inequality that seems to keep the work humming right along. However, that is apparently not because the busiest ants are the most qualified. When the researchers removed the five hardest working ants from the nest container, they saw no productivity decline as the remaining 25 continued to dig.\nHaving a nest is essential to fire ants, and if a colony is displaced \u2013 by a flood, for instance \u2013 the first thing the ants will do upon reaching dry land is start digging. Their tunnels are narrow, barely wide enough for two ants to pass, a design feature hypothesized to give locomotion advantages in the developing vertical tunnels. Still, the ants know how to avoid creating clogs by retreating from tunnels already occupied by other workers \u2013 and sometimes by not doing anything much at all.\nTo avoid clogs and maximize digging in the absence of a leader, robots built by Goldman\u2019s master\u2019s degree student Vadim Linevich were programmed to capture aspects of the dawdling and retreating ants. The researchers found that as many as three robots could work effectively in a narrow horizontal tunnel digging 3D printed magnetic plastic balls that simulated sticky soil. If a fourth robot entered the tunnel, however, that produced a clog that stopped the work entirely.\n\u201cWhen we put four robots into a confined environment and tried to get them to dig, they immediately jammed up,\u201d said Goldman, who is the Dunn Family Professor in the School of Physics. \u201cWhile observing the ants, we were surprised to see that individuals would sometimes go to the tunnel and if they encountered even a small amount of clog, they\u2019d just turn around and retreat. When we put those rules into combinations with the robots, that created a good strategy for digging rapidly with low amounts of energy use per robot.\u201d\nExperimentally, the research team tested three potential behaviors for the robots, which they termed \u201ceager,\u201d \u201creversal\u201d or \u201clazy.\u201d Using the eager strategy, all four robots plunged into the work \u2013 and quickly jammed up. In the reversal behavior, robots gave up and turned around when they encountered delays reaching the work site. In the lazy strategy, dawdling was encouraged.\n\u201cEager is the best strategy if you only have three robots, but if you add a fourth, that behavior tanks because they get in each other\u2019s way,\u201d said Goldman. \u201cReversal produces relatively sane and sensible digging. It is not the fastest strategy, but there are no jams. If you look at energy consumed, lazy is the best course.\u201d Analysis techniques based on glassy and supercooled fluids, led by former Ph.D. student Jeffrey Aguilar, gave insight into how the different strategies mitigated and prevented clog-forming clusters.\nTo understand what was going on and experiment with the parameters, Goldman and colleagues \u2013 including Will Savoie, a Georgia Tech Ph.D. student, Research Assistant Hui-Shun Kuan and Professor Meredith Betterton from the Department of Physics at the University of Colorado Boulder \u2013 used computer modeling known as cellular automata that has similarities to the way in which traffic engineers model the movement of cars and trucks on a highway.\n\u201cOn highways, too few cars don\u2019t provide much flow, while too many cars create a jam,\u201d Goldman said. \u201cThere is an intermediate level where things are best, and that is called the fundamental diagram. From our modeling, we learned that the ants are working right at the peak of the diagram. The right mix of unequal work distributions and reversal behaviors has the benefit of keeping them moving at maximum efficiency without jamming.\u201d\nThe ability to avoid clumping seems to meet a need that many systems have, Betterton noted. \u201cThe ants work in a sweet spot where they can dig quickly without too many clogs. We see the same physics in ant digging, simulation models, and digging by robots, which suggests that for groups of animals that need to excavate, avoiding clogs is crucial.\u201d\nThe researchers used robots designed and built for the research, but they were no match for the capabilities of the ants. The ants are flexible and robust, able to squeeze past each other in confines that would cause the inflexible robots to jam. In some cases, the robots in Goldman\u2019s lab even damaged each other while jostling into position for digging.\nThe research findings could be useful for space exploration where tunnels might be needed to quickly shield humans from approaching dust storms or other threats. \u201cIf you were a robot swarm on Mars and needed to dig deeply in a hurry to get away from dust storms, this strategy might help provide shelter without having perfect information about what everybody was doing,\u201d Goldman explained.\nBeyond the potential robotics applications, the work provides insights into the complex social skills of ants and adds to the understanding of active matter.\n\u201cAnts that live in complex subterranean environments have to develop sophisticated social rules to avoid the bad things that can happen when you have a lot of individuals in a crowded environment,\u201d Goldman said. \u201cWe are also contributing to understanding the physics of task-oriented active matter, putting more experimental knowledge into phenomenon such as swarms.\u201d\nIn addition to those already mentioned, the research included Michael Goodisman, associate professor in Georgia Tech\u2019s School of Biological Sciences.\nThis research was supported by the National Science Foundation through grant numbers PoLS-0957659, PHY-1205878 and DMR-1551095 as well as a grant W911NF-13-1-0347 from the Army Research Office, and the National Academies Keck Futures Initiative.
