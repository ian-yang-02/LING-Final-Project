Current Editor-in-Chief, Clinton Smith has sought out a new crop of undergraduate and graduate students, along with faculty members, to review submissions and refresh the journal\u2019s look.\nThe Tower\naims to continue highlighting students\u2019 research efforts for years to come.\nHere is a breakdown of the submission process and what we can expect from\nThe Tower\nin the future:\nSubmissions are reviewed on a rolling basis with one deadline per semester. The current deadline for the Spring 2021 semester is April 19. There are two submission categories, which include Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program (UROP) summaries and a research report. The UROP summaries are 300-600-word summaries of research, including preliminary results. The research report submission should follow the same guidelines as published articles in scientific journals: Abstract, Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion, References, and Figures. In the submission\npage , students are instructed to submit an abstract, research paper, and the name of the faculty advisor overseeing the project among other submission criteria.\nAfter they receive a submission, the submissions and review team seeks out undergraduate students, grad students, and faculty involved in the same or intersecting area of research. There are currently two students in the submissions and review team, and with their efforts, each entry has an average of at least six reviewers. The team sends a rubric to each reviewer and, after careful consideration, will notify the applicant of their submission status. This holistic process takes a couple of months for each submission.\nThe upcoming issue will include news, interviews, abstracts, and articles among other sections yet to be announced. The staff is also in the process of pitching ideas for interviews, spotlights, and features to be added to the journal. Smith is aiming to have a diverse pool of submissions from different majors to reflect the research community on campus. In previous years, the journal has received submissions from biomedical engineering, mechanical engineering, computer science, and economics, but are hoping to attract students from all majors.\nThe journal will be published on an annual basis with its comeback issue planned for Spring 2022. Print and online versions of the next issue will be distributed on campus.\nTo read more about\nThe Tower\nsubmission guidelines, visit\nhsoc.gatech.edu/news/item/639622/submit-tower-undergraduate-research-journal\nTo submit your research, visit\ndocs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfDdWjeH0SEkuHbTcdivacoKnzKjA2Qv3wTousuHWbSnKk72Q/viewform\nAdditional Images\nContact\nVanesa Vargas\nInstitute Communications\nEmail\nstucomm@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
