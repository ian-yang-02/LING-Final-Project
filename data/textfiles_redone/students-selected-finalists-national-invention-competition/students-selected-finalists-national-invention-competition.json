It\u00a0is a mixed-reality application used with a headset that combines barcode scanning for immediate inventory control with navigation that projects the optimal path through the\u00a0warehouse to each item.\nAn earlier iteration, called PickAR, was a\nfinalist\nfor the 2017\nInVenture Prize , Georgia Tech\u2019s annual invention competition.\nThe application recently\nfinished second in the Imagine Cup , a worldwide innovation competition sponsored by Microsoft.\nTwo other computer science majors, Cheng Hann and\nWenqi Xian, were part of the team during InVenture and assisted with the Microsoft contest.\n\u201cWe have never forgotten how helpful our mentors and peers at Georgia Tech and the\nCREATE-X\nprogram have been,\u201d Srinivas said. \u201cWe have made a lot of great progress on our product and have migrated to a new development environment based on Android.\u201d\nAs part of the\nCollegiate Inventors Competition , teams will travel to Washington, D.C., for the event, which will take place from Nov. 1-3. The judges include National Inventors Hall of Fame inductees and leaders from the United States Patent and Trademark Office. Student winners and their advisors will be awarded cash and prizes ranging from $2,500 to $10,000.\nThe competition, which started in 1990, is considered one of the nation\u2019s foremost competitions encouraging innovation, entrepreneurship, and creativity by recognizing and rewarding college students working on cutting-edge inventions.\nOculogyx also recently won the\nAtlanta Startup Battle , which awarded the company $100,000.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nLaura Diamond\nMedia Relations\n404-894-6016\n@LauraRDiamond\nEmail\nlaura.diamond@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
