Since the founding of that UK program in 2017, representation of reviewers of color has more than doubled in two years. The alumni went on to place their work in such publications as\u00a0the\nTimes Literary Supplement, The Guardian, The Telegraph,\nand\nThe New Statesman.\n\"But improving the\u00a0numbers\u00a0is\u00a0only part of the program's aim to generate a critical culture that is not only\u00a0inclusive but also\u00a0knowledgeable\u00a0and representative of the diversity of poetry being written today,\" said Parmar, who, along with Howe, will serve as faculty at the workshop.\nProgram Aligns with Ivan Allen College Mission to Promote Social Good\nIn addition to Parmar and Howe, the faculty will include the\u00a0 New York Times \u00a0book critic\u00a0Parul Sehgal,\u00a0 Poetry\nEditor Don Share,\u00a0 The Georgia Review \u00a0Associate Editor Soham Patel, Tupelo Press Editor Jeffrey Levine; and Vidyan Ravinthiran, a\u00a0poet and critic who teaches American Literature at Harvard University.\nOther sponsors and collaborators include Harvard University, the University of Liverpool's Centre for New and\u00a0International\u00a0Writing, Letras Latinas at the University of Notre Dame\u2019s Institute for Latino Studies, UCLA English Department, King\u2019s College, London and the Georgia Tech Library.\nIt makes sense for such an effort to be taken on in the Ivan Allan College of Liberal Arts, where the mission statement calls for \u201csocially and ethically conscious strategies for positive action,\u201d Denton said.\n\u201cThis program seeks to raise up traditionally underserved groups in our community, local and nationally, and provide them with the tools to be positive change makers in our world,\u201d Denton said.\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nGeorgia Tech Poet Ilya Kaminsky Named Finalist for National Book Award\nGeorgia Tech Poet Ilya Kaminsky Awarded Prestigious Academy of American Poets F\u2026\nThe Poetry of Waffles\nContact\nMichael Pearson\nmichael.pearson@iac.gatech.edu\n404.894.2290\nEmail\nmichael.pearson@iac.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
