That\u2019s due in large part to the increase of carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere, caused by human activity. This has led oceans to warm, ice sheets to melt, and sea levels to rise\u00a0faster \u2014 and it has accelerated the frequency of extreme weather events, such as hurricanes.\nWhen it comes to facing these challenges, \u201cIt\u2019s all hands \u2014 and all solutions \u2014 on deck,\u201d says Susan Lozier, dean and Betsy Middleton and John Clark Sutherland Chair in the College of Sciences at Georgia Tech and president of the American Geophysical Union (AGU). \"While we as scientists continue to embrace discovery science, we need to more fully embrace solution space.\"\nGeorgia Tech faculty across a number of disciplines are working on projects in ocean science and engineering aimed at identifying, projecting, mitigating, and even reversing the effects of climate change. Many of these researchers are doing so in conjunction with Georgia Tech\u2019s Ocean Science and Engineering (OSE) program and its founding director, Emanuele \u201cManu\u201d Di Lorenzo, professor of ocean and climate dynamics.\nThough the OSE program is relatively new \u2014 accepting its first students in 2017 \u2014 it has attracted attention for its ability to coordinate and integrate the ocean systems work being done at Georgia Tech and beyond to solve significant problems. \u201cThere is a new cohort of people who are needed \u2014 problem-solvers of Earth climate, and this involves the ocean,\u201d Di Lorenzo says. \u201cOur hope is that through the OSE program, we will provide students with the tools and the knowledge and resources to be active players as new ocean leaders. This goes beyond them being researchers.\u201d\nRead more about the Georgia Tech scientists, engineers, and researchers who are working to reverse the effects of climate change and harness the power of the world\u2019s oceans.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nBlair Meeks\nInstitute Communications wmeeks@gatech.edu\nJess Hunt Ralston\nCollege of Sciences jess.hunt@cos.gatech.edu\nEmail\nwmeeks7@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
