Submitted photo.&nbsp;\nAug 30, 2023\nAs the Georgia Tech women's basketball team recently completed its\nforeign tour to Croatia and Spain , another Yellow Jacket is preparing to represent the Institute abroad. Colin Wegner, a third-year chemical engineering student, will compete in the 2023 Ironman World Championship in Nice, France, on Sept. 10.\nWegner is a fourth-generation Georgia Tech student, following in his family's footsteps to attend his dream school, just as he followed in his father's footsteps as a child when the two would run together. At the age of 12, Colin and his dad, Torsten Wegner, signed up for a sprint triathlon. They haven\u2019t slowed down since, although Colin does believe he's caught up to his dad.\n\"He's a good cyclist,\u201d Colin said. \u201cI'm definitely stronger than he is now \u2013 finally, after a long, long time.\u201d When asked if Torsten would agree, Colin replied, \"Grudgingly, yes.\"\nAfter honing his skills over the years, Wegner decided in early 2022 to cross an item off his bucket list by competing in a full 140.6-mile Ironman Triathlon \u2013 a 2.4-mile swim, a 112-mile bicycle race, and a 26.22-mile run. On a November day in Panama City Beach, Florida, Wegner crossed the finish line with a time of 12:02:10, qualifying him to compete in the upcoming world championship in the 18 \u2013 24 age group.\n\"It always seemed like such a lofty goal,\u201d he said. \u201cBut here I am, a normal college kid getting ready to compete on such a grand stage.\"\nDealing with the already busy schedule of a Tech student, Wegner has learned how to balance the addition of his rigorous training schedule, which includes early morning trips to the North Georgia mountains as he prepares for the hilly terrain he'll face in September, both on foot and on the bike. The training can be just as mentally taxing as it is physically, but with one competition under his belt, Wegner understands that there are no shortcuts on the road to France.\nFor his first Ironman, he says, \u201cI would take days off here and there and sometimes cut my runs short because I was hurting or tired. But, after feeling unprepared for the run during the race, I realized how important it is to train to run through that same pain on race day. I feel much more prepared this time by just being far more consistent and pushing through soreness and really leaning into the 'hurt locker,' as it's called.\"\nApplying the same competitive drive to the classroom, Wegner has maintained a 4.0 GPA through his first two years at Tech. He credits the supportive nature of the Institute for allowing him to pursue his dreams of competing at a high level.\nWegner is still deciding what path he'll take after completing his degree, and while he doesn't foresee competition becoming his day job, he's eager to see where his dream takes him.\n\"It's very mentally and physically grueling, but I love the competition and even enjoy the training. It's something I\u2019ll carry on throughout my whole life. Whether I end up doing really well, we'll find out, but making a career out of it is not the plan right now,\" Wegner said.\nWhen the starting gun is fired in early September, Wegner will be proudly donning a Georgia Tech tri suit while his family \u00ad\u00ad\u2013 and the entire Tech community \u2013 cheers him on.\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nGeorgia Tech Triathlon Club\nContact\nSteven Gagliano\n- Communications Officer\nInstitute Communications\nEmail\nsteven.gagliano@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
