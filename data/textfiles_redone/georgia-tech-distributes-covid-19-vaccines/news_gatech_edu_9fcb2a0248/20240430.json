The rollout plan for the campus community consists of consecutive phases with corresponding groups.\nIn its initial allocation, Georgia Tech received both the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine and the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine.\nThe first phase of distribution, called Phase 1A+, includes Stamps Health Services staff; CARE staff and Counseling Center staff; Health Initiatives victim advocates and nutritionists; Georgia Tech Police Department (GTPD) staff; Covid-19 surveillance testing personnel; Athletic Association medical staff and trainers; and Georgia Tech employees ages 65 and older.\nCaptain Marcus Walton with GTPD was among the first to get vaccinated.\n\u201cI was excited because to me it is the sense of knowing that we are one more step closer to getting back to some type of normalcy in the world,\u201d he said.\n\u201cPersonally, I have family members that I have not visited since the pandemic started, and I would love to go visit and hug them,\u201d Walton said. \u201cProfessionally, I am what you call a critical or essential employee, and when I took this job 16 years ago I took an oath that I would do this job to the best of my ability. Taking the vaccine, along with practicing other safety measures, allows me to continue to go out and do my job daily knowing that I am helping and not hurting. I want to be a part of the solution, not the problem.\u201d\nJanet Foley, a pharmacist with Stamps Health Services, is working at the vaccine distribution clinic in the Exhibition Hall. As a healthcare worker, she was glad to get it.\n\u201cI believe in vaccination, and I believe in the benefit vaccines give to building herd immunity. So I think it\u2019s important for everybody to get vaccinated,\u201d Foley said. \u201cI have trust in the system that the vaccine is safe, so I wanted to get it right away to show my family, neighbors, and everybody that it\u2019s good to get this vaccination.\u201d\nFoley, who has been in her job for seven years, said she likes the large turnout for vaccines.\n\u201cDemand seems to be pretty high on campus, and that\u2019s encouraging,\u201d she said. \u201cI hope the students come out and get vaccinated when it\u2019s open to them.\u201d\nThe next phase, Phase 1B, is expected to be open to all faculty and\nstaff, including affiliate, auxiliary, and foundation employees. Phase 1C is expected to include people ages 16 to 64 with medical conditions that increase the risk for severe illness with\u00a0Covid-19. This includes Georgia Tech students. Phase 2 is expected to include all Georgia Tech students. The DPH is responsible for setting all phases of the vaccine rollout, including the timing.\n\u201cWe\u2019re ironing out the process to make it faster to get people in and out,\u201d Foley said. \u201cThe more of these clinics we do, the faster the process is going to get.\u201d\nNOTE: As a reminder, community members in the initial phase of the vaccine distribution \u00ad\u2014 Phase 1A+ \u2014 are eligible to schedule an appointment to receive their vaccine.\nFor more information on the Covid-19 vaccine, including the rollout plan for the Georgia Tech community, visit\nhealth.gatech.edu/coronavirus/vaccine/\nAdditional Images\nContact\nVictor Rogers\nInstitute Communications\nEmail\nvictor.rogers@comm.gatech.edu\nAdditional information\nGeorgia Tech has begun to administer vaccine to groups in phase 1A+ as determined by the Georgia Department of Public Health.
