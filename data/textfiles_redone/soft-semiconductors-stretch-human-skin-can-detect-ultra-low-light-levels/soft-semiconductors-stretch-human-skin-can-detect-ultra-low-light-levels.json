The trend toward more flexible substrates has led to fabrication of numerous devices, from light-emitting diodes to solar cells and transistors.\nGeorgia Tech researchers have created a material that acts like a second skin layer and is up to 200% more stretchable than its original dimension without significantly losing its electric current. The researchers say the soft flexible photodetectors could enhance the utility of medical wearable sensors and implantable devices, among other applications. The research will be published on Dec. 15 in the journal\nScience Advances .\nGeorgia Tech researchers from both mechanical and computing engineering labs collaborated over three years to demonstrate a new level of stretchability for a photodetector, a device made from a synthetic polymer and an elastomer that absorbs light to produce an electrical current.\nPhotodetectors today are used as wearables for health monitoring, such as rigid fingertip pulse oximeter reading devices. They convert light signals into electrical ones and are commonly used on wearable electronics.\nStretchable like a Rubber Band\nGiven that conventional flexible semiconductors break under a few percentages of strain, the Georgia Tech findings are \u201can order-of-magnitude improvement,\u201d said Olivier Pierron, professor in the\nGeorge W. Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering , whose lab measures the mechanical properties and reliability of flexible electronics under extreme conditions.\n\u201cThink of a rubber band or something that's soft and stretchable like human skin yet has similar electrical semiconducting properties of solid or rigid semiconductors,\u201d said Canek Fuentes-Hernandez, a co-PI formerly in the\nSchool of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE)\nand now an associate professor in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Northeastern University in Boston. \u201cWe\u2019ve shown that you can build stretchability into semiconductors that retains the electrical performance needed to detect light levels that are around hundred million times fainter than produced by a light bulb used for indoor illumination,\u201d he said.\nExtraordinary Tenacity and Teamwork\nBernard Kippelen, vice provost for International Initiatives and an ECE professor, oversaw the work of Youngrak Park, the study\u2019s first author and a Ph.D. candidate in ECE. \u00a0Following two-and-a-half years of research, Park uncovered the right combination of chemical compounds that produced a super-soft material with the ability to generate and conduct electricity when exposed to light.\nPark found the perfect ratio for all parts of the semiconductor layer to maintain high performance in the photodetector. But it was painstaking work to prove the materials\u2019 stretchability, especially given that a single layer was 1,000 times thinner than a human hair.\nPark relied on Kyungjin Kim, then a Georgia Tech Ph.D. mechanical engineering student, to test the material\u2019s reliability. He continued to provide Kim with larger, thicker samples until one with a thickness of 500 nanometers worked.\n\u201cIt was still super thin. Under dry conditions, it would just crumble. We had to use a water reservoir to keep its shape,\u201d recalled Kim, now an assistant professor in the University of Connecticut\u2019s Department of Mechanical Engineering.\nElaborating on how difficult it was to measure pure mechanical properties of a photoactive layer, Pierron noted, \u201cElectronic devices are very brittle typically, which is okay with conventional devices fabricated on rigid substrates. But as soon as you use soft substrates that becomes an issue.\u201d\nThe water acted like plastic wrap keeping the thin films in place without crumbling or losing shape, enabling the researchers to stretch the material and measure its mechanical properties.\nTo test for electrical signals coming out of the device under illumination, electronic terminals had to be embedded on it. Yet, those terminals had to be deformable, too, or the entire device would become rigid.\n\u201cFabricating stretchable electronic terminals was a major challenge in and of itself,\u201d said ECE PhD graduate Felipe Andres Larrain, who worked closely with Park and focused on the embedded components. \u00a0He is now an assistant professor at Adolfo Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez University in Chile.\nWhile this breakthrough material has been initially integrated into a photodetector and tested for electrical functionality, more testing and optimization is needed to show the materials\u2019 stretchability\u00a0 under multimodal loads and its shelf stability.\n\u201cWhat's exciting is what these materials and the devices will enable us to develop\u2015namely, the concept of intelligence systems. You have functional surfaces that combine sensors that monitor all kinds of physical properties,\u201d said Graham, former chair of the Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering and now Dean of Engineering at the University of Maryland.\n\u201cThis is a very good example of interdisciplinary research \u2014 none of this work would have been possible without the collaboration between electrical and mechanical engineers,\u201d Kippelen said. \u201cIn the lab we didn\u2019t have any prior experience with stretchable materials. Figuring out how to measure this took a lot of perseverance, creativity and hard work.\u201d\nNew Smart Applications Possible\nThe researchers are most excited about the potential of the material to enhance medical wearables. Typically, wristwatches that use rigid biosensors have limitations since flexing the wrist can completely change the sensor\u2019s measurements. They are subject to \u201cmotion artifact,\u201d or degraded image quality, caused when a person moves.\n\u201cMoving around can drastically affect the usability of collected data but being able to reposition devices on the body to minimize or eliminate motion artifact is a big deal,\u201d noted Gabriel Cahn, a project manager for Huxley Medical, a biosensor startup in Atlanta, who recently graduated from Georgia Tech with a doctorate in flexible electronics.\u00a0 \u201cHaving electronics that can flex, twist, bend and conform to non-flat surfaces and move with your body will allow you to place these sensors in more advantageous places to collect biometric data. It will be infinitely more useful in helping diagnose or monitor existing medical illnesses.\u201d\nThe research team foresees rich applications for the soft and stretchable polymer blend beyond wearables for health monitoring. \u201cThe soft device also could be attractive for implantable electronics for bio-electronic applications since the interfaces comply with the dynamic motion of the soft biological tissues, reducing the foreign body reaction,\u201d said Kim.\n\u201cThe potential is fantastic,\u201d added Larrain. \u201cIn the long-term, you could develop sensors that could enhance or even replace the human eye or be applied to robotic eyes.\u201d\nFuentes sees the material working in smart agriculture applications, where farmers could attach light sensors into fruits or other produce to monitor growth, disease and to better time harvesting.\nKippelen believes the rubber-like photodiodes that detect ultralow light levels could find applications in detecting, identifying, and characterizing ionizing radiation for nuclear fuel cycle monitoring.\nCITATION:\nY.
