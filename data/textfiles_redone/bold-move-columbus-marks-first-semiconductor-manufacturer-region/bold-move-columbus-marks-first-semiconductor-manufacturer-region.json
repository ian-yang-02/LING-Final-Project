It also signifies a collaborative effort to harness the cutting-edge innovations in semiconductor packaging available at\u00a0 Tech\u2019s\u00a0 Institute for Electronics and Nanotechnology .\n\"Our decision to locate in Columbus was driven by several crucial factors, and\u00a0we are thrilled about the opportunities that this vibrant city presents for our growth and development,\u201d said Prashant Patil, Micromize founder and CEO. \u201cThe work of CHIPS4CHIPS in supporting the semiconductor industry is commendable, and we are excited to be part of this innovative ecosystem.\u201d\nThis exciting development was announced Tuesday, Jan. 23, at the Marcus Nanotechnology Center on Georgia Tech\u2019s campus to a large group of state legislators and other state officials, a delegation of business and civic leaders from Columbus, and leadership from Georgia Tech and ATDC. The announcement is a true look at how statewide partnerships can lead to success for the Columbus region.\nMicromize, a spinoff of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, selected Georgia as its new home, in part, to take advantage of the semiconductor packaging expertise at Georgia Tech. The company plans to establish its\u00a0headquarters and manufacturing facility in Columbus, further solidifying its presence in the state\u2019s vibrant technology\necosystem. Additionally, Micromize will center its cutting-edge research and development on Georgia Tech's campus.\n\"The collaboration with Micromize is a significant milestone for CHIPS4CHIPS and the entire region,\u201d said Ben Moser, president and CEO of United Way of the Chattahoochee Valley and chair of CHIPS4CHIPS. \u201c This announcement marks the first of what we believe will be many to come, and we are thankful that Micromize recognizes the potential of our region for this industry. Columbus is poised for remarkable development, and we look forward to the positive impact that Micromize will bring to our community.\u201d\nThe strategic relocation is expected to create significant economic opportunities in the region. Micromize will bring 20-25 jobs to Columbus through its headquarters and manufacturing facility, contributing to the local workforce, and fostering growth.\nMicromize will center its Research & Development Lab at Georgia Tech\u2019s\n3D Systems Packaging Research Center , which is regarded as the world\u2019s best for semiconductor packaging research. This partnership represents a synergistic collaboration of industry leaders, research institutions, and the entrepreneurial ecosystem. Micromize's move to Columbus not only underscores the city's growing prominence as a technology hub, but also highlights the collaborative efforts driving innovation and economic development in the state of Georgia.\nIn addition to C4C\u2019s nationally recognized workforce development efforts, the Fort Moore Army base, and its skilled workforce, the region\u2019s proximity to a port and airport will facilitate efficient shipping, and\u00a0Columbus played a pivotal role in supporting the company by providing essential infrastructure, he said.\n\u201cOur collaboration with Georgia Tech enriches our talent pool, adds exponentially to our research and development capabilities, and access to mentorship at ATDC enhances our commercialization potential,\u201d Patil said. \u201cWe are also proud to be part of the effort to revitalize semiconductor manufacturing in the United States, with Columbus serving as our starting point as we embark on this exciting journey of growth and innovation.\u201d\nGeorgia Tech, a leader in microchips and nanotechnology research, innovation, and fabrication, provides fertile ground for Micromize's relocation. The Institute\u2019s commitment to advancing semiconductor technology aligns with the national push at the federal level (via the CHIPS and Science Act) to bring more semiconductor production to the U.S., making it more competitive in research, development, and manufacturing.\n\u201cAs the state\u2019s technology startup incubator, we\u2019re excited to welcome Micromize into our portfolio and to support them into the next phase of growth and expansion,\u201d said ATDC Director John Avery.\n\u201cMicrochips, semiconductor packaging, and microelectronics are critical to our national economy and national security. Micromize\u2019s choosing Georgia as its home to grow reflects what is proving to be a successful model when business, government, and research institutions such as Georgia Tech collaborate.\u201d\nAdditional Media\nContact\nP\u00e9ralte C.
