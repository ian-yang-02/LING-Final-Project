Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering and the School of Materials Science and Engineering.\n\u201cBut we\u2019ve found that\u2019s not always the case,\u201d he added.\nFor the study, which was published June 19 in the journal\nJoule\nand was sponsored by the National Science Foundation and the U.S. Department of Energy, the research team looked at how three different ions \u2013 lithium, sodium, and potassium \u2013 reacted with particles of iron sulfide, also called pyrite and fool\u2019s gold.\nAs batteries charge and discharge, ions are constantly reacting with and penetrating the particles that make up the battery electrode. This reaction process causes large volume changes in the electrode\u2019s particles, often breaking them up into small pieces. Because sodium and potassium ions are larger than lithium, it\u2019s traditionally been thought that they cause more significant degradation when reacting with particles.\nIn their experiments, the reactions that occur inside a battery were directly observed inside an electron microscope, with the iron sulfide particles playing the role of a battery electrode. The researchers found that iron sulfide was more stable during reaction with sodium and potassium than with lithium, indicating that such a battery based on sodium or potassium could have a much longer life than expected.\nThe difference between how the different ions reacted was stark visually. When exposed to lithium, iron sulfide particles appeared to almost explode under the electron microscope. On the contrary, the iron sulfide expanded like a balloon when exposed to the sodium and potassium.\n\u201cWe saw a very robust reaction with no fracture \u2013 something that suggests that this material and other materials like it could be used in these novel batteries with greater stability over time,\u201d said Matthew Boebinger, a graduate student at Georgia Tech.\nThe study also casts doubt on the notion that large volume changes that occur during the electrochemical reaction are always a precursor to particle fracture, which causes electrode failure leading to battery degradation.\nThe researchers suggested that one possible reason for the difference in how the different ions reacted with the iron sulfide is that the lithium was more likely to concentrate its reaction along the particle\u2019s sharp cube-like edges, whereas the reaction with sodium and potassium was more diffuse along all of the surface of the iron sulfide particle. As a result, the iron sulfide particle when reacting with sodium and potassium developed a more oval shape with rounded edges.\nWhile there\u2019s still more work to be done, the new research findings could help scientists design battery systems that use these types of novel materials.\n\u201cLithium batteries are still the most attractive right now because they have the most energy density \u2013 you can pack a lot of energy in that space,\u201d McDowell said. \u201cSodium and potassium batteries at this point don\u2019t have more density, but they are based on elements a thousand times more abundant in the earth\u2019s crust than lithium. So they could be much cheaper in the future, which is important for large scale energy storage \u2013 backup power for homes or the energy grid of the future.\u201d\nThis material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant Nos.
