With many students missing out on events last year, this year\u2019s highly anticipated festivities will include particular attention to safety protocols, including masks and hand sanitizer being offered at indoor events.\nEvents are scheduled all week long, starting with the Homecoming concert on Wednesday, Oct. 20, and students are encouraged to test frequently as they participate in more social activities.\nThat testing can start now. Students who test today, Oct. 13, can pick up a free t-shirt at the Community Market. Get your test, grab a sticker, and bring it to the Jackets Moving Forward table on the Instructional Center Lawn from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. Buzz will be there to welcome you, too.\nPlan to test again at the end of this week, and early next week before the Homecoming festivities begin.\nCovid-19 campus testing continues to be fast and free. The saliva-based test takes about two minutes and all sites are open regular hours this week. And, of course, cookies and other treats await you at test sites.\nView site locations and hours , and start your next test at\nmytest.gatech.edu .\nThe best ways to prevent Covid-19 are still through vaccination and wearing face coverings when indoors.
