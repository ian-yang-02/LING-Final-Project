With rapidly growing classes and labs, he\u2019s looking at how technology, training can complement hands-on anatomy.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nEmail\nGeorgia Tech's Neuroscience Club in Adam Decker's anatomy class.

Decker knew that many of his pre-health students would soon be on their way to medical schools elsewhere \u2014 and he worried that these undergrad classes would pale in comparison to what they\u2019d later encounter as graduate students with more hands-on experiences.\n\u201cIt just didn\u2019t get the punch across like I wanted \u2014 for having the students know what a heart feels like in their hands, what a lung feels like,\u201d says Decker, a senior academic professional in Biological Sciences at Tech. \u201cPieces of plastic are fine, and they serve a purpose \u2014 but it\u2019s not the real deal like they would see in grad school.\u201d\nStudent evaluations of his course would occasionally echo those same sentiments. Why couldn\u2019t neuroscience students study an actual human brain to better understand how it works?\nThose evaluations led Decker to explore how he could bring human cadaveric specimens and organs to Georgia Tech\u2019s Atlanta campus for his students to study. The feedback from students now learning anatomy from those specimens is clear \u2014 Decker\u2019s lab and course are among some of the fastest growing classes in the School, with students from a variety of disciplines showing interest \u2014 such as a biomedical engineering major who wants to design heart valves and is looking for hands-on experience, and\u00a0 an aspiring physician-astronaut \u00a0\u201ccarving my own path to advance the intersections between medicine, engineering, and space exploration\u201d as a dual major in biology and industrial engineering, with dual minors in social justice and physiology.\nA related special topics\u00a0course in pathology started by Decker could soon be a permanent\u00a0addition to the School of Biological Sciences curriculum, with a growing base of young alumni who share that they\u2019re now deciding on specialties in medical school based on their experiences in his classes.\n\u201cWe are so lucky to have Adam as an instructor at Georgia Tech,\u201d says Michael (Mike) Goodisman, an associate professor in the School of Biological Sciences. \u201cAdam has great reviews from the students in his classes.\u00a0They can see how passionate he is about understanding human form and function.\u00a0These are very difficult classes \u2014 but the students love them.\u00a0And Adam is always trying to provide the most contemporary and exciting class experience possible.\u201d\n\u201cThis was the first time these specimens have been brought to campus,\u201d Decker says. \u201cThe human side of our biology curriculum is really growing here. I\u2019m just grateful to have had a part in that, developing courses and helping satisfy that need. It\u2019s an exciting time to be in pre-health here.\u201d\nAdopting a new approach to anatomy\nCreating these immersive courses took time, Decker says. His path to bringing cadaveric specimens to Georgia Tech involved two years of advocacy\u2014 phone calls, meetings, and negotiations with groups split across Georgia Tech and\u00a0 Emory University School of Medicine , along with teaming up with fellow School of Biological Sciences professors who supported the collaborative effort for campus.\nBack in 2018, Decker signed up to teach with Georgia Tech\u2019s\u00a0 Pacific Study Abroad Program , through which students travel to New Zealand and Australia for courses and cultural experiences. Decker was leading the Scientific Foundations of Health (APPH/BIOL1040)\u00a0class there, and says the trip helped him decide to look at adding cadaver classes and labs to curriculum offerings back at Tech\u2019s Atlanta campus.\nOn the south island of New Zealand, he explains, the University of Otago in Dunedin has a medical school with a popular\u00a0 Anatomy Museum , \u201cwhere you could go in and they have all the prosections (specimens that demonstrate anatomic structure for students), all the cadaver organs, sections of tissues and bones, and anything you could think of related to the human body,\u201d he says, \u201cand it was open to the public.\u201d\nAfter peppering the curator with questions about the process of obtaining and hosting specimens, \u201cI started thinking that there\u2019s no reason we can\u2019t do this back home. We don\u2019t have a medical school \u2014 but Emory is right down the road.\u201d\nWhen he returned to Atlanta, Decker connected with colleagues at Emory University to see how cadaveric-based curricula might be made available at Georgia Tech, launching a multi-year effort with detailed requirements, and logistics \u2014 and a unique philanthropic program.\nA team from Emory inspected the anatomy lab space on Tech\u2019s campus, in a recently renovated building where courses and labs were planned. The group inquired about security arrangements, and laid down detailed rules and logistics for things like storage temperature, transportation, and appropriate humidity levels for specimens.\nRegarding that last stipulation: Decker also happens to be a licensed embalmer in the state of Georgia. \u201cI\u2019m the guy who can keep the specimens preserved, and where they need to be, as far as preservation goes, and not pose a public health risk to the community. Emory liked that.\u201d\nThe university also offered to help through a very unique philanthropic initiative \u2014 the\u00a0 Emory Body Donation Program . Decker explains that some of the cadaveric specimens that Emory and Tech\u2019s future doctors, nurses, researchers, and founders study are thanks to generous individuals \u2014 often alumni \u2014 who, as the program notes, \u201cwish to be useful to the living after death. We all cannot endow a hospital or establish a clinic, but each of us has the opportunity to make one valuable gift to medical science - the gift of his or her body after death.\u201d\n\u201cThis was something new for the school, I know,\u201d Decker shares. \u201cBut the semesters were rolling by and students were missing the opportunity \u2014 because we were hung up\u201d with finalizing paperwork and agreements across Emory and Tech.\nSo Decker reached out to his colleague Mike Goodisman, who made some calls and arranged a phone conference with both universities. The remaining questions and legal considerations were soon resolved, and Decker was invited to Emory to conduct dissections for the cadavers and specimens he would bring back to Georgia Tech.\n\u201cThey left me with twenty cadavers. I was able to get multiple hearts and lungs, entire gastrointestinal tracts, brains, and a spinal cord,\u201d he explains. \u201cIt took me seven hours to get the brain and spinal cord in one section \u2014 that specimen has proven valuable to the neuroscience majors. They want to see everything in one piece. These are really unique things that get the students excited.\u201d\nStudent reaction, and respect for the specimens\nStudying human hearts allows students to trace blood flow, something they could begin to learn from plastic models, but \u201cit\u2019s nothing like holding the real thing, and being able to trace the actual blood flow. It\u2019s an amazing experience they get to have with this.\u201d\nThat experience has prompted some graduates of Decker\u2019s classes to even change their medical school plans. \u201cNow they\u2019re telling me they want to go into cardiology. They\u2019re choosing a specialty because of this \u2014 and that\u2019s the best experience, when you get them excited about something and they want to devote themselves to it.\u201d\nThat energy is reflected in class attendance. The first human anatomy class Decker taught in 2014 had 66 students. In fall 2020, even with Covid-19, he had close to 295 students. \u201cThis is an upper elective 3000-level course. It\u2019s almost unheard of to have almost 300 students.\u201d\nHis senior-level human pathology course kicked off in 2019 as a\nspecial topic elective \u00a0with 33 students. Decker is now running it for the second time, and has enrolled nearly 100 students.\n\u201cDr. Decker has really done a great service to the students of Georgia Tech in bringing this course to life, so to speak,\u201d says\u00a0 Young-Hui Chang , professor and associate chair for Faculty Development in the School of Biological Sciences. \u201cHe has worked incredibly hard to get us to the point where we can offer a unique cadaver-based human anatomy course to our undergraduate students. In particular, the students who have ambitions for a variety of health-related careers really benefit from this unique experience of learning from real human anatomy \u2014 and to learn it under the guidance of a truly gifted anatomist and teacher in Adam Decker.\u201d\nAs to how students react to seeing specimens for the first time? \u201cThey\u2019re usually very silent. Everybody is sitting down, nobody was talking. There\u2019s almost a reverence you feel \u2014 as there should be. I tell them that this person loved somebody, lost somebody, went to school. You need to hold these specimens and have that reverence for them. These were people, and they\u2019ve given the gift of themselves to help you learn.\u201d\nNew technology applied to an ancient practice\nDecker adds that anatomy is \u201cpretty old school,\u201d pointing out that dissections and naming of the body\u2019s structures occurred in the 1500s. \u201cAnatomy is a very old science, but it\u2019s actually the basis of all health care. It\u2019s the first course medical students take before they become doctors or nurses. You have to know what\u2019s normal anatomy before you know what\u2019s abnormal.\u201d\nDecker also wants to complement his anatomy and pathology courses by adding some new technology to traditional offerings. For instance, a California-based company,\u00a0 Anatomage , makes what it calls a virtual dissection table \u2014 essentially a typical human cadaver in digital form. A seven-foot-long \u201coperating table\u201d is basically a large flat screen with an image of a cadaver. By touching the screen, students can \u201ccut away\u201d tissue. Body parts are annotated, \u201cso everything is labeled. It\u2019s amazing. That\u2019s where a lot of this is headed.\u201d\nDecker says Stanford University School of Medicine is now using the tables, and he\u2019s put in a budget request in hopes of adding two of these tables to Tech\u2019s campus.\nIn the meantime, he hopes to optimize storage and specifications so that students can work more directly with the specimens. Decker knows that his students would be ready to take on the challenge. \u201cMy anatomy class is not a typical undergrad course. It\u2019s more of \u2018one foot in medical school content, one foot in undergrad.\u2019 It\u2019s pretty intense, but I feel confident they will do well \u2014 and they always do.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nWhy Biology at GT?\nPre-Health Advising\nCelebrating #GT21 Graduate Stories: Yassin Watson\nElizabeth \u201cLizzie\u201d Stubbs: B.S. in Psychology, Minor in Biology\nFour College of Sciences Instructors Receive Class of 1934 Teaching Achievement\u2026\nContact\nRenay San Miguel\nCommunications Officer II/Science Writer\nCollege of Sciences\n404-894-5209\nEmail\nrenay.san@cos.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
