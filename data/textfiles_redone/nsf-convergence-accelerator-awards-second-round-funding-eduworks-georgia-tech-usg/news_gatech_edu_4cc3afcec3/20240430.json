Over two years, Competency Catalyst will receive $5 million in funding from the NSF Convergence Accelerator.\nThe Phase I Convergence Accelerator cohort was announced in 2019 and included the Competency Catalyst team as one of 43 projects to receive Phase I funding. The Phase II cohort includes just nine teams of the original 43 and will provide Competency Catalyst with up to $5 million in funding for prototype development and pilot projects. During the two years of Phase II funding, the Competency Catalyst team, which includes Eduworks, Georgia Tech\u2019s Center for 21st Century Universities (C21U), USG, and the Credential Engine, will develop prototypes of digital tools to support critical workforce reskilling in the United States.\n\u201cThe unpredictability of the job market over the past year has prompted many people to consider their current career trajectory and skills,\u201d said\nAshok Goel , co-PI and chief scientist for C21U. \u201cIt is critical that we leverage technology to develop better tools to sync up employers and educators so that job seekers have clear paths to reskilling. This type of tool is exactly what we hope to develop through the Competency Catalyst project.\u201d\nOver the next two years, Competency Catalyst will create two digital resources to support reskilling \u2013 a Skillsync application and a C2 platform. The Skillsync application enables companies to succinctly express reskilling needs for their workforce. This information is then distilled to colleges and universities so that they can design accelerated educational programs with the needed skills as specific learning outcomes. The Skillsync application is built on the C2 platform, which is designed to better describe and align job requirements and opportunities for reskilling in specific knowledge, skill, and ability (KSA) terminology. Georgia Tech\u2019s Jill Watson AI-based educational assistant, the Credential Engine\u2019s open data infrastructure, and Eduworks\u2019 digital competency extraction tools and open-source Competency and Skills System (CaSS) will provide the framework for these two innovative new tools.\n\u201cThe pairing of C2 and Skillsync will empower direct, real-time communication between companies and education providers through an AI-powered digital tool,\u201d said\nMatt Lisle , director of digital learning technologies for C21U and member of the Competency Catalyst development team. \u201cWe believe that this will have an immediate and positive impact on the efficiency and effectiveness of reskilling America\u2019s workforce.\u201d\nThis Convergence Accelerator Phase II Grant is overseen by the National Science Foundation\u2019s Convergence Accelerator Program in the Office of Integrative Activities and is associated with the Convergence Accelerator topic area of AI and Future Jobs, and National Talent Ecosystem.\nYou can read more about the National Science Foundation\u2019s Convergence Accelerator Grant program and find the list of grant recipients in their September 2020 announcement, \u201c Accelerating research to impact society at scale \u201d.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nBrittany Aiello\nCommunications Program Manager, C21U\nbrittany@c21u.gatech.edu\nEmail\nbrittany@c21u.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
