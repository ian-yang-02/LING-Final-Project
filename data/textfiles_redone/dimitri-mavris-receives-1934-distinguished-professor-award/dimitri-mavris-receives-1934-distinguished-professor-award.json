He did not realize it at the time, but his first day of class at Georgia Tech would mark the beginning of a career that would span 44 years as a Yellow Jacket.\nWhat Dimitri did know was that he wanted to follow in his family\u2019s footsteps.\n\u201cThere was no aerospace program in Greece when I graduated high school, so my grandfather encouraged me to leave home,\u201d said Mavris. \u201cHe was one of the original classes of Greek army aviators, and he financed my studies in aerospace engineering. I wanted to follow in my sister and brother-in-law's footsteps and attend Georgia Tech.\u201d\nOver time, plans to earn his bachelor\u2019s degree and return to Greece turned into pursuit of a master\u2019s degree, then a Ph.D., followed by a career as an engineering professor \u2014 all at Georgia Tech.\nHis experience as a student arriving in the U.S. from another country influences the way Mavris thinks of his current students, particularly those also from another country or the first of their family to attend college.\n\u201cThese days, I do a lot of student interviews for our programs, and it really strikes me how many applicants are of the first generation to go to college or the first to go to grad school. And they are hoping to find someone who can provide advice and guidance,\u201d said Mavris. \u201cI have always felt that the best you can give someone in that situation is your time, attention, and care.\u201d\nThe Georgia Tech lab currently run by Mavris, the\nAerospace Systems Design Laboratory\n(ASDL), was the brainchild of Professor Emeritus Daniel Schrage. Just as Mavris has become a mentor to so many, Schrage was a mentor to Mavris and introduced him to systems thinking, design, and engineering. In 1996, Mavris became the ASDL lab director and, under Schrage\u2019s tutelage, sought to build something impactful that also maintained an environment that felt like family. ASDL began with just five students, several of whom are still with the lab as research faculty. Mavris sees this as a testament to the lab\u2019s supportive environment.\nASDL maintains a \u201cfamily atmosphere\u201d even having grown today to a robust team of 50 full-time researchers and 300 graduate students. It has conferred degrees to almost 1,300 graduate students: 287 Ph.D.s and 1,009 master\u2019s degrees. Yet, no matter how large and successful his lab is, Mavris\u2019 concerns are always with his students.\nASDL community of faculty, staff, and students.\nOver the years, he has championed growth and changes (both curricular and institutional) to push the College of Engineering and the School of Aerospace Engineering in ways that would produce and support some of the top minds entering the engineering workforce.\n\u201cI think the School of Aerospace Engineering is very different today than it was back when I first came [to Georgia Tech]. We have always prided ourselves on producing the best engineers. I took that to heart and wanted to understand what that really looks like in industry,\u201d said Mavris. \u201cSo, I was fortunate to be selected by Boeing to pilot their Welliver Faculty Fellowship Program. It became very apparent to me that a lot of the subjects we were teaching in universities at the time were viewed by industry as fundamental knowledge, but they were seeking new skills to keep them ahead of the competition. Research fields such as systems architecture and systems engineering, multidisciplinary design optimization, integrated production and process development, and robust design (to name a few) were not present [in higher education] at the time.\u201d\nThese were all fields that had to be developed and, throughout the three decades that followed, Mavris set out to do so. With encouragement and support from colleagues and mentors like Professors Robert Loewy and Vigor Yang, Mavris was able to develop an impactful program in which the aerospace industry saw value. Under his leadership, ASDL developed into the largest lab of its kind and established a global reputation for excellence in both its rigorous educational program and substantial research.\nOver time, ASDL became the go-to lab for U.S. government-contracted technology assessments and is now seen as a global leader in systems design, architecting, and optimization. ASDL receives more than $20 million annually in research funding from both the government and American and European industry. Since its launch, the lab has brought in $325 million in research funding.\n\u201cASDL\u2019s success would not be possible without the support and leadership of J.L. Chameau, Steve McLaughlin, Gary May, Raheem Beyah, Chaouki Abdallah, Steve Cross, Larry Jacobs, and the leadership of the School of Aerospace Engineering \u2014 past chairs Robert Loewy and Vigor Yang, as well as current chair Mitchell Walker,\u201d acknowledges Mavris. \u201cIn addition, our excellent research team and students have helped the lab grow and evolve over time.\u201d\nAs the aerospace industry has become increasingly competitive \u2014 with advanced degrees often a requirement \u2014 Mavris has worked to secure funding to support master\u2019s and Ph.D. students to ensure that cost is not a barrier for them to start their careers.\nMavris is flanked at the December 2023 ASDL Graduate Recognition Ceremony by the eight students who completed their Ph.D.s and Buzz.\n\"My philosophy when I started, and this is with most young people, is that you're thinking about your own career, technology advancements, or the next contract, but as time progresses, you realize that there will always be another project,\u201d he said. \u201cThere will always be another hill to climb. But really, the only thing that matters in the end is the journey and the people you met and helped along the way.\u201d\nFrom conducting hundreds of student interviews every year, to advising and mentoring, to hooding Ph.D. graduates during Commencement, Mavris is proud to serve as a support for his students, sharing lessons learned across his four decades at Georgia Tech.\n\"My career has been a journey of self-discovery, always looking for ways to become a more effective researcher and educator,\u201d says Mavris. \u201cGeorgia Tech's model of service teaches us to be unselfish in our time and share with students \u2014 not to see people and other entities as competitors. It is gratifying to me that many of the students I have taught become professors and help carry on the ASDL legacy.\"\nQuotes From Colleagues\n\u201cDr. Mavris and I have worked together for the past 32 years, and he is one of the most knowledgeable professors in the areas of systems engineering, multidisciplinary design and optimization, aircraft design, and more. Dr. Mavris is amazingly dedicated to the Aerospace Systems Design Laboratory, especially to its research faculty and students. The success of ASDL is largely due to his ability to understand our customers\u2019 needs and his ability to motivate the people who work for him. He is also one of the most compassionate professors I have ever met, and he directs ASDL as if it is part of his family. I am very fortunate to be part of his ASDL team/family!\u201d - Jimmy Tai, ASDL Associate Director, Aerospace Systems Design Laboratory Advanced Configurations Division Chief, School of Aerospace Engineering\n\u201cDimitri Mavris always puts students first. He is not just an advisor, he is a mentor, and his research family now extends far and wide. His vision for a lab that could prepare students to be the industry leaders of tomorrow is here today! On a more personal note, he has been a mentor and friend since I came to Georgia Tech and a great role model in servant leadership. This award is well deserved!\" - Elena Garcia, Senior Research Engineer, Advanced Methods Division Chief, Export Control Coordinator, Aerospace Systems Design Laboratory, School of Aerospace Engineering\n\u201cProfessor Dimitri Mavris has been a cornerstone of the School of Aerospace Engineering, fostering exceptional partnerships with leading industry and government sponsors. His leadership and vision have been pivotal in preparing hundreds of students for successful careers in the aerospace sector, significantly influencing the trajectory of the U.S. aerospace industry.
