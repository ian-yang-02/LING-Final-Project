We Need to Scrub Carbon Directly from the Air\nNew Direct Air Capture Center will leverage Georgia Tech\u2019s leadership in a burgeoning field.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nEmail\nPostdoctoral fellow Poorandokht Kashkouli, seated, discusses test data from their direct air capture rig with Ryan Lively, left, and Chris Jones.

But it\u2019s become increasingly clear to climate scientists and policymakers that just reducing emissions is not enough.\n\u201cWe now know that we probably should have stopped putting massive amounts of CO 2\nin the air 10, 20, 30 years ago to prevent the climate from getting above 2 degrees C,\u201d said\nChris Jones , a chemical engineer at Georgia Tech. \u201cNow we've waited so long to reduce our emissions that we need to develop technologies that are referred to as negative emissions technologies that remove CO 2\nfrom the atmosphere.\u201d\nJones was one of a handful of scientists who co-authored a\nlandmark National Academies report in 2018 that outlined a variety of approaches to negative emissions.\nAgricultural practices and forest management are options \u2014 essentially using nature\u2019s ability to grab carbon dioxide out of the air and lock it away in plants and soil. But Jones said we\u2019ll need quicker and more direct approaches.\n\u201cWe could plant billions of trees to do this, but there's not enough available land. And the trees don't grow fast enough for us to do this quickly enough to slow global warming at the rate required,\u201d said Jones, John F. Brock III School Chair in the\nSchool of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering (ChBE) . \u201cThat's where direct air capture comes in: It's a chemical engineering way of designing a process that takes CO 2\nout of the air.\u201d\nRead the full story on the College of Engineering website.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nJoshua Stewart\nCollege of Engineering\nEmail\njstewart@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
