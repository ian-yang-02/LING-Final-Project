That was the question posed by\nNeil deGrasse Tyson\nto a panel of leading experts, including Georgia Tech\u2019s\nJohn Wise , at the 25 th\nannual Isaac Asimov Memorial Debate.\nThe live event was held on March 19 at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City, and while the 800 available tickets sold out within 20 minutes, the discussion is now publicly available\non YouTube .\nTyson is the the Frederick P. Rose Director of the Hayden Planetarium. He personally invited Wise, a professor in the\nSchool of Physics\nand director of the\nCenter for Relativistic Astrophysics , who traveled to New York for the event alongside his wife,\nEmily Alicea-Mu\u00f1oz , a fellow physicist and academic professional in the School of Physics.\nThe discussion centered on how the James Webb Space Telescope has indeed changed astrophysics, especially in relation to understanding the first billion years after the Big Bang when galaxies and black holes were rapidly forming \u2014 an area where Wise has significant expertise.\nJourney to the stars\n\u201cMy research group and I have been focusing on this topic for several years, so I was ecstatic to participate in the panel,\u201d Wise says. The event was also an opportunity for the astrophysicist to reconnect with fellow experts \u2014\u00a0the panel also included\nMike Boylan-Kolchin\nof University of Texas at Austin,\nWendy Freedman\nof the University of Chicago,\nPriya Natarajan\nof Yale University, and\nRachel Somerville\nof the Flatiron Institute. Wise had previously collaborated on research with several of the panelists, and Tyson is no stranger to Georgia Tech.\n\u201cJust after I received my Ph.D., my collaborators and I worked with the Hayden Planetarium at the American National History Museum to produce a planetarium show segment from my simulations of the first stars,\u201d Wise recalls. The show segment,\nJourney to the Stars , premiered in 2009 and was narrated by Whoopie Goldberg. Georgia Tech also hosted Tyson in 2014 at the Ferst Center, where many members of the\nCenter for Relativistic Astrophysics\nmet with him.\nIn the spirit of Isaac Asimov\u2019s legacy of science-oriented storytelling, this year\u2019s debate also provided an opportunity for audience members to \u201ceavesdrop\u201d on robust scientific discussion \u2013 with Tyson acting as an interpreter and storyteller, explaining the technical language and helping panelists explain advanced topics.\n\u201cThe conversation was fantastic,\u201d says Wise. \u201cNeil really brought out the best in us and our scientific endeavors in uncovering the mysteries of the early universe with the James Webb Space Telescope.\u201d\nAbout the Isaac Asimov Memorial Debate\nThe Hayden Planetarium notes that \u201cthe late Dr. Isaac Asimov, one of the most prolific and influential authors of our time, was a dear friend and supporter of the American Museum of Natural History. In his memory, the Hayden Planetarium is honored to host the annual Isaac Asimov Memorial Debate \u2014 generously endowed by relatives, friends, and admirers of Isaac Asimov and his work \u2014 bringing the finest minds in the world to the Museum each year to debate pressing questions on the frontier of scientific discovery. Proceeds from ticket sales of the Isaac Asimov Memorial Debates benefit the scientific and educational programs of the Hayden Planetarium.\u201d\nLearn more and watch past debates\nhere .\nAdditional Media\nContact\nWritten by Selena Langner\nContact:\nJess Hunt-Ralston\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
