The McKnight Award will allow the researchers to scale up to a device with more than 1,000 electrodes that can record from 10 or more muscles.\nAug 07, 2018\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nScientists have made remarkable advances into recording the electrical activity that the nervous system uses to control complex skills, leading to insights into how the nervous system directs an animal\u2019s behavior.\n\u201cWe can record the electrical activity of a single neuron, and large groups of neurons, as animals learn and perform skilled behaviors,\u201d says\u00a0 Samuel Sober , an associate professor of biology at Emory University who studies the brain and nervous system. \u201cWhat\u2019s missing,\u201d he adds, \u201cis the technology to precisely record the electrical signals of the muscles that ultimately control that movement.\u201d\nThe Sober lab is now developing that technology through a collaboration with the lab of\u00a0 Muhannad Bakir , a professor in Georgia Tech\u2019s School of Electrical and Computer Engineering. The researchers recently received a $200,000 Technological Innovations in Neuroscience Award from the McKnight Foundation to create a device that can record electrical action potentials, or \u201cspikes\u201d within muscles of songbirds and rodents. The technology will be used to help understand the neural control of many different skilled behaviors to potentially gain insights into neurological disorders that affect motor control.\n\u201cOur device will be the first that lets you record populations of spikes from all of the muscles involved in controlling a complex behavior,\u201d Sober says. \u201cThis technique will offer unprecedented access to the neural signals that control muscles, allowing previously impossible investigations into how the brain controls the body.\u201d\n\u201cBy combining expertise in the life sciences at Emory with the engineering expertise of Georgia Tech, we are able to enter new scientific territory,\u201d Bakir says. \u201cThe ultimate goal is to make discoveries that improve the quality of life of people.\u201d\nThe Sober lab previously developed a prototype device \u2014 electrodes attached to flexible wires \u2014 to measure electrical activity in a breathing muscle used by Bengalese finches to sing. The way birds control their song has a lot in common with human speech, both in how it is learned early in life and how it is produced in adulthood. The neural pathways for birdsong are also well known, and restricted to that one activity, making birds a good model system for studying nervous system function.\n\u201cIn experiments using our prototype, we discovered that, just like in brain cells, precise spike timing patterns in muscle cells are critical for controlling behavior \u2014 in this case breathing,\u201d Sober says.\nThe prototype device, however, is basic. Its 16 electrodes can only record activity from a single muscle \u2014 not the entire ensemble of muscles involved in birdsong. In order to gain a fuller picture of how neural signals control movement, neuroscientists need a much more sophisticated device.\nThe McKnight funding allowed Sober to team up with Bakir. Their goal is to create a micro-scale electromyography (EMG) sensor array, containing more than 1,000 electrodes, to record single-cellular data across many muscles.\nThe engineering challenges are formidable. The arrays need to be flexible enough to fit the shape of small muscles used in fine motor skills, and to change shape as the muscles contract. The entire device must also be tiny enough not to impede the movement of a small animal.\n\u201cOur first step is to build a flexible substrate on the micro-scale that can support high-density electrodes,\u201d Bakir says. \u201cAnd we will need to use microchips that work in parallel with 1,000 electrodes, and then attach them to that substrate.\u201d\nTo meet that challenge, the Bakir lab will create a 3D integrated circuit. \u201cEssentially, it\u2019s building a miniature skyscraper of electrical circuits stacked vertically atop one another,\u201d Bakir says. This vertical design will allow the researchers to minimize the size of the flexible substrate.\n\u201cTo our knowledge, no one has done what we are trying to do in this project,\u201d Bakir says. \u201cThat makes it more difficult, but also exciting because we are entering new space.\u201d\nThe Sober lab will use the new device to expand its songbird vocalization studies. And it will explore how the nervous system controls the muscles involved when a mouse performs skilled movements with its forelimbs.\nAn early version of the technology will also be shared with collaborators of the Sober lab at three different universities. These collaborators will further test the arrays, while also gathering data across more species.\n\u201cWe know so little about how the brain organizes skilled behaviors,\u201d Sober says. \u201cOnce we perfect this technology, we will make it available to researchers in this field around the world, to advance knowledge as rapidly as possible.\u201d\nThe mission of the McKnight Foundation\u2019s Technological Innovations in Neuroscience Award, as described on its website, is \u201cto bring science closer to the day when diseases of the brain and behavior can be accurately diagnosed, prevented and treated.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nContact\nWriter and media contact: Carol Clark\ncarol.clark@emory.edu\nSenior Science Communicator\nEmory University\nEditor, eScienceCommons\nEmail\ncarol.clark@emory.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
