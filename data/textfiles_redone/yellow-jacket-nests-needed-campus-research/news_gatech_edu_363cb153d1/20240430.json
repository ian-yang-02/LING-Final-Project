Not football or basketball, but the time of year when colonies of yellow jackets \u2014 the insects \u2014 reach their maximum size. It\u2019s also when Professor Michael Goodisman and the Goodisman Research Group collect their nests.\n\u201cWe typically collect nests for a month or so beginning in late October, which is prime time for collecting. The colonies usually die off around Thanksgiving, and are completely dead by Christmas \u2014 although climate change may be moving the dates,\u201d said\nGoodisman , professor in the\nSchool of Biological Sciences .\nGoodisman is asking those in the Tech community to\ncontact him\nif they have a yellow jacket nest in their area. He and his team will come out and collect the nest for their research. (Historically, his nests have primarily been collected from placing a classified ad in\nThe Whistle .)\nHumans usually cross paths with the yellow jackets\u2019 underground nests a couple of times a year. The first is between April and June, when people tend to mow their lawns frequently. The second is fall, when it\u2019s time to rake leaves.\n\u201cYellow jackets are particularly aggressive this time of year,\u201d said Goodisman, whose team collects the insects alive, albeit somewhat sedated. The underground nests typically have a single hole, about the size of a silver dollar, for entering and exiting.\n\u201cWe pour a little bit of anesthetic into the hole. It does the same thing to them that it does to us \u2014 it knocks them out,\u201d Goodisman said. \u201cThen we try to dig up the nest very quickly before they come to. We pull the nest out and bring it back to the lab.\u201d\nWhen collecting nests, Goodisman and the team wear beekeepers\u2019 uniforms with long pants underneath for additional protection. Yellow jackets are aggressive and will push their way through air holes in the pith helmets, so the researchers cover them with tape to keep the insects out.\n\u201cI have had that happen to me, and it\u2019s no fun at all,\u201d Goodisman said. \u201cIf there\u2019s an opening, they will find it and get in.\u201d\nStudying Yellow Jacket Behavior\nThe\nGoodisman Research Group\nis studying yellow jackets to learn about highly social behavior.\n\u201cYellow jackets are an example of some of the most extreme and impressive social behavior that you will see in any animal, even more so than in humans,\u201d Goodisman said. \u201cTheir social structure is similar to honeybees in that they typically have a single queen, though not always. She produces a bunch of selfless workers that work until the colony succeeds.\u201d\nThe researchers are also interested in studying multiyear super colonies. Nests usually last only one season, from May to December. But when temperatures are mild, a colony can survive the winter and become massive the next year. Goodisman\u2019s team recently partnered with a team at Auburn University to study super colonies collected in south Alabama.\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve found is that these colonies are headed by multiple queens, which is different from the annual colonies,\u201d he said. This leads to questions about differences in the genetics of yellow jackets in different types of colonies \u2014 questions for a future study. His team hopes to continue to study the formation of these colonies and whether they are increasing in frequency.\nGoodisman does not expect to find super colonies in the local area because of the climate, but will use nests collected locally for a project that is focused on genetic conflict in yellow jackets.\nGo (Yellow) Jackets!\nGoodisman\u2019s interest in insects began when he was a child in Syracuse, New York.\n\u201cThere are yellow jackets in Syracuse and all across North America, from Mexico to Alaska,\u201d he said \u2014 indeed, they can be found all across the northern hemisphere. They are one of the most common and successful social insects.\n\u201cThey\u2019re great fun, as you might imagine. They have a lot of personality,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s exhilarating when you\u2019re trying to pull them out of the ground or get them out of the house.\u201d\nHis undergraduate research at Cornell University included work with insects, and he did his doctoral thesis at the University of Georgia on fire ants.\nWhile at UGA he saw fire ants in a tray in the lab, and he thought it was \u201cso cool.\u201d But his work with yellow jackets didn\u2019t start until he did postdoctoral work in Australia.\n\u201cThere was some interesting research being done on invasive yellow jackets in Australia and New Zealand. I\u2019ve been working on yellow jackets well before I came to Georgia Tech.\u201d\nIt was purely coincidental that Goodisman became a professor at Georgia Tech, home of the Yellow Jackets. But it still causes the occasional raised eyebrow when he tells people about his research.\n\u201cPeople do a double take and ask if I\u2019m at Tech because of my yellow jacket research. They ask if I have a yellow jacket professorship, or if I\u2019m the \u2018Chair of Yellow Jacket Research.\u2019 It\u2019s always a fun conversation, especially with Georgia Tech alumni.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nContact\nKristen Bailey\nInstitute Communications\nAdditional information\nFree yellow jacket nest removal.
