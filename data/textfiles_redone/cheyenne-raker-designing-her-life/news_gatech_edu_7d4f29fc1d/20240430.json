Now she is graduating with a master\u2019s in industrial design from the College of Design. She also has a bachelor\u2019s degree in mechanical engineering from Ohio Northern University.\n\u201cGraduate school is hard, and imposter syndrome is real,\u201d Raker said. \u201cBut I always had to remind myself that I didn\u2019t get here by accident. It took just one person to see something in me that I didn\u2019t even see in myself, and here I am. I couldn\u2019t be prouder of my last three years here at Tech. I will forever be grateful for each of my professors, the faculty, and students who helped me along this journey.\u201d\nThat journey included a few hurdles. When she started the graduate program she expected the workload to be just a notch above the undergraduate level.\n\u201cI learned the hard way,\u201d she said. \u201cI took 19 credit hours my second semester, and I did not have a life. I don\u2019t know how I got through it. I think playing sports while growing up helped me with time management.\u201d\nRaker faced another hurdle when the pandemic hit. She was working on a project that required the use of 3D printers and the design studio when the campus switched to online learning in Spring 2020.\n\u201cI needed to finish all of my prints before I couldn\u2019t come to campus anymore,\u201d she said. \u201cI got everything printed, took all of my stuff home with me, and I was able to finish my project from home because I had everything I needed from the studio. But I\u2019ll tell you \u2014 trying to do industrial design from my computer is not the same.\u201d\nIn July, Raker will begin working as an industrial design engineer at Hubbell Lighting in Greenville, South Carolina. She interned with the company in the summer of 2019.\n\u201cI really enjoyed the type of work I did, and this position is a perfect fit that aligns both my undergraduate degree in mechanical engineering and graduate degree in industrial design. That was one of my biggest goals I wanted to achieve,\u201d she said.\nBefore beginning her job, Raker has a couple of adventures in the works.\n\u201cThe weekend after graduation, I am planning to go camping in the Great Smoky Mountains, filled with all adventurous things like zip lining, hiking, and ATV riding,\u201d she said. \u201cI love the outdoors, and this kind of escape will be a great way to relax, both mentally and physically, and doing things that bring me joy and peace.\u201d\nBeginning in June, Raker and her family are going on a cross-country road trip for several weeks, visiting national parks and other sites out West.\nTo celebrate Commencement, Raker\u2019s mom, dad, sister, and her sister\u2019s boyfriend will join her in Atlanta.\n\u201cAt Commencement, I am most looking forward to walking across that stage, crying a tear or two, and just realizing I accomplished one of the hardest things in my life,\u201d she said.\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nSchool of Industrial Design\nCollege of Design\nContact\nVictor Rogers\nInstitute Communications\nEmail\nvictor.rogers@comm.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
