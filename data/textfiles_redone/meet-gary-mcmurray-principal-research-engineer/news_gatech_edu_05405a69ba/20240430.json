Most were in the defense industry, and the job duties were very specific.\n\u201cI joke about one job that was to design fuel pumps for the aft section of cargo planes,\u201d McMurray recalled. \u201cI asked, \u2018Well, what if I want to design fuel pumps for the front section?\u2019 They said, \u2018No. That\u2019s a different skill set.\u2019\u201d\nThe job sounded too constraining and unappealing to McMurray, so he continued his job search, interviewing with the Georgia Tech Research Institute (GTRI) in 1989. He had been working in robotics, a relatively new field at the time.\n\u201cI was looking for something in robotics, and GTRI was trying to get into robotics,\u201d he said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t have anybody working in that field at all, so I was really the first person hired to work in that area. It gave me an opportunity to start from scratch and develop something unique and different. I really enjoyed that.\u201d\nThree decades later, McMurray still works at GTRI.\n\u201cI wear two hats in the organization,\u201d he said. He is the division chief for the Intelligent Sustainable Technologies Division, and an associate director for the Institute for Robotics and Intelligent Machines (IRIM), working with director Seth Hutchinson.\nThe Intelligent Sustainable Technologies Division conducts research to improve the human condition through transforming the agricultural and food systems, sustainable use and access to energy and water, and improving workplace safety and pandemic response. IRIM is an umbrella under which robotics researchers, educators, and students from across campus can come together to advance a wide variety of robotics activities at the Institute.\nThe Intelligent Sustainable Technologies Division has approximately 36 research faculty and 40 students. The unit hires about 10% of all the students at GTRI and maintains close ties with the academic side of campus.\n\u201cOne of the things I enjoy in my role as a division chief is the ability to set the vision and mission,\u201d McMurray said. \u201cWe\u2019re a little bit different from the rest of GTRI because we don\u2019t do the Department of Defense work. We work a lot with the campus, but we also work with other universities on sustainability projects regarding food or energy. The projects have the potential to make a big impact. I describe it as having one foot on the basic research side and one foot on the applied side. We have master\u2019s and Ph.D. students doing cutting-edge basic research, and we\u2019re also building systems and applying research and deploying things into the field.\u201d\nThe division\u2019s food processing research includes improving yield, food quality, and food safety while minimizing the environmental impact by applying image processing, robotics, biosensors, and environmental treatment technologies. The division also conducts air quality research, including monitoring and reducing the effects of vehicular emissions.\nSo, what\u2019s the connection between food processing and auto emissions?\n\u201cTo solve problems in both of those areas we employ general research technologies \u2014 robotics, chemical and biological sensing, data analytics, machine learning, systems engineering, and then energy and materials,\u201d McMurray said. \u201cApproaches that work in traditional manufacturing may not work in the food industry. There is no CAD drawing for a boneless chicken breast or a chicken leg. Each one is different. It\u2019s also wet, slippery, and could be spoiled.\u201d\nThat\u2019s where sensing and data analytics come into play. The same applies to analyzing vehicular emissions.\n\u201cWhen you look at food processing, our work really brings together all of these different skill sets. And then when you look at the data analytics side of air quality emissions, the team has the longest continuous set of data about air quality in the city. This has been the key database that the EPA uses for studying carbon emissions for automobiles,\u201d McMurray said.\nAfter more than 30 years at GTRI, McMurray still gets excited when a plan comes together.\n\u201cThe most rewarding part of the work is when you can bring together the basic research and the applied, build a system that does something new and novel, put it into the field and test it, and have somebody come back and say, \u2018That\u2019s really cool. That worked.\u2019\u201d\nAway From the Office\nMcMurray and his wife have two sons \u2014 a first-year student at Kennesaw State University and a high school senior. He recently started playing chess again, which was a passion of his in middle and high school.\n\u201cMy parents were always afraid I was going to quit school and go play chess professionally,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were quite worried about that.\u201d\nBut then he got into robotics and work, so chess took a back seat. As his children have grown older, he has gotten back into the game. \u201cEvery night I study and play online,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s always interesting.\u201d\nHe read\nThe Queen\u2019s Gambit,\na book about the game that was made into a Netflix series, and he said it was required reading for chess enthusiasts.\n\u201cChess players are not normal people,\u201d he said, laughing. \u201cThe game is very obsessive, and you just sit there at the board for hours. My longest game lasted six and a half hours.\u201d\nMcMurray used to play competitively all over the U.S. \u201cOne of my goals, maybe when I retire, is to try to reach the rank of international master.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nRead More Staff Stories\nContact\nVictor Rogers\nInstitute Communications\nEmail\nvictor.rogers@comm.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
