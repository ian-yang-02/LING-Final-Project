Today she is the managing director for Georgia Tech\u2019s Institute for Leadership and Social Impact (formerly the Institute for Leadership and Entrepreneurship).\n\u201cI have been in Atlanta 20 years, which is incredible,\u201d Pap said. \u201cI never thought I\u2019d stay this long, but it grew on me.\u201d\nPap (pronounced \u201cpop\u201d) was born in western Romania, in a region called Transylvania. She usually doesn\u2019t mention that because \u201cit stops the conversation\u201d and starts a new one about vampires or\nThe Rocky Horror Picture Show .\n\u201cI grew up during communism, so there were no outside pop culture references at all,\u201d she said, explaining how the American fascination with vampires and a particular film character were new to her when she arrived in the U.S.\nBack in Romania, Pap\u2019s love of athletics started early. Her father was a rally race car driver and a sports enthusiast. \u201cMy dad put me on skis at three years old,\u201d she said. She also participated in fencing, handball, and track. She was introduced to volleyball at age nine.\n\u201cI was walking down the street with my sister. A gentleman, who was a volleyball coach, came up to us and asked me, \u2018How tall are you?\u2019 Then he asked, \u2018How tall are your parents?\u2019 I answered him, and he said, \u2018Let\u2019s go talk to your parents.\u2019\u201d\nPap is 6 feet 2 inches tall and has been that height since she was 13. Three years later, she began playing professional volleyball, although it was not considered professional by U.S. standards. She moved to Bucharest and played there for a couple of years. Then she moved to Hungary and played for a few more years before being recruited to play at Georgia Tech in 2000.\nFrom Hungary to Midtown Atlanta\n\u201cCoach Shelton Collier recruited me,\u201d Pap said. \u201cHe was a great coach. I\u2019m grateful that he saw something in me that was worth the trip to Hungary and worth extending a full ride to Georgia Tech. He really changed my life and played a big role in where I am today.\n\u201cVolleyball was great. It was great to be in a beautiful gym and in nice, new outfits with girls who were excited about the same things that I was and spoke the same language,\u201d Pap said.\nAnd she made lifelong friendships with her fellow players. \u201cI probably value my friendships more than any of the outcomes of the games. After 16 or 17 years that is what matters,\u201d she said. \u201cBeing at Georgia Tech was always more than just being on the court and winning.\u201d\nPap earned a bachelor\u2019s degree and a master\u2019s degree in international affairs from the Sam Nunn School of International Affairs. She also earned an MBA. Now she is pursuing a doctorate in higher education administration at the University of Georgia.\nLife at Tech\nPap has been with the Institute for Leadership and Social Impact (formerly ILE) since 2006. She went to work with Terry Blum, former dean of the Scheller College of Business, until she figured out what she wanted to do with her life. That was 14 years ago.\n\u201cSo, I either haven\u2019t figured out what I want to do with my life yet, or this is what I want to do,\u201d she joked. \u201cIt has been a very rewarding experience. Terry is one of those outstanding mentors who knows when to push you and when to support you. I have been very lucky to grow under her mentorship.\u201d\nThe Institute for Leadership and Social Impact facilitates a study abroad program that takes undergraduates to Hungary, Austria, and the Czech Republic and exposes them to the nonprofit sector in that part of the world. The center also manages the Ideas to Serve competition for students who are passionate about social issues and want to create a better, more humane society. And the center presents the Impact Speaker Series, bringing in leaders and entrepreneurs.\nPap also teaches the Capstone Course for the leadership minor at Georgia Tech. \u201cI very much enjoy working with students,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s the hardest part of my job. It takes a lot of mental and emotional preparation to make sure that I\u2019m doing it well and to the best of my abilities.\u201d\nWith a full-time job, academic pursuits, and a family, Pap has a very busy life that no longer includes volleyball. Today she is into tennis and yoga. \u201cAs a former college athlete, struggling to touch your toes or balance on one leg keeps you humble,\u201d she said with a smile.\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nInstitute for Leadership and Social Impact\nContact\nVictor Rogers\nInstitute Communications\nEmail\nvictor.rogers@comm.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
