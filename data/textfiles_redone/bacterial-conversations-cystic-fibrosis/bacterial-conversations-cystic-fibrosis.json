The postdoctoral researcher works with School of Biological Sciences Professor\nMarvin Whiteley , studying the social lives of bacteria.\nDarch observes the conversations of bacteria, which take place via molecules they release into the environment and are sensed by other bacteria. In Darch\u2019s experiments, completed messages are marked by the red-to-green change in the color of the bacterium sensing the molecule.\nBy sending and receiving extracellular signals, bacteria sense their neighbors. When enough bacteria are in the conversation, things happen. Sometimes it leads to changes in virulence or ability to establish an infection. The phenomenon is called quorum sensing.\nYet little is known about how quorum sensing proceeds during infection \u201cMuch of what is known about quorum sensing,\u201d Darch says, \u201ccomes from studies of large populations of bacteria in an environment that does not compare with the natural infection site.\u201d In infections, for example, bacteria are often found in small, dense clusters, called aggregates. \u201cIt\u2019s really important for us as scientists to think about what bacterial growth looks like in an infection,\u201d Darch says.\nIn a paper in the\nProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA , Darch, Whiteley, and colleagues describe for the first time how close bacteria need to be to \u201ctalk\u201d with each other in an environment similar to an infection. Their findings could reveal new ways to disrupt bacterial signaling and provide other targets to treat infections.\nThe work was supported by the National Institutes of Health, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, Human Frontiers Science, and the Welch Foundation.\nCystic Fibrosis Model\nThe study uses an environment similar to the chronic infection of the cystic fibrosis (CF) lung.\nCF is a genetic disease that causes buildup of sticky mucus in the lung. The viscous setting CF creates makes the organ prime real estate for disease-causing bacteria. Among the most prevalent of these in the CF lung is\nPseudomonas aeruginosa.\nP. aeruginosa\ninfections pose a huge problem because they are resistant to many antibiotics and are difficult to treat. Often\nP. aeruginosa\ninfection is what causes death among patients with CF.\nThe team used a synthetic CF sputum media (SCFM2), based on the makeup of lung secretions from patients. In nutritional content and physical form, the medium is similar to sputum from the lung. Importantly,\nP. aeruginosa\nforms aggregates in SCFM2 that are similar in size to those observed in CF lung tissue.\n3-D Printed Bacteria\nTo begin to answer the question \u201cHow close do you have to be to talk to your neighbor?\u201d the team collaborated with\nJason Shear\nat the University of Texas, Austin. The\nShear Lab\nhad developed a micro-3D-printing platform that could be used to engineer the growth of bacteria to mimic infections.\nBacteria are not uniformly distributed in infections. \u201cInstead we see bacterial aggregates that vary in size and can be separated by large distances,\u201d Whiteley says. \u201cWe needed an experimental method to engineer these types of infection landscapes in the lab.\u201d\nUsing Shear\u2019s micro-3D-printing platform, the team printed bacterial aggregates of exact positions and sizes.\nA typical experiment starts by enclosing one producer cell in a picoliter-sized trap, using micro-3D-printing. After multiple cell divisions, the population fills the volume of the trap. Then SCFM2-containing aggregates of responder cells are overlaid the porous trap.\nThey observe the one-way flow of signals from aggregates in a trap (producers) to aggregates outside receiving signals (responders). They could see the response of completed conversations by responders changing color from red to green.\nImplications for Cystic Fibrosis\n\u201cWe found that bacterial aggregates slightly larger than those in CF lung \u2013 containing about 2,000 cells \u2013 were not large enough to signal to other aggregates,\u201d Darch says.\nPrior to this study, it was thought that bacterial signaling could occur over extended distances. However, in the CF lung, small populations of bacteria are scattered across a large volume and separated by large distances. Aggregates are unlikely to \u201ctalk\u201d to each other.\nIt took aggregates containing at least 5,000 cells to successfully send signals to neighbors as far away as 176 micrometers. \u201cThese aggregates are around five times the size of the average aggregate observed in CF lung tissue\u201d Darch says \u201cFrom these data, communication is likely confined within an individual aggregate rather than being a population-wide phenomenon\u201d.\nAmong CF patients who are at least 20 years old,\n80% are infected with P. aeruginosa . \u201cInfection with\nP. aeruginosa\nremains a significant clinical problem in immunocompromised patients, particularly those with CF,\u201d Darch says. \u201cUnderstanding better how bacteria communicate has the potential to find ways of disrupting the communication and potentially diminishing bacterial virulence.\u201d\n\u201cThe study provides benchmark data for how quorum sensing might proceed in an environment similar to the CF lung,\u201d says\nWhiteley, who is a member of the Parker H. Petit Institute for Bioengineering and Bioscience . \u201cIn different settings, where\nP. aeruginosa\nand other bacteria exist as aggregates of different sizes, communication may look different. Future studies will involve experimental and modeling work to further examine the spatial parameters of quorum sensing in CF and other infections, such as a chronic wound.\u201d\nFigure Caption\n(Left) Rendered confocal laser-scanning micrograph of a micro-3D-printed trap (red) \u00a0surrounded by\nP. aeruginosa\naggregates responding to quorum-sensing signals (green) in a synthetic CF sputum media (SCFM2).\n(Right) Rendered confocal laser-scanning micrograph of responding (green) and non-responding (red)\u00a0 P. aeruginosa\naggregates formed in a synthetic CF sputum media (SCFM2).\nAdditional Images\nContact\nA.
