The longer a shutdown lasts, the greater the likelihood that operational changes would be necessary.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nEmail\nSep 25, 2023\nThe United States government is rapidly approaching its Sept. 30 deadline to reach an agreement on federal spending for the next fiscal year, which begins October 1. If an agreement is not reached by the deadline, it will result in a government shutdown, which will affect many programs, including the federal contracting work performed by Georgia Tech.\n\u201cCurrently, Georgia Tech receives approximately $85 million per month of federal funding for research activities,\u201d said Jim Fortner, vice president for Finance and Planning and interim chief financial officer. \u201cIf there is a prolonged federal government shutdown, we would most likely need to slow down some research, reduce our subcontracting, and potentially delay some projects or activities.\u201d\nIn preparation for this possibility, Georgia Tech assembled a working group to assess the potential impact and develop mitigation strategies to help ensure business continuity in the event of a federal government shutdown. More information will be provided as it becomes available.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nRachael Pocklington\nInstitute Communications\nEmail\nrpocklington@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
