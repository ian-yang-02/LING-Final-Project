These include search and rescue of hostages, information gathering after terrorist attacks or natural disasters, and humanitarian missions.\nThe award is part of ARL\u2019s Distributed and Collaborative Intelligent Systems and Technology (DCIST) Collaborative Research Alliance. Penn Engineering will lead this alliance in collaboration with the Army Research Laboratory, Massachusetts Institute of Technology\u2019s Aeronautics and Astronautics Department, and the Georgia Institute of Technology. The consortium also includes faculty from University of California San Diego, University of California Berkeley and University of Southern California.\nDCIST involves imbuing teams of heterogeneous robots and sensors with the intelligence to learn and adapt to different settings and perform new tasks along with humans. Key to this vision is building resilience to disruption.\nTeams of robots and human first responders might eventually be used to survey a disaster site for victims, but unpredictable environments and ongoing hazards could damage or destroy some of the robots, or disrupt communications between them. If each robot were just preprogrammed and given specific instructions, that could lead to gaps in their search. But if the team were able to reconfigure itself in response to damage, the remaining robots could collaboratively decide how to reorganize and work with human partners to complete the mission.\n\u201cWe want to have teams of robots that know how to work together, but can figure out how to keep working even if some of their teammates crash or fail, if GPS signal is unavailable, or if cloud services are disrupted,\u201d said Vijay Kumar, Penn Engineering\u2019s Nemirovsky Family Dean and director for the DCIST program. \u201cThis means designing networks with loose, flexible connections that can change on the fly. That way, a single event can\u2019t bring down the entire network. More importantly, we want them to learn to perform tasks they may have never performed and work alongside humans that they may never have worked with.\u201d\nThe three important research focus areas are distributed intelligence and learning; creating a cohesive team of autonomous robots, sensors, computational resources and human experts; and building resiliency in group behaviors.\n\u201cThrough this exciting project, Georgia Tech will help develop novel tools and techniques that enable human operators to work effectively and safely in teams together with autonomous robots,\u201d said\nMagnus Egerstedt , executive director of Georgia Tech\u2019s\nInstitute for Robotics and Intelligent Machines\nand Julian T. Hightower Chair in Systems and Controls. \u201cThese types of questions connect well with our\u00a0expertise in the areas of human-robot interactions, distributed decision making and learning, and swarm robotics.\u201d\nBeyond Egerstedt, the Georgia Tech researchers affiliated with this multidisciplinary project are\nSonia Chernova , assistant professor in the School of Interactive Computing;\nPanagiotis Tsiotras , Dean\u2019s Professor in the School of Aerospace Engineering; and\nJustin Romberg , Associate Chair for Research and Schlumberger Professor in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering.\nWith multiple types of assets collectively assessing a complex, continuously changing scenario and determining how best to assign their individual skills to a broadly defined problem, such human-robot teams of the future would be ideal first-responders to dangerous situations.\n\u201cThe technology we\u2019re working will better allow humans to respond by projecting their intelligence without directly coming in harm\u2019s way,\u201d Kumar said.\nResearch News\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\n177 North Avenue\nAtlanta, Georgia\u00a0 30332-0181 USA\nMedia Relations Contacts : Georgia Tech \u2013 John Toon (404-894-6986) (jtoon@gatech.edu); UPenn \u2013 Evan Lerner (215-573-6604) (elerner@upenn.edu).\nProvided by Army Research Laboratory\nAdditional Images\nContact\nJohn Toon\nResearch News\n(404) 894-6986\nEmail\njtoon@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
