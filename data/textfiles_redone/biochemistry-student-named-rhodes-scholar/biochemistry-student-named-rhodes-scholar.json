That\u2019s what the biochemistry major wrote in his personal statement when he applied for the Rhodes Scholarship this year.\n\u201cI cannot say for sure where exactly in the field my interests will take me \u2014 evolutionary biology, medicinal chemistry, biophysics,\u201d he noted. \u201cI know myself too well to claim that any of these subjects would fail to fascinate and invigorate me the way research and learning always does.\u201d\nIn Spring 2018, Runnels, a native of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, will graduate with a bachelor's degree in biochemistry after only three years at Georgia Tech. And next fall, he will begin postgraduate study at the University of Oxford \u2014 the sixth student in Tech history to be named a Rhodes Scholar.\nRunnels works in the lab of Loren Williams, professor in the School of Chemistry and Biochemistry. Under the guidance of Williams, graduate student Nicholas Kovacs, lab manager Jessica Bowman, and others in the lab, he is studying the origins of protein folding.\n\u201cCalvin is considered by my lab members and by me to be among the brightest and most promising undergraduate students in our program,\u201d Williams stated in his Rhodes Scholar recommendation letter for Runnels. \u201cHe ranks in my view alongside a young John Rinn. John began his research career in my laboratory and is now a highly successful member of the University of Colorado faculty. Calvin, like John, is bound to do great things.\u201d\nRunnels\u2019 research investigates the primitive protein and RNA folding structures fossilized in the ribosome, which may provide insight into the origins of life.\n\u201cThe really cool thing about our research is that in the Williams lab, we think that the secrets of the origins of life are encoded in everyone\u2019s cells,\u201d Runnels said. \u201cEvery organism that exists has a little fossil record of the history of the molecules that are most important to life on Earth. That fossil record is called the ribosome, which is a little machine in your cells that makes protein.\u201d\nRunnels said the ribosome evolves similarly to the way a tree grows.\n\u201cIf you cut down a tree you can see [in the rings] the history of when that tree was a lot smaller and younger. You can peel away the layers and trace the history to the way it looked at the very beginning,\u201d he explained. \u201cThe ribosome is very similar in that the core of the ribosome is evolutionarily the most ancient part, and as it evolved over time new little pieces of protein and pieces of RNA accreted onto its surface, and it grew up into the modern ribosome.\u201d\nRunnels studies the core protein and RNA molecules in the ribosome and what their interactions tell us about the very earliest interactions of biopolymers on Earth.\nChoosing Georgia Tech\nLike many new Tech students, Runnels started as an undecided engineering major.\n\u201cI mostly came to Georgia Tech because I liked the way it felt. When I was here on my scholarship weekend I felt very welcome. I felt like people really liked it here. So, I came here on a feeling, more than on what I wanted to study,\u201d he said.\nIn high school, he enjoyed chemistry and he was good at it, but he didn\u2019t see himself being a scientist or chemist because his experience at working in labs had been less than positive.\nOne of the first things Runnels did as a first-year student was to go on a Tech Trek to Banff National Park in Alberta, Canada, with his cohort of Stamps President\u2019s Scholars. He met his research professor Loren Williams on that trip, and he was inspired and fascinated by their conversation.\n\u201cThat sums up my relationship with science and learning in general,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s all about what can inspire you and what can motivate you to dive into a topic that you didn\u2019t know anything about. Many of my favorite scientists didn\u2019t study just one thing.\u201d\nAt Tech, Runnels has been equally accomplished outside the research lab. He served as representative for the School of Chemistry and Biochemistry in the undergraduate Student Government Association (SGA), as well as co-chair of SGA\u2019s Cultural and Diversity Affairs Committee. He is a linear algebra teaching assistant, Beckman Coulter Petit Undergraduate Research Scholar, Stamps President\u2019s Scholar (Randolph Whitfield Scholarship), member of the Honors Program, Georgia Tech Student Ambassador, Diversity and Inclusion Fellow, member of the Omicron Delta Kappa honor society, recipient of the Georgia Tech Campus Life and Community Scholarship, and was a semifinalist for Mr. Georgia Tech this year. He is a transgender male, and served as the student co-chair of the campus LGBTQIA Action Team.\nHow does he manage this high level of activity and commitment?\nStephanie Ray, associate dean of students and director of Student Diversity Programs, addressed the question in her letter of recommendation for Runnels.\n\u201cIn addition to his accomplishments in the classroom and laboratory, Runnels was able to find balance in his life, and he was able to excel as a well-rounded student. At Georgia Tech balancing school and extracurricular activities is not always unproblematic, but Runnels found the key,\u201d Ray said. \u201cCalvin has spent a great deal of time at Tech learning about himself and learning about others. As a result, Calvin is very committed to improving the human condition.\u201d\nThe Rhodes Scholarship, established in 1902 and named for the British mining magnate and South African politician Cecil John Rhodes, is an international postgraduate award for students to study at the University of Oxford. It is considered one of the world\u2019s most prestigious scholarships, with 32 American students chosen for 2018. Runnels will be at Oxford for two to three years, depending on his course of study.\nRunnels said being named a Rhodes Scholar is a tremendous honor and came as a shock. He said he is trying to keep its meaning in perspective.\n\u201cWhat I think it means, and the way I\u2019m trying to frame it in my mind, is that I don\u2019t want to view getting this scholarship as my peak accomplishment of my life,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to think of it as an affirmation of the things I have done so far and also as a call to duty to make a difference in the world and try to do great things from here on.\u201d\nRunnels is the sixth Tech student to win a Rhodes Scholarship. Previous Rhodes Scholars include S. Alton Newton (1951); Will Roper (2002); Jeremy Farris (2004); Joy Buolamwini (2012); and Melissa McCoy (2013).\nAdditional Images\nContact\nVictor Rogers\nInstitute Communications\nEmail\nvictor.rogers@comm.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
