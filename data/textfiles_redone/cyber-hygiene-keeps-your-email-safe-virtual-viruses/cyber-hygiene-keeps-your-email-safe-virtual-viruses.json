She\u2019s asking your advice on a document attached to the email.\nBeing the helpful person that you are, you should just open up that file and give it a look, right? Wrong, says\nBrendan Saltaformaggio , a cybersecurity expert and assistant professor in the Georgia Tech\nSchool of Electrical and Computer Engineering .\nCyber criminals are taking advantage of the fact that more of us are working from home, away from the online safeguards we may have at work. What appears to be an email from a colleague in another department could be an attack that tricks recipients into opening attachments and silently installs malware.\n\u201cPeople will be doing a lot more over email when they work from home,\u201d Saltaformaggio noted. \u201cThey will be corresponding more with co-workers, sending potentially sensitive documents and interacting with people they may not necessarily know using computer systems that may not have been intended for secure use. That increases risk.\u201d\nTo stay safe from viruses and other malware, Saltaformaggio offers five tips for dealing with email while teleworking under these special conditions \u2013 and during the normal office conditions that we hope to resume soon.\nDon't click links in emails when you don't know the sender. Malicious links are among the most common sources of malware. Always hover over a link to be shown the website it links to. Be sure it is the website you expect before you click.\nDouble-check before you open files that get emailed to you, especially if they are unexpected. If anything about that email looks suspicious, don't hesitate to call up the sender and ask if they have really just sent you a file.\nWhen attaching files to email, always double check who you're sending it to. One small typo could send sensitive information to a stranger.\nWatch out for phishing! If something asks for your username and password, don't hesitate to call up your IT people and ask whether that request is legitimate. Your network administrator won\u2019t send you an email asking to you to log into a strange website.\nThought you had avoided traffic by working at home? Networks can get overloaded when everyone is teleworking. Teleworking spouses and children streaming movies can quickly jam a home internet connection. If everything seems clear on your end, report excessive slowdowns to your IT department.\n\u201cTeleworking can help companies get their staffs safely through this crisis, but we all need to be careful to practice good cyber hygiene, just as we are washing our hands to avoid an infection from viruses in the physical world,\u201d Saltaformaggio said.\nResearch News\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\n177 North Avenue\nAtlanta, Georgia\u00a0 30332-0181\u00a0 USA\nMedia Relations Assistance : John Toon (404-894-6986) (jtoon@gatech.edu).\nAdditional Images\nContact\nJohn Toon\nResearch News\n(404) 894-6986\nEmail\njtoon@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
