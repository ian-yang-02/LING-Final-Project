Dabbar , undersecretary for science at the U.S. Department of Energy, toured several of Georgia Tech\u2019s energy related labs on Friday, Sept. 25. The tour was organized by\nCollege of Sciences\nAssociate Dean Julia Kubanek and Regents Professor Tim Lieuwen, executive director of the\nStrategic Energy Institute . The itinerary included visits to the\nGeorgia Tech Research Institute (GTRI) , the Carbon Neutral Energy Solutions Building, chemistry labs in the Bunger Henry Building, and the National Electric Energy Testing, Research, and Applications Center (NEETRAC).\n\u201cIn putting together Undersecretary Dabbar\u2019s visit, we attempted to demonstrate the full range of Georgia Tech\u2019s energy research portfolio, from basic science to industry scale testing, and our deep understanding of national security, national lab partnerships, corporate partnerships, and company startups,\u201d Lieuwen said. \u201cWe think the tour achieved this very effectively.\u201d All aspects of Undersecretary Dabbar\u2019s tour were arranged with special considerations for maintaining full compliance with safety and health guidelines.\nTopics of discussion included cybersecurity and energy infrastructure, carbon capture and synthetic fuels, and microgrids and electric infrastructure. At each stop along the tour, Dabbar engaged with researchers and experts to discuss their work and to see Georgia Tech\u2019s facilities. He met with about a dozen researchers including Alexa Harter from GTRI\u2019s Cybersecurity, Information Protection, and Hardware Evaluation Research Laboratory; Devesh Ranjan from the\nGeorge W. Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering ; Krista Walton from the\nSchool of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering ; and Salvador Palafox from\nNEETRAC .\nIn his role as undersecretary, Dabbar is the lead for technology commercialization activities for the department and its 17 national labs, as well as the Department of Energy\u2019s principal advisor on fundamental energy research, energy technologies, and science. He also serves on the department\u2019s Environmental Management Advisory Board. Before his appointment as undersecretary in 2017, he was the managing director for mergers and acquisitions at J.P. Morgan, where he focused on operations, finance, and strategy in the energy sector. Dabbar holds a B.S. from the U.S. Naval Academy and an MBA from Columbia Business School.\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nStrategic Energy Institute\nContact\nBrent Verrill\nResearch Communications Program Manager\nInterdisciplinary Research Institutes\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
