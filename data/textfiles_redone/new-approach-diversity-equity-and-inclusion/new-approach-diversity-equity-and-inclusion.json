Under the new model, existing programs will be embedded across the Institute\u2019s academic and administrative units rather than being run out of a separate, central office.\n\u201cBy weaving these programs into the fabric of the Institute, we will be more effective at increasing representation and building a more inclusive culture,\u201d Cabrera said. \u201cRather than having programs concentrated in one separate office, we will empower the units closest to the work that can have a more direct impact in the life of the Institute.\u201d\nThe new approach will involve several organizational changes. Programs and staff will shift from the office of the Vice President of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion into the Office of the Provost, Student Engagement and Well-Being, Institute Communications, and Administration and Finance. The office of the VP will be discontinued upon the retirement of Archie Ervin at the end of December.\n\u201cI am grateful to Archie Ervin for 13 years of dedicated service to Georgia Tech,\" Cabrera said. \u201cThanks in part to his work, we are a more diverse and inclusive place than we were a decade ago and are now in a position to share the responsibility across the Institute to push the work forward.\u201d\nTo coordinate the work and monitor the Institute\u2019s progress, a new Diversity and Inclusion Strategic Leadership Team will be formed, with representation from various administrative and academic units and co-chaired by Shantay N. Bolton, executive vice president for Administration and Finance and chief business officer, and Steven W. McLaughlin, provost and executive vice president for Academic Affairs.\nThe new model shifts resources to where they can have the most immediate and effective impact, enables solutions that are better tailored to the unique challenges and opportunities within each area, integrates programs within core academic and administrative processes, and empowers all units to take ownership.\nDetails of the organizational changes will be finalized this month and rolled out between now and the end of the Fall semester. The new Diversity and Inclusion Strategic Leadership Team will be established this month in order to oversee and coordinate the transition.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nBlair Meeks\nInstitute Communications\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
