Juan-Pablo Correa-Baena, assistant professor and Goizueta Junior Faculty Rotating Chair in the School of Materials Science and Engineering, and his research group have been blazing trails on the hunt for new materials that can be used in solar energy conversion.\n\u201cThe most important part of this investment in U.S. manufacturing is the fact that Qcells is investing in the development of ingot and wafer production,\u201d Correa-Baena said. Currently, silicon needs to be processed to form solar cells used to harvest energy. Ingots are the first step in the manufacturing process of refining raw materials into wafers. The wafers become the base for completed solar panels.\nOver the past decade, most ingot and wafer production has been happening outside of the U.S. \u201cWith this investment, we guarantee that we can have full control of the supply chain by manufacturing all aspects of the solar panels domestically,\u201d said Correa-Baena. Ultimately, the goal is to make solar energy more affordable for American consumers and create high-paying jobs for Georgians.\n\u201cIt is exciting to see that silicon manufacturing is restarting in the U.S. and that Georgia is at the forefront of it,\u201d said Ajeet Rohatgi, Regents\u2019 Professor and John H. Weitnauer Jr. Chair in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering.\nRohatgi is one of the world\u2019s leading researchers in photovoltaics \u2013\u00a0the conversion of light into electricity using semiconducting materials like silicon. He is the founding director of the first university-based and Department of Energy-funded\nCenter of Excellence for Photovoltaics Research and Education . The center\u2019s work focuses on finding and improving the materials used to make solar cells while also improving their efficiency.\nQcells built its first plant near Dalton, Georgia, in 2019. By 2022, the facility had become the largest producer of solar panels in the western hemisphere. Rohatgi says representatives from Qcells have visited his research facilities on campus, and he and his team have visited the company\u2019s Dalton facility as well.\n\u201cAs demand for clean energy continues to grow nationally, we\u2019re ready to put thousands of people to work creating fully American made and sustainable solar solutions, from raw material to finished panels,\u201d said Justin Lee, CEO of Qcells. \u201cWe are committed to working with our customers as well as national and Georgia leaders to bring completely clean energy to millions of people across the country.\u201d\nTim Lieuwen, executive director of the\nStrategic Energy Institute ,\nRegents' Professor, and David S. Lewis Jr. Chair said, \u201cGeorgia Tech is a key leader in most of the core technologies associated with clean energy industries, has nationally distinctive researchers and facilities, and educates a lot of undergraduate and graduate students in these areas.\u201d\nThat is why Tech has the potential to be a valuable partner in this project. \u201cWe are in a unique space where we can interface with Qcells to help them improve materials processing and explore new materials, but also aid in their manufacturing processes by introducing artificial intelligence to optimize processes and increase their productivity,\u201d said Correa-Baena.\nThe announcement is not just significant for Georgia Tech, but for the state of Georgia as well. In Lieuwen\u2019s view, Georgia is emerging as a center of clean energy manufacturing and technology, in no small part thanks to the Institute\u2019s partnerships, research, and workforce development efforts. He says advancements in electric vehicles, batteries, and hydrogen power are all picking up steam in our state. \u201cHaving these types of companies in areas where Georgia Tech is focusing research and development efforts is good for the Institute and the state.\u201d\nThe Qcells expansion is likely just the tip of the iceberg, as leading researchers from across campus identify projects like these where Tech ingenuity and innovation can make a difference.\n\u201cI\u2019m enthusiastic about this expansion of solar cell manufacturing in Georgia because it builds on other clean energy, electrification, and energy storage industries already existing or planned for our state,\u201d said Julia Kubanek, professor and vice president for Interdisciplinary Research. \u201cThe Southeast is increasingly becoming known as a hub for cleantech innovation, and Georgia Tech is proud to be a key contributor to this ecosystem.\u201d\nProduction at the new Qcells solar plant is expected to start in 2024.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nSteven Norris\nsnorris@gatech.edu\nDirector, Media Relations and Social Media\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nEmail\nsnorris@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
