Earlier this month, CNN traveled the country in a campaign camper to allow people to film questions that might be used in future debates. Of the three questions selected for candidates in Tuesday night\u2019s primetime debate, two of them came from Georgia Tech students. Both of the featured Yellow Jackets are students in the Sam Nunn School of International Affairs, a division of Georgia Tech\u2019s Ivan Allen College of Liberal Arts. The first came from international affairs major Josh Jacob from Johns Creek. He first introduced himself as a Georgia Tech student before launching into his question. \u201cRecently Donald Trump mentioned that we must kill the families of ISIS members. However, this violates the principle of distinction between civilians and combatants in international law,\u201d Jacob began. \u201cSo my question is: How would killing innocent civilians set us apart from ISIS?\u201d The response on social media after his question was quick and positive. \u201cCan I vote for the Georgia Tech student for president? Most direct statement all night.\u201d Said @KenzieTheIntern on Twitter. Twitter user @sckozub said, \u201cGuy from Georgia Tech coming in with the best question of the night.\u201d When asked why he chose the question he did, Jacob says the answer is simple. \u201cI feel many GOP candidates tend to ignore international law when they pontificate about war.\u201d Jacob says he had no previous knowledge that his question had been selected, and was shocked when his face appeared on national television. He also credits an experience at Tech for helping him come up with a question. \u201cI studied abroad in the Europe. We went on a number of site visits to national parliaments and international institutions. I credit that experience with sharpening my ability to ask concise but incisive questions,\u201d Jacob says.\u00a0 Only minutes after Jacob\u2019s appearance came another Georgia Tech student\u2019s recorded question. Ashley Tofil, a student in the modern languages program, was also surprised to see herself on television. She directed her question to Carly Fiorina, who recently made a campaign stop at Georgia Tech. \u201cMs. Fiorina, In November you said that you would not talk to Vladimir Putin after you were elected because you would be communicating from a position of weakness,\u201d she started. \u201cDo you believe it is feasible to not communicate with another world leader and do you think that is also a sign of weakness?\u201d she asked. Fiorina then went on to explain that she would not cut off all communication with Putin, but that now was not the time to engage with him. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a bad response,\u201d says Tofil. \u201cI think that not talking to Putin and walking away from the negotiating table when necessary are two different things,\u201d she says. The social media praise continued after Tofil\u2019s question. \u201cShoutout to Georgia Tech students for being politically aware and asking legit questions. #GOPDebate\u201d Sara Edwards posted on her Twitter account. Both Jacob and Tofil are beaming about their inclusion in the national conversation. \u201cThere were hundreds of provocative and interesting questions asked by students from other colleges, so to have two out of the three questions come specifically from the Nunn School is certainly an honor,\u201d Jacob says. \u201cI\u2019m always proud to represent Georgia Tech,\u201d says Tofil.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nSteven Norris Social Media Manager\nEmail\nsnorris@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
