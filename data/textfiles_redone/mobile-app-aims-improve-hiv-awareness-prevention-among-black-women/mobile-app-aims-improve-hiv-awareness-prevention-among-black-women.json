To achieve this, the app offers personalized messaging to promote HIV preventative behaviors among its users.\nStatistics show that Black women have the second-highest rate of all new HIV infections in the United States, accounting for 69 percent of all HIV diagnoses among women in the South. In a preliminary study, participants endorsed the mobile app intervention and expressed a desire for a fully developed and integrated version.\n[RELATED:\u00a0Virtual Counselor to Help Address Vaccination Hesitancy in Black Communities]\nThanks to a $709,000 grant from the NIH, researchers will refine the app and evaluate its feasibility, acceptability, and usability among real-world users. The research needed to further develop the app will be conducted in Cobb, Dekalb, Fulton, and Gwinnett Counties, which all have high rates of new HIV cases.\nAndrea Grimes Parker, Georgia Tech\u2019s lead collaborator on the project, will receive a share of the grant worth $229,000. She is one of three primary collaborators. The others are Dr. Rasheeta Chandler of the Emory School of Nursing, the principal investigator, and Dr. Natalie Hernandez of the Morehouse School of Medicine.\nThe project, set to last three years, is titled\u00a0 In-the-kNOW (Novel Approaches to Optimizing Women\u2019s Health): A Mobile Application to Optimize HIV Prevention and Sexual/Reproductive Health Communication Among Black Women in the Southern U.S.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nDavid Mitchell, Communications Officer II david.mitchell@cc.gatech.edu\nEmail\ndavid.mitchell@cc.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
