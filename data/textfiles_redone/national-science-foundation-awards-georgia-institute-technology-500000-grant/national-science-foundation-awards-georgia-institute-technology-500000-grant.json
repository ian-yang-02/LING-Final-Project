VentureLab is Georgia Tech's incubator and helps faculty, students, and staff commercialize their research.\nAug 31, 2017\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nThe National Science Foundation (NSF) has named the Georgia Institute of Technology an Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Site \u2014 and awarded it a $500,000 grant to help Institute-based research teams identify and interview target customer audiences.\nThe grant, spread over five years, will be managed by Tech\u2019s VentureLab program. VentureLab is Georgia Tech\u2019s incubator that works with Institute faculty, staff, and students to evaluate their research and help them create startups based on those findings.\nI-Corps Sites enable academic institutions to catalyze teams whose technology concepts are likely candidates for commercialization. It also provides infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training, and funding to help researchers move from idea to commercialization.\nAt Georgia Tech, the I-Corps Sites grant will support up to 150 research teams \u2014 comprised of Institute students, faculty, researchers, or staff \u2014 in their efforts to meet with and interview potential customers, said Paul Freet, VentureLab\u2019s NSF\u00a0I-Corps instructor.\n\u201cA key part of the commercialization process is learning from customers\u2014 what I-Corps calls customer discovery,\u201d Freet said. \u201cWe ask our research teams to search for evidence of product-market-fit and learn if there is a market for the commercialization of their research.\u201d\nAll I-Corps Sites teams are expected to conduct 20 customer interviews. To help teams accomplish that goal, Georgia Tech teams accepted into the program will be reimbursed with up to $3,000 for travel to visit customers or attend trade shows.\nTeams that complete the I-Corps Sites program also will have access to follow-on $50,000 I-Corps Team grants. To date, Georgia Tech researchers have received more than 50 I-Corps Team grants.\n\"The I-Corps program has been instrumental in helping launch a startup based on my research into advanced materials,\" said Krista Walton, professor and Robert \u201cBud\u201d Moeller Faculty Fellow in the Georgia Tech School of Chemical & Biomolecular Engineering. \"Early feedback from potential customers was critical in setting the direction of our startup. The I-Corps Sites grant will help get more researchers out of the lab and in front of customers.\"\nAbout VentureLab:\nCreated in 2001 and ranked as the No. 2 university startup\u00a0incubator in the world, VentureLab is the Georgia Institute of Technology\u2019s incubator whose mission is to collaborate with faculty, staff, and students to create startups based on Tech research.
