If Dr. King were alive today, he wouldn\u2019t be the man who is saying that we can get to the table of brotherhood; he would be agitating for the change that he was trying to create.\u201d\nAfter discussing the complexities of American history, including the Poor People\u2019s Campaign, King\u2019s last days, and the designation of a federal holiday honoring him, Reid shifted her focus to today\u2019s national climate. \u201cThe wealth gap is only getting worse, and the political power gap is just as wide. The country has a long way to go to be a more perfect union.\u201d\nAs Reid stated, the median black family has $1,700 in wealth, and the median Latino family has $2,000 in wealth \u2013 total assets minus total debt \u2013 which has declined over the past three decades. Meanwhile, white median household wealth is significantly higher \u2013 $116,800 \u2013 up from $102,000 30 years ago. 1\n\u201cAnyone who wants to advocate for economic justice needs to understand that you need to fight for racial justice as a unique, special, and separate thing. Then, you need to fight for economic justice as a reparative, multi-community, and interdenominational thing,\u201d concluded Reid. \u201cOtherwise, America is a tribal country, and all the tribes will fight for whatever limited resources there are.\u201d\nFollowing the lecture, Allen Hyde, assistant professor in the School of History and Sociology, remarked, \u201cIt is important to understand the complexity of Dr. King and American history, so we can understand the connections between racial justice and economic justice in both the past and today\u2019s society.\u201d\n\u201cDespite America\u2019s tribal nature, we can come together by developing Dr. King\u2019s dangerous unselfishness, particularly in today\u2019s narcissistic era, as the need for economic justice cuts across everything,\u201d said John Jordan, alumnus of Morehouse College and managing partner for Fight for Light Inc.\nTo view the MLK Lecture in its entirety, visit\nhttps://youtu.be/LF9PiJpzW2U .\nGeorgia Tech\u2019s MLK Lecture is sponsored by Institute Diversity, Ivan Allen College of Liberal Arts, Office of Government and Community Relations, and Office of Student Diversity Programs.
