(Goldman Sachs) has joined\nEngage , an early-stage venture fund created by Georgia Tech and 10 leading global corporations.\nThe Engage Ventures growth program differs from other accelerators in that it targets later stage companies and helps them develop and execute go-to-market strategies. The fund\u2019s mission is to provide talented entrepreneurs with access to capital, customers and distribution channels through its accelerator and corporate partnerships.\n\u201cEngage is a unique model for a fund and accelerator because it allows an impressive group of corporations to lend their talent and resources to entrepreneurs in order to help them drive strategy and growth,\u201d said Dave Dase, head of Goldman Sachs\u2019 Investment Banking Division's Southeast Region. \u201cGoldman Sachs is committed to the Southeast, and to Atlanta, and we are thrilled to have the opportunity to invest in the entrepreneurial community in such a meaningful way.\u201d\nBased in Georgia Tech\u2019s Technology Square, Engage provides programming and support in partnership with the\nAdvanced Technology Development Center\n(ATDC). ATDC was established at Georgia Tech by Georgia lawmakers in 1980 to launch and build technology companies.\n\u201cSince its inception a little over one year ago, Engage is already having an impact on the growing entrepreneurial ecosystem in Atlanta and across the country,\u201d said Georgia Tech President G.P. \u201cBud\u201d Peterson.\u00a0 \u201cAs we engage with companies like Goldman Sachs, we are working to maximize the collective strengths of Georgia Tech, the Engage corporate partners, and the city of Atlanta to support startups nationally, while promoting Atlanta\u2019s world-class talent and strengthening the economy here in Georgia and the Southeast.\u201d\nEngage Ventures is the largest-ever strategic grouping of major corporations in an independent venture firm. The 10 founding companies contributing capital, expertise, time and resources in support of Engage include AT&T, Chick-fil-A, Cox Enterprises, Delta Air Lines, Georgia-Pacific, Georgia Power Foundation Inc., Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), Invesco Ltd., The Home Depot and UPS. Invest Georgia has also joined the fund since it was first announced last year. Executives from these firms mentor companies receiving financial support from the venture fund.\nThe fund is managed by Tech Square Ventures, which is led by managing partner Blake Patton.\nThe first cohort of startups completed the program in the fall. The\nsecond cohort\nwas announced last month.\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nInnovation Ecosystem at Georgia Tech\nEngage Ventures\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
