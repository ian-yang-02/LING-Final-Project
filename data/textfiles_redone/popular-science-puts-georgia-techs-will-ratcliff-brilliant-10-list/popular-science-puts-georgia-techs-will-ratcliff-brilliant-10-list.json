The\nmagazine\nPopular Science\nhas heaved the researcher from the Georgia Institute of Technology into\nits annual list \u201cThe Brilliant 10,\u201d a select roster\nof \u201cthe 10 most innovative young minds in science and technology.\u201d\u00a0 Ratcliff was praised for advancing the study of cellular evolution. PopSci\ncited his work demonstrating how single-cell organisms may have transitioned into simple multicellular organisms ages ago.\u00a0 It\u2019s widely seen as an arduous evolutionary leap, since single cells had to forfeit a lot of their own fitness for the greater good of creating viable cell groups. \u201cWilliam Ratcliff revealed surprising insights into what might have been necessary for this transition to occur,\u201d\nPopular Science\nwrote in its September/October edition. He has illuminated \u201cone of the greatest mysteries of life.\u201d The needs of the many Ratcliff, an assistant professor\nin Georgia Tech's\nSchool of Biological Sciences , has put thousands of generations of yeast and many generations of algae cells through stresses in the lab devised to get them to evolve better survival strategies around forming cohesive groups. \u201cWe\u2019re figuring out kind of clever ways to get them to form groups and then for those groups to become more complex,\u201d he said. The idea is to end up with a rudimentary multicellular being with cells taking on specialized roles, a very early step on the pathway to organ development.\u00a0 But the first advantage to group formation is simple -- size. Bigger is often better. \u201cA lot of small predators have small mouths that are great at eating single-cells,\u201d Ratcliff said.\u00a0 But\nbig multicellular cell clusters are too big for these predators\nto get their mouths around. Clustered cells survive to pass on their genes. Race to the bottom To accelerate the evolution of yeast from individuals cells into\ncell groups called \u201csnowflakes,\u201d one of his signature achievements , Ratcliff has selected for yeast cells that sink more quickly.\u00a0 There, again, big clusters sink better than single cells. Once clusters are done outcompeting the unicells, they compete against each other. \u201cIt\u2019s remarkable how quickly snowflake yeast clusters evolve new traits that let them win this race,\u201d he said. While the group gains various strengths, it sacrifices the viability of individual cells.\u00a0 \u201cThey evolve a division of labor in the group, in which some of them commit suicide,\u201d Ratcliff said.\u00a0 That changes reproductive patterns, which makes the clusters\u2019 progeny more competitive. The loss of individual cell fitness is extensive. The more robust a cluster gets, the less likely its individuals are to survive if they are caused to revert back to individual cells.\u00a0 It\u2019s like an odd twist on the traditional marriage vows: Part, and you will die. Much of Ratcliff\u2019s research is funded by NASA\u2019s Exobiology program and the National Science Foundation. Felt it coming Before\nPopular Science\ncalled for an interview for its four-paragraph nod, Ratcliff had sensed something was coming.\u00a0 For a few months, while the magazine cemented its list, it asked around at scientific societies about noteworthy up-and-coming researchers. As a result, Ratcliff received some veiled tips. \u201cA couple of colleagues of mine said, \u2018Hey man, I got a call from a reporter. I can\u2019t tell you anything about it, but you may be hearing something soon,\u2019\u201d he said. When\nPopSci\ncalled, a reporter told Ratcliff that many scientists had mentioned him, strongly influencing the decision to name him one of \"The Brilliant 10.\"\u00a0 \u201cThat was very touching that people within the research community said to them they should look at my lab,\u201d Ratcliff said. Hail Mary pass Life\u2019s small coincidences have helped guide Ratcliff\u2019s academic strivings down the path of evolutionary research. His career in biology spawned from childhood, when his parents carted him and his brother Felix off in their summers to woodland family cabins next to craggy Pacific Coast cliffs near Mendocino, California.\u00a0 \u201cThere was really nothing to do except to run around the forest and the ocean checking out the lives of plants and animals,\u201d Ratcliff said. They got hooked; both brothers became biologists. Plants became Ratcliff\u2019s passion at an early age, which led to a bachelor of science in plant biology from the University of California, Davis, but that threw his career a serendipitous curve. \u201cI thought it would have a lot to do with ecology, but it turned out to be mostly cellular biology.\u201d The decision to see if yeast cells could be coaxed into making the leap to multicellularity was also slightly capricious.\u00a0 \u201cThere was a lot of doubt surrounding it, but I thought, \u2018Why not just give it a try and see,\u2019\" said Ratcliff, whose Ph.D. is in ecology. He was astonished when that longshot worked.\u00a0 \u201cIt was a kind of Hail Mary pass,\u201d he said. It led to a dedicated research specialization and a notable body of continuing work. ------- Read about a tiny mutation triggering massive evolutionary change\nAdditional Images\nContact\nWriter and contact: Ben Brumfield Research News (404) 660-1408\nEmail\nben.brumfield@comm.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
