The culmination of decades of advocacy, activism, and demands for equal treatment and full citizenship, the ADA codified protections against discrimination in employment, public services and accommodations, transportation, and telecommunications.\nIt also laid the groundwork for later efforts \u2014 that continue to this day \u2014 to transform infrastructure, policies, and technology, placing accessibility at the forefront rather than a retrofitted afterthought. It has helped to change the way people think about equity, access, and usability in our built environment and our daily lives.\n\u201cIt speaks to inclusion on a larger scale, and it\u2019s very strong civil rights legislation,\u201d Johnson Marshall said. \u201cNot only is it an anti-discriminatory act, but it also established measurable standards.\u201d\nShe began working at Georgia Tech in 2002 as assistant dean of students and director of disability services and became the Institute\u2019s first full-time ADA compliance coordinator in 2016. \u201cI\u2019ve been able to see a lot of changes at Tech during the 19 years I\u2019ve been here,\u201d she said.\nIn her current role, she helps to make sure the Institute complies with the ADA and other disability-related laws in higher education, through policy development, equity and grievance processes, and ADA transition planning. Tech, like all higher ed institutions, is required to have a plan to ensure that its campus is accessible, including physical accessibility and also programmatic and service accessibility. That plan needs to be updated on a regular basis. \u201cOur last update was in 2016,\u201d Johnson Marshall said. \u201cSince then, we have created a transition plan, where we work on the items that were part of that assessment of our entire campus.\u201d\nThe position originated within the general counsel\u2019s office in Legal Affairs and recently moved to IDEI. \u201cCompliance, and everything that the ADA stands for, was meant to give minimum standards and minimum guidance,\u201d she said. \u201cBut in order for a person to actually participate in your campus environment, you need to go beyond the minimum, and to ensure that compliance is equitable to everyone involved.\u201d\nIt\u2019s also important, in her view, to \u201cunderstand an inclusive culture that includes disability and to understand what our community looks like. Our community is not made up of just one type of person, and we need to really commit to that.\u201d\nThe newest assistant dean and director of disability services is Anne Jannarone, who came to Tech in 2019 with more than 20 years in the field. From the outset, she appreciated what she saw as the Institute\u2019s commitment to supporting students and employees with disabilities.\n\u201cIt was impressive,\u201d she said. \u201cI liked the idea of being in a big city and talking about accessibility not just on campus but in the midst of the larger Atlanta community.\u201d\nGeorgia Tech\u2019s\nOffice of Disability Services\nfocuses on finding solutions and implementing accommodations for individuals with disabilities who face physical, technological, academic, or other barriers on campus. Jannarone takes to heart her team\u2019s responsibility for \u201cdetermining reasonable accommodations for all the possible scenarios a student with a disability can face.\u201d These land most frequently on the academic side \u2014 accommodations related to exams and note-taking, for example. Some students have sensory disabilities, so the office provides alternative formats, interpreters, and real-time captioning, among other services.\nFor Jannarone, one of the most significant effects of the ADA was to expand the reach of legal protection beyond what had been established by the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, Section 504, which applied only to public institutions that received federal funding. By including private places of public accommodation, the ADA demonstrated that, for the first time on a national level, \u201cthe breadth of experiences of people with disabilities was being thought about.\u201d\nBoth Jannarone and Johnson Marshall agree that enormous changes have taken place, in part because of the ADA, and that much work remains to be done. They also note some important shifts occuring as a result of the pandemic, which got people thinking differently \u2014 and some for the first time \u2014 about disabilities and technology. It allowed faculty and staff to explore new, virtual models of teaching and working outside of traditional classrooms and offices, models that can provide greater accessibility and usability for people with disabilities.\nAwareness is also increasing as a result of the efforts of individuals and units across Georgia Tech \u2014 including the\nCenter for Inclusive Design and Innovation , the Office of Information Technology, and the\nDiversity and Inclusion Fellows Program , which helped launch\nABLE Alliance\nin 2019. Made up of Tech faculty, staff, and students, ABLE Alliance works to improve accessibility and inclusion on campus, as well as providing support, resources, networking, and professional development opportunities.\n\u201cOnce we realize who is actually in our community or our culture, I think we\u2019ll have a better understanding of designing things for all people to use,\u201d Johnson Marshall said. \u201cWe\u2019re getting there.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nContact\nStacy Braukman\nEmail\nstacy.braukman@comm.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
