But in the tropical Pacific, the oxygen level has been falling at a much faster rate than the temperature change can explain.\u201d\nThe study, which was published May 16 in Nature Geoscience, was sponsored by the National Science Foundation, a Georgia Power Faculty Scholar Chair and a Cullen-Peck Faculty Fellowship.\nIn the report, the researchers describe how air pollution from industrial activities had raised levels of iron and nitrogen \u2013 key nutrients for marine life \u2013 in the ocean off the coast of East Asia. Ocean currents then carried the nutrients to tropical regions, where they were consumed by photosynthesizing phytoplankton.\nBut while the tropical phytoplankton may have released more oxygen into the atmosphere, their consumption of the excess nutrients had a negative effect on the dissolved oxygen levels deeper in the ocean.\n\u201cIf you have more active photosynthesis at the surface, it produces more organic matter, and some of that sinks down,\u201d Ito said. \u201cAnd as it sinks down, there\u2019s bacteria that consume that organic matter. Like us breathing in oxygen and exhaling CO2, the bacteria consume oxygen in the subsurface ocean, and there is a tendency to deplete more oxygen.\u201d\nThat process plays out all across the Pacific, but the effects are most pronounced in tropical areas, where dissolved oxygen is already low.\nAthanasios Nenes, a professor in the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences and the School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at Georgia Tech who worked with Ito on the study, said the research is the first to describe just how far reaching the impact of human industrial activity can be.\n\u201cThe scientific community always thought that the impact of air pollution is felt in the vicinity of where it deposits ,\u201d said Nenes, who also serves as Georgia Power Faculty Scholar. \u201cThis study shows that the iron can circulate across the ocean and affect ecosystems thousands of kilometers away.\u201d\nWhile evidence had been mounting that global climate change may have an impact on future oxygen levels, Ito and Nenes were spurred to search for an explanation for why oxygen levels in the tropics had been declining since the 1970s.\nTo understand how the process worked, the researchers developed a model that combines atmospheric chemistry, biogeochemical cycles, and ocean circulation. Their model maps out how polluted, iron-rich dust that settles over the Northern Pacific gets carried by ocean currents east toward North America, down the coast and then back west along the equator.\nIn their model, the researchers accounted for other factors that can also impact oxygen levels, such as water temperature and ocean current variability.\nWhether due to warming sea waters or an increase in iron pollution, the implications of growing oxygen-minimum zones are far reaching for marine life.\n\u201cMany living organisms depend on oxygen that is dissolved in seawater,\u201d Ito said. \u201cSo if it gets low enough, it can cause problems, and it might change habitats for marine organisms.\u201d\nOccasionally, waters from low oxygen areas swell to the coastal waters, killing or displacing populations of fish, crabs and many other organisms. Those \u201chypoxic events\u201d may become more frequent as the oxygen-minimum zones grow, Ito said.\nThe increasing phytoplankton activity is a double-edged sword, Ito said.\n\u201cPhytoplankton is an essential part of the living ocean,\u201d he said. \u201cIt serves as the base of food chain and absorbs atmospheric carbon dioxide. But if the pollution continues to supply excess nutrients, the process of the decomposition depletes oxygen from the deeper waters, and this deep oxygen is not easily replaced.\u201d\nThe study also expands on the understanding of dust as a transporter of pollution, Nenes said.\n\u201cDust has always attracted of a lot of interest because of its impact on the health of people,\u201d Nenes said. \u201cThis is really the first study showing that dust can have a huge impact on the health of the oceans in ways that we\u2019ve never understood before. It just raises the need to understand what we\u2019re doing to marine ecosystems that feed populations worldwide.\u201d\nThis material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. OCE-1242313.
