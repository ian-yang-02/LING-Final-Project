Today the area is a thriving innovation ecosystem thanks to a network of students, faculty, researchers, startup entrepreneurs and global corporations.\n\u201cTech Square is a globally recognized destination for innovation,\u201d said AURP President Mason Ailstock. \u201cThrough Georgia Tech\u2019s leadership, Tech Square creates intentional collisions between industry partners, entrepreneurs and the university. AURP is thrilled to showcase the breadth and depth of Atlanta and Georgia Tech to the 2019 conference attendees.\u201d\nTech Square is comprised\u00a0of more than 2 million\u00a0square\u00a0feet of office, research, retail, residential and hotel space, including the\u00a0Technology\u00a0Square\u00a0Research Building, the Biltmore, Global Learning Center, the Scheller College of Business and the new Coda building, which will open in 2019.\nMore than 100 companies, employing 15,000, people are located in the 10-block area of Midtown Atlanta. Nearly 30 major companies run corporate design, innovation, technology development and research centers in or near the area, including Anthem, AT&T, Delta Air Lines, Home Depot, NCR, Southern Company and UCB.\nWhile these corporate operations represent a wide range of industries, they all seek to tap into the area\u2019s culture of collaboration \u2014 and its talent pool.\nTech Square is one reason why Atlanta is among the top cities for corporate innovation, said Greg King, associate vice president for economic development at Georgia Tech and an AURP board member.\n\u201cWith a density that helps to accelerate innovation and development, Tech Square brings together education, research and corporate partnerships,\u201d King said. \u201cGeorgia Tech has also fostered an environment where corporate innovators can learn from each other and experienced entrepreneurs mentor younger startups.
