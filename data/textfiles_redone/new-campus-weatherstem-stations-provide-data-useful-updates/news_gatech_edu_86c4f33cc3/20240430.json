WeatherSTEM \u2013 an integration of weather stations, collected and distributed atmospheric data and STEM-based curriculum for grades K-12 \u2013 recently worked with Georgia Tech Emergency Preparedness to install the stations at three locations on campus: the roof of the Wardlaw Center, the corner of the Campus Recreation Center parking deck and the roof of the Georgia Tech Police Department. \"Having these weather stations on campus allows us to verify local conditions with ground truth data,\u201d said William Smith, director of Georgia Tech Emergency Preparedness. \u201cThis has applications from sports medicine to public safety.\u00a0 Because the data is easily accessible from a number of platforms, including social media and the WeatherSTEM app, the entire Georgia Tech community can always understand current weather conditions and how they may impact their daily activities.\" In addition to up-to-the-minute condition information, the stations are also equipped with cameras that produce dramatic images of clouds, including time-lapse imagery. Twenty-four hour time-lapse views of the sky are posted to a dedicated YouTube channel each night around midnight. A good example came from the stadium camera unit Nov. 12 at the Virginia Tech football game. The video is\navailable at online . Each station also has its own social media feeds on Twitter and Facebook. In addition to weather data and up-to-the-minute status of weather conditions, WeatherSTEM engages K-12 students in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) subjects. Studying the weather makes use of all the key disciplines and is at the heart of WeatherSTEM\u2019s mission. \u201cEveryone on the planet can relate to weather,\u201d said Ed Mansouri, creator of WeatherSTEM, who was recently on campus for the WeatherSTEM installations. \u201cA primary goal for WeatherSTEM is to offer teachers tools to integrate weather data, images and charts into their science and math lessons. We are very excited to be working with the Georgia Institute of Technology to introduce our STEM-focused platform to Georgia\u2019s K-12 students.\u201d Local teachers looking to draw on the WeatherSTEM data and curriculum can learn more at\nhttp://gatech.weatherstem.com/about . Mansouri and the WeatherSTEM team are continuing to install stations on campuses of other Atlantic Coast Conference universities. No word on how competitive the schools will be in deciding \u201cwho has the best weather?\u201d\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nStadium station website\nCRC station website\nGTPD station website\nEmail\nlance.wallace@comm.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
