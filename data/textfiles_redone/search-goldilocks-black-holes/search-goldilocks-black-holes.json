On the low end are those with masses 10 times that of the sun. Examples are the two black holes whose merger generated the\nfirst gravitational wave to be detected , by\nthe LIGO Scientific Collaboration\n(LSC), an international team including researchers in the School of Physics\u2019\nCenter for Relativistic Astrophysics\n(CRA). LIGO stands for Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory, a facility based in the U.S.\nOn the high end are black holes that are a million times as massive as the sun.\nEvidence for them comes from NASA images .\nFor the Goldilocks black holes, with masses in between, no hard proof exists to date.\nIndirect evidence\nhas been offered, but nothing unambiguous so far. A single detection can transform our understanding of the first stars in the universe.\nAs it happens, LIGO has been designed to detect gravitational waves arising from collisions of midsize black holes. A\nrecent study\nsuggests that the Goldilocks of black holes may be uncommon. Analysis of LIGO data collected from September 2015 through January 2016 found no evidence for midsize black holes. However, the work enables scientists to estimate more accurately than ever before the abundance of such black holes.\nThe paper reports a \u201csurvey of the universe for midsize-black-hole collisions up to 5 billion light years ago,\u201d says\nKaran Jani , a former Georgia Tech Ph.D. physics student who participated in the study. That volume of space contains about 100 million galaxies the size of the Milky Way. Nowhere in that space did the study find a collision of midsize black holes.\n\u201cClearly they are much, much rarer than low-mass black holes, three collisions of which LIGO has detected so far,\u201d Jani says. Nevertheless, should a gravitational wave from two Goldilocks black holes colliding ever gets detected, Jani adds, \u201cwe have all the tools to dissect the signal.\u201d\nThe study was undertaken by hundreds of scientists worldwide belonging to LSC and\nthe Virgo Collaboration , another international team observing gravitational waves from a facility in Italy. Georgia Tech scientists worked on\nthe paper\nin close collaboration with colleagues from the\nAlbert Einstein Institute Hannover , in Germany; Hillsdale College; Kenyon College; \u00a0Massachusetts Institute of Technology; Pennsylvania State University;\nRadboud University , in the Netherlands;\nUniversit\u00e9 Paris Diderot , in France; and the\nUniversity of Birmingham , in England.\nJani received a\nPh.D. in spring 2017 . He worked with CRA Director\nDeirdre Shoemaker ,\nLSC Deputy Spokesperson Laura Cadonati , and CRA colleagues\nJuan Calderon Bustillo ,\nJames Clark ,\nClaudia Lazzaro , and\nPablo Laguna . All of them participated in the first detection of a gravitational wave, on Sept. 14, 2015.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nA.
