For safety reasons, plans are to remove the tree during the Thanksgiving break.\n\u201cBefore removing a tree, we have an outside vendor evaluate the tree to ensure our assessment is correct,\u201d said Quentin Holden, campus tree surgeon. \u201cWhile we have done everything possible to help the tree survive, the tree is leaning heavily, and a structural issue has been recently discovered at the tree\u2019s base putting it at severe risk of failure. It must be removed for campus safety.\u201d\nThe wood from this tree will not be reused as lumber due to the curvature of the tree trunk. Wood harvested for lumber needs to have straight trunks to minimize warping and checking (separating or cracking). With the removal of the oak, multiple trees will be planted on campus, or funds equivalent to the replacement will be provided to the tree bank, in accordance with the Campus Landscape Master Plan and the Tree Care Replacement Policy. Locations for replacement trees will be identified and the trees planted in the appropriate season. Currently, the campus tree count totals more than 15,000 trees with an estimated total replacement value of more than $11 million.\nInstitute Landscape Architect Jason Gregory said, \u201cWe\u2019re always sad when we have to remove such a large tree on campus, but it is part of the management of our urban forest to maintain a safe environment for everyone.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nContact\nCathy Brim\nCommunications Officer II\nInstitute Communications/Infrastructure and Sustainability\nEmail\ncathy.brim@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
