Ayanna Howard, chair of the School of Interactive Computing and Linda J. and Mark C. Smith Professor, recommended Bryant.\nFor the film, she was asked to program a Nao, a humanoid robot she utilizes in the\u00a0 Human-Automation Systems (HumAnS) Lab , which the lab affectionately named Cookie. The robot is traditionally used in adaptive rehabilitative activities for children with motor impairments.\n\u201cI had about a week to get it ready. I had this idea of what they wanted, and I tried to program it as best I could. I had no idea what the movie was about, but I was just excited to be a part of it,\u201d Bryant explained.\nSuperintelligence,\nstarring Melissa McCarthy, takes place when an all-powerful autonomous artificial intelligence chooses to study the most average person on earth, Carol (played by Melissa McCarthy). The fate of the world hangs in the balance\nFor the scene, Bryant programmed Cookie to execute specific non-verbal movements that matched the timing and script. Cookie can be seen in the film executing custom gestures that helped to portray the personality of the Superintelligence while also exhibiting social and communicative behavior as it spoke to the actors in the scene.\nOn the day of filming, Bryant took the Nao robot to the Klaus Advanced Computing Building. Sitting right behind the camera, De\u2019Aira was readying for her cue. Anxiously waiting, she says everyone on set was understanding and eager to learn, with plenty of questions. And, of course, when it was time, Cookie came through with flying colors.\n\u201cI like to say that the robot was the biggest superstar on the set.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nContact\nEvan Atkinson , Georgia Tech Institute Communications\nEmail\neatkinson6@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
