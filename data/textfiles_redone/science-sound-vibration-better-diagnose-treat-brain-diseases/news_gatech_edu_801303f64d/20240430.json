Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering\nand the\nWallace H. Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering\nat Georgia Tech and Emory University. \u201cEach researcher is bringing their own expertise to explore how vibrations and waves across a range of frequencies could either extract information from the brain or focus energy on the brain.\u201d\nAccessing the Brain Is a Tough Challenge\nWhile it is possible to treat some tumors and other brain diseases non-invasively if they are near the center of the brain, many other conditions are harder to access, the researchers say.\n\u201cThe center part of the brain is most accessible; however, even if you are able to target the part of the brain away from the center, you still have to go through the skull,\u201d Arvanitis said.\nHe added that moving just 1 millimeter in the brain constitutes \u201ca huge distance\u201d from a diagnostic perspective. The science community widely acknowledges the brain\u2019s complexity, each part associated with a different function and brain cells differing from one to the other.\nAccording to\nBrooks Lindsey , a biomedical engineering assistant professor at Georgia Tech and Emory, there is a reason why brain imaging or therapy works well in some people but not in others.\n\u201cIt depends on the individual patient\u2019s skull characteristics,\u201d he said, noting that some people have slightly more trabecular bone \u2014\u00a0\u00a0the spongy, porous part of the bone\u00a0that makes it more difficult to treat.\nUsing ultrasound waves, the researchers are tackling the challenge on multiple levels. Lindsey\u2019s lab uses ultrasound imaging to assess skull properties for effective imaging and therapy. He said his team conducted the first investigation that uses ultrasound imaging to measure the effects of bone microstructure \u2014 specifically, the degree of porosity in the inner, trabecular bone layer of the skull.\n\u201cBy understanding transmission of acoustic waves through microstructure in an individual\u2019s skull, non-invasive ultrasound imaging of the brain and delivery of therapy could be possible in a greater number of people,\u201d he said, explaining one potential application would be to image blood flow in the brain following a stroke.\nRefocusing Ultrasound Beams on the Fly\nArvanitis\u2019 lab recently found a new way to focus ultrasound through the skull and into the brain, which is \u201c100-fold faster than any other method,\u201d Arvanitis said. His team\u2019s work in adaptive focusing techniques would allow clinicians to adjust the ultrasound on the fly to focus it better.\n\u201cCurrent systems rely a lot on MRIs, which are big, bulky, and extremely expensive,\u201d he said. \u201cThis method lets you adapt and refocus the beam. In the future this could allow us to design less costly, simpler systems, which would make the technology available to a wider population, as well as be able to treat different parts of the brain.\u201d\nUsing \u2018Guided Waves\u2019 to Access Periphery Brain Areas\nAnother research cohort, led by\nAlper Erturk , Woodruff Professor of Mechanical Engineering at Georgia Tech, and former Georgia Tech colleague Massimo Ruzzene, Slade Professor of Mechanical Engineering at the University of Colorado Boulder, performs high-fidelity modeling of skull bone mechanics along with vibration-based elastic parameter identification. They also leverage guided ultrasonic waves in the skull to expand the treatment envelope in the brain. Erturk and Ruzzene are mechanical engineers by background, which makes their exploration of vibrations and guided waves in difficult-to-reach brain areas especially fascinating.\nErturk noted that guided waves are used in other applications such as aerospace and civil structures for damage detection. \u201cAccurate modeling of the complex bone geometry and microstructure, combined with rigorous experiments for parameter identification, is crucial for a fundamental understanding to expand the accessible region of the brain,\u201d he said.\nRuzzene compared the brain and skull to the Earth\u2019s core and crust, with the cranial guided waves acting as an earthquake. Just as geophysicists use earthquake data on the Earth\u2019s surface to understand the Earth\u2019s core, so are Erturk and Ruzzene using the guided waves to generate tiny, high frequency \u201cearthquakes\u201d on the external surface of the skull to characterize what comprises the cranial bone.\nTrying to access the brain periphery via conventional ultrasound poses added risks from the skull heating up. Fortunately, advances such as cranial leaky Lamb waves increasingly are recognized for transmitting wave energy to that region of the brain.\nThese cranial guided waves could complement focused ultrasound applications to monitor changes in the cranial bone marrow from health disorders, or to efficiently transmit acoustic signals through the skull barrier, which could help access metastases and treat neurological conditions in currently inaccessible regions of the brain.\nUltimately, the four researchers hope their work will make full brain imaging feasible while stimulating new medical imaging and therapy techniques. In addition to transforming diagnosis and treatment of brain diseases, the techniques could better detect traumas and skull-related defects, map the brain function, and enable neurostimulation. Researchers also see the potential for uncovering ultrasound-based blood-brain barrier openings for drug delivery for managing and treating diseases such as Alzheimer\u2019s.\nWith this comprehensive research of the skull-brain system, and by understanding the fundamentals of transcranial ultrasound, the team hopes to make it more available to even more diseases and target many parts of the brain.\nThis work is funded by the National Science Foundation (CMMI Award 1933158 \u201cCoupling Skull-Brain Vibroacoustics and Ultrasound Toward Enhanced Imaging, Diagnosis, and Therapy\u201d).\nCITATIONS:\nC.
