Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering at Georgia Tech and Emory University, have studied the kinetics of autocatalytic reactions used to make colloidal metal nanocrystals suitable for catalytic, biomedical, photonic, electronic and other uses.

The kinetics data is based on painstaking systematic studies done to determine growth rates on different nanocrystal facets \u2014 surface structures that control how the crystals grow by attracting individual atoms.\nIn an article published December 11 in the journal\nProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , a research team from the Georgia Institute of Technology provided a quantitative picture of how surface conditions controlled the growth of palladium nanocrystals. The work, which will later include information on nanocrystals made from other noble metals, is supported by the National Science Foundation.\n\u201cThis is a fundamental study of how catalytic nanocrystals grow from tiny seeds, and a lot of people working in this field could benefit from the systematic, quantitative information we have developed,\u201d said\nYounan Xia , professor and Brock Family Chair in the\nWallace H. Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering\nat Georgia Tech and Emory University. \u201cWe expect that this work will help researchers control the morphology of nanocrystals that are needed for many different applications.\u201d\nA critical factor controlling how nanocrystals grow from tiny seeds is the surface energy of the crystalline facets on the seeds. Researchers have known that energy barriers dictate the surface attraction for precursors in solution, but specific information on the energy barrier for each type of facet had not been readily available.\n\u201cTypically, the surface of the seeds that are used to grow these nanocrystals has not been homogenous,\u201d explained Xia, who is also the Georgia Research Alliance Eminent Scholar in Nanomedicine and holds joint appointments in School of Chemistry & Biochemistry and School of Chemical & Biomolecular Engineering. \u201cYou may have different facets on the crystals, which depend on the arrangement of the atoms below them. From the standpoint of precursors in the solution around the seeds, these surfaces have different activation energies which determine how difficult it will be for the precursors or atoms to land on each surface.\u201d\nXia\u2019s research team designed experiments to assess the energy barriers on various facets, using seeds in a variety of sizes and surface configurations chosen to have only one type of facet. The researchers measured both the growth of the nanocrystals in solution and the change in concentration of palladium tetrabromide (PdBr 4 2- )\u00a0precursor salt.\n\u201cBy choosing the right precursor, we can ensure that all the reduction we measure is on the surface and not in the solution,\u201d he explained. \u201cThat allowed us to make meaningful measurements about the growth, which is controlled by the type of facet, as well as presence of a twin boundary, corresponding to distinctive growth patterns and end results.\u201d\nOver the course of nearly a year, visiting graduate research assistant Tung-Han Yang studied the nanocrystal growth using different types of seeds. Rather than allowing nanocrystal growth from self-nucleation, Xia\u2019s team chose to study growth from seeds so they could control the initial conditions.\nControlling the shape of the nanocrystals is critical to applications in catalysis, photonics, electronics and medicine. Because these noble metals are expensive, minimizing the amount of material needed for catalytic applications helps control costs.\n\u201cWhen you do catalysis with these materials, you want to make sure the nanocrystals are as small as possible and that all of the atoms are exposed to the surface,\u201d said Xia. \u201cIf they are not on the surface, they won\u2019t contribute to the activity and therefore will be wasted.\u201d\nThe ultimate goal of the research is a database that scientists can use to guide the growth of nanocrystals with specific sizes, shapes and catalytic activity. Beyond palladium, the researchers plan to publish the results of kinetic studies for gold, silver, platinum, rhodium and other nanocrystals. While the pattern of energy barriers will likely be different for each, there will be similarities in how the energy barriers control growth, Xia said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really how the atoms are arranged on the surface that determines the surface energy,\u201d he explained. \u201cDepending on the metals involved, the exact numbers will be different, but the ratios between the facet types should be more or less the same.\u201d\nXia hopes that the work of his research team will lead to a better understanding of how the autocatalytic process works in the synthesis of these nanomaterials, and ultimately to broader applications.\n\u201cIf you want to control the morphology and properties, you need this information so you can choose the right precursor and reducing agent,\u201d said Xia. \u201cThis systematic study will lead to a database on these materials. This is just the beginning of what we plan to do.\u201d\nIn addition to the researchers already mentioned, the study also included Shan Zhou, Kyle Gilroy, Legna Figueroa-Cosme, Yi-Hsien Lee and Jenn-Ming Wu.\nThis work was supported in part by a research grant from the NSF (CHE 1505441) and startup funds from the Georgia Institute of Technology.
