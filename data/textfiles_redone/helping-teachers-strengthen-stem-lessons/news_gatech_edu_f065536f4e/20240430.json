Teachers will have access to Georgia Tech\u2019s computing research and Honeywell engineers, who will serve as mentors and coaches.\nThe Honeywell STEM Challenge, a software engineering competition open to students of teachers who participate in the STEM Teacher Leadership Program. Students will work in teams to solve real-world challenges using software coding and computation techniques.\nAn annual STEM Teacher Leadership Program Symposium, where alumni and other teachers and leaders from the metro Atlanta area can attend academic and networking activities at Georgia Tech.\nThe program will be facilitated by Georgia Tech\u2019s Center for Education Integrating Science, Mathematics and Computing (CEISMC).\n\u201cWe\u2019re pleased to continue our relationship with Honeywell as part of our vision to be among the most highly respected, technology-focused learning institutions in the world,\u201d said Rafael L. Bras, Georgia Tech\u2019s provost, executive vice president for academic affairs and K. Harrison Brown Family Chair. \u201cStrong students start with strong foundations. Together with Honeywell\u2019s support, Georgia Tech will be able to continue to place strategic emphasis on teachers as they prepare the next generation of STEM leaders.\u201d\nBeyond the new program, Honeywell and Georgia Tech already collaborate on job fairs, research projects and other academic opportunities and internships.\n\u201cThe complexities of today\u2019s connected world require young people to learn new computer science and software skills to solve tomorrow\u2019s problems,\u201d said Jamshed Patel, site leader for Honeywell\u2019s Atlanta Software Center. \u201cBy offering new teaching techniques in these subject areas to metro Atlanta teachers, we hope to prepare students to join a workforce where success comes from the ability to logically think through a technical problem and find a way to solve it.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nSTEM Teacher Leadership Program at Georgia Tech\nContact\nFor media inquiries, email Laura Diamond, laura.diamond@gatech.edu\nTo participate in The STEM Teacher Leadership Program at Georgia Tech, email stlp@ceismc.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
