A\nnew study\nhas shown how fortuitously some early predecessors of protein may have fallen into line.\nIn the laboratory, under conditions mimicking those on pre-life Earth, a small selection of amino acids linked up spontaneously into neat segments in a way that surprised researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology. They had given these amino acids found in proteins today some stiff competition by adding amino acids not found in proteins, thinking these non-protein, or non-biological, amino acids would probably not allow predominantly biological segments to come together.\nThe non-biological amino acids had the potential to chemically react equally well or better than the biological ones and frequently become part of the tiny chains, perhaps serving as an in-between step in the greater evolution toward proteins. The experiment dashed those expectations -- but to the researchers\u2019 delight. The reactions resulted mostly in strings that were closer to today\u2019s actual proteins and less in\u00a0chains that included non-biological amino acids.\n\u201cThe non-biological amino acids were being excluded to some extent,\u201d said Nick Hud, one of the study\u2019s principal investigators,\u00a0a\nRegents Professor in Georgia Tech\u2019s School of Chemistry and Biochemistry \u00a0and associate director of the\nPetit Institute for Bioengineering and Bioscience\nat Georgia Tech.\nDoorway to evolution\nIn particular, the researchers had thought the non-biological amino acids would outcompete the biological amino acid lysine, but it was not the case. They also thought lysine would often not fit neatly into the chains the way\u00a0it does in proteins. The reaction surprised them again.\n\u201cLysine went into the chains predominantly in the way that it is connected in proteins today,\u201d said Hud, who is also director of the\nNational Science Foundation/NASA Center for Chemical Evolution\n(CCE), which is headquartered at Georgia Tech and explores chemistry that may have paved the way to first life.\nThe research team, which included collaborators from\nThe Scripps Research\nInstitute, published their results\nin the journal\nProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences\non July 29, 2019. The research was funded by the NSF and NASA.\nThe study\u2019s experiment points to chemical evolution having prefabricated some amino acid chains useful in living systems before life had evolved a way to make proteins. The preference for the incorporation of the biological amino acids over non-biological counterparts also adds to possible explanations for why life selected for just 20 amino acids when 500 occurred naturally on the Hadean Earth.\n\u201cOur idea is that life started with the many building blocks that were there and selected a subset of them, but we don\u2019t know how much was selected on the basis of pure chemistry or how much biological processes did the selecting. Looking at this study, it appears today\u2019s biology may reflect these early prebiotic chemical reactions more than we had thought,\u201d said Loren Williams, another principal investigator in the study and a\nprofessor in Georgia Tech\u2019s School of Chemistry and Biochemistry \u00a0as well as a Petit Institute researcher.\n[Ready for graduate school?\u00a0 Here's how to apply to Georgia Tech. ]\nMono, oligo, poly\nTo help understand the study\u2019s significance, let\u2019s look at how proteins form, then at the study\u2019s core experiment, which revealed an unexpectedly high preference for bonds between sites called alpha-amines (\u03b1-amines) on the biological amino acids. Those bonds gave resulting molecular segments a protein-like shape in the lab.\nIn a protein, one amino acid is a single chemical unit, or monomer. A few of them linked together is called an\noligomer , and really long chains are polymers. In proteins, the polymer is called a polypeptide -- named after the peptide bonds that link its monomers together.\nPolypeptides are long chains that often form helices, like old phone cords, or flat sheets. They kink and fold up into specific, mostly functional wads, sheets, and other shapes, which are called proteins. The study looked at how amino acid monomers linked up to make interesting oligomers that look like small pieces of proteins.\nHadean Eon experiment\nLate in the\nHadean Eon , Earth\u2019s earliest phase, when prebiotic chemistry was taking shape, the planet\u2019s surface was awash in vulcanism and rain, and large meteors pummeled it with new chemicals. The researchers\u2019 experimental lab setup reflected relatively mild conditions for those times and feasibly present ingredients.\nFirst author\nMoran Frenkel-Pinter\nplaced the biological amino acids lysine, arginine, and histidine together with three non-biological competitors in water containing hydroxy acids. Hydroxy acids are known to facilitate amino acid reactions and would have been common on prebiotic Earth.\nThe mixture was heated to 85 degrees Celsius, pushing the reaction and evaporating the water, and the researchers analyzed the products formed.\n\u201cWe found this high preference for the inclusion of these biological amino acids and the linkage via the \u03b1-amine,\u201d said Frenkel-Pinter, a NASA postdoctoral researcher in the CCE.\nAmine groups are made of nitrogen and hydrogen and are quite reactive, but the \u03b1-amine is part of the core of an amino acid, and other amines in this experiment were at the end of a sidechain extending off the core. The latter is often more reactive.\n\u201cIt surprised us that this chemistry favored the \u03b1-amine connection found in proteins, even though chemical principles might have led us to believe that the non-protein connection would be favored,\u201d Frenkel-Pinter said. \u201cThe preference for the protein-like linkage over non-protein was about seven to one.\u201d\nEasy chemical evolution\nMost resulting oligomers had evenly placed links in the chain, which are used in life, as opposed to non-\u03b1-amine bonded oligomers, which built more irregular chains.\nThe finished products were mostly\ndepsipeptides , which the CCE previously\nestablished as stepping stone products in an easy, reliable pathway to peptides .\nIn another reflection of life chemistry, the abiotic depsipeptide transition to peptides is the same basic reaction (ester-amide) carried out by ribosomes, the cellular machines that make proteins today.\nSurprise reactions, in which potential pre-life chemistry casually falls into place, have happened often in the CCE\u2019s research. They have shored up the center\u2019s core\u00a0hypothesis that most biological polymers formed\u00a0in\u00a0wet and dry cycles, perhaps on rain-swept dirt flats or lakeshore rocks regularly baked by the sun\u2019s heat.\nDespite its grounded simplicity, the premise of everyday wet-dry cycles\u00a0being key to the origin of life is unconventional, challenging a more established narrative that improbable concurrences of cataclysms and multiple ingredients were necessary to produce life\u2019s early materials in rare and volatile events.\nAlso read:\u00a0 The Helix, of DNA Fame, May Have Arisen with Startling Ease\nThese researchers coauthored the study: Jay Haynes, Martin C, Anton Petrov, and Bradley Burcar of Georgia Tech; and Ramanarayanan Krishnamurthy and Luke Leman of Scripps.
