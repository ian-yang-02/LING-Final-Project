Georgia Institute of Technology researchers have invented new ways to interact that provide a little more control. Among their enhancements using LG and Sony watches:\nScrolling through apps running your fingers along the watch band\nLaunching eight smartwatch apps by tapping key points on the watch case (or bezel)\nRejecting phone calls by blowing on the screen or tapping the side of the watch\nEditing dictated text message errors by breathing on the screen\nTransferring on-screen information from the watch to a phone with breaths\nSelecting numbers by tapping the back of your hand\nThe research was presented at several conferences in the fall, most recently in Niagara Falls at the\n2016 ACM International Conference on Interactive Surfaces and Spaces\nin November.\nPh.D. student\nCheng Zhang\noversaw WatchOut, an interaction technique that uses taps and scrolling gestures on the case and watchband, \u201coutside\u201d the watch screen. They\u2019re possible because of the watch\u2019s gyroscope and accelerometer sensors.\n\u201cOther techniques that improve control of smartwatches have included 3D gestures above the screen, bigger screens or adding an extra armband,\u201d Zhang said. \u201cWe wanted to show it could be done with existing technology already common on today\u2019s devices.\u201d\nOne demo app allows wearers to scroll up, down, left and right by swiping on the watchband. According to Zhang it makes it easier to interact with GPS maps or menus. His study showed that scrolling on rubber watchbands was more accurate than leather bands due to the different friction of the materials.\nThey also created an app that creates eight touchpoints on the device\u2019s bezel. Rather than scrolling through a long list of apps, the user simply hits one of eight spots on the case to launch Facebook, for example. Hitting the sides of the watch can also control incoming calls.\n\u201cSmartwatches aren\u2019t very convenient when you\u2019re carrying something,\u201d Zhang said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we wanted to create a technique that allows the user to tap the watch to accept or deny phone calls. Hitting the right side answers the call; the left side ignores it.\u201d\nHands-free control is exactly what the other Georgia Tech team, led by Ph.D. student\nGabriel Reyes , had in mind. One day he watched his wife blow a piece of fuzz off her phone while holding their newborn son. He and a team of students later created Whoosh, a technique that allows a person to control the watch by blowing, exhaling, shushing, sipping or puffing on the screen. The watch uses its microphone and machine learning to identify the breath patterns of each acoustic event, then assigns an action to each.\nFor example, a wearer can shush the watch to ignore a call or blow on it twice to accept. In another scenario, the watch can be locked or unlocked using a correct combination of short or long breaths. Voice recognition sometimes produces incorrect words when dictating a text message. Blowing quickly on the watch can erase words, while blowing on it longer will send the text message when ready. Finally, the technique also works with smartphones. A user can transfer content from the watch to a smartphone simply by sipping it off the watch and puffing it on the phone.\nReyes and his team are excited that they\u2019ve proven the technology works. He says it could have potential for people with disabilities. \u201cThe sip and puff technique has been used to control wheelchairs,\u201d he said. \u201cPerhaps Whoosh could be the foundation for developers looking for ways that allow more control for those who can\u2019t easily interact with their mobile and wearable devices.\u201d\nDingtian Zhang , a Ph.D. student and labmate of Reyes, also designed a 3D-printed case that snaps onto the watch. The attachment has eight holes around the bezel, each with varying lengths. When a wearer blows into each of the holes, unique frequencies are generated much like a flute. The watch\u2019s microphone and the Whoosh system detects the subtle differences in the frequencies produced and identifies the intended target. Each target is linked to a specific action within applications.\nThe final project, TapSkin, allows users to tap on the back of their hand to input numbers 0-9 or commands into the watch. The technique uses the watch\u2019s microphone and inertial sensors to detect a total of 11 different tapping locations on a person\u2019s skin around the watch.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nJason Maderer\nNational Media Relations\nmaderer@gatech.edu\n404-660-2926\nEmail\nmaderer@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
