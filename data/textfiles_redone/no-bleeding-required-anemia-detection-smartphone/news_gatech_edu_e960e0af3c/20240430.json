Instead of a blood test, the app uses photos of someone\u2019s fingernails taken on a smartphone to determine whether the level of hemoglobin in their blood seems low.\nThe researchers published their results on Tuesday, December 4, 2018, in\u00a0 Nature Communications .\n\u201cAll other \u2018point-of-care\u2019 anemia detection tools require external equipment, and represent trade-offs between invasiveness, cost, and accuracy,\u201d said principal investigator Wilbur Lam. \u201cThis is a standalone app that can look at hemoglobin levels\u00a0\u00a0without the need to draw blood.\u201d\nThe app should be used for screening, not clinical diagnosis.\nLam is a clinical hematologist-bioengineer at the Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center of Children\u2019s Healthcare of Atlanta, associate professor of pediatrics at Emory University School of Medicine and a faculty member in the Wallace H. Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering at Georgia Tech.\nThe study's first author was\u00a0Rob Mannino,\u00a0who was motivated to conduct the research by his own experience living with beta-thalassemia, an inherited blood disorder caused by a mutation in the beta-globin gene. Mannino was a graduate research assistant in biomedical engineering who has since graduated.\n\u201cTreatment for my disease requires monthly blood transfusions,\u201d Mannino says. \u201cMy doctors would test my hemoglobin levels more if they could, but it\u2019s a hassle for me to get to the hospital in between transfusions to receive this blood test. Instead, my doctors currently have to just estimate when I\u2019m going to need a transfusion, based on my hemoglobin level trends.\u201d\n\u201cThis whole project couldn\u2019t have been done by anyone but Rob,\u201d Lam says. \u201cHe took pictures of himself before and after transfusions as his hemoglobin levels were changing, which enabled him to constantly refine and tweak his technology on himself in a very efficient manner. So essentially, he was his own perfect initial test subject with each iteration of the app.\u201d\nThe app could facilitate self-management by patients with chronic anemia, allowing them to monitor their disease and to identify the times when they need to adjust their therapies or receive transfusions, the researchers said. That may reduce side effects or complications of having transfusions too early or too late.\nThe technology could be used by anyone at any time and could be especially appropriate for pregnant women, women with abnormal menstrual bleeding, or runners/athletes. Its simplicity means it could be useful in developing countries. Clinical diagnostic tools have strict accuracy requirements, but Mannino and Lam think that with additional research, they can eventually achieve the accuracy needed to replace blood-based anemia testing for clinical diagnosis.\nAnemia is a blood condition that affects two billion people worldwide and can lead to fatigue, paleness and cardiac distress if left untreated. The current gold standard for anemia diagnosis is known as a complete blood count (CBC).\nThe researchers studied fingernail photos and correlated the color of the fingernail beds with hemoglobin levels measured by CBC in 337 people: some healthy, and others with a variety of anemia diagnoses. The algorithm for converting fingernail color to blood hemoglobin level was developed with 237 of these subjects and then tested on 100.\nThe researchers were able to show that a single smartphone image, without personalized calibration, can measure hemoglobin level with an accuracy of 2.4 grams/deciliter with a sensitivity of up to 97 percent. Personalized calibration, tested on four patients over the course of several weeks, can improve the accuracy to 0.92 grams/deciliter, a degree of accuracy on par with point-of-care blood-based hemoglobin tests. Normal values are 13.5-17.5 grams/deciliter for males and 12.0-15.5 grams/deciliter for females.\nIn the app, the use of fingernail beds, which do not contain melanin, means the test can be valid for people with a variety of skin tones. The accuracy is consistent for dark or light skin tones, Mannino says. The app uses image metadata to correct for background brightness and can be adapted to phones from multiple manufacturers.\nMannino and Lam say they are working with a variety of doctors at Children\u2019s and Emory \u2013 geriatric, internal medicine, neonatologists, transfusion medicine, global health \u2013 to obtain additional data and better calibrate their system.\n\u201cThis is just a snapshot of the accuracy right now,\u201d Lam says. \u201cThe algorithm gets smarter with every patient enrolled.\u201d\nThe following researchers co-authored this study: David Myers, Erika Tyburski, G.D. Clifford of Georgia Tech and Emory;\u00a0Jeanne Boudreaux, Christina\nCarusa \u00a0of Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, and Traci Leong of Emory.\nThe research was supported by the National Science Foundation (Graduate Research Fellowship DGE-1650044 and Southeastern Nanotechnology Infrastructure Corridor 1542174), the 2017 Massachusetts General Hospital Primary Care Technology Prize, and National Institutes of Health (R21 EB025646). \u00a0 The smartphone anemia app is projected to be available commercially for public download as soon as Spring of 2019. \u00a0 A patent application has been filed for the anemia app, and Wilbur Lam and Rob Mannino have a financial interest in the success of this product.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nHolly Korschun, Emory University communications\n404-727-3990 hkorsch@emory.edu\nEmail\nhkorsch@emory.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
