Stories can be submitted\nhere\nand will be used to help MHSC get a better picture of students\u2019 problems and the resources, if any, they\u2019ve used to help alleviate them.\nWhile the submissions will be collected privately, students can choose whether they\u2019d like their story to be shared with a larger audience. MHSC will select six to eight of those stories to present at an event in late March, called GT CARES 4U.\nThe event was created in a partnership among MHSC, the Counseling Center, and Health Initiatives to encourage listeners to seek help for themselves or others. Any student is welcome to submit their story for GT CARES 4U, regardless of whether they have used on-campus mental health resources.\n\u201cIt\u2019s so important that we as a community start speaking more openly about mental health experiences we\u2019re going through,\u201d said Sophia Martin, director of MHSC. \u201cIt can help others realize that they\u2019re not alone in facing their own hardships, and I hope this event will inspire others to seek help and explore the new resources Georgia Tech has provided for us.\u201d\nMHSC is asking that potential speakers refrain from using graphic language or imagery, as those listening may be struggling with their mental health and could be triggered by sensitive content. Submissions are open through Wednesday, Feb. 24; the selected speakers will be contacted by March 5.\nAny student currently facing mental health issues can take advantage of on-campus resources, including the\nnewly expanded\nCounseling Center.
