Buzz Buddies, a new student organization that builds\u00a0mentorship programs between Georgia Tech students and those in nearby public schools, is partnering with Boyd Elementary School in Atlanta to deliver books for its students and encourage literacy.\nThe book drive will culminate in Ramblin\u2019 Reading Day, where members of Buzz Buddies will be interacting with Boyd students throughout the day. The event will start with Buzz Buddies greeting Boyd students when they get off the buses. They\u2019ll be waiting with tables of books organized by grade level, and each student will be able to grab a book to take home and keep. Later in the day, Buzz Buddies will visit all 26 classrooms at Boyd virtually to read to the students.\nWhile only those interested in joining Buzz Buddies will be participating in the Ramblin\u2019 Reading Day event, anyone can get involved on their own by donating books to Boyd via this\nAmazon wishlist . Requested books range from\nOh, the Places You\u2019ll Go!\nto the\nDiary of a Wimpy Kid\nseries.\n\u201cIt\u2019s our hope that Boyd students will have the physical materials that help promote reading proficiency, are empowered by the ownership of their own book, and are able to envision themselves at Georgia Tech one day,\u201d said Chandler Woods, co-founder and president of Buzz Buddies. \u201cAs for Georgia Tech, we hope to encourage students, faculty, and staff to get involved in the education communities around us, as well as recruit members for Buzz Buddies.\u201d\nLearn more about Ramblin\u2019 Reading Day and how to get involved\nhere .\nAdditional Images\nContact\nGrace Wyner\nInstitute Communications\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
