Recently, there has been an uptick in cases, reflecting what is happening across the country. While a majority of the cases on campus are student-related, employees have tested positive as well.\nThe coronavirus can affect anyone, which is why it is so important that we remain vigilant \u00adabout wearing face coverings, washing hands, testing weekly, and keeping an appropriate distance \u2013 even when gathering in small and familiar groups. While we have focused on students\nstaying safe as they return home\nto complete the fall semester, much of this advice applies to employees who will also want to gather with friends and family for the holidays.\nA few helpful reminders before and during the break:\nTake advantage of the FREE asymptomatic surveillance testing before the break.\nTesting Locations and Hours .\nTraveling may increase the risk of getting and spreading Covid-19. If you are traveling for the break, do not travel if:\nYou are sick or experiencing a fever, cough, or shortness of breath.\nYou test positive for Covid-19 within 10 days prior to travel.\nYou have close contact with someone who has Covid-19.\nBefore traveling, familiarize yourself with the public health guidelines or mandates in the location(s) you\u2019ll be visiting. In addition, Georgia Tech researchers have developed a tool that can help estimate the potential risk of exposure involved with a trip.

Georgia Tech\u2019s surveillance testing is not a diagnostic test. Visit\nTesting Locations and Hours\nfor information on types of testing and how to obtain one.\nIf driving, bring face coverings and hand sanitizer for stops at gas stations and rest areas.\nIf staying home, the\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention\noffers guidance on protecting yourself and others during the Thanksgiving break.\nWhile you are away from campus, continue to follow health and safety measures \u2014 including the\ndaily self-checklist , social distancing, proper hygiene, and wearing a face covering.\nIf you are experiencing Covid-19 symptoms or have been exposed to someone who has tested positive, the\nCovid-19 decision tree\nwill help guide you through what steps to take next.\nStay vigilant before and during the holidays. Don\u2019t just do it for yourself \u2014 do it for your loved ones.\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nCovid-19 Testing Locations and Hours\nTech Moving Forward\nContact\nRachael Pocklington\nInstitute Communications\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
