To achieve this, Sun and Choi use a recurrent neural network (RNN) to model temporal relations among events in electronic health records.\nTemporal relationships communicate the ordering of events or states in time. This type of relation is traditionally used in natural language processing. However, Choi saw a new opportunity to leverage the power of RNNs.\n\u201cI studied deep learning and I was wondering if RNNs could be introduced into health care. It is a very popular model for processing sequences\u00a0and is traditionally used for translation,\u201d said Choi.\nBy utilizing RNN, this algorithm can anticipate early stages of heart failure, which will ultimately lead to better preventative care for patients at risk of heart disease.\n\u201cMachine learning is being used in every aspect of health care. From diagnosis and treatments to recommendations for patient care after surgeries. This particular model is focused on deep learning, which has had great success in many industries. However, in health care, we are on the front of pioneering deep learning and Edward is one of the first ones to apply it,\u201d said Sun.\nAccording to the\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention , heart failure effects 5.7 million adults in the United States, and half of those who develop heart failure die within 5 years of diagnosis costing the nation an estimated $30.7 billion each year. Choi\u2019s findings stand to provide relief to millions of Americans each year by allowing doctors and patients to have early intervention of the disease.\n\u201cThis is a preliminary work, it showed potential that it can do better than classical models \u2013 it makes a good promise for how deep learning can make a positive impact in the health care industry,\u201d said Choi.\nThe paper was covered by\nScientific American \u00a0and\u00a0 Kaiser Health News , along with several other works on machine learning for health, including articles from Google and MIT.\nAdditional Images\nEmail\nkristen.perez@cc.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
