But for other disabilities, such as cognitive disabilities, features are less common, and sales representatives are often less knowledgeable about those that do exist.\u201d\nBattery life is particularly an issue for people who are deaf, the researchers note. They often rely on brightly lit, battery-draining phone screens to communicate using sign language or text. Lack of WEA support can be a serious safety issue by itself. But phones that lack such support also frequently lack other up-to-date accessibility features, said\u00a0Research Scientist\u00a0 Salimah LaForce , who wrote the\u00a0 report \u00a0(pdf) with CACP Research Associate Dara Bright.\nCACP\u2019s Research Goes to the FCC\nCACP conducts the biennial review for submission to the FCC as part of the federal agency\u2019s mandated review of tech accessibility under the Twenty-First Century Communication and Video Accessibility Act (CVAA) of 2010. The Center may be the only objective, university-based research organization to broadly review cell phone accessibility across a range of disabilities and report its findings to the FCC, LaForce said. The work helps influence regulatory policy and ultimately may help lead to broader adoption of features that benefit people with disabilities \u2014 and those without them. It\u2019s work that fits squarely into Georgia Tech\u2019s focus of making a positive impact on people\u2019s lives.\nFor their most recent review, researchers looked for 54 accessibility features on 153 phones and found that:\nMore than 95% of reviewed phones evaluated had headphone jacks, Bluetooth, speaker capabilities, GPS, adjustable font, and alternative biometrics to unlock phones.\nFewer than one-third of the phones had accessibility features such as a physical keyboard, Braille display support, audible clues, or eye tracking. Four in ten had easily replaceable batteries.\nWhile features such as real-time text, car connectivity, and simple displays increased by 49 percentage points or more among reviewed models, the presence of configurable audio and two-way video fell since CACP\u2019s 2020 review.\nPhones provided under the government-subsidized Lifeline program also showed improved accessibility across a range of features, including screen magnifiers, simple displays, car connectivity, and Braille access.\nWEA Support a Predictor of Accessibility\nThe survey found that more and more cell phones \u2014 92% in the most recent review \u2014 can receive Wireless Emergency Alert (WEA) messages. That\u2019s an increase of 18% from 2020. WEA access is an essential capability in its own right, helping keep users safe when severe weather or other disasters strike. But, according to researchers, it\u2019s also a key predictor for other accessibility features. That\u2019s likely because WEA-capable phones are often newer models, LaForce says.\nAnd while most phones now offer the most up-to-date WEA 3.0 standard, many of those that only support earlier WEA versions \u2014 with their shorter messages, fewer supported languages, and less precise geo-targeting \u2014 are subsidized Lifeline phones. According to the report, this inequity can hit people with disabilities especially hard as they often rely on the subsidized phones and services.\nThe review also identified emerging accessibility issues on the road, citing potential issues with disabled motorists attempting to access the plethora of mobile-phone-powered services cell and auto manufacturers are jointly building into cars.\n\u201cSystems that require motorists to push buttons or perform other physical tasks to connect their phone to their car are not accessible,\u201d LaForce said.\nMore Transparency Needed\nAnother significant issue is lack of transparency, said Bright. Few cell phones come with manuals anymore, and there\u2019s little standardization among phone makers when it comes to giving names to features or describing how they work.\n\u201cUsers shouldn\u2019t have to dig or rely on secondary sources to find this information, which is crucial for people with disabilities trying to find a phone that meets their needs,\u201d Bright said. \u201cThis is something we strongly urge the FCC to address.\u201d\nUltimately, LaForce and Bright see the issue as one of civil rights.\n\u201cWhen I came into this space, that became very apparent to me,\u201d LaForce said. \u201cHaving accessible communications matters. It matters in their work. It matters in their education. It matters in their safety. And it matters in their daily lives, being able to get things done and keep in touch with those they care about.\u201d\nVisit CACP\u2019s\nwebsite\nto learn more about the Center\u2019s inclusive approach to technology design.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nMichael Pearson\nIvan Allen College of Liberal Arts\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
