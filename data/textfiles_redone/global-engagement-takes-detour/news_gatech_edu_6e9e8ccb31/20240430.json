So when international travel was halted last spring because of the coronavirus pandemic, the Office of International Education (OIE) had to alter its itinerary.\n\u201cSince March we have had to cancel programs involving international travel because of Covid-19 travel restrictions,\u201d said Lorie P\u00e1ulez, director of Education Abroad in OIE. \u201cBut just because students aren\u2019t going abroad doesn\u2019t mean that interest in study abroad or international education has declined. International mobility of students is frozen, but there is still extreme interest.\u201d\nP\u00e1ulez and her colleagues, facing travel restrictions abroad and new health and safety procedures at home, had to find new ways for students to explore global engagement. This year they held a virtual Study Abroad Fair using Gatherly, a video chat platform created by Georgia Tech students through CREATE-X.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want a generation of students to graduate with no global engagement. That is so important to Tech,\u201d P\u00e1ulez said. \u201cWe\u2019re rolling out a new program called Global at Home. It will be cohort-based, like a study abroad program, with global learning outcomes as a key component. Right now this is in lieu of study abroad.\u201d\nStudy abroad program directors in the School of Modern Languages have proposed Spanish language cohorts with virtual cultural and industry visits. The College of Design, which usually takes students to Europe, has pivoted to a US-based program. They will take students on Amtrak along the East Coast, studying the European influence on architectural styles in Washington, DC, Boston, New York, St. Augustine, and Miami.\nFor students pursuing the International Plan degree designation, the committee governing the designation is being as flexible as possible with student requirements, while preserving the integrity of the program.\nGlobal Education on Campus\nThe 21st annual International Education Week is Nov. 16 \u2013 20, with multiple\nevents on campus\nincluding a scavenger hunt on Wednesday, Nov. 18 at 5:30 p.m. The hunt, using the Scavify app, will be in person, outdoors, open to Georgia Tech students, and following Covid-19 safety precautions. Questions will test students\u2019 knowledge on trivia related to global themes and Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) on campus.\nAs part of International Education Week, students from the Global Leadership Living Learning Community will compete in an online SDG showcase where they will present a solution geared to advance a particular SDG in a community they have selected around the world. There also will be an event with President Cabrera called \u201cCharla con Cabrera\u201d (or Chat with Cabrera). Students will ask the president questions during the 30-minute event, which will be shown virtually with a limited number of in-person participants. Participants may\nregister to watch online\nvia BlueJeans.\n\u201cThrough our living learning communities we continue to have in-person events weekly,\u201d said Allison Noffsinger, associate director of On-Campus Internationalization in OIE. \u201cWe have done everything we can to get students together in a safe way because they are really benefiting from personal interaction. They\u2019re craving it.\u201d\nIn August Noffsinger and her colleagues taped numbers on the classroom floor to indicate physical distancing. Between events they spray the area and use sanitizer to wipe surfaces.\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to give the students normalcy,\u201d Noffsinger said. \u201cWe usually take the students in buses all over Atlanta and sometimes out of state. We can\u2019t do that now, but there are other things we can do.\u201d\nNoffsinger and her OIE colleagues recently took students from the Global Leadership Living Learning Community walking on the Atlanta BeltLine with a list of places of interest along the path.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lot more work to plan events now because of safety concerns, but we\u2019re carrying on,\u201d she said.\nCreativity and Resilience\nOIE begins recruiting a year in advance for international programs.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a long process before we get them out the door,\u201d said P\u00e1ulez. \u201cIt has been challenging to have virtual events. But we have been able to reach a lot of students and talk to them about opportunities. We\u2019re currently reviewing program proposals for summer 2021.\u201d\nPrograms are being proposed with Covid-19 in mind, addressing the concerns created by the pandemic. For students who can\u2019t travel, OIE is exploring virtual opportunities.\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking for different ways to get students engaged, P\u00e1ulez said. \u201cWe have continued our recruiting. I hope we can get back to full mobility. We\u2019re preparing for when that happens because students are ready to go.\u201d\nOIE has also been supporting international students. OIE\u2019s International Student and Scholar Services has been collaborating with Education Abroad to help international students who are stuck at home because of visa issues. Students who were planning to do an international internship can still register for the Global Internship course and continue with their academic progression.\nBecause of travel restrictions, many of Tech\u2019s international first-years were not able to get their visas to enter the US. But they were able to start their time at Georgia Tech at the Georgia Tech-Lorraine and Georgia Tech-Shenzhen campuses.\n\u201cThat was a great way to welcome students who would have had to sit out for a semester,\u201d P\u00e1ulez said, acknowledging the unorthodox start.\n\u201cI have been touched and impressed by the entire Georgia Tech community and the efforts put forth to help students find ways to meet their goals personally and academically and not get delayed at graduation,\u201d P\u00e1ulez said. \u201cThe creativity and resilience shined through in ways that I would not have imagined under normal circumstances. I am encouraged by the fact that people are working hard to accomplish goals in the face of this crisis, which has made everything more difficult \u2014 studying, delivering classes, and being an administrator. I have been very impressed by everyone\u2019s ability to get things done with all of the challenges we\u2019re facing.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nOffice of International Education\nInternatiional Education Week Events\nContact\nVictor Rogers\nInstitute Communications\nEmail\nvictor.rogers@comm.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
