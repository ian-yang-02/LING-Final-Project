Imagine rows and rows of strength testing machines from a carnival, but very tiny. A platelet is\u00a0capable of exerting forces that are several times larger, in relation to its\u00a0size, than a\u00a0muscle cells.\nAfter a blood clot forms, it contracts, promoting wound closure and restoration of normal blood flow. This process can be deficient in a variety of blood clotting disorders. Previously, it was difficult to measure an individual platelet\u2019s contributions to contraction, because clots\u2019 various components got in the way.\nThe prototype diagnostic tools were\u00a0 described in Nature Materials \u00a0in a\u00a0paper published on Monday, October 10, 2016. The research was supported with funding from the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute and the National Science Foundation.\n\"We discovered that platelets from some patients with bleeding disorders are \u2018wimpier\u2019 than platelets from healthy people,\" says\nWilbur Lam, an assistant professor\nin the Department of\nPediatrics at Emory University School of Medicine\nand in the\nWallace H. Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering at Georgia Tech and Emory University . \"Our device may function as a new physics-based method to test for bleeding disorders, complementary to current methods.\"\nThe first author of the paper is\u00a0 David Myers, an instructor at Emory's medical school . Lam is also a physician in the Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Children\u2019s Healthcare of Atlanta.\nThe scientists infer how strong or wimpy someone\u2019s platelets are by measuring how far the protein dots move, taking a picture of the rows of dots, and then analyzing the picture on a computer.\nThe dots are made of fibrinogen, a sticky protein that is the precursor for fibrin, which forms a mesh of insoluble strands in a blood clot.\nIn addition to detecting problems with platelet contraction in patients with known inherited disorders such as Wiskott Aldrich syndrome, Myers, Lam and colleagues could also see differences in some patients who had bleeding symptoms, but who performed normally on standard diagnostic tests.\nThe researchers also used chemical tools to dissect the process of platelet contraction. They showed that inhibitors of Rho/ROCK enzymes shut down platelet contraction, but inhibitors of a related pathway, MLCK (myosin light chain kinase), did not. Individual platelet contraction could become an assay for development or refinement of blood thinning drugs, Lam says.\nYongzhi Qiu, Meredith Fay, Yumiko Sakurai, Jong Baek, Reginald Tran, Jordan C.
