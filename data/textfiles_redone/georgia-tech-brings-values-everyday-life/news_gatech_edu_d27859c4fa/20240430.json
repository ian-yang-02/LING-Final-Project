GT) will help the entire community bring our values to life in tangible ways that allow us to fulfill the objectives of the strategic plan.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nEmail\nFeb 03, 2021\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nLast fall, Georgia Tech introduced a new\n10-year strategic plan , grounded in a new mission statement and\nnine strategic values . In his annual Institute Address, President \u00c1ngel Cabrera said, \u201cThe mission and the values are not just words on paper. They describe who we are and who we aspire to be every day.\u201d\nFor the new year, Georgia Tech will seek to advance our values with a new campaign called Living Our Values Every Day (L.O.V.E. GT). The objective is to help the entire community bring our values to life in tangible ways that allow us to fulfill the objectives we set forth in the strategic plan. Regardless of a person\u2019s role\n\u2014\nstudent, faculty, staff, alumni, or affiliate\n\u2014\nall of us can contribute by serving as examples of our values in our interactions with one another and with the communities we serve.\n\u201cWhen we were creating the strategic plan we held appreciative inquiry sessions and found there is so much pride in being connected with Georgia Tech across all the job spectrums from the administrative support staff to the landscaping staff to faculty,\u201d said Sonia Alvarez-Robinson, executive director of Georgia Tech Strategic Consulting. \u201cOur love for Georgia Tech is what will bring us together. Even where we have ideological differences, we have to find common agreement on how we live our values as an organization every day.\u201d\nTo accomplish the ambitious goals of the strategic plan, having a campus culture that supports Institute values will be critical.\n\u201cWe pay attention to the things that are rewarded,\u201d Alvarez-Robinson said. \u201cSo, it\u2019s important to establish and accept the standards for behaviors and practices in our community. And in order for the values to really be part of the fabric of the Institute, we have to hardwire them into our jobs.\u201d\nValues-Based Goal Setting\nAs employees prepare to set their goals for this year, Georgia Tech Human Resources (GTHR) and its strategic partners will support employees with incorporating the shared commitment to Georgia Tech\u2019s mission. One example: GTHR has developed a values-based goal setting template that includes Tech\u2019s nine strategic values.\nThis is a change from how employees previously set their goals. The new template includes details on the difference between expectations and goals, examples of creating values-based S.M.A.R.T. (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-based) goals, and the responsibilities of both employee and supervisor in the process.\nA values-based goal states two things: 1)\nwhat\nwe will focus on during the coming year and 2)\nhow\nwe will get the work done. Here is an example of this new goal setting: Organize and manage the portfolio of Institute initiatives to advance the Institute Strategic Plan by using a collaborative\n[We celebrate collaboration] , inclusive\n[We thrive on diversity] , and student-centered approach\n[Students are our top priority]\nthat leverages the use of Smartsheets technology\n[We champion innovation]\nto track progress of reliable data points from January 1, 2021, through December 31, 2021\n[We strive for excellence].\nFor the 2020 review period, employees will use the same performance appraisal template. However, as we continue to work in a pandemic environment, GTHR wants to ensure easy access to our performance management forms for those who may be working remotely. As such, the performance appraisal form is currently available on-line and is in a new Docusign format. The new values-based goal setting template form will also be placed in a Docusign format.\nTo account for this new standard, GTHR has updated the performance appraisal process for 2020 with new deadlines.
