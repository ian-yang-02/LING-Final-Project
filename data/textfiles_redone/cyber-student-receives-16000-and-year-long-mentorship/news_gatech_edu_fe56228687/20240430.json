Ramanathan is pursuing a Master of Science in Cybersecurity (MS Cybersecurity) at the\u00a0 School of Cybersecurity and Privacy \u00a0(SCP) at Georgia Tech.\n\u201cI am extremely elated by these awards,\u201d she said. \u201cI owe this to my parents and professors. They have been extremely supportive throughout my time at Georgia Tech.\u201d\nRecipients of the Women in Cybersecurity Scholarship are handpicked by FS-ISAC from a pool of international candidates. Winners receive a $10,000 award along with a pass to attend the organization\u2019s annual summit in Colorado and a one-year mentorship with Bank of America.\nRamanathan first learned about the scholarship opportunity in her Information Security Policies class taught by SCP Professor\u00a0 Peter Swire . The master\u2019s student said Swire was among the first she reached out to when she received the news about winning the award.\n\u201cI am delighted that Georgia Tech helped prepare Subhiksha for winning this prestigious scholarship,\u201d said Swire.\nWhen Ramanathan isn\u2019t in class or studying, she works with Georgia Tech faculty as a teaching or research assistant. She has worked extensively on research projects involving a confluence of cybersecurity and machine learning. She has worked on automated topic modeling of global cybersecurity strategies with\u00a0 Nadiya Kostyuk , assistant professor in SCP and the\u00a0 School of Public Policy \u00a0(SPP). She has also assisted Research Scientist\u00a0 Maria Konte , by working on a network traffic anomaly analysis using machine learning.\nNow, Ramanathan works with\u00a0 Jon Lindsay , SCP associate professor jointly appointed with the\u00a0 Sam Nunn School of International Affairs , where she is focusing on the geopolitical arena of cybersecurity.\nAs a recipient of the Karishma Babu and Vijay Balasubramaniyan Endowment Fund, Ramanathan will receive a one-time fellowship award of $6,000. Managed by the\u00a0 Georgia Tech Foundation , the fund supports graduate students from India.\nThe endowment was created thanks to a donation by Georgia Tech alumni\u00a0 Karishma Babu \u00a0(MS ECE 09) and her husband\u00a0 Vijay Balasubramaniyan \u00a0(Ph.D. CS 11). Ramanathan was nominated for the award by SCP Professor\u00a0 Mustaque Ahamad , who advised Balasubramaniyan when he was pursuing his degree at Georgia Tech.\n\u201cIt is wonderful that a current MS Cybersecurity student is chosen for a fellowship that has been established by a graduate of our MS Cybersecurity program and his wife,\u201d said Ahamad.\n\u201cSubhiksha is a great choice for this fellowship because she is an outstanding student and her interests and expertise cover both technology and policy areas of cybersecurity.\u201d\nWith two awards under her belt, Ramanathan is preparing for her final semester at Georgia Tech. After she graduates next May, she wants to land a position at a top-tier financial institution as a comprehensive cloud security engineer. Regardless of the role, she wants to use the machine learning and cybersecurity techniques she learned at Georgia Tech and SCP to help with fraud detection and battling cyber threats.\n\u201cIt feels good to almost be done,\u201d said Ramanathan. \u201cBut I will miss Georgia Tech and SCP, it has been my entire life while I have been here.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nContact\nJohn Popham\nCommunications Officer at the School of Cybersecurity and Privacy\nEmail\njpopham3@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
