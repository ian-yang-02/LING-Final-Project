An event held recently in southern California could mark the beginning of a new chapter in this form of aerial combat.\nIn what may have been the first aerial encounter of its kind, researchers from the\nGeorgia Tech Research Institute\nand Naval Postgraduate School recently pitted two swarms of autonomous aircraft against one another over a military test facility. While the friendly encounter may not have qualified as an old-fashioned dogfight, it provided the first example of a live engagement between two swarms of unmanned air vehicles (UAVs), and allowed the two teams to demonstrate different combat tactics in flight.\n\u201cThe ability to engage a swarm of threat UAVs with another autonomous swarm is an area of critical research for defense applications,\u201d said Don Davis, division chief of the Robotics and Autonomous Systems Branch of the Georgia Tech Research Institute. \u201cThis experiment demonstrated the advances made in collaborative autonomy and the ability of a team of unmanned vehicles to execute complex missions. This encounter will serve to advance and inform future efforts in developing autonomous vehicle capabilities.\u201d\nEach team launched ten small propeller-driven Zephyr aircraft, though two of the aircraft experienced technical issues at launch and were unable to compete, resulting in a 10 versus 8 competition. Although the UAVs were physically identical, their computers used different autonomy logic, collaboration approaches, and communications software developed by the two institutions. GPS tracking allowed each aircraft to know the location of the others for this demonstration. In the future, this information will be provided by on-board cameras, radars, and other sensors and payloads.\nEach aircraft used a single-board mission computer, and for this demonstration, an open-source autopilot maintained flight control. The aircraft also had Wi-Fi systems that allowed them to communicate with other aircraft and with a ground station.\n\u201cBoth teams were trying to solve the same problem of flying a large swarm in a meaningful mission, and we came up with solutions that were similar in some ways and different in others,\u201d said Charles Pippin, a senior research scientist at the Georgia Tech Research Institute. \u201cBy comparing how well each approach worked in the air, we were able to compare strategies and tactics on platforms capable of the same flight dynamics.\u201d\nThe foam-wing aircraft couldn\u2019t actually shoot at one another, so a ground computer determined when an aircraft would have been in a position to attack another aircraft. The swarm teams flew three different sorties to compare different algorithms. The event took place February 9, 2017 at Camp Roberts, a California National Guard facility in Monterey County, Calif.\nThe two institutions have been working together since 2015 on issues involving collaborative autonomy \u2013 the ability of autonomous vehicles to work together to accomplish a given task. The Georgia Tech researchers have been using aircraft known as Skywalkers that are similar to the Zephyrs used by the Naval Postgraduate School.\n\u201cThis was a very successful test,\u201d said Davis. \u201cIt gave us, as far as I know, the first actual experimentation of flying two autonomous swarms of UAVs against one another with no human control, other than sending high level commands or sending a message to engage. We were really trying to understand how different autonomy tactics work against other autonomy tactics.\u201d\nFor each UAV, the autonomy algorithms were fully in control of the aircraft, but a safety pilot stood by to take control of any aircraft if necessary. \u00a0The autopilots also had built in safety constraints, such as airspace boundaries and ranges.\nSuch aerial demonstrations are the third step in the process that the Georgia Tech team uses to test its autonomy systems, Pippin said. As a first step, tactics are rapidly tested on a simulator that runs 30 times faster than real time. Next, promising approaches are tested on a full software stack that includes a high-resolution simulation.\n\u201cWe run hardware-in-the-loop simulations where we have the actual algorithms running on the hardware we fly,\u201d said Pippin. \u201cThe full software stack includes the autonomy logic, communications systems, collaboration algorithms and other software that is then inserted directly into the actual aircraft. In the third step, the tactics are flown on the aircraft on test ranges. In this case, we used the Zephrys and flew the swarms at Camp Roberts.\u201d\nThe Georgia Tech researchers are using machine learning to help their autonomy system optimize performance and recognize under which circumstances a particular tactic may be advantageous.\n\u201cRight now, we\u2019re more interested in the research questions about autonomous coordination among the vehicles and the tactical behavior of the groups of vehicles,\u201d Pippin explained. \u201cWe are focusing our efforts on how these vehicles cooperate and want to understand what it means for them to operate as a team.\u201d\nDogfighting tactics have advanced dramatically since the World War I, but the advent of UAV swarms may bring a brand new set of challenges. Unmanned vehicles have freedom to dive, bank, and climb at rates human pilots cannot tolerate. But the real advantage may be in computing power that could track dozens of adversaries \u2013 far more than any human pilot could do \u2013 and develop new ways to address challenges.\n\u201cAutonomous techniques using machine learning may identify new tactics that a human would never think of,\u201d added Davis. \u201cHumans tend to base their techniques on tactics that manned fighters have used in the past. These autonomous aircraft may invoke new strategies.\u201d\nIn addition those already named, the Georgia Tech Research Institute team that supported the swarm demonstration included Michael Day, Kevin DeMarco, David Jensen, Rick Presley, and Evan Hammac. Others supporting the project included Michael Matthews, Eric Squires, Rob Bever, Ethan\u00a0Trewhitt, and students Laura Strickland, Avery Leonard, Natalie Rakoski, and Jeremy Feltracco.\nResearch News\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\n177 North Avenue\nAtlanta, Georgia \u00a030332-0181 \u00a0USA\nMedia Relations Contacts : John Toon (404-894-6986) (jtoon@gatech.edu) or Ben Brumfield (404-385-1933) (ben.brumfield@comm.gatech.edu).\nWriter : John Toon\nAdditional Images\nContact\nJohn Toon\nResearch News\n(404) 894-6986\nEmail\njtoon@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
