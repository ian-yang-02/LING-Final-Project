Cyrus was also one of the dozens of dancers wearing tennis ball-green costumes. Beyonc\u00e9 was performing her Oscar-nominated original song Be Alive from the movie soundtrack of King Richard, a biography of Richard Williams, father of Grand Slam tennis champions Venus and Serena Williams.\n\"I'm just so grateful,\" Brown posted on her Instagram account referring to being part of the performance. Speaking of Instagram, Raianna is standing just to the left of Beyonc\u00e9 in the artist's official post of the performance\u2013an Instagram photo that has received more than 3 million likes.\nIt isn't the first time Brown has danced on a national stage though. In 2020, she danced alongside\nShakira and Jennifer Lopez in the Super Bowl LIV halftime show .\nBut she says this is her first performance in Los Angeles and her first chance to dance at an awards show. Brown earned her degree from Georgia Tech in industrial engineering and has continued working as the lead software developer for consulting firm CMB Global Partners \u2014 while advancing her dancing career as well.\nCyrus, also prominently part of the elaborate choreography sequence that kicked off the Oscars, was a dancer at Georgia Tech, too, as well as Ms. Georgia Tech in 2010. She earned her degree in civil engineering. After working in the corporate world for several years, she pivoted to become a professional dancer and has performed with Mandy Moore, LL Cool J, and Pharrell Williams, and has been seen on Netflix, NBC's The Voice, and the American Music Awards. Like Brown, Cyrus has also performed at the Super Bowl halftime show; she did it this year with Mary J. Blige.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nSteven Norris\nInstitute Communications\nEmail\nsnorris@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
