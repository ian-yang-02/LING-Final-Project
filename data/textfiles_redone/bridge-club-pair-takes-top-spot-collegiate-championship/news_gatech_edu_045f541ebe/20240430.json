The Collegiate Pairs Championship is one of two national collegiate tournaments organized annually by the American Contract Bridge League (ACBL), the premier bridge organization in North America.\n\u201cI was very excited to finally represent our school in a sport I\u2019ve been playing semi-professionally,\u201d said Zhu. \u201cWe were in position to win after the first session, so I made sure to think through and play every hand slowly the second session. Winning felt great but I\u2019m prouder of what our program has accomplished.\u201d\nThe primary mission of the Bridge Club at Georgia Tech is to promote the game of bridge to Tech students. Many come to club meetings because they offer an opportunity to take their minds off their studies and play cards in a friendly, relaxed atmosphere. Others enjoy playing bridge as a competitive game and are eager to hone their skills and test them against other players. The Bridge Club welcomes both types of players, as well as anyone who would like to learn the game.\nBridge Club members also play against teams from other colleges, both in person and online. In February, the Bridge Club organized an informal collegiate tournament on the Georgia Tech campus, in which 11 teams from four different schools took part. The club is planning to hold a similar event in February 2023, along with online matches through the ACBL.\nCyrus Hettle, senior executive officer for the Bridge Club, encourages any student who is interested to come to a meeting.\n\u201cMost of our players learned the game in college and have been playing for a few years,\u201d he said. \u201cTwo of our players who competed in Providence have only been playing for about a year.\u201d\nLearn more about the club on its\nEngage page , or stop by their table at the\nFall Student Organizations Fair this\nweek.
