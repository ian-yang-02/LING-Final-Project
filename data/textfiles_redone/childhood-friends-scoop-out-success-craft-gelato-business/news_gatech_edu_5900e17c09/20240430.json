Smith, Ballard, and Jones are the December Faces of Manufacturing, program developed by the Georgia Manufacturing Extension Partnership (GaMEP) at Georgia Tech to honor people who work in or are affected by manufacturing in Georgia.\nDec 11, 2015\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nDecadence never tasted oh so good. And for three friends who went into business together to create Honeysuckle Gelato, a craft gelato business based in Atlanta, 2015 has turned out to be the sweetest year yet. The trio, Khatera Ballard, Wes Jones, and Jackson Smith, founded the company in 2011 and sold the gelato \u2014 an Italian-style ice cream \u2014 via a food truck and through direct small-batch manufacturing sales to local Atlanta chefs and restaurateurs. \u201cFrom the beginning, we have had a very specific goal of being the Southeast\u2019s major regional gelato brand,\u201d said Ballard, who met Jones and Smith when she married one of their friends. That goal includes creating more than 250 flavor combinations and sourcing most of its ingredients, including all of its dairy, from Georgia farmers. Honeysuckle Gelato\u2019s focused strategy appears to have paid off for the three business partners, who are the Georgia Manufacturing Extension Partnership\u2019s (GaMEP) December Faces of Manufacturing. Georgia\u2019s manufacturing industry is a critical component of the state\u2019s economy. The Faces of Manufacturing series shows how the 365,000 Georgians who work in the industry \u2014 including more than 53,000 in food manufacturing \u2014 help their communities stay economically strong and viable. Honeysuckle Gelato\u2019s products are now found in more than 100 restaurants and 85 retail outlets across the Southeast, including a regional deal with Whole Foods. Just this year, the company inked a deal with Delta Air Lines, which now offers Honeysuckle Gelato to first class passengers on some cross-country flights. \u201cOn July 7, on an Atlanta to Los Angeles flight, Honeysuckle Gelato made its debut,\u201d Smith explained. Starting a business was a longtime dream for Smith and Jones, who have been friends since the second grade. After college, Smith spent two years teaching in China but then moved to New York City in 2010 and began working as a tutor under the No Child Left Behind program. He searched for a permanent job, eventually landing an ice cream production manager position under Jon Snyder, a local gelato legend in New York. Eventually, he moved back to Atlanta and began experimenting with making gelato in his parents\u2019 kitchen. That led to discussions with Jones, and eventually Ballard, who relocated to Atlanta from Tulsa, Oklahoma, to found the company. In coming up with the company\u2019s name, Smith, the creator behind the flavors, said the idea was to highlight a sweet and fresh sense of nostalgia and give a nod to its roots as a business based in the South. The Delta agreement, plus the company\u2019s opening of a retail shop in Atlanta\u2019s Ponce City Market, doubled their manufacturing output this year. Additionally, Jones said, \u201cThese two opportunities allowed us to add two new full-time jobs to our team and several new hourly-based employees.\u201d The company has a total staff of 18.
