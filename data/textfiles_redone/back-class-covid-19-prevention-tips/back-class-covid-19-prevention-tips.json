Here are some tips on how you can protect yourself.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nEmail\nStamps Health Services is located&nbsp;within the Joseph Brown Whitehead Building on the Georgia Tech campus.&nbsp;\nAug 18, 2023\nCovid-19 cases are rising nationwide. Although the community levels in\nFulton County remain low , Dr. Benjamin Holton, senior director of Stamps Health Services, wouldn't be surprised if cases rise when people start gathering around our campus community in the next few weeks.\n\"We've seen a spike at the start of each semester since Covid-19 began. People come together and bring viruses with them. There's a lot of commingling, and it spreads from person to person, so we typically see a bump at the beginning of the semester. So far, that dissipates relatively quickly,\u201d he said.\nAs the semester begins, his recommendations for all students include:\nMake sure you\u2019re up to date on vaccinations .\nGet tested \u00a0if you have\u00a0 Covid-19 symptoms .\nIf exposed, follow\nrecommendations .\nStay home when you\u2019re sick.\nBecause Covid-19 can mimic a common cold or a variety of other illnesses, Holton specifically highlighted the importance of the guidance to stay home if you are experiencing a cough, sore throat, fever, runny nose, or other symptoms.\n\"That is one of the most important things we can do to prevent the spread of Covid-19 and other respiratory illnesses like the flu,\u201d he said. \u201cIsolating gives your body time to reduce your viral load enough to ensure you're not spreading the virus to those around you, and that's a key part of interrupting the transmission chain.\u201d\nCurrent CDC guidelines\ninclude a five-day isolation period for those with mild illness and a 10-day period for those who experience moderate symptoms, including shortness of breath or difficulty breathing.\nHolton stressed that those who are immunocompromised should wear a mask and take additional precautions to avoid exposure to Covid-19 and other respiratory illnesses. While the federal Covid-19 public health emergency ended in May, Holton suggests that the virus is on track to become a seasonal virus similar to the flu.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a real possibility that it\u2019ll be a seasonal virus, and not once a year like the flu tends to be, but maybe twice a year where we have a little bump, and we need to take more precautions,\u201d he said, noting that the community is better equipped to deal with surges due to availability of vaccines and natural immunity among the general public.\nHolton recommends that students have several at-home tests on hand as the semester begins. Students experiencing symptoms can also get tested by making an appointment at\nStamps . With the exception of psychiatry, all appointments there have returned to in-person as the health center continues to return to pre-pandemic operations.\nAlong with offering Covid-19 vaccinations by appointment, Stamps will host walk-in flu vaccination clinics in October, with details to be announced early in the semester.\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nStamps Health Services\nContact\nSteven Gagliano\n- Communications Officer\nInstitute Communications\nEmail\nSteven.gagliano@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
