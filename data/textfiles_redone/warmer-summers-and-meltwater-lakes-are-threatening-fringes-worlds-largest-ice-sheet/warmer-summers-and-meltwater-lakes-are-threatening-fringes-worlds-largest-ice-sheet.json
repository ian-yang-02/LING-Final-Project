A new study shows lake area and volume vary substantially from year-to-year around the East Antarctic Ice Sheet and between ice shelves.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nEmail\nMeltwater lake on the S\u00f8rsdal Glacier.

These supraglacial lakes were tracked between 2014 and 2020.\nThe\nstudy , published in\nNature Communications\nwith co-authors from Durham, Newcastle, and Lancaster universities and Georgia Institute of Technology, shows that lake volume varied year-to-year by as much as 200% on individual ice shelves (floating extensions of the main Antarctic ice sheet), and by around 72% overall.\nLakes were also found to be deeper and larger in warmer melt seasons and formed on some potentially vulnerable ice shelves.\nIt\u2019s the first time meltwater lakes have been studied over consecutive melt seasons across the whole ice sheet, enabling the controls on their development to be explored. The work provides vital insight into why and where lakes grow and will help experts understand which ice shelves may be most at risk of breaking up as a consequence of surface melting.\n\u201cThis work shows that year-to-year variability of supraglacial lakes is important on the East-Antarctic ice shelves. It demonstrates that we need to further improve our models to represent the critical factors leading to such spatio-temporal variability,\u201d said\nVincent Verjans , a postdoctoral fellow in the\nSchool of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at Georgia Tech\nand member of the Institute\u2019s\nIce & Climate Group . \u201cCapturing the correct sensitivity of lake formation to a multitude of factors such as temperature, snowfall, and wind patterns is challenging. Yet, it is necessary because supraglacial lake formation plays a critical role on the stability of ice shelves, and thus on the dynamics of ice sheets.\u201d\n\u201cWe knew that supraglacial lakes were more extensive than previously thought around the East Antarctic Ice Sheet, but until now only had snapshots of these in some years,\u201d said\nJennifer Arthur , principal investigator and Ph.D. student in the\nDepartment of Geography, Durham University . \u201cOur study reveals these lakes change in scale far more than we originally suspected. We were surprised at how much lakes can change year-to-year between ice shelves. We explored the potential reasons for this and found that warmer summer air temperatures in Antarctica correlated with more extensive lakes.\u201d\nIn addition to helping experts understand supraglacial lake formation and climatic impacts, the research seeks to predict which ice shelves may be most at risk of collapse.\n\u201cDue to climate change, air temperatures in Antarctica will continue to rise and our study suggests that this will lead to an increase in the number and volume of supraglacial lakes, which will in turn put some East Antarctic ice shelves at risk of meltwater-driven collapse,\u201d Arthur added.\nUnderstanding the climatic conditions controlling meltwater lake variability will also improve the accuracy of regional climate models used to replicate observations and predict future ice sheet change in Antarctica.\nThe study used images from the Landsat 8 satellite. Work on this study was funded through a UKRI Natural Environment Research Council doctoral studentship and individual author grants from the Natural Environment Research Council.\nCITATION;\u00a0 Large interannual variability in supraglacial lakes around East Antarctica,\nJennifer F Arthur, Chris R.
