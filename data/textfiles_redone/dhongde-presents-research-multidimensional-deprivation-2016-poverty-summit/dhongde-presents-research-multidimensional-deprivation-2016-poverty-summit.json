It is intended to spark a deeper awareness of poverty and to create long-lasting solutions for the poor in our communities.\nDhongde presented her research on multi-dimensional deprivation in the United States during the Great Recession. According to her analysis, about 15 percent of the population experiences multidimensional deprivation, exceeding the prevalence of official income poverty. Some of the dimensions in which Americans were most deprived included\u00a0lack of education, severe housing burdens, and lack of health insurance.\nAdditional findings from Dhongde\u2019s analysis can be found in her recently published article in the Social Indicators Research journal.\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nEconomist's Research Reveals Poverty Should Be Measured by More than Income\nDhongde's Social Indicators Research article\nDhongde's Publications\nContact\nRebecca Keane\nDirector of Communications\n404.894.1720\nrebecca.keane@iac.gatech.edu\nEmail\nrebecca.keane@iac.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
