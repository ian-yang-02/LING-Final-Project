As he stepped off the lander,\u00a0he told an estimated TV audience of a half-billion, \u201cThat\u2019s one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.\u201d\nThose memories will flood back on Saturday, July 20, 50 years to the day since that moment in history. We asked some Georgia Tech College of Sciences researchers \u2013\u00a0and an alumnus with a special connection to that day \u2013\u00a0their thoughts on how Apollo 11 and the space program impacted the cause of science and technology in the U.S.\nBob McDonald\nHe\u2019s 83 years old and enrolled in the\nOnline Master of Science in Analytics\nprogram, making him Georgia Tech\u2019s oldest graduate student, according to\nGeorgia Tech Professional Education . This will be his fourth degree from Tech. He already has a B.S. in\nChemical Engineering\n(\u201957)\u00a0and a Masters (\u201961) and Ph.D. (\u201966) in\nNuclear Engineering . McDonald had a unique front-row seat for the Apollo program.\n\u201cI was a brand new engineer working for\nRocketdyne , who had a contract to manufacture the J2 engines for the Saturn rocket.\u00a0 There were five J2s on the Saturn second stage to get into Earth orbit.\u00a0 A single J2 powered the third stage to the Moon and back.\n\u201cThe J2 was a new, liquid hydrogen- and liquid oxygen-fueled engine.\u00a0To prevent the rocket exhaust from melting the engine, liquid hydrogen was pumped through small tubes down to the end of the engine bell, then back up to the combustion chamber for burning.\u00a0 My job was to do the heat transfer and flow calculations for the hydrogen in those tubes to make sure temperatures would be within design limits. This was prior to engine testing when the temperatures could be measured directly. When the engine was tested and performed correctly, my job was finished.\n\u201cOne interesting thing about the [Apollo]\u00a0project was that we already knew all the science\u00a0and math needed for success. We knew where the Moon was, how far we had to travel, how long it would take, and how much energy was required.\u00a0 What we did not have was any of the hardware, the machinery, or equipment necessary to make the trip.\u00a0 Developing, testing, and learning to use the necessary equipment was a job for the engineers.\u00a0 Engineering and science are like one pair of gloves, and both benefitted. At the end of the project the United States was stronger, more prosperous, and wiser than when it began. The money was well spent, and we should do it again.\u201d\n\"The money was well spent, and we should do it again.\"\nJennifer Glass\nAn associate professor in the\nSchool of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences ,\nGlass \u00a0was a\nNASA Astrobiology\nPostdoctoral Fellow at the\nCalifornia Institute of Technology\nfrom 2011 to 2013. Her research area is biogeochemistry.\n\u201cThe Moon gives the Earth tides and stabilizes our climate by preventing the planet\u2019s tilt from changing more than a few degrees. But until the Apollo program, we didn\u2019t know exactly how old the Moon was or what it was made of. A major achievement of the Apollo program was reconstruction of the timeline of the Moon's formation. These\u00a0data came from measurements of the isotopic composition of rock samples that Apollo 11 astronauts collected on the Moon 50 years ago this month. One of these scientists was my academic grandfather (my Ph.D. advisor\u2019s Ph.D. advisor), the late\nGerald Wasserburg , who ran a lab at Caltech called the \u2018Lunatic Asylum\u2019.\n\u201cPerhaps the most important emblem of the Apollo program was the\u00a0iconic photo of Earth rising over the lunar horizon,\u00a0captured by Apollo 8 astronaut\nWilliam Anders . The\nEarthrise photo\nprofoundly changed human consciousness. That image made people realize how special our own planet is\u00a0\u2013\u00a0a pale blue dot against the vastness of space. It ushered in the environmental awareness of the 1970s.\u201d\nRafael de la Llave\nA professor in the School of Mathematics,\nde la Llave\nresearches dynamical systems, including the study of orbits. In 2015, de la Llave and two other scientists received a\n$100,000 NASA grant\nto research how math could help make space travel less costly and more efficient.\n\u201cWhen the Moon landing happened, I was a kid in Spain. Like everybody else in the world, I was deeply moved and full of admiration.\n\"The Moon landing changed the vision we had of our planet and of our species. It was technology impacting on religion and philosophy, not just on everyday life, from GPS, and mobile cameras to\u00a0wireless technology.\nThe Moon landing also changed politics; it showed that big democratic and united organizations, where ideas percolate up and down, are more efficient than rigid ones. It was an accomplishment that made the whole world reflect.\u201d\n\"The Moon landing...showed that democratic and united organizations, where ideas percolate up and down, are more efficient than rigid ones.\"\nJohn Wise\nWise\nis the Dunn Family Associate Professor in the\nCenter for Relativistic Astrophysics\nin the\nSchool of Physics . Wise uses supercomputers to create simulations of the Big Bang, along with the birth of stars and the lifespan of black holes.\n\u201cThe Apollo program accelerated rocket technology and space science for years to come, not only in the U.S. but around the globe. The feats achieved by the whole team inspired a generation of young people into STEM fields, fascinated by the depths of space. The advancements in rockets led to many space telescopes and planetary probes in decades to come.\n\u201cThe discoveries by NASA telescopes and probes partly motivated me to pursue astrophysics as a career.\u00a0As an 80's kid, I lingered over pictures of the gas giant planets sent back by the Voyager spacecraft.\n\u201cA decade later, the\nHubble Space Telescope\ngave us images of galaxies across the universe. Many other scientists have told me that they had similar formative memories of NASA missions. Without the Apollo program pushing the limits of humankind, these space science missions might have not been possible in the 20th century.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nContact\nRenay San Miguel\nCommunications Officer\nGeorgia Tech College of Sciences\n404-894-5209\nEmail\nrenay.san@cos.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
