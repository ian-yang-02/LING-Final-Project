These messages are then printed onto white and gold hearts and hung from campus trees for all to read.\nLast Fall , more than 800 messages were displayed to welcome people back after Spring and Summer 2020 classes took place remotely.\n\u201cThere was such a positive response to the project last year that we wanted to see if this could become an annual event to bring the community together for the start of each fall semester,\u201d said Heather Fleming, president of SMILE. \u201cHearts for Campus has been a great way to get people to positively reflect on their Tech experiences heading into the new school year.\u201d\nThe campus community is invited to submit messages through a Google form at\ntinyurl.com/heartsforcampus . Messages are on display now and will continue to be added as they are received. Submissions close Aug. 28, and the hearts will be on display through early September.\n\u201cSeeing everyone read each other's messages creates a super welcoming environment. There is something really cool about walking through campus and realizing each heart represents a different member of the community,\u201d said Fleming.\nSubmit your message today .\nAdditional Images\nContact\nKristen Bailey\nInstitute Communications\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
