But researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology have figured out a way to keep what helps, while blocking what harms, in a type of therapy to fight serious chronic inflammatory diseases.\nIt\u2019s simple and works a little like a pacemaker: An implanted device electrically stimulates the vagus nerve, but, in addition, inhibits unwanted nerve activity in a targeted manner.\nForms of vagus nerve stimulation treatment against chronic inflammation have already been\nsuccessfully tested in humans by private industry\nwith the intent to make them available to patients. But the\ninnovation by Georgia Tech researchers\nof adding an inhibiting signal could increase the clinical efficacy and therapeutic benefit of existing treatments.\nTemporarily snipping a nerve\n\u201cWe use an electrode with a kilohertz frequency that blocks unwanted nerve conduction in addition to the electrode that stimulates nerve activity,\u201d said principal investigator\nRobert Butera, a professor jointly appointed in Georgia Tech\u2019s School of Electrical and Computer Engineering\nand the\nWallace H. Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering .\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019ve arranged the two near each other, so the blocking electrode forces the stimulation from the stimulating electrode to only go in one direction.\u201d\nThe researchers\u2019 innovation could theoretically by implemented relatively quickly by augmenting\nexisting clinical devices . So far, tests in rats have returned very encouraging results, and they have been achieved without taking more drastic measures notable in other experiments to optimize this kind of treatment \u2013 such as a vagotomy, the cutting of part of the vagus.\n\u201cThe original studies in animals on the anti-inflammatory benefits of vagus nerve stimulation resorted to nerve transections to achieve directional stimulation as well as boost effectiveness of nerve stimulation. But cutting the vagus is not clinically viable, due to the multitude of vital bodily functions it monitors and regulates. Our approach provides the same therapeutic benefit, but is also immediately reversible, controllable, and clinically feasible,\u201d said\nlead researcher Yogi Patel , a bioengineering graduate student.\n\u201cWe call it a virtual vagotomy,\u201d Butera said.\nPatel, Butera and former Georgia Tech researchers\nTarun Saxena\nand\nRavi V. Bellamkonda , published the results of\ntheir study in the journal\nScientific Reports , which is published by Nature Publishing Group,\u00a0on Thursday, January 5, 2017. The research was funded by the National Institutes of Health and the Ian\u2019s Friends Foundation.\nVagus nerve: What is it?\nTo understand how this new bioelectronic fine-tuning works, let\u2019s start with the vagus nerve itself.\nIt lies outside the spinal column and runs in two parts down the front of your neck on either side. It\u2019s easy to forget about because, though it does help you feel some limited sensations like pain and heat from a handful of internal organs, those sensations are not as blatant and common as when you reach out and touch something with your hand.\nYour voluntary, or somatic, nervous system is responsible for the reaching, touching, and feeling, and the vagus nerve belongs to your\nin voluntary nervous system \u2013 actually called the autonomic nervous system. Though you may experience the effects less consciously, you couldn\u2019t survive without a vagus.\n\u201cThe vagus nerve conveys an incredible amount of information related to the state and function of the visceral organs \u2013 your digestive tract, your heart, your lungs, information about the nutrients you eat \u2013 anything required for homeostasis (physiological balance),\u201d Patel said.\nThe vagus nerve is the lifeline between the vital function control centers of your brain and your visceral organs, passing messages constantly between your hypothalamus and organs to control things like pulse and respiration, certain secretions, and the limiting of immune response.\nInflammation: What role does the vagus nerve play?\nThat last one is where inflammation comes in, because it's part of the body's natural immune response. But when the immune system becomes hyperactive, it can attack not just pathogens but also uninfected tissue, as with patients suffering from diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, irritable bowel syndrome or Crohn\u2019s disease. Drug-based therapies often fail to significantly benefit them.\nThe two parts of the autonomic (involuntary) nervous system -- the sympathetic and the parasympathetic -- strongly influence your immune system. The vagus nerve belongs to the parasympathetic.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a seesaw system. Your sympathetic nervous system helps kick the immune system on, and the parasympathetic nervous system tempers it,\u201d Patel said.\nElectrical stimulation is good: Any downsides?\nStimulating the vagus nerve supports that tempering effect, but it can also somewhat excite the part of the nervous system that stimulates the immune response, which is counterproductive\u00a0if you're looking to calm it.\n\u201cEvery circuit has a path coming from the brain and one going to the brain, and when you stimulate electrically, you usually have no control over which one you get. You usually get both.\u201d Patel said. These paths are often in the same nerve being stimulated.\nThe path leaving the brain and going toward other organs, called the efferent pathway, is the one to stimulate to temper the immune system and help relieve chronic inflammatory conditions. The one going to the brain, called the afferent pathway, if stimulated, leads eventually to the hypothalamus, a pea-sized region in the center of the brain. That triggers a chain of hormonal responses, eventually releasing cytokines, messaging molecules that promote inflammation.\n\u201cYou get a heightened inflammatory response when you stimulate the afferent pathways, which are actively conveying information about your internal state and trigger the immune system when necessary,\u201d Patel said. \u201cAnd if a patient is already in a hyperactive immune state, you don\u2019t want to push that even more.\"\nStimulating downward (efferent), while blocking upward (afferent) vagus nerve activity keeps the good effect while preventing possible bad effects. In animals that received this treatment, blood tests showed that inflammation markedly decreased. Most importantly, this treatment can be turned on or off, and be tuned to the needs of each patient.\nNo additional authors were involved in the study, which was performed at Georgia Tech.
