The testing will help a research team at the Georgia Institute of Technology advance cell-based therapies for fighting the disease, an inherited X-linked disorder diagnosed in one in 3,500 people worldwide.\n\u201cI am in love with the work that I\u2019m doing,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are looking at extending the lifespan and improving the quality of life. Being in the lab and working with diseases that are affecting people around the world is what I want to do with my life.\u201d\nHern\u00e1ndez, an industrial biotechnology major at the University of Puerto Rico at Mayag\u00fcez, spent 10 weeks this summer in the laboratory of\nAndr\u00e9s Garc\u00eda , the Rae and Frank H. Neely Chair in the\nGeorge W. Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering\nand the executive director of the\nPetit Institute for Bioengineering and Bioscience\nat Georgia Tech. The opportunity came through the National Science Foundation\u2019s Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program, which supported her work through the NSF Engineering Research Center for Cell Manufacturing Technologies (CMaT), also headquartered at Georgia Tech.\nAs one of 14 students working in cell therapy and manufacturing labs at the University of Georgia, the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Georgia Tech during the summer, Hern\u00e1ndez received hands-on experience with cutting-edge research, and said she hopes to be part of the health care revolution that CMaT is helping to create.\n\u201cCell therapy is an emerging field and CMaT\u2019s goal is to make it scalable, high quality and affordable,\u201d she explained. \u201cWorking in a project that aims to make this type of treatment available is very important to me.\u201d\nWorkforce Development a Key Part of CMaT\nStudents have traditionally not received much research-based experience until they enter graduate school. The NSF\u2019s REU effort is helping to change that by giving undergraduates an opportunity to work in advanced research labs alongside top graduate students and pioneering researchers in a broad range of fields. By giving them an idea of what it\u2019s like to participate in the development of cutting-edge therapies and new technologies, the program is helping develop the next generation of research leaders.\n\u201cEducational programs at all levels are critical, of course, and the REU program bringing undergraduates into CMaT labs is important for introducing these students to the excitement of new cell therapies and cell manufacturing,\u201d said\nAaron Levine , CMaT\u2019s co-director for workforce development and a professor in Georgia Tech\u2019s School of Public Policy. \u201cDeveloping the future workforce has been identified as a critical issue for cell manufacturing to succeed. The CMaT workforce programs are critical to our success \u2014 and for the industry to reach its full potential.\u201d\nThe students applied for the REU at CMaT and were assigned both a university principal investigator and a mentor for the summer. Beyond the lab experiences, the students learn collaboration, networking and other key skills.\n\u201cThis is a unique and impactful REU program focused on cell manufacturing research that has successfully engaged an impressive cohort of students, many from underrepresented groups in STEM,\" said Mary Poats, REU program manager in NSF\u2019s Division of Engineering Education and Centers. \u201cThe students are engaged early on in state-of-the-art ERC research and innovation activities that are directed toward a goal of curing disease and illnesses throughout the world. It is rewarding to hear these students passionately describe how being a part of CMaT\u2019s summer REU program has so positively impacted their desire to further pursue related engineering and science academic studies, along with careers in the health care industry.\u201d\nAfter a summer working in the laboratory of\nHang Lu , the Love Family Professor in Georgia Tech\u2019s School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, Tailynn McCarty, says she\u2019d like to get some experience in industry before going on to graduate school. A chemical engineering major from the University of Rhode Island, she hopes her experience with optimizing culture procedures for cellular aggregates \u2014 large groups of cells measured in three dimensions instead of just two \u2014 might open a corporate door.\n\u201cCMaT is providing an opportunity to save lives,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve wanted to help people for a very long time, and I didn\u2019t know exactly how I would do that. The work that CMaT is doing will allow me and other people to develop cures for illnesses to reduce the large impact of disease.\u201d\nNSF REU Gives Students Early Experience in Research\nA key goal of the REU program is to give students a taste of what they\u2019ll experience working in a research lab, whether that\u2019s in a traditional academic setting or in industry. That goal appealed to Eva Gatune, who is working on dual degrees in biology and biomedical engineering at Xavier University of Louisiana.\n\u201cAs undergraduates, we\u2019re looking to the future and to graduate school \u2014 what we\u2019ll do next,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is the perfect preview to tell us if this is something we want to do or not.\u201d\nDuring the summer REU, Gatune worked in the laboratory of Georgia Tech Biomedical Engineering Professor\nManu Platt\nstudying cathepsins, enzymes that degrade proteins in the body. Specifically, she worked on how cathepsins and their protein networks affect breast cancer \u2014 and found that experience inspiring.\n\u201cNot a lot of young people would get an opportunity like this,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s heartwarming and fascinating to be part of something that is bigger than you. In the next 10 years, who knows how far this is going to go?\u201d\nFor Yasmine Stewart, a biology major from Savannah State University, the REU program provided an opportunity to participate in one of the most exciting areas of life sciences research today: cell therapies. She worked with graduate students in the laboratory of\nLohitash Karumbaiah , assistant professor in the\nCollege of Agricultural & Environmental Sciences at the University of Georgia , learning cell culture techniques.\n\u201cWe all have loved ones who suffer from diseases, so I\u2019m especially passionate about doing my part to help them,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve learned a lot of things in the lab, as far as cell culturing, but I\u2019ve also learned patience, how to read research articles and to study more. I\u2019ve learned how to work with others in the lab.\u201d\nStewart had been considering an M.D.- Ph.D. path, but her experience using microfluidics technology to study potential cell treatments made the research track more intriguing. \u201cThe CMaT program is important because it is going to improve health care,\u201d she said.\nGetting in on the Ground Floor of an Exciting Technology\nKailyn Cleaves saw the summer REU as an opportunity to \u201cget outside my comfort zone and do things I had never done before.\u201d A biochemistry and pre-med major from the University of Tennessee-Knoxville, she enjoyed the lab experience and, like other students, found involvement in the early stages of cell manufacturing to be both exciting and rewarding.\n\u201cI felt intimidated at first because I had never worked in a lab before,\u201d she said. But she quickly found that graduate students in the laboratory of\nSteven Stice , director of the University of Georgia\u2019s Regenerative Bioscience Center, enjoyed helping her and providing mentoring.\nFor David Frey, a Georgia Tech second-year student majoring in biomedical engineering, working in the lab of\nKrishnendu Roy , CMaT executive director and Robert A. Milton Chair, unlocked a \u201cdream come true.\u201d Frey worked on a microfluidics project that could lead to improvements in the way cells are cultured. The technology could also help match therapies to a patient\u2019s specific disease characteristics.\n\u201cIt\u2019s truly been a dream come true,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to be in the lab all day. But being in school, I could never do that. This program definitely helps you immerse yourself in the research you are doing.\u201d\nAs with others in the program, Frey was excited about being part of the cell manufacturing initiative in its early stages.\n\u201cIt\u2019s exciting being a pioneer with this specific technology,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery day you want to see what the final product will look like. You want to see that the technology is being used for medical purposes. This could potentially help thousands of people someday.\u201d\nMaking Cell Therapies Widely Available and Affordable\nThe companies that will bring cell therapies to the clinic will create a broad range of new jobs, everything from Ph.D. researchers developing new technologies to production staff and quality control specialists responsible for manufacturing cells of consistent quality and efficacy. Developing a new workforce to handle those divergent tasks is a key element of the CMaT initiative.\n\u201cMany of the REU students will go into industry, and they will come out of this lab experience with a better understanding of what industry needs and what sorts of skills are important for both industry and academic researchers,\u201d Levine explained. \u201cWe deliberately structure our projects to have faculty and students from multiple institutions, often with industry partners. This is really how the real world works today \u2014 assembling the best teams to advance knowledge.\u201d\nTherapies based on living cells are different from traditional drug-based treatments, having great promise but also significant challenges.\n\u201cMost of the medical treatments we have now are much simpler, relying on small molecules or biologics,\u201d Levine said. \u201cThe idea behind cell therapies is that cells can be much more powerful to treat conditions that are currently not treatable. Many of the conditions that we struggle with have to do with cellular dysfunction. The hope is that cell therapy can emerge as a way to replace or repair those cells.\u201d\nHowever, living cells can be affected by small changes in their environment and as they are transported to the clinics where they will be used. Ensuring consistency is another of the major challenges ahead, one for which Georgia Tech is applying its expertise in manufacturing and process control.\nOnly a small number of cellular therapies have been approved for use in the United States, and many more are in the research pipeline. But these therapies are often expensive \u2014 sometimes costing hundreds of thousands of dollars per patient. Making these affordable for use by ordinary patients is yet another challenge that CMaT is taking on.\n\u201cBy developing better technologies to manufacture cells more reliably, more safely and more inexpensively, we hope to lower the cost of these therapies and make cell therapy more widely accessible,\u201d Levine explained. \u201cThe students participating in this program will be thrust into a field where the opportunities are growing dramatically. Preparing them to understand what the potential is and what the trends are like in this field is what we believe we\u2019ve accomplished this summer.\u201d\nThe NSF Engineering Research Center for Cell Manufacturing Technologies was established to create new integrated manufacturing innovations and advanced bioprocessing technologies to enable robust, scalable, low-cost bio-manufacturing of high-quality therapeutic cells. CMaT has established cellular testbeds in three areas: (1) Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to repair, regenerate and restore diseased tissues and organs, (2) Engineered T cells to treat some forms of cancer, and (3) Induced pluripotent stem cell (IPSC)-derived cardiomyocytes to treat heart disease.\nResearch News\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\n177 North Avenue\nAtlanta, Georgia\u00a0 30332-0181\u00a0 USA\nMedia Relations Contact : John Toon (404-894-6986) (jtoon@gatech.edu).\nWriter : John Toon\nAdditional Images\nContact\nJohn Toon\nResearch News\n(404) 894-6986\nEmail\njtoon@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
