The mRNA vaccines developed through the federal government's \"Operation Warp Speed\" program were a massive innovation; however, annually updating those boosters for specific SARS-CoV-2 variants is inefficient for scientists and patients. SARS-CoV-2 is just one member of the Sarbecovirus ( SAR S\nBe ta co rona virus ) subfamily (others\u00a0 include SARS-CoV-1, which caused the 2002 SARS outbreak, as well as other viruses circulating in bats that could cause future pandemics).\nResearchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology and the University of Wisconsin-Madison have developed a new vaccine that offers broad protection against not only SARS-CoV-2 variants, but also other bat sarbecoviruses. The groundbreaking trivalent vaccine has shown complete protection with no trace of virus in the lungs, marking a significant step toward a universal vaccine for coronaviruses.\n\u201cWe had been working on strategies to make a broadly protective vaccine for a while,\u201d said\nRavi Kane ,\nGarry Betty/V Foundation Chair\u00a0and GRA Eminent Scholar in Cancer Nanotechnology and\u00a0 professor in the\nSchool of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering . \u201cThis vaccine may protect not just against the current strain circulating that year, but also future variants.\u201d\nThey presented their findings in \u201c Broad protection against clade 1 \u00a0 sarbecoviruses after a single immunization with cocktail spike-protein-nanoparticle \u00a0 vaccine ,\u201d published in the February edition of\nNature Communications .\nKane and his research group have been working on the technologies to develop more widely protective vaccines for viruses since he joined Georgia Tech in 2015. Although the team didn\u2019t specifically foresee Covid-19 arising when it did, pandemics have regularly occurred throughout human history. While the team pivoted their vaccine research to address coronaviruses, they were surprised by how rapidly each new variant arose, making their broader vaccine even more necessary.\nOnce they realized the challenge inherent in how fast SARS-CoV-2 mutates, they had two options for how to build a vaccine: design one to be widely preventative against the virus, or use the influenza vaccine, which updates annually for the anticipated prevalent variant, as a model.\nMaking a broad vaccine is more appealing because it enables patients to get one shot and be protected for years. To create their general vaccine, Kane\u2019s team capitalized on the key to the original mRNA vaccines \u2014 the spike protein, which binds the virus to healthy cells. Their vaccine uses three prominent spike proteins, or a trivalent vaccine, to elicit a broad enough antibody response to make the vaccine effective against SARS-CoV-2 variants as well as other sarbecoviruses that have been identified as having pandemic potential.\n\u201cIf you know which variant is circulating, you can immunize with the spike protein of that variant,\u201d Ph.D. student and co-author Kathryn Loeffler said. \u201cBut a broad vaccine is more difficult to develop because you\u2019re protecting against many different antigens versus just one.\u201d\nCollaborators in the Kawaoka group at the University of Wisconsin tested their vaccine in hamsters, which they had previously identified as an appropriate animal model to evaluate vaccines and immunotherapies against SARS-CoV-2. The vaccine was able to neutralize all SARS-CoV-2 omicron variants tested, as well as non-SARS-CoV-2 coronaviruses circulating in bats. Even better, the vaccine provided complete protection with no detectable virus in the lungs.\nKane hopes that the vaccine strategy his team identified can be applied to other viruses \u2014 other coronavirus subfamilies as well as other viruses such as influenza viruses. They also expect that some of the specific antigens they describe in this paper can be moved toward preclinical trials. Someday, a trivalent vaccine could comprise a routine part of people\u2019s medical treatment.\nContact\nTess Malone, Senior Research Writer/Editor\ntess.malone@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
