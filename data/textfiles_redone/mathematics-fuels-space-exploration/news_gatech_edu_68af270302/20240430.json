With both hex nuts at rest, the School of Mathematics professor taps one slightly.\nGiven the slight energy input, the nut moves. In a while, the nut at rest also starts to swing. Eventually, a dance commences, the two hex nuts gracefully oscillating as they transfer energy from one to the other.\nWhen more oscillators are involved, beautiful geometric patterns emerge,\nas this video shows.\nDesigners of space missions can harness the dynamics creating these dazzling motions to save fuel. \u201cIf we could make the mathematical details very explicit, we can make these work to our advantage,\u201d de la Llave says. \u201cWe could move spacecraft with very small amounts of fuel. We could extend the life of satellites \u2013 or send robots to the moon \u2013 inexpensively.\u201d\nNASA recently awarded a $100,000\u00a0grant to de la Llave,\nMarian Gidea of Yeshiva University , and\nRodney Anderson of NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory\n(JPL)to take the first steps to realize the potential of mathematics to lower the fuel cost of space travel. The project \u2013 \u201cAccelerating Diffusion to Enable Rapid Tour Design\u201d \u2013 has a duration of one year.\nAs part of the project goals, this week in the Skiles Building, space mission designers from JPL and mathematicians from Georgia Tech and Yeshiva University are gathering for\na four-day workshop . The participants will work together with the mathematical tools of the Arnold diffusion mechanism and trajectory design. The goal is to incorporate what is also known as the \u201cbutterfly effect\u201d \u2013 which is the ability of minuscule changes to cause gigantic effects in certain systems \u2013 into space mission design.\n\u201cIf we want to go around jumping from moon to moon, applying these new advances in mathematics can help us get there at much, much lower cost, making such a mission so much more doable.\u201d\nThe Arnold diffusion mechanism is the underlying mathematical concept. Both de la Llave and Gidea are world-renowned experts in this field.\n\u201cIn a nutshell, the Arnold diffusion mechanism states that small amounts of force, applied at the right moments, can produce large effects over time,\u201d\nGidea explained last year . \u201cA familiar example is pushing a playground swing: with a tiny push on the swing each time it comes back to you, the amplitude of the swing will keep increasing.\n\u201cIn the case of space missions, this small forcing translates into firing the rocket\u2019s engine at the right place and the right moment to accelerate in orbit when the natural dynamics is slow.\u201d Other possible small forcings could be the tugs of gravitational tides induced by stars, planets, moons, and even asteroids.\nAt other times, \u201cthe spacecraft will coast along the space superhighway at zero cost,\u201d Gidea said.\n\u201cCelestial bodies are moving all the time,\u201d de la Llave says. \u201cAnd they generate forces that depend on time. If you can ride the wave of those forces, then you can move and accelerate using just the gravitational forces of astronomical objects.\u201d\nThe Arnold diffusion mechanism is rooted in the\nKolmogorov-Arnold-Moser (KAM) theorem . The theorem provides a general framework for understanding what happens when a simple physical system is modified slightly, according to School of Mathematics Professor\nHoward \u201cHowie\u201d Weiss . \u201cRafael and others played a big role in extending the KAM theorem,\u201d Weiss says. \u201cRafael is extremely modest. He is probably the world\u2019s leader in this business.\u201d\nDesign of space mission routes historically has been based mostly on patching orbits of conical geometry. Recent mathematical advances in the Arnold diffusion mechanism have uncovered other geometries that reveal new potential pathways leveraging the gravitational dynamics in space. Adding small maneuvers at precise times and locations to the pathways found via the Arnold diffusion mechanism could significantly drop the cost of space missions.\nWhile de la Llave and Gidea work on the mathematics, JPL\u2019s Anderson will focus on applying the mathematical methods to mission concepts. Anderson is an expert on the application of dynamical systems theory to trajectory design problems. He is the coauthor of a\n2013 NASA monograph\nthat explores the use of low-energy paths to transfer a spacecraft from Earth to its moon.\nOne space endeavor of great interest is to visit the moons of Jupiter systematically, de la Llave says. \u201cIf we want to go around jumping from moon to moon, applying these new advances in mathematics can help us get there at much, much lower cost, making such a mission so much more doable.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nWorkshop Webpage\nContact\nA.
