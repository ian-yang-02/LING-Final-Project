That\u2019s where \u201cSlothBot\u201d comes in.\nPowered by a pair of photovoltaic panels and designed to linger in the forest canopy continuously for months, SlothBot moves only when it must to measure environmental changes \u2013 such as weather and chemical factors in the environment \u2013 that can be observed only with a long-term presence. The proof-of-concept hyper-efficient robot, described May 21 at the International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA) in Montreal, may soon be hanging out among treetop cables in the Atlanta Botanical Garden.\n\u201cIn robotics, it seems we are always pushing for faster, more agile and more extreme robots,\u201d said\nMagnus Egerstedt , the Steve W. Chaddick School Chair of the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology and principal investigator for Slothbot. \u201cBut there are many applications where there is no need to be fast. You just have to be out there persistently over long periods of time, observing what\u2019s going on.\u201d\nBased on what Egerstedt called the \u201ctheory of slowness,\u201d Graduate Research Assistant Gennaro Notomista designed SlothBot together with his colleague, Yousef Emam, using 3D-printed parts for the gearing and wire-switching mechanisms needed to crawl through a network of wires in the trees. The greatest challenge for a wire-crawling robot is switching from one cable to another without falling, Notomista said.\n\u201cThe challenge is smoothly holding onto one wire while grabbing another,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a tricky maneuver and you have to do it right to provide a fail-safe transition. Making sure the switches work well over long periods of time is really the biggest challenge.\u201d\nMechanically, SlothBot consists of two bodies connected by an actuated hinge. Each body houses a driving motor connected to a rim on which a tire is mounted. The use of wheels for locomotion is simple, energy efficient and safer than other types of wire-based locomotion, the researchers say.\nSlothBot has so far operated in a network of cables on the Georgia Tech campus. Next, a new 3D-printed shell \u2013 that makes the robot look more like a sloth \u2013 will protect the motors, gears, actuators, cameras, computer and other components from the rain and wind. That will set the stage for longer-term studies in the tree canopy at the Atlanta Botanical Garden, where Egerstedt hopes visitors will see a SlothBot monitoring conditions as early as this fall.\nThe name SlothBot is not a coincidence. Real-life sloths are small mammals that live in jungle canopies of South and Central America. Making their living by eating tree leaves, the animals can survive on the daily caloric equivalent of a small potato. With their slow metabolism, sloths rest as much 22 hours a day and seldom descend from the trees where they can spend their entire lives.\n\u201cThe life of a sloth is pretty slow-moving and there\u2019s not a lot of excitement on a day-to-day level,\u201d said Jonathan Pauli, an associate professor in the Department of Forest & Wildlife Ecology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, who has consulted with the Georgia Tech team on the project. \u201cThe nice thing about a very slow life history is that you don\u2019t really need a lot of energy input. You can have a long duration and persistence in a limited area with very little energy inputs over a long period of time.\u201d\nThat\u2019s exactly what the researchers expect from SlothBot, whose development has been funded by the U.S. Office of Naval Research.\n\u201cThere is a lot we don\u2019t know about what actually happens under dense tree-covered areas,\u201d Egerstedt said. \u201cMost of the time SlothBot will be just hanging out there, and every now and then it will move into a sunny spot to recharge the battery.\u201d\nThe researchers also hope to test SlothBot in a cacao plantation in Costa Rica that is already home to real sloths. \u201cThe cables used to move cacao have become a sloth superhighway because the animals find them useful to move around,\u201d Egerstedt said. \u201cIf all goes well, we will deploy SlothBots along the cables to monitor the sloths.\u201d\nEgerstedt is known for algorithms that drive swarms of small wheeled or flying robots. But during a visit to Costa Rica, he became interested in sloths and began developing what he calls \u201ca theory of slowness\u201d together with Professor Ron Arkin in Georgia Tech\u2019s School of Interactive Computing. The theory leverages the benefits of energy efficiency.\n\u201cIf you are doing things like environmental monitoring, you want to be out in the forest for months,\u201d Egerstedt said. \u201cThat changes the way you think about control systems at a high level.\u201d\nFlying robots are already used for environmental monitoring, but their high energy needs mean they cannot linger for long. Wheeled robots can get by with less energy, but they can get stuck in mud or be hampered by tree roots, and cannot get a big picture view from the ground.\n\u201cThe thing that costs energy more than anything else is movement,\u201d Egerstedt said. \u201cMoving is much more expensive than sensing or thinking. For environmental robots, you should only move when you absolutely have to. We had to think about what that would be like.\u201d\nFor Pauli, who studies a variety of wildlife, working with Egerstedt to help SlothBot come to life has been gratifying.\n\u201cIt is great to see a robot inspired by the biology of sloths,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has been fun to share how sloths and other organisms that live in these ecosystems for long periods of time live their lives. It will be interesting to see robots mirroring what we see in natural ecological communities.\u201d\nThis research was sponsored by the U.S. Office of Naval Research through Grant N00014-15-2115.
