Rethink Strep Throat Remedies\nIt's time to develop alternate drugs against small infections as a strategy to slow the antibiotic resistance crisis, Georgia Tech evolutionary bacteriologists say.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nEmail\nGroup A Streptococci, colored yellow, are the most common culprits in bacterial upper respiratory infections.

The doctor may write a quick prescription for penicillin or amoxicillin, and with the stroke of a pen, help diminish public health and your own future health by encouraging bacteria to evolve resistance to antibiotics.\nIt\u2019s time to develop alternatives to antibiotics for small infections, according to a\u00a0 new thought paper by scientists at the Georgia Institute of Technology , and to do so quickly.\nIt has been\u00a0 widely reported that bacteria will evolve to render antibiotics mostly ineffective \u00a0against them by mid-century, and current strategies to make up for the projected shortfalls haven\u2019t worked.\nOne possible problem is that drug development strategies have focused on replacing antibiotics in extreme infections, such as sepsis, where every minute without an effective drug increases the risk of death.\nBut the evolutionary process that brings forth antibiotic resistance doesn\u2019t happen nearly as often in those big infections as it does in the multitude of small ones like sinusitis, tonsillitis, bronchitis, and bladder infections, the Georgia Tech researchers said.\n\u201cAntibiotic prescriptions against those smaller ailments account for about 90 percent of antibiotic use, and so are likely to be the major driver of resistance evolution,\u201d said\u00a0 Sam Brown, an associate professor in Georgia Tech\u2019s School of Biological Sciences . Bacteria that survive these many small battles against antibiotics grow in strength and numbers to become formidable armies in big infections, like those that strike after surgery.\n\u201cIt might make more sense to give antibiotics less often and preserve their effectiveness for when they\u2019re really needed. And develop alternate treatments for the small infections,\u201d Brown said.\nBrown, who specializes in the evolution of microbes and in\u00a0 bacterial virulence , and first author Kristofer Wollein Waldetoft, a medical doctor and postdoctoral research assistant in Brown\u2019s lab, published an\u00a0 essay detailing their suggestion for refocusing the development of bacteria-fighting drugs on December 28, 2017, in the journal\u00a0 PLOS Biology .\nDuplicitous antibiotics\nThe evolution of antibiotic resistance can be downright two-faced.\n\u201cIf you or your kid go to the doctor with an upper respiratory infection, you often get amoxicillin, which is a relatively broad-spectrum antibiotic,\u201d Brown said. \u201cSo, it kills not only strep but also a lot of other bacteria, including in places like the digestive tract, and that has quite broad impacts.\u201d\nE. coli \u00a0is widespread in the human gut, and some strains secrete enzymes that thwart antibiotics, while other strains don\u2019t. A broad-spectrum antibiotic can kill off more of the vulnerable, less dangerous bacteria, leaving the more dangerous and robust bacteria to propagate.\n\u201cYou take an antibiotic to go after that thing in your throat, and you end up with gut bacteria that are super-resistant,\u201d Brown said. \u201cThen later, if you have to have surgery, you have a problem. Or you give that resistant\u00a0 E. coli \u00a0to an elderly relative.\u201d\nMuch too often, superbugs have made their way into hospitals in someone\u2019s intestines, where they had evolved high resistance through years of occasional treatment with antibiotics for small infections. Then those bacteria have infected patients with weak immune systems.\nFurious infections have ensued, essentially invulnerable to antibiotics, followed by sepsis and death.\nAlternatives get an \u201cF\u201d\nDrug developers facing dwindling antibiotic effectiveness against evolved bacteria have looked for multiple alternate treatments. The focus has often been to find some new class of drug that works as well as or better than antibiotics, but so far, nothing has, Brown said.\nWollein Waldetoft came across a\u00a0 research paper in the medical journal\u00a0 Lancet Infectious Diseases\u00a0 that examined study after study on such alternate treatments against big, deadly infections.\n\u201cIt was a kind of scorecard, and it was almost uniformly negative,\u201d Brown said. \u201cThese alternate therapies, such as\u00a0 phage \u00a0or\u00a0 anti-virulence drugs \u00a0or,\u00a0 bacteriocins \u00a0-- you name it -- just didn\u2019t rise to the same bar of efficacy that existing antibiotics did.\u201d\n\u201cIt was a type of doom and gloom paper that said once the antibiotics are gone, we\u2019re in trouble,\u201d Brown said. \u201cDrug companies still are investing in alternate drug research, because it has gotten very, very hard to develop new effective antibiotics. We don\u2019t have a lot of other options.\u201d\nBut the focus on new treatments for extreme infections has bothered the researchers\u00a0because the main arena where the vast portion of resistance evolution occurs is in small infections. \u201cWe felt like there was a disconnect going on here,\u201d Brown said.\nDon\u2019t kill strep, beat it\nThe researchers proposed a different approach: \u201cTake the easier tasks, like sore throats, off of antibiotics and reserve antibiotics for these really serious conditions.\u201d\nDeveloping non-antibiotic therapies for strep throat, bladder infections, and bronchitis could prove easier, thus encouraging pharmaceutical investment and research.\nFor example, one particular kind of strep bacteria, group A \u00a0streptococci , is responsible for the vast majority of bacterial upper respiratory infections. People often carry it without it breaking out.\nStrep bacteria secrete compounds that promote inflammation and bacterial spread. If an anti-virulence drug could fight the secretions, the drug could knock back the strep into being present but not sickening.\nBrown cautioned that strep infection can lead to rheumatic heart disease, a deadly condition that is very rare in the industrialized world, but it still takes a toll in other parts of the world. \u201cA less powerful drug can be good enough if you don\u2019t have serious strep throat issues in your medical history,\u201d he said.\nSometimes, all it takes is some push-back against\u00a0 virulent bacteria \u00a0until the body\u2019s immune system can take care of it. Developing a spray-on treatment with bacteriophages, viruses that attack bacteria, might possibly do the trick.\nIf doctors had enough alternatives to antibiotics for the multitude of small infections they treat, they could help preserve antibiotic effectiveness longer for the far less common but much more deadly infections, for which they\u2019re most needed.\nWant to Learn More?\u00a0Read:\nFDA Taps Georgia Tech to Help Reduce Cost of Making Antibiotics\nResearch was funded by the Simons Foundation (grant 396001), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (grant OADS-2016-N-17812), the Wenner-Gren Foundation, and the Physiographic Society of Lund.
