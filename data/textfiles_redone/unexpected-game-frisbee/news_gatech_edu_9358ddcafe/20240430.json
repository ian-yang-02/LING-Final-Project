The second-year computer science major sprinted up the hill after seeing Georgia Tech President \u00c1ngel Cabrera ride by on his bike.\nOzgo and his best friend and classmate Reed Blanchard have been on a mission to complete 30 things outside of their comfort zones in 30 days. One of them was to play frisbee with the president of Georgia Tech.\nWhen Ozgo spotted Cabrera, he didn\u2019t want to pass up the opportunity to introduce himself, so he pounded the pavement to catch up with him. And when he finally made it did, he breathlessly asked the president if he\u2019d like to play frisbee, to which the pair of friends got a yes.\n\u201cQuite honestly, I was a little surprised,\u201d Ozgo said. \u201cWe just wanted to get to know you a little bit better,\u201d Blanchard told Cabrera.\nThey arranged a time to meet on Tech Green, and as it turned out the weather couldn\u2019t have been better.\nBlanchard, a second-year mechanical engineering major, and Ozgo are both Stamps President\u2019s Scholars at Georgia Tech, representing the top 1% of students admitted to Tech.\nPresident Cabrera\u2019s son was also a Stamps Scholar. As it turns out, Ozgo is from Arlington, Virginia, and his father is a George Mason graduate. Cabrera was president of that university before taking over leadership at Tech in 2019.\n\u201cMy parents were so excited when they found out you were coming to Tech,\u201d Ozgo said.\nThe two students had the opportunity to ask a few questions while playing frisbee. One was about his favorite memory so far this year.\nCabrera replied that he\u2019d received a lesson on how to drive \u201cWreck 2,\u201d the Ford Model A Roadster owned by the Georgia Tech Alumni Association. It\u2019s about as close as you can get to driving the original Wreck, the iconic Model A sport coupe maintained and driven by Tech students.\nIn turn, between throws, the president asked the students about their college experiences and the projects they\u2019re working on. The moral of the story: don\u2019t be afraid to get out of your comfort zone. The answer is always no until you ask \u2014 even if that question is about playing frisbee with a university president.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nSteven Norris\nInstitute Communications\nEmail\nsnorris@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
