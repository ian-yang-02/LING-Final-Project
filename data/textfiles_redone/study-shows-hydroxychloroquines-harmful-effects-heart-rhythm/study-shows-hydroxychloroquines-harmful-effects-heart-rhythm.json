Now, a team of researchers has used an optical mapping system to observe exactly how the drug creates serious disturbances in the electrical signals that govern heartbeat.\nThe research, reported May 29 in the journal\nHeart Rhythm , found that the drug made it \u201csurprisingly easy\u201d to trigger worrisome arrhythmias in two types of animal hearts by altering the timing of the electrical waves that control heartbeat. While the findings of animal studies can\u2019t necessarily be generalized to humans, the videos created by the research team clearly show how the drug can cause cardiac electrical signals to become dysfunctional.\n\u201cWe have illustrated experimentally how the drug actually changes the waves in the heart, and how that can initiate an arrhythmia,\u201d said Flavio Fenton, a professor in the School of Physics at the Georgia Institute of Technology, researcher in the Petit Institute for Bioengineering and Bioscience,\u00a0and the paper\u2019s corresponding author. \u201cWe have demonstrated that with optical mapping, which allows us to see exactly how the waveform is changing. This gives us a visual demonstration of how the drug can alter the wave propagation in the heart.\u201d\nWhat the team saw was an elongation of the T wave, a portion of the heart cycle during which voltages normally dissipate in preparation for the next beat. By extending the QT portion of one wave cycle, the drug sets the stage for disturbances in the next wave, potentially creating an arrhythmia. Such disturbances can transition to fibrillation that interferes with the heart\u2019s ability to pump.\nThe ability to easily trigger disturbances known as \u201clong QT\u201d reinforces cautions about using hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in humans \u2013 particularly in those who may have heart damage from Covid-19, cautioned Dr. Shahriar Iravanian, a co-author of the paper and a cardiologist in the Division of Cardiology, Section of Electrophysiology, at Emory University Hospital.\n\u201cThe hearts used in the study are small and very resistant to this form of arrhythmia,\u201d Iravanian said. \u201cIf we had not seen any HCQ-induced arrhythmias in this model, the results would not have been reassuring. However, in reality, we observed that HCQ readily induced arrhythmia in those hearts. This finding is very concerning and, in combination with the clinical reports of sudden death and arrhythmia in Covid-19 patients taking HCQ, suggests that the drug should be considered a potentially harmful medication and its use in Covid-19 patients be restricted to clinical trial settings.\u201d\nGeorgia Tech postdoctoral fellow Ilija Uzelac administered HCQ to the animal hearts \u2013 one from a guinea pig and one from a rabbit \u2013 while quantifying wave patterns changing across the hearts using a high-powered, LED-based optical mapping system. Voltage-sensitive fluorescent dyes made the electrical waves visible as they moved across the surface of the hearts.\n\u201cThe effect of the arrhythmia and the long QT was quite obvious,\u201d said Uzelac. \u201cHCQ shifts the wavelengths to larger values, and when we quantified the dispersion of the electrical current in portions of the heart, we saw the extension of the voltage across the tissue. The change was very dramatic comparing the waveforms in the heart with and without the HCQ.\u201d\nThe drug concentration used in the study was at the high end of what\u2019s being recommended for humans. HCQ normally takes a few days to accumulate in the body, so the researchers used a higher initial dose to simulate the drug\u2019s effect over time.\nIn a normal heartbeat, an electrical wave is generated in specialized cells of a heart\u2019s right atrium. The wave propagates through the entire atria and then to the ventricles. As the wave moves through the heart, the electrical potential created causes calcium ions to be released, which stimulates contraction of the heart muscle in a coordinated pattern.\nDrugs such as HCQ modify the properties of these ion channels and inhibit the flow of potassium currents, which prolongs the length of the electrical waves and creates spatial variations in their properties. Ultimately, that can lead to the development of dangerously rapid and dysfunctional heart rhythms.\n\u201cThe wavelength becomes less homogeneous and that affects the propagation of additional waves, producing sections of the heart where the waves do not propagate well,\u201d Fenton said. \u201cIn the worst case, there are multiple waves going in different directions. Every section of the heart is contracting at a different time, so the heart is just quivering. At that point, it can no longer pump blood throughout the body.\u201d\nPatients taking HCQ for diseases such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis rarely suffer from arrythmia because the doses they take are smaller than those being recommended for Covid-19 patients, Iravanian said.\n\u201cCovid-19 patients are different and are at a much higher risk of HCQ-induced arrhythmia,\u201d he said. \u201cNot only is the proposed dose of HCQ for Covid-19 patients two to three times the usual dose, but Covid-19 has effects on the heart and lowers potassium levels, further increasing the risk of arrythmias.\u201d\nFenton and his colleagues have already begun a new study to evaluate the effects of HCQ with the antibiotic azithromycin, which has been suggested as a companion treatment. Azithromycin can also cause the long QT effect, potentially increasing the impact on Covid-19 patients.\nThe study, which was supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health and National Science Foundation, was also coauthored by Dr. Hiroshi Ashikaga from Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine; Dr. Neal Bathia from the Division of Cardiology, Section of Electrophysiology at Emory University Hospital; Conner Herndon, Abouzar Kaboudian, and James C.
