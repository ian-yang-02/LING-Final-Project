The study was designed to assess rates and routes of possible infectious disease transmission during flights.\nCo-researchers Vicki Hertzberg, Ph.D., professor at Emory University's\u00a0Nell Hodgson Woodruff School of Nursing and Howard Weiss, Ph.D., professor in the School of Mathematics at the Georgia Institute of Technology, led tracking efforts in their FlyHealthy(TM)\u00a0study, developing a model that combines estimated infectivity and patterns of contact among aircraft passengers and crew members to determine likelihood of infection.\nFlyHealthyTM team members were assigned to monitor specific areas of the passenger cabin, and made five round trips from the East to West Coast recording movements of passengers and crew. In addition, they collected air samples and obtained surface samples from areas most likely to harbor microbes. They leveraged the movement data to create thousands of simulated flight scenarios and possibilities for direct exposure to droplet-transmitted respiratory diseases.\n\u201cRespiratory diseases are often spread within populations through close contact,\u201d explained\u00a0Hertzberg. \u201cWe wanted to determine the number and duration of social contacts between passengers and crew, but we could not use our regular tracking technology on an aircraft. With our trained observers, we were able to observe where and when contacts occurred on flights. This allows us to model how direct transmission might occur.\u201d\n\u201cWe now know a lot about how passengers move around on flights. For instance, around 40 percent of passengers never leave their seats, another 40 percent get up once during the flight, and 20 percent get up two or more times. Proximity to the aisle was also associated with movement. About 80 percent of passengers in aisle seats got up during flights, in comparison to 60 percent of passengers in middle seats and 40 percent in window seats. Passengers who leave their seats are up for an average of five minutes.\u201d\nResearchers also noted fomite transmission \u2013 exposure to viruses that remain on certain surfaces such as tray tables, seat belts and lavatory handles \u2013 as additional likely contributors to disease transmission. They provide public health recommendations to help prevent the spread of infectious disease.\n\u201cWe found that direct disease transmission outside of the one-meter area of an infected passenger is unlikely,\u201d explained\u00a0Weiss. Respiratory infections can also be transmitted indirectly through contact with an infected surface. This could happen if a sick passenger coughs into their hand, and later touches a lavatory surface or overhead bin handle. \u201cPassengers and flight crews can eliminate this risk of indirect transmission by exercising hand hygiene and keeping their hands away from their nose and eyes.\u201d\nThe study, which was funded in partnership with aerospace leader Boeing, evaluated only the potential spread of infectious agents on an aircraft. Transmission could also occur at other points in a passenger\u2019s journey, underscoring the need to maintain healthy habits, he added.\nComplete findings of the study are available in the journal\nProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .\nExternal News:\u00a0 this article was featured in many national news stories, including\nThe\u00a0Washington Post\nThe NY Times\nMashable\nPopular Science\nAP -\u00a0Associated Press\nThe Smithsonian\nTODAY Online\nEl Pais (Spanish)\nCITATION : Vicki Stover Hertzberg and Howard Weiss (co-first authors), Lisa Elon, Wenpei Si, Sharon L.
