Scheller College\u2019s TI:GER (Technology Innovation: Generating Economic Results) program offers a Global Technology Innovation Practicum that is uniquely positioned to provide students with hands-on experience in tech innovation and strategy to help solve the most pressing problems companies face.\nJonathan Giuliano (executive director and academic director of TI:GER, academic lead of CDL-Atlanta, and professor of the practice in strategy and innovation) led this unique practicum in its inaugural offering this summer semester. This is the only practicum to date giving students the opportunity to work directly with tech companies offering public health and economic recovery solutions in immediate response to the Covid-19 pandemic.\nPartnering with the Creative Destruction Lab-Atlanta\nThe practicum partnered with the Creative Destruction Lab (CDL), an objectives-based global program that helps seed-stage science and technology-based companies transition from science projects to scalable and financeable start-ups. CDL-Atlanta is the only CDL site in North America and it is strategically situated within the Scheller College.\nGregory Ray, operations director at CDL-Atlanta, helped organize the practicum, coached and mentored TI:GER students throughout the course, attended all online class sessions and directed the collaboration with other CDL sites.\nWhen the pandemic hit, CDL moved quickly. CDL-Recovery provided venture capitalists and entrepreneurs in the public health sector with the chance to partner with Scheller graduate students to work on Covid-19 solutions.\nMerging Research with Business\nGabriel Cahn, a second-year dual-degree MBA and PhD student in mechanical engineering, had a few reasons for participating. Enrolling in the practicum would give him time to work on research for his PhD in flexible electronics as well as earning MBA credit. Plus, in collaborating with CDL-Recovery, he would be working on a public health issue that could have global ramifications. Together with his interests in technical management and strategy, the match was perfect.\n\u201cI thought of no better time to observe strategy than in seeing how this global event is impacting every aspect of business and human interaction,\u201d he said. And he was impressed by CDL. \u201cIt\u2019s like TI:GER on steroids,\u201d he said.\nCahn was matched with a French company working on developing\na five-minute Covid-19 test\u00a0 that\u00a0is expected to enter the market\u00a0between\u00a0late 2020\u00a0and\u00a0early 2021. Cahn compared his experience to an internship rather than a practicum. \u201cI felt like I was working for the company and I felt I had a significant impact there,\u201d he noted.\nBringing Ideas to Market through Collaboration\nAnother unique aspect of the practicum is that Scheller MBAs collaborate with business students from other CDL universities throughout the project. Ginny Hodges, an Evening MBA student, said the collaboration was an asset to the practicum.\n\u201cI had a stellar partner from the University of Toronto and got to work with her, which was an additional piece of international exposure and partnership that I haven\u2019t had the opportunity to do in my MBA experience so far,\u201d she said.\nHodges worked with a venture that is developing a strategy for a Covid-19 diagnostic kit based on the technology they validated during a prior virus outbreak.\n\u201cWhen the professor came to us with this opportunity to participate in the Covid-19 recovery workstream, I thought, \u2018What could be a more meaningful and relevant way to immediately apply what I\u2019d just been learning in TI:GER than to come up with solutions to this global health and economic crisis?\u2019\u201d she stated.\nBuilding Bridges to a New Career\nPaige Cruver was matched with a company developing a transdermal patch to deliver drugs through the skin, including a potential application for a vaccine against Covid-19.\u00a0 She is a second-year MBA student with a B.S. in biology and a Master\u2019s in Public Health. She wanted to get back into public health while retaining her information technology experience and felt an MBA would be the bridge that connected her back to the healthcare industry.\n\u201cI\u2019m nearing the end of my MBA journey and this experience is one that has had a profound impact on me professionally and personally,\u201d she stated. \u201cWe are all living history right now, and the opportunity to actively contribute to public health and economic recovery efforts through CDL is something that a traditional classroom or a case study simply can\u2019t capture.\u201d Her work helped the company\u2019s founders decide whether to move forward with their product.\n\u201cThe CDL staff, mentors, and intake process, as well as the startups that participate, are proof positive that the business world can be nimble \u2013 and thoughtful \u2013 in creating, applying, and managing innovation in an ever-changing world,\u201d she said, summing up the impact of the partnership between the Global Technology Innovation Practicum and CDL-Atlanta\u2019s initiatives.\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nTechnology Innovation: Generating Economic Results (TI:GER)\nContact\nLorrie Burroughs\nEmail\nlorrie.burroughs@scheller.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
