Study by Deloitte\u2019s Center for Higher Education Excellence and Georgia Tech\u2019s Center for 21st Century Universities\nApr 19, 2017\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nAs higher education faces demographic and financial challenges in the decade ahead, the role and expectations of the college president are also undergoing substantial change, according to a new report by Deloitte\u2019s Center for Higher Education Excellence and Georgia Tech\u2019s\nCenter for 21st Century Universities . The report, \u201c Pathways to the University Presidency: The Future of Higher Education Leadership ,\u201d identified several key takeaways:\nVaried Pathways:\nWhile the provost\u2019s office has long been the most frequent stopover point on the way to the presidency, academic deans are increasingly moving right to the top job and bypassing the provost\u2019s office altogether.\nA New Role for the Provost:\nThe provost is no longer simply regarded as the No. 2 person on campus. Rather, today\u2019s provosts often have a set of skills that complement the president, rather than replicate them.\nPresident as Fundraiser-In-Chief:\nFundraising is essential from a president\u2019s first day in office, according to the survey, and only grows in importance over time in the position. Despite the attention given to this issue over the past several years, preparing presidents to cultivate donors hasn\u2019t improved much, if at all.\nA Need for Formal Leadership Development:\nInvestments in leadership often lag behind its importance to presidents. While nearly two-thirds of presidents said they had coaches or mentors to help them \u201cprepare\u201d for the role, only one-third of leaders indicated in the survey that they still receive coaching to \u201csucceed\u201d in the job.\nEmphasis on Short-Term Wins at the Cost of Long-Term Planning:\nThere is increasing pressure on presidents to look for quick wins. As a result, many are looking for the proverbial \u201clow-hanging fruit\u201d on their campuses where they can show fast results, not only for their own boards but also search committees for their next job.\n\u201cThere is increasing pressure for presidents to learn on the job and find quick wins,\u201d said Jeffrey J. Selingo, a visiting scholar at Georgia Tech\u2019s Center for 21 st\nCentury Universities and one of the authors of the report. \u201cUnless higher education creates more deliberate training programs for future leaders and helps align short-term tactics and long-term strategies, we\u2019re likely to face a leadership crisis in the coming years.\u201d\nThe report was compiled after a 10-month study that included the first-of-its-kind data mining of more than 800 curricula vitae (CVs) of sitting presidents of four-year institutions, in addition to an extensive survey of 150 presidents.\nThe report also highlights five ways college and university governing boards and stakeholder groups can improve the pipeline to their institution\u2019s presidency:\nDevelop intentional training and leadership development opportunities aimed at prospective college presidents.\nAlign short-term tactics and long-term strategies.\nPromote better understanding of the role of presidents among search committees and a transition team to onboard the president.\nEmbrace a willingness to look beyond traditional backgrounds.\nBuild relationships with various stakeholders both on and off campus.\n\u201cNow is the time for colleges and universities to prepare for an upcoming wave of retirements,\u201d said Cole Clark, executive director, higher education, Deloitte Consulting LLP and national director of higher education client relations. \u201cToday\u2019s and tomorrow\u2019s colleges and universities need presidents with an even more diverse set of leadership skills and experience. Financial acumen, planning and fundraising are just a few areas of specialization necessary to effectively lead a college or university.\u201d\nThe report methodology included three different aspects:\nData mining:\nCV analysis in which data was collected on 840 presidents, gleaned from publicly available information on institutional websites and through other sources, such as professional networking sites.\nSurvey:\nA survey sent via email to 1,031 presidents of four-year colleges and universities (16 percent response rate).\nStructured interviews:\nMore than 24 in-depth interviews with current presidents and board of trustee members were conducted.\n\u201cThe data mining aspect of this report is unique as we were able to uncover trends in how the traditional pathway to the college and university presidency is changing,\u201d said Sonny Cheng, principal, Deloitte Consulting LLP and human capital leader, higher education. \u201cWhile the provost\u2019s office remains the most common launching pad for presidencies, there is evidence that many provosts no longer aspire to the top job, nor in some instances have the broad set of skills necessary for the changing demands of the president\u2019s role.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nRead the Study\nCenter for 21st Century Universities\nContact\nJason Maderer\nNational Media Relations\nmaderer@gatech.edu\n404-660-2926\nEmail\nmaderer@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
