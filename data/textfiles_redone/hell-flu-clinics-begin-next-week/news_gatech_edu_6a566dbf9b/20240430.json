The first on-campus flu shot clinics will be held\nat McCamish Pavilion Sept. 21 \u2013 22 from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. , with more to come later this fall.\nThis year\u2019s clinics will have a greater capacity than in years past. Last year, each clinic, held at Stamps Health Services, administered 200-300 shots daily; this year they are aiming for as many as 1,200 shots per day.\nStudents who want to get a flu shot do not need to make an appointment beforehand and can simply walk up to McCamish during the clinic\u2019s hours of operation. Temperature and symptom checks will be administered at the door. In accordance with the University System of Georgia\u2019s (USG) guidelines, masks will be required inside McCamish.\nFlu shots are also available to faculty and staff and will be free for those enrolled in a USG healthcare plan. Employees are required to pre-register at\nhealth.gatech.edu/flu , and those enrolled in a Kaiser plan will only be able to receive shots on Sept. 22. Shots administered to faculty and staff members will be capped at 150 per day.\n\u201cWhile it is always important to get a flu shot, this year is particularly important,\u201d said Dr. Benjamin Holton, senior director at Stamps Health Services. \u201cThe symptoms of flu and the symptoms of Covid-19 are very similar, and the two illnesses cannot be distinguished based on clinical criteria alone.\u201d\nThis similarity in symptoms could cause a strain on Tech\u2019s medical resources, including testing, isolation capacity, and overall medical care. Holton noted that those who have both the flu and Covid-19 tend to be sicker than those who have one or the other.\n\u201cA flu outbreak increases the risk that students and staff will attribute symptoms of illness to the flu instead of Covid-19 and choose to attend class or go to work with symptoms, increasing risk of exposure of others to Covid-19 and increasing its spread,\u201d Holton said.\nLearn more about flu symptoms and how to get your flu shot\nhere .\nMore clinic dates will be scheduled later in the semester. For those who can\u2019t attend or wish to make an appointment, call Stamps Health Services Pharmacy at\u00a0 404.894.1430, extension 5.
