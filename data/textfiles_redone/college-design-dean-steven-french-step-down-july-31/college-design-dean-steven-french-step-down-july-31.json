This is due to innovative research- and technology-focused academic programs, which are unique among U.S. design colleges. New programs include the Bachelor of Science in Music Technology, the Master of Real Estate Development, and the minors in Industrial Design and in Sustainable Cities. \u00a0Increased philanthropic support, including new endowed chairs and graduate fellowships, is also a credit to French\u2019s tenure as dean.\nFrench has served as dean of the College of Design since 2013 and has held the John Portman Dean\u2019s Chair since 2014. In 2016, he led the transition from the College of Architecture to the College of Design. He joined Tech in 1992 as the director of and a professor in the City and Regional Planning Program. His expertise in sustainable urban development and natural hazard mitigation has contributed to Georgia Tech\u2019s visibility in these areas.\nThe College will remain under Dean French\u2019s leadership while a search commences. Details on the search process and the leadership transition will be announced later this spring.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nOffice of the Provost\nEmail\nprovostsoffice@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
