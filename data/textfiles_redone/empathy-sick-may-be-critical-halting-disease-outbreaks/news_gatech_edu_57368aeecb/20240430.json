Healthy people attempting to protect themselves couldn\u2019t, by themselves, stop the disease from spreading. Among the key factors was empathy of infected persons.\n\u201cWe wanted to understand disease dynamics from an individual\u2019s perspective,\u201d said Ceyhun Eksin, a postdoctoral fellow in the laboratory of Georgia Tech\nSchool of Biological Sciences\nProfessor\nJoshua S. Weitz . \u201cIn particular, we wanted to know what role individual behavior plays in disease spread and how behavior might affect forecasting and consequences in the long run when there is an outbreak.\u201d\nThe research, reported March 14 in the journal\nScientific Reports , was sponsored by the U.S. Army Research Office. The work used mathematical models that took into account how infectious diseases spread and the effects of measures taken to control them.\nPublic health initiatives against seasonal diseases like influenza tend to initially focus on immunization programs, which move individuals out of the \u201csusceptible\u201d category. Once an outbreak begins, health campaigns focus on encouraging susceptible persons to take precautions such as hand-washing and avoiding infected people.\nThe success of those measures may depend on individual perceptions of how great the risk of infection might be, Eksin noted. The more awareness individuals have of infected persons around them, the more likely they are to protect themselves. Perception can also affect the behavior of infected individuals, who may be more likely to stay home from work or cover their cough, for instance, if they believe their presence could infect a significant number of people.\n\u201cIf an infected person really wants to attend a meeting at work, it\u2019s one thing if only one other person could be at risk,\u201d he said. \u201cIt may be a different thing if they could affect a whole office of susceptible people.\u201d\nThe empathy of sick persons becomes especially important toward the end of an outbreak, when the number of infected persons may be low, but still enough to sustain the illness. When the number of sick people is low, risk perception falls, leading susceptible people to reduce their precautions \u2013 and sick people to feel less concern about infecting others.\nIf those sick persons then decide to head off to work despite their illness, they may infect unsuspecting susceptible people, causing the outbreak to continue. \u201cThe behavior of the infected individuals can be more important than the behavior of the susceptible individuals in eradicating the disease,\u201d said Eksin. \u201cA little bit of empathy can be crucial at this point.\u201d\nWhile the research examined the results of individual actions during an outbreak, those individual decisions were actually related because individuals are part of networks of contacts.\n\u201cIn a connected network, everyone\u2019s activities can affect you in one way or another,\u201d Eksin said. \u201cIf your sick neighbors decide to isolate themselves, then you don\u2019t need to take any action to protect yourself against them. But you don\u2019t necessarily know what your neighbors are doing, and their actions may well be affected by what others are doing. The effect can cascade.\u201d\nWhile calculating such interactions could be intractable from a computing standpoint, the authors introduced an algorithm based on game theoretic concepts that allows a logical resolution. \u201cOur analysis provides a principled response to recent calls to integrate game theory with disease dynamics to understand how individuals should act in response to disease development.\u201d\nThe results of the work may improve the ability to predict individual behavior such as risk aversion or empathy. That would allow better forecasting of outbreaks and facilitate more efficient use of resources such as vaccines and public health awareness advertising. But additional information may be required to effectively make such predictions, Eksin said.\nChanging individual behavior in response to risk perception may point toward the importance of adjusting communication campaigns as disease fluctuates. And the importance of self-isolating for infected individuals may suggest more awareness initiatives aimed specifically at that group rather than susceptible persons.\n\u201cWhen we studied individual behavior, empathy trumped risk aversion in disease eradication, which was counterintuitive for us,\u201d Eksin added. \u201cWe need to champion the benefits of empathy by sick individuals to eradicate disease in the community.\u201d\nThis research is supported by the Army Research Office under grant W911NF-14-1-0402, and in part by KAUST.
