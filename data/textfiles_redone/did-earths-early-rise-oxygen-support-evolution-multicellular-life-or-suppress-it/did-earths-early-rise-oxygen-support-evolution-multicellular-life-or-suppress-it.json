Georgia Tech researchers report a more complex effect\nFacebook\nTwitter\nEmail\nMay 14, 2021\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nScientists have long thought that there was a direct connection between the rise in atmospheric oxygen, which started with the\u00a0 Great Oxygenation Event \u00a02.5 billion years ago, and the rise of large, complex multicellular organisms.\nThat theory, the \u201cOxygen Control Hypothesis,\u201d suggests that the size of these\u00a0early multicellular organisms was limited by the depth to which oxygen could diffuse into their bodies. The hypothesis makes a simple prediction that has been highly influential within both evolutionary biology and geosciences: Greater atmospheric oxygen should always increase the size to which multicellular organisms can grow.\nIt\u2019s a hypothesis that\u2019s proven difficult to test in a lab. Yet a team of Georgia Tech researchers found a way \u2014 using directed evolution, synthetic biology, and mathematical modeling \u2014 all brought to bear on a simple multicellular lifeform called a \u2018 snowflake yeast \u2019. The results? Significant new information on the correlations between oxygenation of the early Earth and the rise of large multicellular organisms \u2014 and it\u2019s all about exactly how much O 2\u00a0 was available to some of our earliest multicellular ancestors.\n\u201cThe positive effect of oxygen on the evolution of multicellularity is entirely dose-dependent \u2014 our planet's first oxygenation would have strongly constrained, not promoted, the evolution of multicellular life,\u201d explains\u00a0 G. Ozan Bozdag , research scientist in the\u00a0 School of Biological Sciences \u00a0and the study\u2019s lead author. \u201cThe positive effect of oxygen on multicellular size may only be realized when it reaches high levels.\u201d\n\u201cOxygen suppression of macroscopic multicellularity\u201d\nis published in the May 14, 2021 edition of the journal\nNature Communications .\u00a0 Bozdag\u2019s co-authors on the paper include Georgia Tech researchers\u00a0 Will Ratcliff , associate professor in the School of Biological Sciences;\u00a0 Chris Reinhard , associate professor in the\u00a0 School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences ;\u00a0 Rozenn Pineau , Ph.D. student in the School of Biological Sciences and the\u00a0 Interdisciplinary Graduate Program in Quantitative Biosciences (QBioS) ; along with\u00a0 Eric Libby , assistant professor at Umea University in Sweden and the\u00a0 Santa Fe Institute \u00a0in New Mexico.\nDirecting yeast to evolve in record time\n\u201cWe show that the effect of oxygen is more complex than previously imagined. The early rise in global oxygen should in fact strongly\u00a0 constrain\u00a0 the evolution of macroscopic multicellularity, rather than selecting for larger and more complex organisms,\u201d notes Ratcliff.\n\u201cPeople have long believed that the oxygenation of Earth's surface was helpful \u2014 some going so far as to say it is a precondition \u2014 for the evolution of large, complex multicellular organisms,\u201d he adds. \u201cBut nobody has ever tested this directly, because we haven't had a model system that is both able to undergo lots of generations of evolution quickly, and able to grow over the full range of oxygen conditions,\u201d from anaerobic conditions up to modern levels.\nThe researchers were able to do that, however, with snowflake yeast, simple multicellular organisms capable of rapid evolutionary change. By varying their growth environment, they evolved snowflake yeast for over 800 generations in the lab with selection for larger size.\nThe results surprised Bozdag. \u201cI was astonished to see that multicellular yeast doubled their size very rapidly when they could not use oxygen, while populations that evolved in the moderately oxygenated environment showed no size increase at all,\u201d he says. \u201cThis effect is robust \u2014 even over much longer timescales.\u201d\nSize \u2014 and oxygen levels \u2014 matter for multicellular growth\nIn the team\u2019s research, \u201clarge size easily evolved\u00a0either when our yeast had no oxygen or plenty of it, but not when oxygen was present at low levels,\u201d Ratcliff says. \u201cWe did a lot more work to show that this is actually a totally predictable and understandable outcome of the fact that oxygen, when limiting, acts as a resource \u2014 if cells can access it, they get a big metabolic benefit. When oxygen is scarce, it can't diffuse very far into organisms, so there is an evolutionary incentive for multicellular organisms to be small \u2014 allowing most of their cells access to oxygen \u2014 a constraint that is not there when oxygen simply isn't present, or when there's enough of it around to diffuse more deeply into tissues.\u201d\nRatcliff says not only does his group\u2019s work challenge the Oxygen Control Hypothesis, it also helps science understand why so little apparent evolutionary innovation was happening in the world of multicellular organisms in the billion years after the Great Oxygenation Event. Ratcliff explains that geologists call this period the \u201cBoring Billion\u201d in Earth\u2019s history \u2014 also known as the Dullest Time in Earth's History, and Earth's Middle Ages \u2014 a period when oxygen was present in the atmosphere, but at low levels, and multicellular organisms stayed relatively small and simple.\nBozdag adds another insight into the unique nature of the study. \u201cPrevious work examined the interplay between oxygen and multicellular size mainly through the physical principles of gas diffusion,\u201d he says. \u201cWhile that reasoning is essential, we also need an inclusive consideration of principles of Darwinian evolution when studying the origin of complex multicellular life on our planet.\u201d Finally being able to advance organisms through many generations of evolution helped the researchers accomplish just that, Bozdag adds.\nThis work was supported by\u00a0National Science Foundation grant no.\u00a0DEB-1845363 to W.C.R, NSF\u00a0grant no.
