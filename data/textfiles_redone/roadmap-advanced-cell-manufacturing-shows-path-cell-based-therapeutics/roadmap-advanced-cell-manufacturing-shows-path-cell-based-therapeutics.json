Over the past decade, new and emerging cell-based medical technologies have been developed to manage and possibly cure many conditions and diseases. In 2012 alone, these technologies treated more than 160,000 patients. Before these treatments can be more widely available, however, the cell therapeutics community will have to develop the capability for advanced, large-scale manufacturing of high-quality and consistent living cells. To advance that goal, the Georgia Research Alliance (GRA) and the Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech) have launched the National Cell Manufacturing Consortium (NCMC), an industry-academic-government partnership that recently released the National Roadmap for Advanced Cell Manufacturing. Establishment of the consortium and development of this 10-year national roadmap was sponsored by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The roadmap was announced June 13 at the White House Organ Summit. \u201cThe cell manufacturing roadmap effort is mission critical to establish the United States as the world leader in cell therapy manufacturing,\u201d said Greg Russotti, Ph.D., vice-president of technical operations for Celgene Cellular Therapeutics. \u201cCell therapies offer exciting next-generation opportunities that may help patients live longer and better lives, reduce the burden on health care and benefit society. Producing sufficient quantities of high quality cell therapies so that patients have access will not be possible without significant advances in the field of cell therapy manufacturing. Industrial, academic, and government stakeholders collaborated to construct this roadmap, which delineates our path to U.S. leadership in the emerging field of cell therapy production.\u201d Development of the roadmap required strong support and involvement from more than 60 representatives from industry, government and nonprofit organizations. \u201cMilliporeSigma (formerly EMD Millipore) supports consortia, like the National Cell Manufacturing Consortium, that bring together industry, innovators, clinicians and academics to advance the field of cell therapy,\u201d said Martha S. Rook, Ph.D., head of novel therapies for the company. \u201cThe consortium\u2019s cell manufacturing roadmap is a valuable resource to help identify and address challenges in cell manufacturing.\u201d While research has demonstrated the value of cell therapies \u2013 using adult stem cells and immune system cells \u2013 improvements are needed to make these cells broadly available to the medical community. \u201cThe aspirin you buy today from one pharmacy is essentially the same as the aspirin you buy from another pharmacy, but cell-based therapies may have different efficacy depending on the source and manufacturing processes,\u201d said\nKrishnendu Roy , Robert A. Milton Chair and professor in the\nWallace H. Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering\nat Georgia Tech and Emory University. \u201cThere are established ways to quickly assess the efficacy and safety of small-molecule drugs that are acceptable around the world. We want to develop and establish similar processes for therapeutic cell manufacturing.\u201d Established in 2014 through a NIST Advanced Manufacturing Technology (AMTech) grant, the NCMC is an industry-driven consortium including cell manufacturing experts from industry, academic research, clinical good manufacturing practice (GMP) centers, government agencies and private foundations. Georgia is positioning itself to be at the forefront of this new and growing market with its research institutions playing a vital role in the consortium. Researchers from Emory University, Georgia Tech, and the University of Georgia are contributing to the ongoing work of the NCMC. The Atlanta-based Marcus Foundation recently made a major gift to Georgia Tech to establish the\nMarcus Center for Therapeutic Cell Characterization and Manufacturing\n(MC3M). The new center, the first of its kind in the United States, will develop processes and techniques for ensuring the consistent, low-cost, large-scale manufacture of high-quality living cells used in cell-based therapies. \u201cThe NIST grant kick-started our efforts to develop a national roadmap for cell manufacturing\u201d said Michael Cassidy, president and CEO of the\nGeorgia Research Alliance . \u201cThe cell manufacturing industry is an emerging and growing industry with annual revenues of over $1 billion. Completion of this roadmap positions Georgia at the forefront of one of the most exciting new initiatives of this century.\u201d For more information on the National Cell Manufacturing Consortium and to view the roadmap, visit\nhttp://cellmanufacturingusa.org . About Georgia Research Alliance The Georgia Research Alliance (GRA) works to expand research and commercialization capacity in Georgia\u2019s universities to recruit world-class talent, seed new companies and transform lives. For over twenty-five years, GRA has worked to strengthen the university research enterprise in Georgia by working in partnership with the University System of Georgia and the Georgia Department of Economic Development to create the companies and jobs of Georgia\u2019s future.
