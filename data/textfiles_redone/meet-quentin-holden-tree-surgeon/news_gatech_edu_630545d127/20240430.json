So, it makes sense to have a tree surgeon to aid in the care and feeding of such a large canopy. That\u2019s where Quentin Holden comes in.\nHolden, certified as an arborist through the International Society of Arboriculture, is a tree surgeon in Facilities. The job has a wide range of duties.\n\u201cI never do the same thing on a long-term basis,\u201d he said. \u201cYesterday I was pruning trees with a pole saw. A few days before that, I was climbing a tree and cutting limbs. At other times I\u2019m putting out fertilizer or watering. It\u2019s very diverse and very interesting.\u201d\nHolden\u2019s interest in trees and working outdoors stems from childhood. His father owned a tree removal company, and when Holden was 13 he spent the summer helping his dad clear saplings from a client\u2019s property. The client had a lake on the property, and Holden was allowed to fish there.\n\u201cAfter that, I connected trees with fishing and the outdoors,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a good experience.\u201d\nAfter graduating from Ridgeview High School (now Ridgeview Charter School) in Sandy Springs, Georgia, Holden went to Abraham Baldwin Agricultural College in Tifton, Georgia, to study forestry. He became homesick after a year, thinking forestry really wasn\u2019t what he wanted to do.\n\u201cThey were talking about working way out in the back country, and I wanted to be in a more urban setting,\u201d he said. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t much happening with urban forestry at the time. So, I came back to Atlanta and decided to study history at Georgia State University.\u201d\nHolden earned a degree in history in 1990. He worked in the corporate world for a few years before joining the Peace Corps in 1993 and going to Grenada to work as a junior forester. There he managed the building of trails in a national forest, surveyed an acre plot in the Grand Etang National Park, and managed a mahogany tree-planting site.\nWhen he returned to the U.S., he got a job with AmeriCorps in their soil conservation program in the Clayton County Extension Office. He also went back to school at night to get certified to teach.\nHe put his love of trees on hold for 11 years while he taught geography, Georgia history, and world history to grades 8 through 10 at North Clayton High School and Decatur city schools. But the trees kept calling him. So, he studied to become certified as an arborist, which he achieved in 2000 while teaching.\n\u201cIn 2008 I decided to take a jump from teaching history to get into doing what I love doing most \u2014 being an arborist and working outside,\u201d he said. After working with Trees Atlanta for about six months, Holden operated his own tree planting business for three years before coming to Tech in 2012.\n\u201cI always liked Georgia Tech because my dad had gone to school here before being drafted into the Navy. So, we had a connection with Georgia Tech growing up,\u201d he said.\nMaintaining Healthy Trees\nOne of Holden\u2019s favorite parts of his job is keeping the trees in good condition.\n\u201cI like climbing large trees and improving their health,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of them have bounced back after we removed some dead wood and cleaned them up. It\u2019s nice to see their health improve and to be a part of that.\u201d\nEven when being proactive and providing good care, sometimes a tree has to be removed for safety. Big Al, the massive oak tree that split last year, is one example.\n\u201cWe\u2019re very reluctant to remove large trees,\u201d Holden said, \u201cbecause even if it\u2019s diseased a lot of people would be upset. We want to make sure we\u2019re doing the right thing. Safety is the most important thing.\u201d\nHolden said they only remove a large tree if removal is the only option that will keep the campus and students safe.\n\u201cThe main reasons to remove a tree is it\u2019s either dead, dying, or diseased. If it were to fall on its own, it could harm someone, a vehicle, or other property. These are the things we look out for,\u201d he said. \u201cBefore removing a tree, we have two outside arborists evaluate the tree to make sure that what I say is correct and to make their recommendations as well.\u201d\nHolden urges everyone on campus to be aware of work zones around trees.\n\u201cThe caution tape is there for your safety. Limbs may be falling, so please don\u2019t walk through the area,\u201d he said.\nAlthough Holden spends his days working on trees, he often takes time to appreciate their beauty.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a nice sycamore tree on the back side of the J.S. Coon Building,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the winter it looks like a large bone because the bark flakes off.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nGeorgia Tech Tree Viewer\nRemembering Big Al\nRead More Staff Stories\nContact\nVictor Rogers\nInstitute Communications\nEmail\nvictor.rogers@comm.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
