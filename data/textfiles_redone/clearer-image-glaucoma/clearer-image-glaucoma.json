These\naggregates of proteins form in the body when a protein loses its normal structure and misfolds or mutates. And s ince many of these proteins are large and complicated, just how some of these mutations occur and aggregate remains a mystery \u2014 as does the creation of effective treatments.\nNew research on glaucoma led by Georgia Tech chemists and an alumna may help change that.\n\u201cThere has been a lot of work done to understand how smaller folded proteins form amyloid aggregates, but this study helps us to understand the aggregation pathway of a larger, more complex system,\u201d says co-first author\nEmily Saccuzzo . That work could one day help scientists uncover new modes of treatment\n\u2014\nnot just for glaucoma, but for other diseases caused by protein aggregation, as well.\nSaccuzzo started the project in 2018 as a graduate student in the Lieberman Lab in the\nSchool of Chemistry and Biochemistry\nat Georgia Tech, and is now a Postdoctoral Research Associate at Pacific Northwest National Labs. \u201cEmily was a summer student before she matriculated, and she established the initial feasibility of doing these experiments,\u201d says\nRaquel Lieberman ,\nprofessor and Sepcic Pfeil\nChair in Chemistry at Georgia Tech. \u201cI'm immensely proud of her.\u201d\nTheir research team's recent findings are featured in a new paper, \u201cCompetition between inside-out unfolding and pathogenic aggregation in an amyloid-forming \u03b2-propeller,\" published in the journal\u00a0 Nature Communications .\nLieberman and Saccuzzo brought together researchers from throughout and beyond the Institute to collaborate on the study.\n\u201cThis was a very multi-disciplinary project, and that's always really satisfying,\u201d Lieberman says. \u201cI think when you bring more people to the table, you can answer hard questions and do more than you can do on your own.\u201d\nThe Georgia Tech research team include s\nHailee F.

Van Horn\nof Arizona State University as well as\nRenhao Li\nof the\nEmory University School of Medicine.\nA complicated protein\nWhile many studies have focused on smaller proteins, called model proteins, that have established \u2018rules\u2019 and known patterns for amyloid-formation (a specialized type of protein aggregation), the protein that contributes to glaucoma is larger and more complex. This type of larger, complicated protein is relatively unstudied.\n\u201cWe had known for a while that mutations in myocilin can cause the protein to misfold and aggregate, which in turn leads to glaucoma,\u201d Saccuzzo says. \u201cWhat we didn\u2019t know, however, was the exact mechanism by which this protein misfolds and aggregates.\n\u201cThe goal of this study was to determine how disease mutants are misfolded, in hopes that that would give us insight into the early steps in the aggregation pathway,\u201d she adds.\nLocated at the interface between the white of the eye and the colored iris, the protein forms a tiny small ring all the way around the eye. \u201cEvery time you blink, you stretch that muscle. Every time the wind blows really strong, or you get something in your eye. Every time you rub your eye, you could be affecting this protein \u2014 even when it's not causing disease,\u201d Lieberman says. Still, scientists aren\u2019t sure what the protein does. \u201cWe only know what it's doing when it's causing trouble,\u201d like glaucoma, she explains. \u201cWe don't know what its actual biological function is.\u201d\nLieberman was initially attracted to the idea of studying the protein because she wondered if the research done on the model proteins might be applicable to the protein causing glaucoma. \u201cThe really early studies showed that it was likely similar to these model proteins that form amyloid,\u201d Lieberman says. \u201cI wanted to look into that because if we could show that that was true, then we could tap into the amazing resources and research done on model systems to help us combat the disease.\u201d\nAn unpredictable system\n\u201cThis was one of the largest amyloid-forming proteins characterized to date,\u201d Sacc uzzo says, and while the team hoped that they would find similarities to model proteins, the larger glaucoma-associated protein showed increased complexity.\n\u201cI think one of the most surprising observations that we made is that the protein itself is not at equilibrium for about 90 days after it\u2019s made,\u201d Lieberman adds. \u201cOne of the tenets of protein chemistry is that amino acid sequences adopt a unique structure, and that all of the information needed to fold the protein into its 3D structure is held in that amino acid sequence.\u201d\nHere, the protein was shimmying a small amount, meaning that it wasn\u2019t at equilibrium. \u201cThere's so much more going on in the system than anyone could have imagined,\u201d Lieberman explains. \u201cWe assume that the shape controls some of the properties, but this is another mystery of this protein.\u201d\nBecause the protein is so complicated and isn\u2019t at equilibrium, \u201cthere is a long list of the things we can\u2019t predict,\u201d says Lieberman, adding that it makes computer predictions difficult, along with certain experiments. \u201cThat was a moment when we thought: wow, here's this new system that people should think about. The rules might be refined to help us better understand what's going on.\u201d\nThe future of protein modeling\nWhile further research will need to be conducted in order to determine how best to treat glaucoma, the study provides a critical foundation for future studies. \u201cWhat is not clear to me right now is whether we would be able to find one drug for all the people who have mutations, or if we need a specific drug for each type of mutation that we would encounter,\u201d Lieberman says. While the research doesn\u2019t prove that one treatment might not be effective for all, \u201cit certainly shows that there's a lot more to this system than we ever expected.\u201d\n\u201cUnderstanding what disease mutants look like at the molecular level could help pave the way for structurally-specific glaucoma therapeutics and diagnostic tools,\u201d Saccuzzo adds.\nLieberman and Saccuzzo also underscore that the work done to understand the protein responsible for glaucoma can also be applied to other large proteins.\n\u201cAt the end of the day, more proteins are not model proteins than\nare\nmodel proteins,\u201d Lieberman says. \u201cThere are many more systems out there, and I suspect that there are many more proteins that can aggregate and may contribute to disease or aging that have yet to be explored. I think this research shows the value of bringing lots of different approaches to probing a complicated system to learn more about it.\u201d\nDOI:\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-44479-2\nResearch reported in this publication was supported by the National Institutes of Health award numbers R01EY021205 (RLL, WVH), R41EY031203 (RLL), R01GM123169 (JCG), and R35GM141933 (WVH).
