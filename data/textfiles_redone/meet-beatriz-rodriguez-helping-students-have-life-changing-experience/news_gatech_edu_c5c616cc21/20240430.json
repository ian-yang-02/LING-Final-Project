Then she worked in the Office of Undergraduate Education as a learning specialist/academic coach. In 2021 she moved to the Scheller College of Business, where she is the assistant dean of Student Engagement for the Undergraduate Program Office, working with the academic advising team and the leadership team to ensure that students have a successful and life-changing experience.\n\u201cMy job touches a little bit of all the operations of the student life cycle, from orientation to graduation,\u201d she said. \u201cI want students to take advantage of the available opportunities for growth and development. I help them get into the classes they need and make them aware of the different clubs that can nurture their leadership styles as they start their careers,\u201d said Rodriguez, who isn\u2019t always directly in front of the students because they all have their own academic advisor. \u201cIt\u2019s exciting to observe everything from behind the scenes and see how the students grow throughout the four or five years they are here.\u201d\nOne of the most rewarding parts of her job is interacting with members of the Scheller community. \u201cIt brings a smile to my face as I walk through the halls and interact with students, faculty, and staff that I know by name. It\u2019s more than a casual hello. We stop and talk about our work as well as our families or vacation plans. It\u2019s the people that make this place special.\u201d\nAway From Work\nRodriguez grew up in Medell\u00edn, Colombia. She came to the U.S. as an international student to attend Kennesaw State University, where she earned a degree in marketing. She also has a master\u2019s degree in professional counseling from Georgia State University. Soon she will become certified as a professional coach with the International Coaching Federation.\n\u201cI found my passion in coaching while at Tech. I really enjoy talking to people and helping them come up with their own solutions to their problems.\u201d\nRodriguez jokes that she has too many hobbies, from knitting to gardening to riding the Peloton bike she purchased in 2020 at the start of the pandemic. \u201cEverything was shutting down. I knew I would go stir crazy if I had to stay in my house, so I got a Peloton to keep active.\u201d\nShe rides about four times a week and often interacts with other members of the Tech community who have a Peloton. \u201cEvery time you log into a class there\u2019s a leaderboard,\u201d she said. \u201cYou get to see who else is biking at that moment. You can compete against them, but I usually don\u2019t because I\u2019m at the bottom of the leadership board.\u201d\nDuring the pandemic she also taught herself to knit, and she learned how to garden. \u201cI always thought that I didn\u2019t have a green thumb because I would kill my houseplants by overwatering or underwatering them,\u201d she said. Now she has houseplants she has kept alive for several years. \u201cI also started a little garden outside and I have successfully grown tomatoes, cucumbers, squash, zucchini, basil, and cilantro.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nRead More Staff Stories\nContact\nVictor Rogers\nInstitute Communications\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
