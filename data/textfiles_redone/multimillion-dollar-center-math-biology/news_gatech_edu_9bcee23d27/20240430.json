The National Science Foundation and the Simons Foundation have launched four\u00a0centers to\u00a0do this, funded with $40 million, one of which is headquartered at Georgia Tech and will receive a fourth\u00a0of the funding.\nFor centuries, together mathematics and physics have shifted paradigms in science and rattled human perception by predicting planetary orbits, theorizing relativity or explaining how one particle can be in two places at the same time. Can theoretical math and biosystems team up to similarly shake the foundations of knowledge?\n\u201cWe certainly think it\u2019s possible,\u201d said Christine Heitsch,\u00a0 a professor in Georgia Tech\u2019s School of Mathematics \u00a0who leads the new regional center. \u201cBut our immediate goals are more realistic,\u201d she said. \u201cOur first step is getting more mathematicians and bioscience researchers\u00a0working together in research collaborations.\"\nBio-math synergy\nOn an everyday basis, that means the Southeast Center for Mathematics and Biology (SCMB) headquartered at Georgia Tech will tackle open questions in biology using novel math.\n\u201cMath can potentially change the way we do our experiments,\u201d said Hang Lu,\u00a0 a professor in Georgia Tech\u2019s School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering \u00a0who co-leads of the center. \u201cIf you model your data with topology (a field of mathematics) you see that your data can have a shape,\u201d Lu said. \u201cAnd that can make you go look for different kinds of data.\u201d\n\u201cIt will be a two-way street,\u201d Heitsch said. \u201cMath always benefits when it\u2019s challenged by reality.\u201d\nOver time, the math-bio spiral could lead to eureka moments.\n\u201cBiological systems can look overwhelmingly complex, and that just means we haven\u2019t found the right way of looking at them yet,\u201d Heitsch said.\nNSF vision\nThe SCMB is one of three NSF-Simons Research Centers for Mathematics of Complex Biological Systems. The other two are based at Harvard University and at the University of California, Irvine. Together, they will not only advance the math-biosciences synergy but also spread their knowledge to hundreds of undergraduate and K-12 students throughout the region through educational outreaches.\nThe SCMB comprises 14 researchers, including collaborators throughout the Southeastern United States. Tulane University, the University of Florida, the University of South Florida, Clemson University, and the Oak Ridge National Laboratory are each contributing a mathematician, and one bioscientist is based at Duke University.\n\u201cThis project has visionary potential to shake up the way we view biological systems, and also expand mathematics,\u201d said\u00a0 Julia Kubanek, Associate Dean of Research in Georgia Tech\u2019s College of Sciences . \u201cThe National Science Foundation and the Simons Foundation have shown tremendous foresight in creating these three centers, and I think headquartering one at Georgia Tech is a great fit because cross-connecting research disciplines is already one of our core missions.\u201d\nBiosciences enigmas\nTo understand the particular value of combining math with biosciences, it\u2019s important to not conflate the latter with physics.\nA graphic depiction of canalization. The path of the ball represents the development toward a phenotype, which may start with varying genetic foundations but roll out to secure phenotypical outcomes. But canalization can also lead to more than one possible phenotypical outcome from one set of genes.\nFor example, in relativity, near-light speeds change an object\u2019s mass, its length, and its passage through time. Those warped phenomena and their equations aren\u2019t so applicable in the world of experimental biosciences, which live in a more Newtonian reality, but one with intricate enigmas for math to demystify.\nTake the phenomenon called\u00a0 canalization , which saves living things from the little genetic snafus inside of us all by making sure that proper physical traits usually get produced in spite of mutations.\nClone contradictions\nCanalization shatters a stubborn popular notion that genes determine how an organism is built.\n\u201cGenes are not deterministic,\u201d said Lu, who is Love Family Professor. She studies the intricate pathways that lead from genetic foundations to measurable physical or behavioral traits, or phenotypes, in\u00a0 C.\u00a0 elegans \u00a0roundworms. \u201cYou often have two individuals with identical genotypes (specific sets of genes) that have different sets of phenotypes.\u201d\nThat means that canalization may not offer just one but two options -- or more -- to form a trait based on a single set of genes. \u201cWhat fascinates me is that you can have ( C.\u00a0 elegans ) clones that are genetically identical but exhibit different behavior,\u201d Heitsch said.\nCanalization is not new; it dates to 1942. But its labyrinthine mechanisms and how they \u201cchose\u201d one phenotypical pathway over the other still contain many mysteries. \u201cMaybe math can help us find answers,\u201d Lu said.\nLabyrinthine intricacies\nAlgebra has already taken up canalization \u00a0but at the SCMB, more maths will join in.\u00a0 Topology , computation, stochastics (principles of randomness), and geometry may enlighten canalization\u2019s myriad interworkings of DNA, RNA, enzymes, protein folding, and just plain randomness.\nOther questions SCMB bioscientists and mathematicians are pursuing:\nHow do stem cells know whether to become a neuron or a skin cell?\nHow does one cell transport molecules to others?\nWhat exactly does RNA do to help repair DNA damage?\nHeitsch, for example, specializes in a field of mathematics called\u00a0 combinatorics , and she applies it to the way molecules of RNA fold.\nHistorical divergence\nBiology is no stranger to stochastics or computation in the analysis of its data, but it has been much less connected than other sciences to the aerial acrobatics of theoretical mathematics.\n\u201cThere is enormous unrealized potential in applying more theoretical areas of math like algebra, topology, and geometry,\u201d Heitsch said. \u201cThat\u2019s new territory, which also means new risks. But we\u2019ve hedged our bets with mathematics already more used in biology to get guaranteed returns.\u201d\nBiology and theoretical math have not interfaced much in the past for a couple of reasons.\nThe endless intricacies of biology, from hundreds of thousands of species to countless biomolecular structures, has made it a gathering and cataloging science for centuries with data that is tough to unify. Also, much data has had to wait for technology to be invented to collect it.\n\u201cBiology hasn\u2019t had the measurement tools until just recently, like mass spectrometry and high-end microscopy, to get the hard data needed for math to work with,\u201d Lu said. \u201cNow is a great time for biology and math to come together,\u201d she said.\nCultural exchange\nAlso, history has separated the disciplines. For centuries, physicists were also mathematicians and vice versa. \u201cAnd they were engineers,\u201d Lu said. But biologists?\n\u201cDarwin was assuredly not a mathematician,\u201d Heitsch said. \u201cHe said he didn\u2019t understand as much math as he would have liked to.\u201d\nNot many mathematicians have been biologists either.\nThe NSF-Simons Foundation centers are building the bridge to join them, and the SCMB at Georgia Tech makes for a good pillar. Most of its bioscience researchers\u00a0already know engineering or physics math, and its mathematicians are already delving into life sciences.\nEditor's Note: This article is a slightly modified clone of the\nfeature story by Ben Brumfield published on May 24, 2018 in Research Horizons online .\nThis article was corrected on May 30, 2018, to reflect corrections\u00a0in the original story about the number of centers (four), total funding ($40 M), and the Georgia Tech's share (one-fourth).\nAdditional Images\nContact\nWriter &\u00a0Media Representative : Ben Brumfield (404-660-1408)\u00a0 Georgia Institute of Technology\n177 North Avenue\nAtlanta, Georgia \u00a030332-0181 \u00a0USA\nEmail\nben.brumfield@comm.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
