The expanded undergraduate offerings target a wider range of job and research opportunities \u2014 from academia to analytics, NASA to NOAA, meteorology to marine science, climate and earth science, to policy, law, consulting, sustainability, and beyond.\nThe\nBoard of Regents of the University System of Georgia\nhas approved two new specific degrees within the School: Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences (AOS) and Solid Earth and Planetary Sciences (SEP). Regents also approved Environmental Science (ENVS) as an interdisciplinary College of Sciences degree between the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences and the\nSchool of Biological Sciences . The existing Earth and Atmospheric Sciences B.S. degree will sunset in two years for new students.\n\u201cWe are really excited to be able to offer this new interdisciplinary undergraduate degree program in Environmental Science,\u201d said\nJean Lynch-Stieglitz,\nADVANCE Professor in Earth and Atmospheric Sciences (EAS). \u201cWhile it was developed jointly between the Schools of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences and Biological Sciences, it brings together Georgia Tech\u2019s broad expertise and course offerings related to the Earth\u2019s environment from across the Institute.\u201d\n\u201cWe are excited to see these new programs develop,\u201d added\nAndrew Newman , professor and the School\u2019s undergraduate coordinator, \u201cas these degrees highlight the quantitative and computational skills of Georgia Tech students, and align better with their interests in global understanding of problems related to environmental impact and sustainability, natural hazards and landscape development, as well as planetary evolution, habitability, and exploration.\u201d\n\u201cStudents looking for specific types of programs will also be more understanding of what their program offers,\u201d Newman said. \u201cUnder our current degree, a student interested in ocean science, planetary science, and environmental chemistry all would be looking at the same degree that doesn\u2019t define their interests. Now, having programs with those interests in their name, and described well on the upcoming webpage, will greatly increase their interest in our program.\u201d\nThe Evolution of EAS at Georgia Tech\nNewman also shared that, in Fall 2021, the School surveyed current EAS undergraduate students and recent alumni for feedback and thoughts on the potential degrees. Responses from the community highlighted that the plan for transitioning the existing major could not only help new students hone their academic and career plans, but also help them communicate beyond EAS about their chosen major.\n\u201cThese degrees make it more clear what the student is studying,\u201d shared one student. \u201cBefore, people would ask what my major \u2018even is\u2019 and what kinds of jobs I could get with it. I think the new majors make it more clear.\u201d\n\u201cFinally, Planetary Science!\u201d said another student. \u201cThis degree would go well with a Physics or AE (Aerospace Engineering) certificate or dual degree.\u201d\nAll about the new Georgia Tech EAS degrees\nThe expanded undergraduate degree offerings are designed to continue Georgia Tech\u2019s reputation for academic rigor \u2014\u00a0and also reflect trends in student interests, as well as current and forecasted needs in the job marketplace.\n\u201cA key aspect of the new Environmental Science degree program will be its flexibility,\u201d said Lynch-Stieglitz. \u201cStudents will be able to focus their study to support their interests and career goals whether those be in conservation, climate change, or environmental health. We\u2019ve also left space in their program to encourage participation in especially impactful experiences such as study abroad and research projects. Georgia Tech students are fantastic \u2014 well prepared, diverse, smart, hard-working, and passionate. This flexible approach will allow them to become the broadly educated leaders who will envision the solutions to environmental problems that are so urgently needed.\u201d\nMore on the new undergraduate degrees and what they will require:\nB.S. Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences (AOS) Degree\nAOS\nuses the current Meteorology track as its foundation and will include aspects of Atmospheric Sciences, Oceanography and Climate Sciences.\nEAS will continue to offer courses needed for\nAmerican Meteorological Society (AMS)\ncertifications as well as those required for\neligibility for National Weather Service meteorology jobs .\nSome courses will be reduced and others added (e.g. the existing course Physics of Weather will now be formally required instead of Earth Processes; the National Weather Service Practical Internship course in partnership with NWS Peachtree City will continue).\nThe AOS degree is designed to take advantage of Atlanta as a \u201chotspot\u201d for major meteorological organizations including The Weather Channel, CNN, local stations in a top 10 TV market, and the National Weather Service (NWS) Peachtree City, Georgia office. The degree also builds on Georgia Tech\u2019s existing expertise in Atmospheric Chemistry, Oceanography, Climate Dynamics, Paleoclimatology and Paleoceanography, and meteorological research.\nAOS degree recipients\nlooking for jobs\nor graduate research can target the energy sector, insurance risk modeling, broadcast meteorology, consulting, data analytics, aviation, military, and K-12 education, among other positions.\nB.S. Environmental Science (ENVS) Degree\nENVS\nwas developed by a joint committee involving EAS and the School of Biological Sciences.\nENVS requires core content in mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, Earth sciences, and public policy.\nUpper level coursework allows students to customize their program of study based on interest.\nStudents will complete a capstone research project that integrates the knowledge they have gained through the program.\nThis degree takes advantage of Georgia Tech\u2019s expertise in Environmental Chemistry, climate science, marine science, Aquatic Chemical Ecology, microbial dynamics, and Environmental Policy. Newman added that there is a critical emerging market need for scientists with expertise in the Earth\u2019s environmental systems.\nThe ENVS degree will provide a strong base for students pursuing graduate programs and careers in environmental policy, environmental law, medicine, and other master\u2019s and Ph.D. programs in environmentally related disciplines.\nB.S. Solid Earth and Planetary Sciences (SEP) Degree\nSEP\nbuilds on the existing Earth Science track to include Planetary Sciences.\nThere is an opportunity to reduce some courses.\nSome courses will now be required (e.g. Physics II, Physics of Planets, Introduction to Geophysics).\nAccording to an SEP prospectus, \u201cthe degree will support Georgia Tech\u2019s mission to develop leaders who advance technology and improve the human condition, through developing holistically minded students that can put human development in context of the environment for which we live, including resource availability, hazards that affect sustainability, and our exploratory nature to understand our place on the planet and solar system.\u201d\nCareer and graduate opportunities include energy sector positions, NASA, NOAA, U.S. Geological Survey, environmental remediation, hazard assessment and data analytics.\nLearn more, contact EAS Undergraduate Advising, and apply:\neas.gatech.edu/undergraduate\neas.gatech.edu/aos\neas.gatech.edu/envs\neas.gatech.edu/sep\nRelated links\nGeorgia Tech School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences Undergraduate Program\nB.S.
