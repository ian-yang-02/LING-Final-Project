For the three students selected as reflection speakers for their fellow graduates, the task is one final challenge as well as a great honor.\nAt each of Georgia Tech\u2019s Commencement ceremonies (bachelor\u2019s, master\u2019s, and Ph.D.), a graduating student is given three minutes to deliver an inspiring message in front of an audience of graduates, families, and friends. This fall the bachelor\u2019s speaker is Jacques Crawford, in electrical and computer engineering. The master\u2019s speaker is Emily Farmer, also in electrical and computer engineering. And the Ph.D. speaker is Narayan Shirolkar in the School of Materials Science and Engineering.\nStudents must apply to become a reflection speaker. A panel of faculty, staff, and students selects a group of finalists who present a full version of their speech to the committee. The selected speakers are required to work with Tech\u2019s Communication Center to prepare for the big day.\nJacques Crawford\nWhen Jacques Crawford applied to be a reflection speaker, he thought it would be a cool opportunity to share his experience at Georgia Tech.\n\u201cI was definitely surprised that I was chosen as a finalist, but it felt good,\u201d he said. He will talk about what his Georgia Tech experience has taught him, and he will acknowledge his support system of family and friends.\nCrawford, who was born in Tampa, Florida, and grew up in Alpharetta, Georgia, comes from a family of engineers. His mom is an industrial engineer. His dad is an electrical engineer. His sister Kaylyn is a 2018 Tech graduate in biomedical engineering, and his brother Joshua is a junior in chemical engineering.\n\u201cOur parents guided us toward certain things like aerospace camp and AP classes,\u201d he said, explaining the family\u2019s penchant for engineering.\nCrawford completed his studies in August. In July, he began working for Google as a network engineer where he will do three rotations in the company over the course of two years. He is based in Sunnyvale, California, and works remotely.\nCrawford is expecting about 20 people to be there to help him celebrate his graduation.\nEmily Farmer\nTwo reasons drove Emily Farmer's decision to apply to be a reflection speaker \u2014 she loves public speaking, and she thought it would be a great way to celebrate her achievement.\n\u201cI had a very difficult time starting at Tech, and I had to leave the school for several semesters to address my mental health,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m proud of myself for making it to this point.\u201d\nThe main theme of Farmer\u2019s speech is that we all have a lot in common at Georgia Tech, but our differences are what make Tech special, and make us better people moving forward. She also will talk about taking a break now and then.\n\u201cI think that\u2019s the most important part,\u201d said Farmer, a native of Clarkesville, Georgia. \u201cAll of this has been based on my time here as a student, and what helped me find balance and happiness.\u201d\nNext spring, she will move to Dallas, Texas to work at Texas Instruments as a semiconductor packaging engineer. She is hard of hearing and has worn hearing aids since age 11. Eventually she would like to go into the field of assistive hearing devices for the deaf and hard of hearing.\n\u201cMy parents and sister will be attending Commencement, along with some very close friends who have helped me along the way toward this degree.\u201d\nNarayan Shirolkar\nWhen Narayan Shirolkar was considering topics for his speech, he had too many ideas for the allotted three minutes. Attending an information session for speakers provided clarity on what was expected and helped him streamline his thoughts.\n\u201cI had to really self-reflect on my journey to the Ph.D. program at Tech and the last few years,\u201d he said. \u201cThe speech is about acknowledging that we get where we are not just based on our merits but also because someone bets on our ability to become a force for positive change and gives us a chance. I chose this topic because it\u2019s something I have experienced and have heard from a lot of my fellow Ph.D. students.\u201d\nShirolkar has been involved in many student organizations over the years including graduate Student Government Association, Student Ambassadors, and the Yellow Jacket Flying Club.\n\u201cThis put me in a unique position to be able to reflect on the collective experience of my fellow Ph.D. students,\u201d he said. \u201cPlus, this is like a last hurrah before I officially become a Tech alumnus.\u201d\nShirolkar\u2019s parents will be watching the ceremony virtually from India, and he has invited a few Tech friends to celebrate with him in person. In January he will start work as a consultant with the Boston Consulting Group in Washington, D.C.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nVictor Rogers\nInstitute Communications\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
