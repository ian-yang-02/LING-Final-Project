Once complete, the plan will define a vision and strategy for the best use of the Institute\u2019s lands, both within and beyond the current core campus.\n\u201cThe creation of the Comprehensive Campus Plan will guide campus development and capital investments on and around the Atlanta campus for the future,\u201d said Maria Cimilluca, vice president for Infrastructure and Sustainability. \u201cThis is significant because it will also strengthen Georgia Tech as an anchor institution for the neighboring communities and Atlanta as a whole.\u201d\nSteeped in the Institute\u2019s strategic plan and commitment to people, research, and teaching, the CCP will demonstrate how Georgia Tech will lead and inspire by example in creating a roadmap for the sustainable development and management of the campus and surrounding communities.\nKey strategic principles of the CCP include:\nStudent-First Experience:\nEnhance the urban ecological landscape to create optimal places where students can thrive.\nAccess and Circulation:\nSupport universal access and promote physical and environmental wellness through intentional design for active modes of transport.\nCommunity:\nImprove the human condition and cultivate a safe, healthy, and equitable urban fabric through the development of dynamic community partnerships.\nConnectivity : Champion adaptive infrastructure that actively supports innovative methods and places for learning.\nTransformative Campus:\nFoster resiliency and radiate influence through sustainable development strategies that meet emerging and evolving campus needs.\nThe project team is led by members from Infrastructure and Sustainability\u2019s Planning, Design, and Construction team. The CCP will be developed in collaboration with individuals from Georgia Tech\u2019s campus and the Atlanta community. Through January 2023, the team will be working to develop plan concepts by:\nConducting community outreach (internal and external).\nForecasting campus needs based on 10-year scenarios.\nDeveloping the plan vision.\nCreating an interactive GIS-based decision-making tool.\nBeginning next week, campus community members are invited to learn more about the development of the CCP, including how they can contribute to and stay involved with this transformative project.\nThe first in-person open house will take place on Tuesday, Sept. 20, from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Tech Walkway. In addition, a virtual option will also be offered on Thursday, Sept. 22, from 11 a.m. to noon via Zoom\nhttps://gatech.zoom.us/j/95369936919 .\nIn the meantime, the campus community is invited to participate in an online visioning exercise to help inform classroom planning.
