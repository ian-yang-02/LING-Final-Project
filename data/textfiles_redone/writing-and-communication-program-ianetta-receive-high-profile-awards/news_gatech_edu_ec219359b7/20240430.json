Perhaps most gratifyingly, the citation demonstrates that the University System of Georgia likewise recognizes this excellence and values the holistic rhetorical education our students receive in the WCP.\u201d\nIanetta Honored for Influential Work\nIanetta received the Maxwell Award with Lauren Fitzgerald, director of the Wilf Campus Writing Center at Yeshiva University, due to their influential work in undergraduate student development, according to the NCPTW.\n\u201cNot only did they collaborate with undergraduates who served as assistant editors of\nWriting Center Journal\nduring Ianetta and Fitzgerald\u2019s tenure as the journal\u2019s editorial team, but later they also hired undergraduate tutor researchers to work on their co-authored book\nThe Oxford Guide for Writing Tutors,\nwhich is quickly becoming a widely-adopted text for tutor education courses internationally,\u201d the group said in its award announcement, citing the pairs\u2019 nomination letter.\nThe organization also cited work by Fitzgerald and Ianetta to advocate for an undergraduate research role for peer tutors, and \u201cthe myriad ways these two have worked separately and together to empower peer tutors, to mentor graduate students, to ground writing center work in sound theoretical underpinnings, and to validate the work of peer tutors as legitimate academic professional activity.\u201d\nAbout the WCP\nGeorgia Tech\u2019s award-winning Writing and Communication Program is committed to innovation both in student-centered teaching and faculty professional development.\nThe program teaches first-year writing and technical communication to 5,500 students each year through its pioneering WOVEN curriculum emphasizing written, oral, visual, electronic, and nonverbal communication. The program is equally committed to preparing faculty for professional success in or out of academia through the\nMarion L. Brittain Postdoctoral Fellowship , one of the largest and most innovative post-doctoral fellowships in the humanities.\nIn September, WCP received a Diversity Champion Unit Award from Institute Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (IDEI). The\naward\nrecognized WCP for its commitment to accessibility, diversity, equity, inclusion, and WCP\u2019s WOVEN (written, oral, visual, electronic, and nonverbal communication) framework. IDEI noted that the framework promotes accessibility by encouraging students to explore how modes interact and can be employed to increase universal access to communication.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nMichael Pearson michael.pearson@iac.gatech.edu\nEmail\nmichael.pearson@iac.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
