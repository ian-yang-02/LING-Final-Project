They could also be much more affordable to produce.\u00a0Credit: Department of Energy\nDec 19, 2019\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nA solar energy material that is remarkably durable and affordable is regrettably also unusable if it barely generates electricity, thus many researchers had abandoned emerging organic solar technologies. But lately, a shift in the underlying chemistry has boosted power output, and\na new study has revealed\ncounterintuitive\u00a0tweaks making the new chemistry successful.\nThe shift is from \"fullerene\" to \"non-fullerene acceptors\" (NFAs), terms detailed below, and in photovoltaic electricity generation, the acceptor is a molecule with the potential to be to electrons what a catcher is to a baseball. Corresponding donor molecules \u201cpitch\u201d electrons to acceptor \u201ccatchers\u201d to create electric\u00a0current.\nHighly cited chemist\nJean-Luc Br\u00e9das at the Georgia Institute of Technology has furthered the technology and also led the new study.\n\u201cNFAs are complex beasts and do things that current silicon solar technology does not. You can shape them, make them semi-transparent or colored. But their big potential is in the possibility of fine-tuning how they free up and move electrons to generate electricity,\u201d said Br\u00e9das, a\nRegents Professor in Georgia Tech\u2019s School of Chemistry and Biochemistry.\nGaining on silicon\nIn just the last four years, tuning NFA chemistry has boosted organic photovoltaic technology from initially converting only 1% of sunlight into electricity to 18% conversion in recent experiments. By comparison, high-quality silicon solar modules already on the market convert about 20%.\n\u201cTheory says we should be able to reach over 25% conversion with organic NFA-based solar if we can control energy loss by way of the morphology,\u201d said Tonghui Wang, a postdoctoral researcher in Br\u00e9das\u2019 lab and first author of the study.\nMorphology, the shapes molecules take in a material, is key to NFA solar technology\u2019s heightened efficiency, but how that works on the molecular level has been a mystery. The new study carefully modeled tiny tweaks to molecular shapes and calculated corresponding energy conversion in a common NFA electron donor/acceptor pairing.\nImproved performance came not from tweaks to the metaphorical hand of the catcher nor from the donor\u2019s pitching hand but from something akin to positions of the catcher\u2019s feet. Some positions better aligned the \u201cbody\u201d of the acceptor with that of the electron donor.\nThe \u201cfeet\u201d were a tiny component, a\nmethoxy group , on the acceptor, and two positions out of four possible positions it took boosted the conversion of light into electricity from 6% to 12%. Br\u00e9das and Wang\npublished their study,\nOrganic Solar Cells Based on Non-Fullerene Small Molecule Acceptors: Impact of Substituent Position , on November 20, 2019, in the journal\nMatter . The research was funded by the Office of Naval Research.\n(The donor/acceptor chemical pair was PBDB-T / IT-OM-1, -2, -3, or -4, with -2 and -3 showing superior electricity generation. See the citation at bottom for a complete chemical name.)\nClunky silicon cells\nMarketable NFA-based solar cells could have many advantages over\nsilicon, which requires mining\nquartz gravel, smelting it like iron, purifying it like steel, then cutting and machining it. By contrast, organic solar cells start as inexpensive solvents that can be printed onto surfaces.\nSilicon cells are usually stiff and\u00a0heavy and weaken with heat and light stress, whereas NFA-based solar cells are light, flexible, and stress-resistant. They also have more complex photoelectric properties. In NFA-based photoactive layers, when photons excite electrons out of the outer orbits of donor molecules, the electrons dance around the\nelectron holes \u00a0they have created, setting them up for a customized handoff to acceptors.\n\u201cSilicon pops an electron out of orbit when photons excite it past a threshold. It\u2019s on or off; you either get a conduction electron or no conduction electron,\u201d said Br\u00e9das, who is also Vasser Woolley Chair in Molecular Design at Georgia Tech. \u201cNFAs are subtler. An electron donor reaches out an electron, and the electron acceptor tugs it away. The ability to adjust morphology makes the electron handoff tunable.\u201d\nNot a fullerene\nLike the name says, non-fullerene acceptors are not\nfullerenes , which are pure carbon molecules with rather uniform and geometric structures of repeating pentagonal or hexagonal elements. Nanotubes, graphene, and soot are examples of fullerenes, which are named after architect Buckminster Fuller, who was famous for designing geodesic domes.\nFullerenes are more ridged in molecular structure and tunability than non-fullerenes, which are more freely designed to be floppy and bendable. NFA-based donors and acceptors can wrap around each other like precise swirls of chocolate and vanilla batter in a Bundt cake, giving them advantages beyond electron donating and accepting \u2013 such as better molecular packing in a material.\n\u201cAnother point is how the acceptor molecules are connected to each other so that the accepted electron has a conductive path to an electrode,\u201d Br\u00e9das said. \u201cAnd it goes for the donors, too.\u201d\nAs in any solar cell, conduction electrons need a way out of the photovoltaic material into an electrode, and there has to be a return path to the opposite electrode for arriving electrons to fill holes that\u00a0departing electrons\u00a0left behind.\nHighly impactful citations\nBr\u00e9das\u2019 accolades are numerous, but he has particularly gained attention for his Google Scholar\nh-index score , a calculation of the impact of a researcher\u2019s publications. Breda\u2019s current score of 146 likely places him in the 700 most-impactful published researchers in modern global history.\nHe has been a particularly noted leader in photoelectric and semiconductor research based on affordable and practical organic chemistry.\nAlso Read:\nThe International Space Station tests carbon nanotube organic solar cells\nThe research was funded by the Office of Naval Research (award N00014-17-1-2208).
