He can now play the piano by controlling each of his prosthetic fingers.\nDec 11, 2017\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nLuke Skywalker\u2019s bionic hand is a step closer to reality for amputees in this galaxy. Researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology have created an ultrasonic sensor that allows amputees to control each of their prosthetic fingers individually. It provides fine motor hand gestures that aren\u2019t possible with current commercially available devices.\nThe first amputee to use it, a musician who lost part of his right arm five years ago,\nis now able to play the piano for the first time since his accident . He can even strum the Star Wars theme song.\n\u201cOur prosthetic arm is powered by ultrasound signals,\u201d said Gil Weinberg, the Georgia Tech\nCollege of Design\nprofessor who leads the project. \u201cBy using this new technology, the arm can detect which fingers an amputee wants to move, even if they don\u2019t have fingers.\u201d\nJason Barnes is the amputee working with Weinberg. The 28-year-old was electrocuted during a work accident in 2012, forcing doctors to amputate his right arm just below the elbow. Barnes no longer has his hand and most of his forearm but does have the muscles in his residual limb that control his fingers.\nBarnes\u2019 everyday prosthesis is similar to the majority of devices on the market. It\u2019s controlled by electromyogram (EMG) sensors attached to his muscles. He switches the arm into various modes by pressing buttons on the arm. Each mode has two programmed moves, which are controlled by him either flexing or contracting his forearm muscles. For example, flexing allows his index finger and thumb to clamp together; contracting closes his fist.\n\u201cEMG sensors aren\u2019t very accurate,\u201d said Weinberg, director of Georgia Tech\u2019s\nCenter for Music Technology . \u201cThey can detect a muscle movement, but the signal is too noisy to infer which finger the person wants to move. We tried to improve the pattern detection from EMG for Jason but couldn\u2019t get finger-by-finger control.\u201d\nBut then the team looked around the lab and saw an ultrasound machine. They partnered with two other Georgia Tech professors \u2013 Minoru Shinohara, Chris Fink ( College of Sciences ) and Levent Degertekin ( Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering ) \u2014 and attached an ultrasound probe to the arm. The same kind of probe doctors use to see babies in the womb could watch how Barnes\u2019 muscles moved.\n\u201c That\u2019s when we had a eureka moment ,\u201d said Weinberg.\nWhen Barnes tries to move his amputated ring finger, the muscle movements differ from those seen when he tries to move any other digit. Weinberg and the team fed each unique movement into an algorithm that can quickly determine which finger Barnes wants to move. The ultrasound signals and machine learning can detect continuous and simultaneous movements of each finger, as well as how much force he intends to use.\n\u201cIt\u2019s completely mind-blowing,\u201d said Barnes. \u201cThis new arm allows me to do whatever grip I want, on the fly, without changing modes or pressing a button. I never thought we\u2019d be able to do this.\u201d\nThis is the second device Weinberg\u2019s lab has built for Barnes. His first love is the drums, so the\nteam fitted him with a prosthetic arm with two drumsticks\nin 2014. He controlled one of the sticks. The other moved on its own by listening to the music in the room and improvising.\nThe device gave him the chance to drum again. The robotic stick could play faster than any drummer in the world. Worldwide attention has sent Barnes and Weinberg\u2019s robots around the globe for concerts across four continents. They\u2019ve also played at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. and\nMoogfest .\nThat success pushed Weinberg to take the next step and create something that gives Barnes the dexterity he\u2019s lacked since 2012.\n\u201cIf this type of arm can work on music, something as subtle and expressive as playing the piano, this technology can also be used for many other types of fine motor activities such as bathing, grooming and feeding,\u201d said Weinberg. \u201cI also envision able-bodied persons being able to remotely control robotic arms and hands by simply moving their fingers.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nWatch Jason Barnes Play the Drums with Prosthesis\nInstitute for Robotics and Intelligent Machines\nContact\nJason Maderer\nNational Media Relations\nmaderer@gatech.edu\n404-660-2926\nEmail\nmaderer@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
