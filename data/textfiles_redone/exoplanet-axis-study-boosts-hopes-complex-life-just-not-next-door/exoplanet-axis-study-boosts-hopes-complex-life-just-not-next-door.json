The stars Alpha Centauri A and Alpha Centauri B comprise a binary system, in which the two stars orbit one another, and close by is an additional faint red dwarf star, Alpha Centauri C, also called Proxima Centauri. Some astronomers have hoped to someday find an exoplanet capable of harboring advanced life in the system, but\nNov 20, 2019\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\n\u201cThey\u2019re out there,\u201d goes a saying about extraterrestrials. It would seem more likely to be true in light of\na new study\non planetary axis tilts.\nAstrophysicists at the Georgia Institute of Technology modeled a theoretical twin of Earth into other star systems called binary systems because they have two stars. They concluded that 87% of exo-Earths one might find in binary systems should have axis tilts similarly steady to Earth\u2019s, an important ingredient for climate stability that favors the evolution of complex life.\n\u201cMultiple-star systems are common, and about 50% of stars have binary companion stars. So, this study can be applied to a large number of solar systems,\u201d said Gongjie Li, the study\u2019s co-investigator an\u00a0 assistant professor at Georgia Tech\u2019s School of Physics .\nSingle-star solar systems like our own with multiple planets appear to be rarer.\nAlpha Centauri B? Wretched\nThe researchers started out contrasting how the Earth\u2019s axis tilt, also called\u00a0 obliquity , varies over time with the variation of Mars\u2019 axis tilt. Whereas our planet\u2019s mild obliquity variations have been great for a livable climate and for evolution, the wilder variations of Mars' axis tilt may have helped wreck its atmosphere, as explained in the section below.\nThen the researchers modeled Earth into\u00a0 habitable, or Goldilocks, zones \u00a0in Alpha Centauri AB \u2013 our solar system\u2019s nearest neighbor, a binary system with one star called \u201cA\u201d and the other \u201cB.\u201d After that, they expanded the model to a more universal scope.\n\u201cWe simulated what it would be like around other binaries with multiple variations of the stars\u2019 masses, orbital qualities, and so on,\u201d said\u00a0 Billy Quarles, the study\u2019s principal \u00a0investigator and a research scientist in Li\u2019s lab. \u201cThe overall message was positive but not for our nearest neighbor.\u201d\nAlpha Centauri A actually didn\u2019t look bad, but the outlook for mild axis dynamics on an exo-Earth modeled around star B was wretched. This may douse some hopes because Alpha Centauri AB is four lightyears away, and a\u00a0 mission named Starshot with big-name backers \u00a0plans to launch a space probe to examine the system, including for signs of advanced life.\nThe researchers published\u00a0their study, which was co-led by\u00a0 Jack Lissauer from NASA \u00a0Ames Research Center, in\u00a0 Astrophysical Journal \u00a0on November 19, 2019, under the title:\nObliquity Evolution of Circumstellar Planets in Sun-like Stellar Binaries .\u00a0The research was funded by the NASA Exobiology Program.\nNo exoplanets have been confirmed around A or B; an exoplanet has been confirmed around the nearby red dwarf star Proxima Centauri, but that planet is likely to be uninhabitable.\n[Ready for graduate school?\u00a0 Here's how to apply to Georgia Tech. ]\nEarth? Just right\nEven with its ice ages and hot phases, Earth\u2019s climatological framework has been calm for hundreds of millions of years - in part because of its mild orbital and axis-tilt dynamics - allowing evolution to take big strides. Sharply varying dynamics, and thus climate, like on Mars could stand to regularly kill off advanced life, stunting evolution.\nEarth\u2019s orbit around the sun is on a slight incline that seesaws gently and very slowly through a slight precession, a kind of oscillation. As Earth revolves, it shifts position relative to the sun, circling it a little like a\u00a0 spirograph drawing. \u00a0The orbit also\u00a0 precesses in shape \u00a0between slightly more and slightly less oblong over 100,000-year periods.\nEarth\u2019s axis tilt precesses \u00a0between 22.1 and 24.5 degrees over the course of 41,000 years. Our large moon stabilizes our tilt through its gravitational relationship with Earth, otherwise, bouncy gravitational interconnections with Mercury, Venus, Mars, and Jupiter would jolt our tilt with resonances.\n\u201cIf we didn\u2019t have the moon, Earth\u2019s tilt could vary by about 60 degrees,\u201d Quarles said. \u201cWe\u2019d look maybe like Mars, and the precession of its axis appears to have contributed to a loss of atmosphere.\u201d\nMars\u2019 axis precesses between 10 degrees and 60 degrees every 2 million years. At the 10-degree tilt, the atmosphere condenses at the poles, creating caps that lock up a lot of the atmosphere in ice. At 60 degrees, Mars could grow an ice belt around its equator.\nUniverse? Hopeful\nIn Alpha Centauri AB, star B, about the size of our sun, and the larger star, A, orbit one another at about the distance between Uranus and our sun, which is very close for two stars in a binary system. The study modeled variations of an exo-Earth orbiting either star but concentrated on a modeled Earth orbiting in the habitable zone centered around B, with A being the orbiting star.\nA\u2019s orbit is very elliptical, passing close by and then moving very far away from B and slinging powerful gravity, which, in the model, overpowered exo-Earth\u2019s own dynamics. Its tilt and orbit varied widely; adding our moon to the model didn\u2019t help.\n\u201cAround Alpha Centauri B, if you don\u2019t have a moon, you have a more stable axis than if you do have a moon. If you have a moon, it\u2019s pretty much bad news,\u201d Quarles said.\nEven without a moon and with mild axis variability, complex, Earthlike evolution would seem to have a hard time on the modeled exo-Earth around B.\n\u201cThe biggest effect you would see is differences in the climate cycles related to how elongated the orbit is. Instead of having ice ages every 100,000 years like on Earth, they may come every 1 million years, be worse, and last much longer,\u201d Quarles said.\nBut a sliver of hope for Earthlike conditions turned up in the model: \u201cPlanetary orbit and spin need to precess just right relative to the binary orbit. There is this tiny sweet spot,\u201d Quarles said.\nWhen the researchers expanded the model to binary systems in the broader universe, the probability of gentle obliquity variations ballooned.\n\u201cIn general, the separation between the stars is larger in binary systems, and then the second star has less of an effect on the model of Earth. The planet\u2019s own motion dynamics dominate other influences, and obliquity usually has a smaller variation,\u201d Li said. \u201cSo, this is quite optimistic.\u201d\nAlso READ:\u00a0 Observing a \u201cCosmic Symphony\u201d Using Gravitational Wave Astronomy\nThe research was funded by the NASA Exobiology Program (grant NNX14AK31G).
