People get creative through the power and potential of technology \u00ad\u2013 and teams consider a problem or an idea and then develop websites, apps, and other high-tech solutions to address it. Think of it as a high-tech invention marathon.\nIt is no surprise that for the past five years Georgia Tech has hosted one of the largest collegiate hackathons in the U.S., or that dozens of companies have lined up to sponsor the event, including Facebook, Lyft, GM, Disney, Microsoft, Coca-Cola, and NCR, among others.\nThis year, more than 1,000 participants from 80 different colleges and institutions gathered on the\nTech campus for HackGT .\nFrom Oct. 19 to 21, as student teams worked nonstop on formulating their ideas and developing their projects, HackGT provided workshops and fireside chats with event sponsors, as well as mentors from business and industry to share their guidance and expertise.\nNew to the world of hackathons? No problem. Georgia Tech\u2019s student organizers say they wanted to create an environment in which everyone felt welcome. Forty-four percent of the attendees at this year\u2019s hackathon were newcomers.\nWinning projects were selected at the end of three days \u2014 and they were unfailingly impressive, especially given the time constraints.\nFour students from four different schools developed a tool they call Vocapture. It uses computer vision to identify objects to help English learners expand their vocabulary. The technology incorporates a smartphone camera to provide real-time text identifying the objects in view. (In one demonstration, \u201cchair,\u201d \u201cdesk,\u201d \u201ctable,\u201d and \u201cdoor\u201d appeared when scanning a classroom.)\nThe team noted that 2 billion people will be learning English by 2020, and hoped a tool like this might give them an advantage in honing their language skills.\nA student from Auburn University spent his hackathon weekend developing a bot to write a freestyle rap on any given topic. WikiBeat uses natural language processing to scan for information from the internet and matches phrases up into couplets, then lays down a beat to match the generated lyrics.\nTo learn more about HackGT and related events, click here .\nAdditional Images\nContact\nSteven Norris\nGeorgia Tech Social Media\nEmail\nsnorris@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
