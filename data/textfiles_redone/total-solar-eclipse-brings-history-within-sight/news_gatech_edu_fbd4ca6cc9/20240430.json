While Atlanta does not fall directly in the path as it did in 2017, nearly 85% of the sun will be blocked, giving the Georgia Tech community a chance to participate in the historic event.\n\"Quite frankly, there's not much difference between 85% and 95%. You can still witness the eclipse, and seeing that the sun is a crescent is a sight you'll never forget,\" said\nJim Sowell , a principal academic professional in the\nSchool of Physics\nand the director of the\nGeorgia Tech Observatory .\nSafety First\nAlthough a portion of the sun will be blocked, looking directly into the sun remains harmful to the eye. Sowell offers several tips to protect yourself.\nSafety glasses:\nTraditional sunglasses do not provide protection for extended solar viewings. Eclipse-safe glasses will be labeled 'ISO 12312-2,' indicating that they have been certified by the International Organization for Standardization. Because the eclipse will last for two hours, glasses can be shared throughout the event.\nPinhole camera:\nUsing a cardboard box, such as a shoebox, Sowell recommends creating a homemade pinhole camera (See image at the bottom of the page), which projects the sun inside the box's walls.\nSowell noted that a colander, or the sun shining through tree leaves, can also be used to project the sun's image onto the ground.\nTelescope:\nTelescopes are a great way to view the eclipse as long as an ISO 12312-2 filter is placed on the lens. A cellphone camera is not a replacement for a filtered lens, as the sun's rays can damage your device.\nWhere to Watch\nWeather permitting, viewers will be able to see the eclipse in an urban or rural environment.\nSun seekers in the city should avoid tall buildings and other obstructions to allow for the best view. In Atlanta, the eclipse is expected to be visible starting at 1:45 p.m., with peak coverage at 3:04 p.m. It will end at 4:21 p.m.\nSowell says that a rural setting is ideal for witnessing the true power of an eclipse, especially within the path of totality.\n\"Birds may begin to recognize that it's getting darker and start to roost. Cattle may start to low, and you'll notice a temperature drop because of the cool air trapped in the shadow as it moves across the Earth. And if you're in totality, you might see some planets and some bright stars that come out due to the dark sky,\" said Sowell, who will be traveling to Dallas, Texas, for the eclipse.\nWitnessing History\nTotal solar eclipses typically occur every one to three years, but Sowell noted that the continental U.S. will not see another until 2044. A professional astronomer for 40 years, Sowell is preparing to see his second total eclipse and hopes this event will inspire others to look at the sky (safely) with the same curiosity he does.\n\"I hope others view the eclipse and understand that there is astronomy that can be done with just the naked eye, and then there is so much more. If we can get people interested with just the sun and the moon, they'll realize they can go to the edge of the universe,\" he said.\nHe adds that, unlike other widely popular events, everyone taking part in the eclipse is a winner.\n\"Unless you're clouded out, this is better than the Super Bowl because half the people are upset about the result, whereas for this kind of eclipse, if you see it, you're excited and will remember it for the rest of your life.\"\nSowell also urges viewers to be patient if the weather isn't ideal.\n\"Just because it's cloudy in the morning or 10 minutes before the event, don't punt,\" he said. \"You need to ride it out. And you might get lucky. Even if it's only during the second half that it clears up, it'll still be just as memorable.\"\nTwo groups of students will be traveling to experience totality, including 55 graduate and undergraduate students from the School of Physics, led by Associate Professor\nDragomir Davidovic , and another trip led by the Georgia Tech Astronomy Club.\nAdditional Media\nContact\nSteven Gagliano\n- Institute Communications\nEmail\nSteven.gagliano@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
