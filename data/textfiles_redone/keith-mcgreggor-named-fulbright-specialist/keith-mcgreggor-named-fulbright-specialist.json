Paul)\nJun 10, 2022\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nKeith McGreggor , Georgia Tech professor of the practice in the\u00a0 School of Interactive Computing , and director of\u00a0 VentureLab , has been named a\u00a0 Fulbright Specialist , one of only nine from Georgia Tech since the program began in 2001.\nThe Specialist program, part of the larger Fulbright exchange offering that includes Fulbright Scholars, pairs U.S. academics and professionals with institutions abroad to share expertise, strengthen relationships, hone skills, gain international experience, and learn about other cultures.\nOnce accepted into the program, specialists remain on the roster for four years. During this time, they are matched with projects designed by host institutions from more than 150 countries. The placements last from two to six weeks.\nMcGreggor, who is also executive director of the National Science Foundation\u2019s\u00a0 I-Corps South \u00a0\u00a0(Innovation Corps) and associate director of the\u00a0 GVU Center , listed artificial intelligence (AI) and entrepreneurship as his areas of expertise. He will work in the Republic of Ireland with\u00a0 Science Foundation Ireland , where he has worked for the last four years to\u00a0 establish an I-Corps-based training system \u00a0for the foundation\u2019s researchers for his first deployment.\nAs director of I-Corps South, McGreggor is a leader in entrepreneurship education. He is also an instructor with the\nInnovation and Technology Commercialization Professionals (ITCP)\u00a0course , an international, online course offering that includes learners from Asia, Europe, and Africa.\n\u201cI\u2019m seeking to better understand the opportunities and challenges those researchers face when trying to translate their technologies out into the world,\u201d he said. \u201cFurther, I\u2019m studying the complex Ireland university/industry ecosystem, to look for ways to strengthen technology transfer and commercialization.\u201d\nHis Irish hosts are looking forward to McGreggor's experience as an entrepreneurship ecosystem builder.\n\u201cSFI is delighted to host Keith for five weeks, to benefit from his significant experience and expertise in the area of entrepreneurship,\u201d said Darragh O\u2019Neill, challenge research manager for SFI, and a colleague of McGreggor\u2019s. \u201cDuring his time in Ireland, Keith will work across teams in SFI as well as engaging with the research community in Ireland.\u201d\nFor future deployments, McGreggor has goals related to both AI and entrepreneurship. \u201cFor entrepreneurship, I want to learn and appreciate the differences between commercialization, technology transfer, and entrepreneurial education in different cultures,\u201d McGreggor said.\u00a0\u201cFor AI, I\u2019m keenly interested in how the adoption of AI may be used to improve the human condition in different cultures, especially in areas where the overall rate of adoption of technology is considered to be low.\u201d\nHe is also excited to bring back to Georgia Tech what he learns and experiences as a specialist.\n\u201cMy belief is that there are culturally universal commonalities in these challenges and opportunities, as well as important differences,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m looking to improve my own understanding of those so that Georgia Tech can improve its own impact in commercialization and entrepreneurship, and to increase the applicability of the entrepreneurial curricula of I-Corps and all of Georgia Tech\u2019s entrepreneurship courses to a more equitable, more diverse, more accessible, and more inclusive worldview.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nContact\nKaren Kirkpatrick\nkaren.kirkpatrick@innovate.gatech.edu\n770.364.0579\nEmail\nkaren.kirkpatrick@innovate.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
