He hopes understanding why will help his team develop tools that will enable personalized precision therapies in the future.\n\u201cMost patients are responding to this drug very well, but it fails in some patients, and why it fails is a mystery,\u201d said Coskun, an assistant professor in the Wallace H. Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering at Georgia Tech and Emory University and a researcher in the Petit Institute for Bioengineering and Bioscience at Georgia Tech.\nCoskun aims to take a detailed look at cellular communication and decision-making, to closely visualize cell signaling and develop a new metric to define how cells respond to drugs for lung cancer therapy. To help him get started, the Emory Lung Cancer SPORE group is awarding him $50,000 over the next year.\n\u201cOur research will result in a molecular screening platform for imaging signaling proteins of human cell cultures and tissues,\u201d said Coskun, who plans to decipher the role of cellular signals and explain how different cells coordinate signaling to achieve healthy or abnormal results, specifically in patients with non-small cell lung cancer.\nThis year, about 200,000 adults in the United States will be diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer, the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the world. About 15 percent of those people have an epidermal growth factor receptor mutation in their cancer.\nEpidermal growth factor receptor, or EGFR, is a protein involved in cell signaling. When it works correctly, it helps control cell division. But when it becomes mutated, as it does in some lung cancer cells, it causes rapid cell growth, helping the cancer spread.\nFor lung cancer patients with the EGFR mutation, there is a measure of hope thanks to a drug developed by Emory University several years ago. In a 2017 clinical study led by Emory researcher Suresh Ramalingam, patients experienced substantial improvement when treated with an EGFR inhibitor called osimertinib, compared to those who received the standard of care.\nThe drug is designed to inhibit EGFR\u2019s haywire signaling activity in cancer. As Coskun noted, though, it doesn\u2019t work well for every patient. It\u2019s because no two patient tumors are exactly alike \u2013 each tumor microenvironment is unique. There are multiple biomarkers and multiple potential targets for cancer drugs to attack. So, inhibiting one protein like EGFR won\u2019t always make a difference, Coskun said.\n\u201cThe standard clinical techniques are limited to focusing on a single marker,\u201d said Coskun, who is using multiplex cellular imaging, a technology that allows detection of multiple markers. \u201cRecent advances in these systems allow visualization of a larger number of markers \u2014 up to 30 unique targets. We intend to develop automated, multiplexed platforms to detect numerous markers and to feed the information into an algorithm to diagnose patients and predict their response to therapies.\u201d\nClearly identifying other markers could pave the way for combination therapies with other inhibitor drugs to block other cancer signaling pathways \u2014 together, they\u2019re a more comprehensive approach to attacking the disease. The ability to look at 30 different proteins or markers \u2014 potential drug targets \u2014 at one time, in a single cell, wasn\u2019t possible before because the technology didn\u2019t exist.\n\u201cThe emerging technology that we have developed here at Georgia Tech and Emory allow rapid and high-content signaling network studies in cells and tissues,\u201d Coskun said.\nEssentially, researchers combine technologies to create a complete molecular profile of a patient\u2019s cancer at the single cell level. Coskun\u2019s team uses microfluidic instruments to acquire microscopic images and then super computers are used to process and visualize complex cellular maps.\n\u201cThese maps will enable personalized precision therapies,\u201d Coskun said. \u201cThat is our goal.\u201d\nCoskun and his team will work under the mentorship of Ramalingam, executive director of the Winship Cancer Institute at Emory and co-lead of the Lung Cancer SPORE, a Specialized Program of Research Excellence created in 2019 with a $9.7 million National Cancer Institute grant. It\u2019s one of four SPORE grants in the U.S. focused on lung cancer.\nLINKS\nhttps://winshipcancer.emory.edu/research/spore-grants/lung-cancer.html\nhttps://bme.gatech.edu/bme/faculty/Ahmet-F-Coskun\nAdditional Images\nContact\nWriter:\nJerry Grillo\nEmail\nJerry.grillo@ibb.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
