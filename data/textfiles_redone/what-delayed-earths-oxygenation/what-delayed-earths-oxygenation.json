About 2.3 billion years ago, this reaction led to a dramatic oxygenation of Earth\u2019s atmosphere.\nEvidence exists for oxygen-releasing photosynthesis evolving much earlier \u2013 perhaps as early as 3 billion years ago. However, the oxygen-rich atmosphere we take for granted today has existed for only about 10% of Earth\u2019s 4.5-billion-year history. Why did oxygenation of the atmosphere occur so much later than the evolution of oxygen-releasing photosynthesis?\n\u201cThe striking lag has remained an enduring puzzle in the fields of Earth history and planetary science,\u201d says Christopher Reinhard, an assistant professor in the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences (EAS).\nReinhard, former EAS postdoctoral researcher Kazumi Ozaki, and collaborators have proposed a solution to the puzzle. Their findings,\npublished in\nNature Communications , suggest that in the oceans of early Earth, oxygen-releasing photosynthesizers could not compete effectively with their primitive counterparts.\nModern photosynthesizers consume water and release oxygen. Primitive ones instead consume dissolved iron ions \u2013 which would have been abundant in the oceans of early Earth. They produce rust as a byproduct instead of oxygen.\nUsing experimental microbiology, genomics, and large-scale biogeochemical modeling, \u201cwe found that photosynthetic bacteria that use iron instead of water are fierce competitors for light and nutrients,\u201d says Ozaki, the paper\u2019s first author and now an assistant professor in the Department of Environmental Science at Toho University, in Japan. \u201cWe propose that their ability to outcompete oxygen-producing photosynthesizers is an important component of Earth\u2019s global oxygen cycle.\u201d\nThe study is part of Reinhard\u2019s research goal to understand how the evolution of the photosynthetic biosphere controlled the composition of Earth\u2019s atmosphere. \u201cWe want to understand the timing of major biological innovations and their impact on the chemistry of Earth\u2019s oceans and atmosphere. We consider these principles to be central in understanding our own evolutionary origins and the search for life beyond our solar system.\u201d\n\u201cOur results contribute to a deeper knowledge of the biological factors controlling the long-term evolution of Earth\u2019s atmosphere,\u201d Ozaki says. \u201cThey offer a better mechanistic understanding of the factors that promote oxygenation of the atmospheres of Earth-like planets beyond our solar system.\u201d The results \u201cyield an entirely new vantage from which to build theoretical models of Earth\u2019s biogeochemical oxygen cycle,\u201d Reinhard adds.\nOther authors of the study are Katharine Thompson, Rachel Simister, and Sean Crowe of the University of British Columbia.\nReinhard acknowledges support from the NASA Astrobiology Institute, the NASA Postdoctoral Program, the Alfred P.
