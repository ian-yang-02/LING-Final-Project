Atlanta-based Norfolk Southern\u2019s gift will provide the initial funding to support the current and future sustainability-related startups in ATDC\u2019s portfolio.\nThe gift of $750,000 will support the initiative for three years. It is the eighth industry-focused vertical of its kind at ATDC, including two others announced earlier in 2022 \u2014 one in robotics and automation, the other in supply chain logistics.\n\"Norfolk\u00a0Southern\u00a0and Georgia Tech are teaming up to support forward-thinking innovation around sustainability.\u00a0Together, some of the brightest minds in Georgia and the business community can continue to make sustainable progress for our nation\u2019s supply chain and economy,\" said\u00a0Josh Raglin, chief sustainability officer for\u00a0Norfolk\u00a0Southern.\nThe sponsorship furthers the company\u2019s strategic goal of integrating\u00a0 sustainability \u00a0into daily operations while helping its customers achieve their sustainability goals. \u201cThrough our collaboration with ATDC and the incubator's sustainability vertical, we will join with students and entrepreneurs in the business of a better planet as they transform their revolutionary ideas into actionable and successful business models,\" Raglin said.\nThe gift will\u00a0support one-on-one coaching via a dedicated ATDC startup catalyst who will manage the sustainability vertical and work to build the pipeline of innovators from across Georgia who are in this space and scaling disruptive technologies to bring to the marketplace.\nThe funds also will support a sustainability-focused curriculum and other resources specialized to those entrepreneurs\u2019 needs as they go from ideation to commercialization.\n\u201cATDC has a history of supporting startups with sustainable tech innovations including Suniva, Emergy, and Quest Renewables,\u201d said John Avery, ATDC director.\nATDC\u2019s startup portfolio already includes 12 companies in the sustainability space, but Avery said there is a wider opportunity for Georgia entrepreneurs.\nWith Norfolk Southern\u2019s sustainability focus, Georgia Tech\u2019s research innovations in that area through centers such as the\u00a0 Strategic Energy Institute , and ATDC\u2019s ability to leverage those resources and its record in scaling successful technology companies, Avery said Georgia is primed to grow that sector.\nThe state is home to 34 companies on the Fortune 1000 list, many of which have set their own sustainability goals. Fifteen of those companies are headquartered in Atlanta, which ranks third in the country for the number of Fortune 500 companies headquartered in the city.\nWhat's more, sustainability innovations can have wider impact across a number of industries that are important to Georgia in addition to transportation and logistics,\u00a0such as agriculture, and renewable energy, Avery said.\n\u201cWith Norfolk Southern at the forefront of sustainability innovation and its support of our dedicated sustainability vertical at ATDC, we are doubling down on one of the biggest opportunities for startups and innovators today and pursuing a very important corporate and societal goal,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can become a hub for all of these sustainability entrepreneurs and their innovations and grow this ecosystem in Georgia by helping to launch viable companies across the state.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nContact\nFor Norfolk Southern, contact Alyssa B.
