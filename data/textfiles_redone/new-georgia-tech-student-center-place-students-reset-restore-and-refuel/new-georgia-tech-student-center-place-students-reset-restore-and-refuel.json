The entire project encompasses five buildings with 232,350 square feet of interior space, spread out across 11 acres. In addition to the building\u2019s new features, the new Student Center has embraced the themes of community and wellness, and will serve a vital role in advancing the\nvision and mission of\u00a0Student Engagement and Well-Being .\n\u201cStudent wellness was at the forefront of designing each feature and space,\u201d says Student and Campus Event Centers Senior Director Lindsay Bryant. \u201cLounge spaces, outdoor seating, and connecting the experiential pathway to the building all contribute to fostering a sense of connection and belonging.\u201d This advances one of the four goals of the new\nCultivate Well-Being Action and Transformation Roadmap\nfor students.\nA notable addition to the main entrance of the building on the second floor is the large mural of the late John Lewis, former U.S. representative. The Student Center was\nrenamed after the civil rights leader , who was an influential student leader while in college. There is also an endowment named to honor Lewis\u2019 legacy that will provide comprehensive, inclusive leadership development opportunities for student leaders, including some scholarships.\nThe project itself was \u201cstudent-centered.\u201d \u201cStudents\u2019 voices helped convey the need for an expansion, students voted on mandatory fees that funded the project, and students were included in the planning and management of the project,\u201d said Luoluo Hong, vice president for Student Engagement and Well-Being. \u201cIt is this kind of student advocacy and leadership that we want to amplify through the John Lewis Student Leadership Pathways Program.\u201d\nRenovated spaces on the first floor include Tech Rec and the Georgia Tech Post Office. Some new additions include a late-night eatery connected to the bowling alley and a theater to host guest speakers and events. Outside the first-floor entrance, construction continues on the Campanile. Completion of this campus landmark is set for late September.\nThe\nStudent Organization\nspace has expanded to the second and third floors and is now referred to as the Student Organization Hub.\nStudent Media\nhas moved from the Smithgall Student Services (Flag) Building to the Student Center and WREK radio is back now that construction is complete. The move offers these organizations higher community and student interaction.\nReservable meeting rooms are located on the third floor, named after streets in the 5th Congressional District, which John Lewis represented from 1987 to 2020. Also located on this floor is a 298-seat theater, which was once the ballroom in the previous Student Center, and the administrative offices, now known as the\nStudent and Campus Events Center\n(SCEC).
