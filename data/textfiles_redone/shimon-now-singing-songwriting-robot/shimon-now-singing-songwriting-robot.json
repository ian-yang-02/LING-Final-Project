That includes a mouth, eyes, new eyebrows, and a series of new movements. He also had new hands, allowing him to play the marimba faster than any human can.

And he\u2019s coming to a music venue near you.\nBut he\u2019s not like any performer you\u2019ve ever seen. He\u2019s not even human.\nShimon, the marimba-playing robot , has learned some new skills: He sings, he dances a little, he writes lyrics, he can even compose some melodies. Now he\u2019s taking them on the road in a concert tour to support\na new album\n\u2014 just like any other musician.\nThe new album will have eight to 10 songs Shimon wrote with his creator, Georgia Tech\nProfessor Gil Weinberg . It will drop on Spotify later this spring.\n\u201cShimon has been reborn as a singer-songwriter,\u201d Weinberg said. \u201cNow we collaborate between humans and robots to make songs together.\u201d\n[ Listen to Shimon's first single, \"Into Your Mind ]\nWeinberg will start with a theme \u2014 say, space \u2014 and Shimon will write lyrics around the theme. Weinberg puts them together and composes melodies to fit them. Shimon can also generate some melodies for Weinberg to use as he puts together a song. Then, with a band of human musicians, Shimon will play the songs and sing.\n\u201cI always wanted to write songs, but I just can\u2019t write lyrics. I'm a jazz player,\u201d Weinberg said. \u201cThis is the first time that I actually wrote a song, because I had inspiration: I had Shimon writing lyrics for me.\u201d\nWeinberg and his students have trained Shimon on datasets of 50,000 lyrics from jazz, prog rock, and hip-hop. Then Shimon uses deep learning, a class of machine learning algorithms, to generate his own words.\n\u201cThere are lots of systems that use deep learning, but lyrics are different,\u201d said Richard Savery, a third-year Ph.D. student who has been working with Shimon over the past year on his songwriting. \u201cThe way semantic meaning moves through lyrics is different. Also, rhyme and rhythm are obviously super important for lyrics, but that isn't as present in other text generators. So, we use deep learning to generate lyrics, but it's also combined with semantic knowledge.\u201d\nSavery offered this example of how it might work: \u201cYou'll get a word like \u2018storm,\u2019 and then it'll generate a whole bunch of related words, like \u2018rain.\u2019 It creates a loop of generating lots of material, deciding what's good, and then generating more based on that.\u201d\nWhen Shimon sings these songs,\nhe really does sing , with a unique voice created by collaborators at Pompeu Fabra University in Barcelona. They used machine learning to develop the voice and trained it on hundreds of songs.\nAlong with his new skills \u2014 all developed in Weinberg\u2019s lab \u2014 Shimon has some new hardware, too, that changes how he plays and moves on stage. To be clear, he\u2019s still mostly stationary, but he has a mouth, new eyebrows, and new head movements designed to help convey emotion and interact with his bandmates. He also has new \u201chands,\u201d that have totally changed how he plays the marimba.\n\u201cShimon plays much faster \u2014 about 25 to 30 hertz at the maximum \u2014 and also much more expressively, playing from a soft dynamic range to a strong dynamic range,\u201d said Ph.D. student Ning Yang, who designed all-new motors and hardware for Shimon. \u201cThat also allows [Shimon] to do choreography during the music being played.\u201d\nFor example, Shimon can count in at the beginning of songs to cue the band, and sometimes he\u2019ll wave his mallets around in time to the music. New brushless DC motors mean he has a much greater range of motion and control of that motion. Yang accomplished that by bringing his engineering knowledge and musical background together to create human-inspired gestures.\n\u201cIt's actually a very, very good example at Georgia Tech that we can actually combine tech and arts together to create something that's brand new,\u201d Yang said.\nHe worked closely with fellow Ph.D. student Lisa Zahray, who created a new suite of gestures for the robot \u2014\u00a0including how he uses those new eyebrows.\n\u201cWe have to think about his role at each time during the song and what he should be doing,\u201d Zahray said. \u201cWe also want to make sure he's interacting with the other musicians around him to give that feel that he's performing with people.\u201d\nThat partnership with people is key for Weinberg. Teaching Shimon new skills isn\u2019t about replacing musicians, he said.\n\u201cWe will need musicians, and there will be more musicians that will be able to do more and new music because robots will help them, will generate ideas, will help them broaden the way they think about music and play music,\u201d Weinberg said.\nShimon, Weinberg, and the entire band are building a touring schedule now with the goal of taking their unique blend of robot- and human-created music to more people. Weinberg said he hopes those shows will prove to be more than a novelty act.\n\u201cI think we have reached a level where I expect the audience to just enjoy the music for music\u2019s sake,\u201d Weinberg said. \u201cThis is music that humans, by themselves, wouldn't have written. I want the audience to think, \u2018There's something unique about this song, and I want to go back and listen to it, even if I don't look at the robot.\u2019\u201d\nShimon was originally developed with support from the National Science Foundation Cyber-Human Systems program, grants No. 0713269, and 1017169.\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\n\"Into Your Mind\" - Shimon's first single\nGil Weinberg\nGeorgia Tech Center for Music Technology\nConnect with Shimon\nFreethink Raps with Shimon\nContact\nJoshua Stewart\n404.894.6016\nEmail\njstewart@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
