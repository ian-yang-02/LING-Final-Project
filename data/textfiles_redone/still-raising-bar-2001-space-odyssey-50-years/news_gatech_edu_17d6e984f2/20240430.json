Why are we still talking about it?\nTelotte : It\u2019s certainly the most influential of all science fiction films, and the most often referenced of all the films in the genre. And by referenced I don\u2019t mean simply homages in other science fiction films, but across the whole cultural landscape. It's entered into our vocabulary, as in such phrases as \u2018Open the pod bay door, Hal,\u2019 or \u2018I\u2019m sorry, I can\u2019t do that, Dave.\u2019 These are phrases that have become part of our common parlance. But more than that, this is a movie that has impacted the science fiction genre and how we make films.\nHow so?\nTelotte : Kubrick invented or advanced a variety of new techniques, new ways of telling stories in film. For example, he made use of a complicated technique called front projection. He deployed a new process called slit-scan photography for the Stargate scene. He made use of what is maybe the best example of something called a match cut in all of film history. A match cut is where one cuts between two different shots that have the same kind of geometry. The first sequence in\n2001: A Space Odyssey\nis called the Dawn of Man. It features apelike creatures who have touched the monolith, become inspired and discovered tools. One learns to use a bone as a weapon to chase other groups of apes away from the watering hole, and then uses it to kill. Exulting, he throws the bone up in the sky and we watch as it drifts up and up and, suddenly, we\u2019re in the darkness of space and there\u2019s a space station, shaped like the bone, at the same angle as the bone. And of course, in space, we see that the U.S. and Russia are still competing. With this simple cut Kubrick has said, \u2018We\u2019ve gone from the Dawn of Man to 2001, yet how far have we really come? Not very far. We throw our bones a little higher in the sky, but we\u2019re still doing the same violent things.\u2019 So, just with inspired editing, he is able to tell an enormously important story.\nWhat impact did this film have on science fiction as a genre?\nTelotte : Well, obviously he made science fiction very respectable. When he contacted the science fiction novelist Arthur C. Clarke and asked if they could work together on a project, Clarke asked, \u2018What do you have in mind?\u2019 And Kubrick said, \u2018Well, I want to make the proverbial good science fiction movie because no one\u2019s ever done that.\u2019\u00a0 I think that comment was something of an overstatement, because there are some really fine science fiction films that appeared before\n2001 , such as\nMetropolis\nin 1927,\nInvasion of the Body Snatchers\nin1956, and\nForbidden Planet\nin 1956. But he did indeed make a really good one. He made one that raised the bar for everybody else. Sixty years ago, the venerable British film journal\nSight and Sound\nstarted doing a worldwide poll of film critics, directors, et cetera, who are central to the film industry, asking them to rank the ten greatest films of all time. For the longest time, it included only works such as\nCitizen Kane , Renoir\u2019s\nRules of the Game ,\nThe Seven Samurai , Fellini\u2019s\n8 \u00bd.\nIn 2012, it ranked\n2001\nin sixth place. This means the critics now are looking back and saying science fiction has a place among the greatest films ever made. Kubrick raised the bar, and raised it recognizably amongst everybody who\u2019s interested in film, not just science fiction fans.\nHow did this movie inspire other filmmakers?\nTelotte : Well, it set the bar so high that no one could do exactly that kind of film for a long time. It obviously was beyond much of the film industry\u2019s capacity\u2014most filmmakers\u2019 technical abilities, and most filmmakers' inspiration. It wasn\u2019t until almost a decade later, in 1977, that George Lucas and Steven Spielberg would come along with the original\u00a0 Star Wars \u00a0and\u00a0 Close Encounters of the Third Kind \u2014both similarly ambitious but pointedly different efforts .\nLucas announced the new world of science fiction in the opening scene of\nStar Wars , which pays homage to\n2001 . While Kubrick\u2019s film opened with an iconic image of the sun, the Earth, and the moon aligned in space, Lucas removed the middle planet and replaced it with a space battle. And that new opening effectively says, \u2018All right, you remember\n2001 , but I'm going to take you to a little different place and mine's going to be more about the ships and the people, this political conflict that's going on, rather than a meditation on the evolution of humanity.\nOne of the most recognizable images from 2001 is the glowing red eye of HAL, the astronauts\u2019 virtual assistant who eventually turns into a murderer. Would this be the same movie without HAL?\nTelotte : I don\u2019t want to say it\u2019s essential but he made the right choice. He made so many right choices. It keeps viewers concentrated on that realm of cold logic that Kubrick wants us to change from, to move away from, or at least to interrogate.\nWe never see aliens in this film. Good choice?\nTelotte : Great choice. It would have made us think about all the different aliens we had seen before in film. And it would make us think back to earlier visions of alien invasion and therefore alien threats. The other option would have been depicting aliens as in something like\nThe Day the Earth Stood Still , which is still kind of an alien invasion film because it features a flying saucer that lands in Washington, but the guy who steps out is Michael Rennie, the English actor. He speaks with an English accent; he\u2019s very calm and very nice. But the reason he\u2019s here is because, as he says, \u2018You people are messing up and we're going to tell you how you should live your lives.\u2019 Where he's from, they have turned everything over to robots, and the people know that if they don't behave nicely to each other, the robots will punish them all. But Kubrick threw out the aliens and said, \u2018Let's make this about ourselves, only about ourselves, because we\u2019re the ones who have to make those crucial decisions. We're the ones who have to change our lives, not have it miraculously happen because somebody else comes in and tells us what to do, or because robots come in and force us to behave in a certain way, or because we have to fight against various three-headed monsters or blob-like invaders. This is our own problem.\u2019 This choice of not showing aliens allows him to focus our attention on human evolution. Kubrick is putting the choice to us and saying humanity has to find ways to change, to become something better.\nEven after five decades, it remains a notoriously difficult movie to interpret. What is it all about?\nTelotte : You\u2019re not going to bind it up in a nutshell, but one element that stands out is that Kubrick is calling for humanity to emerge from the Age of Reason \u00a0visualized in the final room in which we see an old David Bowman \u2014 and become something new. We need to move beyond that, and where we go is to what Kubrick might have termed imaginative man, man who follows his eyes, as he tries to take in a challenging world of new images and learns to use his imagination to overcome problems. This is what the ancient Greeks had formulated for us long ago, that there is a logical side to humanity, as well as an emotional side to humanity, and that the imagination offered a way for bringing these two sides into harmony. I believe Kubrick was basically revisiting this notion and asking, \u2018Might that still be a good path for us to follow?\nAdditional Images\nContact\nRebecca Keane\nDirector of Communications\nrebecca.keane@iac.gatech.edu\n404.894.1720\nEmail\nrebecca.keane@iac.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
