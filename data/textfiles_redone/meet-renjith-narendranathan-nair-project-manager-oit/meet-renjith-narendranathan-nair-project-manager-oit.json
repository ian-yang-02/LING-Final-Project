His job sounds straightforward, but there\u2019s more beneath the surface.\n\u201cI have a complicated role,\u201d said Renjith. \u201cA normal project manager is one who plans, tracks, and monitors to make sure that projects go smoothly and reach the goal within budget. But Georgia Tech is always special. It presents a lot of challenges, not just to me but to my colleagues because we have to wear multiple hats.\u201d\nAt times his role ranges from gathering the requirements for a project to serving as the bridge between the technical teams and functional offices, such as the Registrar\u2019s Office or other campus clients. He sometimes acts as a \u201cunifier\u201d to get the disparate teams to work together, which is both challenging and rewarding.\n\u201cWe also need to maintain business relationships and work with multiple stakeholders outside of Georgia Tech,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to bring all of that together to ensure the project is a success.\u201d\nOne of Renjith\u2019s current projects is collaborating with the Registrar\u2019s Office to switch the web access system (OSCAR) from Banner 8 to Banner 9, starting with student registration. The software maintains student, faculty, course, financial aid, and personnel data.\n\u201cThis is an important and exciting project because it\u2019s something the students have wanted for about five years,\u201d he said. \u201cTransitioning the current registration system to Banner 9 will provide students with a more modern interface with more features and a more responsive design. They will be able to use it on their tablets or other mobile devices.\u201d The new system is scheduled to go live in March.\nDuring the pandemic Renjith has been working remotely most of the time and coming to the office as needed. He misses being able to connect with his colleagues on a personal level.\n\u201cI miss walking to someone\u2019s desk and having a two-minute chat to catch up,\u201d he said, acknowledging that most video meetings don\u2019t allow much time for personal conversation. \u201cI don\u2019t want the environment to have too much of a strictly business state of mind. As a project manager you need to have a good working relationship, professional but also personal at times. Understanding what the other person is going through is critical.\u201d\nAway From Work\nIn 2016 Renjith moved to Atlanta from Minneapolis. Georgia\u2019s relatively mild winter season was a warm reprieve for the native of Kerala, India.\n\u201cIt is probably at minus 20 degrees in Minneapolis right now,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, coming here was a big change.\u201d\nHe settled in the Johns Creek community near Alpharetta with his wife and their three children \u2014 a daughter in third grade, a son in eighth grade, and a son who\u2019s a junior in high school. When he isn\u2019t busy with family activities, he enjoys reading and playing video games.\n\u201cWhen I was driving one hour or more from Johns Creek to campus, I listened to audio books. Now I am picking up real books again,\u201d Renjith said. He is reading Isaac Asimov\u2019s robot series, and during the pandemic he renewed his love of video games.\n\u201cI\u2019ve always played video games.\nCall of Duty: Warzone\nis one that I\u2019ve picked up recently,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m still pretty bad at it but playing video games brought me closer to some of my friends in Australia and India.\u201d He and his friends around the globe find a common time they can play and reconnect.\n\u201cPlaying with someone you know is a different experience. You\u2019re just enjoying the game and you don\u2019t worry about whether you\u2019re good or bad at it.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nContact\nVictor Rogers\nInstitute Communications\nEmail\nvictor.rogers@comm.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
