Conservation offers limited hope.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nEmail\nAt a lively reef where fishing is banned, corals thrive, and fish eat seaweed that would otherwise vastly outcompete and endanger the corals. Fisheries regulations appear to protect reefs and may buy some insurance against mass coral death in ocean warming events. But even protected reefs die off if their waters get too hot too long.

Reef conservation may offer hope: A particular potion, gathered from reefs protected against seaweed overgrowth, proved more robust.\nThe protected Pacific reefs were populated by diverse corals and shimmered with colorful fish, said researchers who snorkeled off of Fiji to collect samples for the study. Oceanic ecologists from the Georgia Institute of Technology compared coral potions from these reefs, where fishing was prohibited, with those from heavily fished reefs, where seaweed inundated corals because few fish were left to eat it.\nThe medicated solutions, or potions, may contain a multitude of chemicals, and the researchers did not analyze their makeup. This is a possible next step, but here the researchers simply wanted to establish if the potions offered any real defense against pathogens and how warming and overfishing might weaken it.\nConservation matters\n\u201cI thought I probably wouldn\u2019t see antibiotic effects from these washes. I was surprised to see such strong effects, and I was surprised to see that reef protections made a difference,\u201d said the study\u2019s first author, Deanna Beatty.\n\u201cThere is a lot of argument now about whether local management can help in the face of global stresses \u2013 whether what a Fijian village does matters when people in London and Los Angeles burn fossil fuels to drive to work,\u201d said Mark Hay, the study\u2019s principal investigator,\u00a0 Regents Professor and Harry and Linda Teasley Chair in Georgia Tech\u2019s School of Biological Sciences .\n\u201cOur work indicates that local management provides a degree of insurance against global stresses, but there are likely higher temperatures that render the insurance ineffective.\u201d\n[Ready for graduate school?\u00a0 Here's how to apply to Georgia Tech. ]\nAdding heat\nThe researchers collected three coral species along with seawater surrounding each species at protected reefs and at overfished reefs. In their Georgia Tech lab, they tested their solutions against the pathogen\u00a0 Vibrio coralliilyticu s \u00a0 at 24 degrees Celsius (75.2 Fahrenheit), an everyday Fijian water temperature, and at 28 degrees (82.4 F), common during ocean heating events.\n\u201cWe chose\u00a0 Vibrio \u00a0because it commonly infects corals, and it\u2019s associated with coral bleaching in these warming events. It\u2019s related to other bleaching pathogens and could serve as a model for them as well,\u201d Hay said.\n\u201cWe chose 24 C and 28 C because they\u2019re representative of the variations you see on Fijian reefs these days. Those are temperatures where the bacteria are more benign or more virulent,\u201d Beatty said.\nThe data showed that warming disadvantaged all potions against\u00a0 Vibrio \u00a0and conservation aided a potion from a key coral species. The team, which included coauthor Kim Ritchie from the University of South Carolina Beaufort, published its study\nin the journal\u00a0 Science Advances \u00a0on Oct. 2 . The research was funded by the National Institutes of Health\u2019s Fogarty International Center, the National Science Foundation, and the Simons Foundation.\nDeeper dive into the experiment\nSeaweed hedges\nThe unprotected reefs\u2019 shabby appearance portended their effects on the one potion associated with a key coral species.\n\u201cWhen you swim out of the no-fishing area and into the overfished area, you hit a hedge of seaweed. You have about 4 to 16% corals and 50 to 90% seaweed there. On the protected reef, you have less than 3% seaweed and about 60% corals,\u201d Hay said.\nHay has researched marine ecology for over four decades and has seen this before, when coral reefs died off closer to home.\n\u201cThirty years ago, when Caribbean reefs were vanishing, I saw overfishing as a big deal there, when seaweed took over,\u201d he said, adding that global warming has become an overriding factor. \u201cIn the Pacific, many reefs that were not overfished have been wiped out in warming events. It just got too hot for too long.\u201d\nDistilling potion\nThe potions are products of the corals and associated microbes, which comprise a biological team called a\u00a0 holobiont .\nTo arrive at potions focused on chemical effects, the researchers agitated the coral holobionts and ocean water then freeze-dried and irradiated the resulting liquid to destroy remnants of life that could have augmented chemical action. Some viruses may have withstood sterilization, but it would have weakened any effect they may have had, if there were any.\nThen the researchers tested the potions on\u00a0 Vibrio .\n\u201cAll of the solutions\u2019 defenses were compromised to varying extents at elevated temperatures where we see corals getting sick in the ocean,\u201d Hay said.\nBut reef protection benefited the potion taken from the species\u00a0 Acropora millepora .\n\u201cThe beneficial effect in the solution tested in the lab was better when\u00a0 Acropora \u00a0came from protected areas, and this difference became more pronounced at 28 degrees Celsius,\u201d said Beatty, who finished her Ph.D. with Hay and is now a postdoctoral researcher at the University of California, Davis.\nAcropora \u00a0architecture\nOf the three species with potions that were tested,\u00a0 Acropora millepora \u00a0may be a special one.\nIt is part of a genus \u2013 larger taxonomic category \u2013 containing about 150 of the roughly 600 species in Pacific reefs, and\u00a0 Acropora \u00a0are core builders of reef structures. They grow higher as sea level rises, helping maintain healthy positions for whole reefs.\n\u201c Acropora \u00a0are big and branching and make lots of crevices where fish live. The\u00a0 evolution of lots of reef fish parallels the evolution of\u00a0 Acropora \u00a0in particular,\u201d Hay said.\nIf fish can hang on, they may buy\u00a0 Acropora \u00a0more time, and coral reefs perhaps, too.\nAlso READ:\u00a0 When Coral Species Vanish, Their Absence Can Imperil Surviving Corals\nThese researchers coauthored the study:\u00a0Deanna Beatty, Jinu Valayil, Cody Clements, and Frank Stewart of Georgia Tech.
