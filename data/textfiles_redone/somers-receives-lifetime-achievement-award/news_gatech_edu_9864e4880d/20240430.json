Somers was recently honored by the Georgia Historical Records Advisory Council with the 2021 Award for Excellence in Lifetime Achievement for her unwavering dedication to preserving the history of the Institute.\n\u201cI\u2019m very grateful to be recognized when I thought my career was in the rearview mirror,\u201d said Somers, who retired in December 2020. For her, the best parts of the job included working with students, meeting interesting people, and saving the stories told by Tech alumni. Somers and the Living History team would give each interviewee\u2019s family a transcript and a link to the video of the interview.\n\u201cWhat I didn\u2019t realize at the very beginning is that to be able to say, \u2018Here is your loved one\u2019s story\u2019 is a great gift to give to the families,\u201d she said.\nThe Living History Program was established in 1994 when Somers, then director of communications for the Georgia Tech Alumni Association, received a call from a nursing home asking for a recording of the Ramblin\u2019 Wreck fight song to play at the 100th birthday party of an alumnus.\nTo commemorate Somers\u2019 work and honor her dedication, the Marilyn Somers Living History Program Collection (1994-2020)\u00a0has been unveiled. The collection is\u00a0housed\u00a0in the\u00a0Georgia Tech\u00a0Archives and Special\u00a0Collections and can be found at\u00a0\u00a0 Collection: Marilyn Somers Living History Program Collection | Archives and Special Collections (gatech.edu)\nAdditional Images\nContact\nVictor Rogers\nInstitute Communications\nEmail\nvictor.rogers@comm.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
