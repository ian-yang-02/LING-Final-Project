(Purdue University illustration/Raymond Hassan)\nOct 23, 2018\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nSolar power accounts for less than two percent of U.S. electricity, but could make up more than that if the cost of electricity generation and energy storage for use on cloudy days and at nighttime were cheaper.\nA Purdue University-led team that included researchers from Georgia Tech have developed a new material and manufacturing process that would make one way to use solar power \u2013 as heat energy \u2013 more efficient in generating electricity.\nThe innovation is an important step for putting solar heat-to-electricity generation in direct cost competition with fossil fuels, which generate more than 60 percent of electricity in the U.S.\n\u201cStoring solar energy as heat can already be cheaper than storing energy via batteries, so the next step is reducing the cost of generating electricity from the sun's heat with the added benefit of zero greenhouse gas emissions,\u201d said Kenneth Sandhage, Purdue\u2019s Reilly Professor of Materials Engineering.\nThe research, which was done at Purdue in collaboration with the Georgia Institute of Technology, the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Oak Ridge National Laboratory, published in the journal\nNature\non October 18.\nSolar power doesn't only generate electricity via panels in farms or on rooftops. Another option is concentrated power plants that run on heat energy.\nConcentrated solar power plants convert solar energy into electricity by using mirrors or lenses to concentrate a lot of light onto a small area, which generates heat that is transferred to a molten salt. Heat from the molten salt is then transferred to a \"working\" fluid, supercritical carbon dioxide, that expands and works to spin a turbine for generating electricity.\nTo make solar-powered electricity cheaper, the turbine engine would need to generate even more electricity for the same amount of heat, which means the engine needs to run hotter.\nThe problem is that heat exchangers, which transfer heat from the hot molten salt to the working fluid, are currently made of stainless steel or nickel-based alloys that get too soft at the desired higher temperatures and at the elevated pressure of supercritical carbon dioxide.\nInspired by the materials his group had previously combined to make composite materials that can handle high heat and pressure for applications like solid-fuel rocket nozzles, Sandhage worked with Asegun Henry \u2013 formerly at Georgia Tech, but now at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology \u2013 to conceive of a similar composite for more robust heat exchangers.\nTwo materials showed promise together as a composite: The ceramic zirconium carbide, and the metal tungsten.\nPurdue researchers created plates of the ceramic-metal composite. The plates host customizable channels for tailoring the exchange of heat, based on simulations of the channels conducted at Georgia Tech by\nDevesh Ranjan's\nteam.\n\u201cWe simulated the printed circuit heat exchanger, which contains channels that are straight and parallel with semi-circular cross sections two millimeters in diameter,\u201d said Ranjan, associate professor in the\nGeorge W. Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering . \u201cThe thickness of each plate in the printed circuit heat exchanger stack and the spacing between the channels were then determined from the maximum allowed stresses for each type of material, with a factor of safety added.\u201d\nMechanical tests by Edgar Lara-Curzio\u2019s team at Oak Ridge National Laboratory and corrosion tests by Mark Anderson\u2019s team at Wisconsin-Madison helped show that this new composite material could be tailored to successfully withstand the higher temperature, high-pressure supercritical carbon dioxide needed for generating electricity more efficiently than today\u2019s heat exchangers.\nAn economic analysis by Georgia Tech and Purdue researchers also showed that the scaled-up manufacturing of these heat exchangers could be conducted at comparable or lower cost than for stainless steel or nickel alloy-based ones.\n\u201cUltimately, with continued development, this technology would allow for large-scale penetration of renewable solar energy into the electricity grid,\u201d Sandhage said. \u201cThis would mean dramatic reductions in man-made carbon dioxide emissions from electricity production.\u201d\nA patent application has been filed for this advancement. The work is supported by the U.S. Department of Energy, which has also recently awarded additional funding for further development and scaling up the technology.\nThis story was provided by Purdue University.\nResearch News\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\n177 North Avenue\nAtlanta, Georgia 30332-0181\nMedia Relations Contacts : Purdue (Kayla Wiles, 765-494-2432, wiles5@purdue.edu); Georgia Tech (John Toon, 404-894-6986, (jtoon@gatech.edu)\nWriter : Kayla Wiles, Purdue University\nAdditional Images\nContact\nJohn Toon\nResearch News\n(404) 894-6986\nEmail\njtoon@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
