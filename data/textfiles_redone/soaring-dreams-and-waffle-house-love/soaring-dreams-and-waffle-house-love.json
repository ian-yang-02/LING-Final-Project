He also loves the Georgia-based restaurant chain, Waffle House.\nAt age five, Alex designed his own Boeing 787 for his kindergarten science fair \u2014 getting help from his U.S. Army veteran grandfather who graduated from Georgia Tech with degrees in architecture and civil engineering. As a child, his love of flight was also inspired by his father\u2019s work with Air Aruba.\nAfter moving to Georgia, where he grew up, there are two things that Alex always knew: he wanted to be a pilot, and Waffle House serves the best comfort food.\nFor the last four years, Alex has spent his time in Colorado Springs, Colorado, at the Air Force Academy. Before he left, he Googled, \u201cHow many Waffle House locations in Colorado Springs?\u201d and three showed up on the map.\nNow graduated from the U.S. Air Force Academy with a Bachelor of Science in Aeronautical Engineering, the active 2 nd\nLieutenant is a master\u2019s student in the Daniel Guggenheim School of Aerospace Engineering.\n\u201cI feel my Air Force experience has instilled great time management skills, diligence, and communications skills that will help me succeed at Tech,\u201d he says.\nHe spends his time balancing research projects in the Aerospace Systems Design Laboratory with his main focus on his project for the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), which invests in technologies supporting national security.\nVan Der Linden\u2019s research focuses on active flow control (AFC), an evolving field of fluid dynamics. His goal is to demonstrate significant efficiency benefits of AFC in an effort to make improvements in aircraft cost, weight, performance, and reliability.\nAfter he completes his graduate program, it\u2019s off to another adventure \u2014 pilot training for the Air Force under the Euro-NATO Joint Jet Pilot Training Program (ENJJPT). But today, he is proud to be on Georgia Tech\u2019s campus to follow in the footsteps of his grandfather.\nAnd it doesn\u2019t hurt that Atlanta has more Waffle Houses than any other city in America.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nEvan Atkinson , Institute Communications\nEmail\neatkinson6@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
