According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, nearly 70 percent of smokers wished they could quit. The Georgia Tech students behind Nix hope their invention can help increase the number of successful quitters.\nThey developed an e-cigarette device with a custom-coded computer that gradually reduces the amount of nicotine a user receives.\n\u201cWe saw some of our friends struggling with addiction to e-cigarettes and cigarettes,\u201d mechanical engineering student Robert Patterson explains.\u00a0The team gathered information about current smoking cessation options, and asked themselves what was keeping success rates so low.\n\u201cA lot of the current nicotine therapies \u2014 like gums and patches \u2014 start with a baseline dosage and involve tapered steps,\u201d explains Nix team member and mechanical engineering student Cory Stine. \u201cWe\u2019re just trying to make it more continuous.\u201d\nThere can also be significant user error in many standard quitting options. A forgotten patch here or too much gum chewing there, and you\u2019re off the intended plan.\u00a0\u201cWith our product, you don\u2019t have to think about any of that. You just use it,\u201d says computer science major Robert Olsen.\nWhat makes Nix different? The onboard chip on the device collects data about the user\u2019s habits and develops a customized plan to taper off nicotine.\n\u201cIt can tell exactly when you last puffed, so we know how much nicotine we last gave you. We keep track of your entire history of use,\u201d explains Nix co-inventor Mohammed Aamir. \u201cOver time, because we have control of nicotine output, we can taper it down over a period of four to six weeks.\u201d\u00a0Eventually, the team says, you\u2019re just getting vapor and you\u2019re not chemically dependent on the device.\nThe end goal: zero nicotine.\n\u201cThe idea is to make it as simple as possible so you\u2019d barely even notice,\u201d says Stone.\nThe CDC says smoking increases the risk for serious health problems, many diseases, and death. People who stop smoking greatly reduce their risk for disease and early death. Although the health benefits are greater for people who stop at earlier ages, there are benefits at any age.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nSteven Norris\nInsitute Communcations\nEmail\nsnorris@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
