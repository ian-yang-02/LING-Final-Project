Learning Assistants (LAs) are students who can help facilitate small group collaboration inside the classroom by working alongside faculty during breakout activities. They promote one-on-one and small group discussions to boost comprehension and problem-solving skills during class.\nThey meet weekly with course instructor to discuss upcoming assignments, activities, labs, and common student difficulties. They also take a 1-credit pedagogy course on interactive educational techniques (CETL 2001) during their first semester as an LA.\nLearning Assistants are a hybrid of a PLUS Leader and a Teaching Assistant (TA). They are used more flexibly and may facilitate small group interaction\u00a0inside\u00a0the classroom,\u00a0hold\u00a0weekly office hours,\u00a0and\u00a0assist with grading. LAs\u00a0also help\u00a0lower\u00a0the teacher to student ratio. LAs are not to replace TA duties.\nThis fall, the LA Program is supporting 10 faculty members in nine courses, with plans to expand in Spring 2022.\nFaculty interested in requesting LA Program support for spring semester may\napply here . A faculty information session\nwill be held virtually\non BlueJeans, Friday, Oct. 29, from 10 to 11 a.m.\nStudents interested in becoming a Learning Assistant may\napply here .\nFor more information, visit the Learning Assistant Program\nwebsite .
