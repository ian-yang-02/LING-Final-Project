But when summer rolls around, the high-tech haven is open to high school students who learn the ins and outs of personal finance and investment.\nThese young minds are starting early, learning how to calculate a mortgage and car payments and even finding about starting a retirement plan as early as possible.\n\u201cWe talk about risk and return, living below your means, keeping low fees \u2013 some of those core fundamental topics of finance,\u201d says Jonathan Clarke, associate professor in the Ernest Scheller Jr. College of Business. \u201cThe younger you can start these conversations, the better off they\u2019ll be long-term.\u201d\nThe dual-display computers and scrolling stock information inside the trading room utilize much of the same technology employed by professional brokerage firms across the world. Students are broken up into groups where they buy and sell stocks based on up-to-the-second evaluations.\n\u201cAt these workstations we are able to simulate a real-time trading environment,\u201d explains Jacqueline Garner, a lecturer in the Scheller College.\nAt the end of the week, the teams calculate the total profits they have made from their stock trading decisions.\n\u201cWe discussed different strategies like buying when stocks are down or selling when they\u2019re up. I suggested buying Google and Starbucks stocks for my team,\u201d high school junior Zavan Croom explains.\n\u201cIn the beginning we tried to play it safe and invest in what we thought were solid stocks,\u201d explains high school senior Audrey Jordan. \u201cWe went all in on a risky stock, and luckily it paid off. We went from last place to first.\u201d\n\u201cI think the competition element really makes this fun for these students,\u201d Garner says.\nThe Ferris-Goldsmith Trading Floor was made possible by generous gifts from a Georgia Tech alumnus and his wife, and the widow of a Georgia Tech graduate: Jere Goldsmith, a 1956 business graduate who retired as first vice president of investments at Merrill Lynch, and his late wife, Barbara; and Joyce Ferris, widow of Dakin Ferris Jr., a 1950 management graduate who served as vice chairman of Merrill Lynch.\n\u201cA lot of universities don\u2019t have a space like this,\u201d Garner says. \u201cWe\u2019re really lucky at Georgia Tech to have this.\u201d\n\u201cI love the two screens,\u201d Jordan says. \u201cIt feels like we\u2019re on a real trading floor.\"\nAs much fun as the students are having, the faculty are hoping for a more long-term pay off.\n\u201cI think a lot of people struggle with even the basics. Understanding how a mortgage works. Understanding how a retirement plan works. The sooner you can start understanding the better,\u201d Garner states.\n\u201cIf we had more 20-year-olds and 30-year-olds prepared to make better financial decisions, we\u2019d all see the benefit of that,\u201d says Clarke.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nSteven Norris\nGeorgia Tech Social Media\nEmail\nsnorris@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
