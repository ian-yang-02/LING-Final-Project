It is also part of AI4OPT\u2019s mission to inspire young Georgians to pursue STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics).\nAI4OPT hosted its first in-person summer camp at Georgia Tech in June. The camp brought together 60 students from schools across Georgia including Drew Charter, Banneker High School, and Westlake High School.\nSweeny was asked to return to this particular camp\u2014but this time, as a mentor.\n\u201cOf course, I said yes, because it was something fun that I could do over the summer preparing for college without it being too hefty,\u201d said Sweeny. \u201cIt was something that I felt prepared for from attending the camp.\u201d\nResponses like Sweeny\u2019s motivates SBC Site Managers like Reem Khir to introduce more bright minds to the camp centered around computer programming logic, programming language for AI, and teamwork.\n\u201cWe expose them [high school students] to certain types of education areas like Twitter analysis, how to solve a sudoku, and even computational biology, if they wanted to consider a career in biology,\u201d said Khir, who joined the camp last year to help students with assignments. This year, she took on even bigger leadership role by maintaining and observing two camps and facilitating 50 students and seven teaching assistants (TAs). She worked under a \u2018student to student and student to TA\u2019 interactive structure so that each participant took away a useful skill in data science.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the time where high school students start forming opinions and decisions about the career path they want to pursue,\u201d said Khir. \u201cThe steppingstone is their college education, and we can help students in that period.\u201d\nAI4OPT Will Acquire and Advance Seth Bonder Camp\nAI4OPT is working to adopt a short-term system used to track students after the camp. The institute wants to build up the system to see majors, colleges, and career paths each student has vowed to pursue before they head off to college or the workforce.\n\u201cThis is a critical period for students,\u201d said Khir. \u201cIt\u2019s a time where students start thinking about a major for college and later impacting the next 20 or 30 years of their life. Being a part of that is very unique in terms of creating a positive influence in the next generation.\u201d\nAI4OPT is taking the lead over the SBC to offer the initiative more organizational support as the program has seen tremendous growth and has become a much broader initiative. The Seth Bonder Foundation, which first introduced the camp to those ages 10-18, will continue to fund the camp now more targeted towards high school students interested in engineering, but do not have access to computer science and/or data science in their middle and high schools.\n\u201cA lot of the different communities are not exposed to this and may never see this opportunity. The Seth Bonder Camp exposes high school students to AI opportunities and gives them skills to successfully enter the field of STEM with confidence,\u201d said Professor Pascal Van Hentenryck, who\u2019s brought his data sciences skills and knowledge to Georgia Tech and leads both AI4OPT and the SBC.\nAI4OPT is in transition to lead the SBC to offer more organizational support as the program sees tremendous growth. The research Institute will expand the longitudinal camps to engage middle and high school students in these topics, while also bringing AI education and research programs to HBCU\u2019s and Hispanic-serving colleges throughout the nation, addressing the widening gap in job opportunities.\nThough Sweeny has transitioned away from coding and transcended into research, she never stopped setting goals even now as a first-year biomedical engineering major at Georgia Tech.\n\u201cDo anything you can to take it [the SBC] even if you don't want to go into coding,\u201d said Sweeny. \u201cIt is a good way to meet new people learn new skills, it is something that you don't necessarily have to have a love for coding to have to do it.\u201d\nTo learn more about the Seth Bonder Camp in Computational and Data Science for Engineering and to partner with the camp, visit sethbondercamp.isye.gatech.edu.\n(Writer\u2019s note: This article is part of a series highlighting AI4OPT members, students, education programs and professional development testimonies.)\nEmail\nbreon.martin@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
