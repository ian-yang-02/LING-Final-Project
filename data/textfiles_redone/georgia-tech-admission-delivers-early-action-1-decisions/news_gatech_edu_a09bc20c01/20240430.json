Admitted students hail from 95 counties and 353 high schools (80% public schools and 20% private schools) around the state. Of the Early Action 1 admit pool 52% are women and 48% are men, 13% come from rural areas of Georgia, and 22% identify as Black or Hispanic. Through the\nGeorgia Tech Scholars program , Tech offers admission to valedictorians and salutatorians who apply from any accredited Georgia high school with more than 50 graduates, and 11% of the admitted students are predicted to be honored as such.\n\u201cGeorgia Tech is committed to serving our state by continuing to expand access to more students from communities across Georgia. In fact, this year 1,000 more residents are studying at Tech than just five years ago,\u201d said Rick Clark, director of Undergraduate Admission. \u201cWe are hopeful these newly admitted students will choose to become Yellow Jackets, since they are not only academically talented, but have also had a tremendous impact and influence in their schools and communities.\n\u201cI\u2019m particularly excited about the number of women who continue to apply, enroll, and thrive at Tech. Companies recruit here because of the diverse talent pool we provide \u2014 and the female voice and perspective, particularly when it comes to policy and product creation, is essential.\u201d\nOn Friday Undergraduate Admission staff members virtually surprised students with their acceptances at several high schools across the state: Warner Robins High School and Northside High School in Warner Robins, West Hall High School in Oakwood, Habersham Central High School in Mount Airy, Commerce High School in Commerce, Lamar County Comprehensive High School in Barnesville, North Murray High School in Chatsworth, Cook High School in Adel, Crisp County High School in Cordele, and Atlanta Girls School.\nBeginning with last year\u2019s admission cycle, first-year applicants could select from one of three admission plans: Early Action1, Early Action 2, and Regular Decision.\nThe first cycle of admission is reserved specifically for Georgia students, including Georgia residents attending high school out of state. The application deadline for Early Action 1 was Oct. 15.\nEarly Action 2 will be announced in late January. Students still interested in applying to Tech as first-year students have until Jan. 5 to meet the Regular Decision\napplication deadline . Those decisions will be announced in late March.\nIn the weeks and months ahead, the admission team will not only continue to review applications, but will also work with students who were deferred admission and discuss\ntransfer pathways\nfor students considering another college before completing their undergraduate degree at Georgia Tech. They will also be hosting in-person and virtual \u201cyield\u201d programs to convince early admits to choose Tech.\n\u201cThe students we admit are also being accepted and awarded scholarships from other amazing universities,\u201d Clark said. \u201cOur team, along with campus partners, current students, and Tech alumni, will be focused on hosting students on campus and virtually to tell them about the incredible opportunities, experiences, network, and return on investment Tech provides.\u201d\nLink to\nfull EA-1 profile .\nAdditional Images\nContact\nVictor Rogers\nInstitute Communications\nEmail\nvictor.rogers@comm.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
