All six of Georgia Tech\u2019s colleges saw an increase in applications.\nA total of 2,330 Georgia students were admitted, for an overall admit rate of 38%. Admitted students hail from 90 counties and 366 high schools around the state. Of the Early Action 1 admit pool 50% are men, 50% are women; 12% come from rural areas of Georgia; and 18% identify as Black or Hispanic. Through the Georgia Tech Scholars program, Tech offers admission to valedictorians and salutatorians who apply from any accredited Georgia high school with more than 50 graduates, and 16% of the admitted students are predicted to be honored as such.\n\u201cNumbers could never tell the entire story that we read in these students\u2019 applications,\u201d said Rick Clark, director of Undergraduate Admission. \u201cIn their families, schools, and local communities they have demonstrated amazing impact and influence. It is truly an honor to offer them admission, and we hope they will ultimately choose to continue their education at Tech.\u201d\nOn Friday Undergraduate Admission staff members virtually surprised students with their acceptances at a dozen high schools across the state. President \u00c1ngel Cabrera joined the effort at Maynard Holbrook Jackson High School in Atlanta. And Provost Steven W. McLaughlin virtually congratulated students at Bowdon High School in Bowdon, Georgia.\n\u201cWhat an exciting time to celebrate with students across the state as they are admitted to Georgia Tech,\u201d said McLaughlin, provost and executive vice president for Academic Affairs. \u201cThese decisions are long-awaited and the result of a lot of hard work and dedication on the part of these students. I was absolutely delighted to play a part.\u201d\nBeginning with the 2021 admission cycle, first-year applicants could select from one of three admission plans: Early Action 1, Early Action 2, and Regular Decision.\nThe first cycle of admission is reserved specifically for Georgia students, including Georgia residents attending high school out of state. The application deadline for Early Action 1 was Oct. 15.\nEarly Action 2 will be announced in January, and the Regular Decision announcement will be in March.\n\u201cOur president\u2019s new strategic plan clearly calls for recruiting and enrolling the top talent from around the state, nation, and globe. I genuinely believe Tech\u2019s best days are ahead, and this admitted group of students is great step toward achieving that mission,\u201d Clark said.\n\u201cAt this point, our team is not only focused on reading the more than 21,500 Early Admit 2 applications we received but also convincing our newly admitted students to choose Tech from among their other amazing college options,\u201d he said.\nView the full EA-1 profile\nAdditional Images\nContact\nVictor Rogers\nInstitute Communications\nEmail\nvictor.rogers@comm.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
