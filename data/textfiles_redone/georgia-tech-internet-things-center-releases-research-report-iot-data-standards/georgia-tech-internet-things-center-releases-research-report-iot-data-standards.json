It follows the recent related CDAIT white paper on \u201cDriving New Modes of IoT-Facilitated Citizen/User Engagement\u201d within a smart city context.\nIn partnership with the CDAIT IoT Research Working Group composed of industry and technological experts from the CDAIT company members, the research was produced by Georgia Tech College of Design researchers under the supervision of Dr. Pardis Pishdad-Bozorgi of the School of Building Construction and Dr. Dennis Shelden, director of the Digital Building Laboratory (DBL).\n\u201cIn this report, we propose a strategy and preliminary framework for building level IoT semantic models and open data strategies,\u201d said Dr. Pishdad-Bozorgi. \u201cSemantic models, which, among other things, attach a fundamental and unambiguous description including spatial context to the data and their interconnection, are critical to fostering data interoperability between building systems,\u201d she added.\nThe report provides a brief review of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)\u2019s Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) and IoT-Enabled Smart City Frameworks as well as Building Information Modeling (BIM). \u00a0It then delves into building data standards and protocols and advances foundational elements for a data acquisition framework for the smart built environment such as smart buildings, smart communities and smart cities.\n\u201cBuildings systems often incorporate proprietary networks of sophisticated sensors and actuators in the form of energy systems, security systems, and smart home devices,\u201d said Dr. Dennis Shelden. \u201cIt is a tremendous impediment not only to IoT interconnectivity but also innovation; articulating a sound strategy for connecting emerging IoT data standards with maturing building information standards can fast-track IoT adoption and expansion,\u201d he underlined.\nThe research leveraged Georgia Tech DBL\u2019s many years of expertise and experience in the development of open building information data exchange standards. DBL faculty and staff are leading members of many of the international organizations creating BIM data exchange standards.\n\u201cThis effort zeroes in on a key IoT vertical market, i.e., smart build environment, and offers a comprehensive perspective on organizations and alliances directly involved in the space,\u201d said Alain Louchez, Managing Director of CDAIT. \u201cIt paves the way for extending building information standards in support of the IoT growth.\u201d\nThe targeted audience for this report consists of software and telecom engineers; computer scientists; application developers; IT architects; smart building solutions architects; system administrators and engineers; architects; as well as business managers and other parties interested in IoT technical underpinnings.\nThe report is available at the\nCDAIT website.\nAbout DBL\nThe Digital Building Laboratory (DBL) is a research center in the Georgia Institute of Technology (\u201cGeorgia Tech\u201d)\u2019s College of Design that pursues technology driven advances in design, construction, and operations of the built environment. The DBL was founded by Professor Emeritus Chuck Eastman in 2009 and is led by Dennis Shelden, an associate professor in the School of Architecture. The DBL undertakes and sponsors research and development, maintains a consortium of industry members, and conducts industry advancement workshops, symposia and educational programs.
