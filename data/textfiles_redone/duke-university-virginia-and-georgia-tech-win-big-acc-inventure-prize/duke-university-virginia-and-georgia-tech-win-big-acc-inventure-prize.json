BioMetrix from Duke won first place and $15,000. This team, led by two women, invented a way to keep athletes and sports teams healthier. A wearable sensor adheres to the skin, collects data and uses cloud services to quantify rehabilitation progress and provide real-time feedback to reduce athletic injuries.\u00a0 Contraline from UVA finished second and earned $10,000. This five-member team is developing a male contraceptive that is long-lasting, non-hormonal and reversible. The non-surgical process is safe, effective and more appealing than condoms or vasectomies, inventors said. And Georgia Tech\u2019s FireHUD scored $5,000 as winners of the People Choice Award, which went to the fans\u2019 favorite invention. The team invented a device to help keep firefighters safe. The\nACC InVenture Prize , which taps into the startup culture growing on college campuses, was held at Georgia Tech. Each of the 15 universities in the Atlantic Coast Conference sent a team of students to the competition. The group was narrowed to five finalists that competed during Wednesday\u2019s live finale. The other two teams were from Boston College and the University of North Carolina. The contest is sponsored by the ACC Academic Consortium, which supports academic initiatives among member universities. Rafael L. Bras, Georgia Tech\u2019s provost and executive vice president for Academic Affairs, said leaders were looking to celebrate the strong academics found in all the ACC schools and agreed that the InVenture Prize was a way to accomplish that goal. The event was modeled after\nGeorgia Tech\u2019s InVenture Prize , which rewards undergraduate students with cash prizes for innovations that aim to solve the world\u2019s big problems. FireHUD won Georgia Tech\u2019s InVenture Prize last month. Zack Braun, a computer engineering major, and Tyler Sisk, an electrical engineering major, i nvented a head-up-display\nthat attaches to a firefighter\u2019s mask and measures heart rate, respiratory rate, blood oxygen level, body temperature, external temperature and other vital signs. This information will help firefighters know if they are overexerting themselves, which can lead to cardiac arrest. The device also transmits data to the incident commander, who can view it on a computer through an app. The team already\nwon $20,000 in the Georgia Tech InVenture Prize . That, along with the $5,000 prize from the ACC contest, will allow them to continue to improve the device, Braun said. \u201cIt felt great representing Georgia Tech,\u201d Sisk said. \u201cIt made this win a little bit more special because we were here for Tech.\u201d Georgia Tech will continue to have a strong presence with the ACC InVenture Prize. The 2017 competition is scheduled to return to campus.\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nACC InVenture Prize\nContact\nLaura Diamond\u00a0 Media Relations\u00a0 404-894-6016 @LauraRDiamond\nEmail\nlaura.diamond@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
