Pending approval by Governor Brian Kemp, the University System of Georgia will allocate an unprecedented additional $98.3 million to Georgia Tech for the upcoming fiscal year (FY23). This brings Georgia Tech\u2019s total state appropriations to nearly $457 million \u2013 a 27% increase.\n\u201cWe are deeply grateful to Governor Kemp, the General Assembly, and the University System of Georgia for their ongoing support and their continued investment for the coming year,\u201d said Georgia Tech President \u00c1ngel Cabrera. \u201cTheir willingness to invest in our people \u2013 both students and employees \u2013\u00a0is a testament to their support of higher education as well as Georgia Tech\u2019s commitment to offer an excellent educational experience to our students and a top-notch place to work for every member of our faculty and staff.\u201d\nThe funds appropriated by the state will allow Georgia Tech to eliminate the Special Institutional Fee, which amounts to $344 per semester for graduate students and $544 for undergraduates. In addition, the Board of Regents voted to\nkeep tuition steady\nfor the third consecutive year. \u201cAt a time of great national concern over the mounting cost of higher education, it is comforting to see that the cost of a Georgia Tech education will not only not go up this year but indeed will be reduced,\u201d Cabrera said. \u201cWe are fortunate to be in a state that invests in higher education so that we can offer high quality and affordable options to our students.\u201d\nThe new budget will also fund a\nCost of Living Adjustment\nof $5,000 per employee that will begin to appear this month in employee paychecks.\nGeorgia Tech\u2019s additional $98.3 million in state appropriations for FY23 can be broken down as follows:\n$38.8 million in enrollment growth funding.\n$33.6 million to fund the elimination of the Special Institutional Fees.\n$24.8 million to fund the Cost of Living Adjustment.\n$1.1 million in adjustments to employee benefits and maintenance and operations.\nAlong with next year\u2019s budget allocation, the USG also approved several capital projects, to be paid for with institutional funds, at Georgia Tech including a new\nStudent-Athlete Performance Center , an Aerospace Engineering Aircraft Hangar Facility, and improvements to the Blake R. Van Leer Building for Electrical and Computer Engineering, as well as safety and accessibility enhancements to Ferst Drive and campus streetscapes. The USG also approved the establishment of the Master of Science in Global Development.\n\u201cWe are very appreciative of these allocations and look forward to investing in areas that support our growth and directly benefit our people, spaces, and processes,\u201d said Kelly Fox, executive vice president for Administration and Finance. \u201cOver the next few weeks, we will work diligently to prioritize spending that supports our strategic initiatives and upholds our values \u2013 always putting our students first in everything we do.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d also like to give a special thanks to our Institute Relations team,\u201d Cabrera said. \u201cThey are instrumental in sharing our story of growth and impact with state leaders and helping us secure resources to help us develop leaders who advance technology and improve the human condition.\u201d\nGeorgia Tech\u2019s Institute Budget Planning and Administration will submit the FY23 budget to the Board of Regents for spending approval in advance of the Board of Regents meeting in May.
