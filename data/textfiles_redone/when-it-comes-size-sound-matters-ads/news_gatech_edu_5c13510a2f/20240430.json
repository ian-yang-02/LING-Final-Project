Participants listened to a radio advertisement for a new sandwich at a fictitious sandwich chain where a spokesperson\u2019s voice was digitally altered to be higher or lower. Participants who heard the ad featuring the lower-pitched voice believed the sandwich was significantly larger than those who heard the higher-pitched version.\nThe same trend was observed in a separate study that tested the pitch level of music. Participants viewed a TV advertisement, with voiceover removed, for a laptop computer and answered several questions about their perceptions. Those who viewed a version of the ad with lower-pitched music perceived the laptop to be larger than those who viewed the higher-pitched variety.\nAdditional studies traced the limitations and contexts of size-sound associations. One study found that an association between a sound and product is necessary to create the desired size effect. Two others showed this effect is most prominent in ads that facilitate product visualization or when visual product information isn\u2019t available at the time of judgment.\nThe researchers believe this work will be relevant for marketers and researchers alike, as it offers important consideration for ads while setting the stage for further study.\n\u201cEven small cues such as differences in acoustic pitch,\u201d they wrote, \u201ccan lead to measurably different perceptions about the products with which they are paired. We demonstrate an important way in which symbolism in sound extends beyond word symbolism, thus expanding the horizons of research in \u2018sound symbolism\u2019 and sensory marketing more generally.\u201d\nCITATION:\nMichael L.
