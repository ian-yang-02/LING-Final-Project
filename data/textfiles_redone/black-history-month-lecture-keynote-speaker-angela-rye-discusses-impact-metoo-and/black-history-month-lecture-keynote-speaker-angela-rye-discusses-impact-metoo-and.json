Justice! When do we want it? Now!\nAccording to Georgia Tech\u2019s Fifth Annual Black History Month Lecture Keynote Speaker Angela Rye, this is the wrong ask.\n\u201cIn Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s \u2018Where Do We Go from Here?\u2019 speech, he discussed power, and he defined power as the ability to achieve purpose,\u201d said Rye. \u201cWhen you can\u2019t achieve your purpose, does it matter if you are dealt with fairly?\u201d\n\u201cIf you\u2019re released from a form of bondage, and you\u2019re not equipped to fully engage in society in a meaningful way, your justice means nothing. Society can treat you fairly, but if you don\u2019t have the tools to achieve your purpose, or power, you\u2019re going to fail. Black activists have been asking for justice and equality, but what we need is equity and power.\u201d\nThe theme of this year\u2019s Black History Month Lecture was \u201cGiving Voice to Justice for 50 Years.\u201d \u201cThe theme was selected to mark the 50th anniversary of the assassination of Dr. King and the founding of AASU at Georgia Tech,\u201d explained Leah Miller, president of the African American Student Union (AASU) and undergraduate student in the Ernest Scheller Jr. College of Business. \u201cMoreover, 2018 is seeing a continuation of the #MeToo movement in the ongoing struggle for gender equity.\u201d\nRye, a national political strategist and commentator, discussed the recent controversies surrounding pervasive sexual harassment, the unmasking of male privilege, and the impact of the #MeToo movement through the lens of Black History Month. As a central narrative, Rye repeatedly referenced \u201cAin\u2019t I a Woman?,\u201d a powerful speech delivered by Sojourner Truth at the Women\u2019s Rights Convention in 1851.\n\u201cI wonder what Sojourner would say today given our current discord and state of the struggle. Not just for women\u2019s rights but for black women\u2019s rights,\u201d reflected Rye. \u201cWhen I think of the many black women throughout history who have blazed trails, opened doors, persisted, and resisted, I pull from their strength. I get to stand on their shoulders. And ain\u2019t I a woman?\u201d\nIn addition to #MeToo, Rye talked about the #StayWoke movement. \u201cWe can\u2019t afford to talk about \u2018Stay Woke\u2019 anymore; we have to \u2018Work Woke.\u2019 We have to use our gifts to truly change our path forward. Black History Month is about honoring the legacy of people who blazed trails for us. They were working woke.\u201d\nInstitute Diversity Vice President Archie Ervin concluded the lecture by stating that he was inspired by the references to \u201cAin\u2019t I a Woman.\u201d \u201cToday\u2019s lecture was an uplifting experience, and at Georgia Tech, we are honored to continue the conversation on April 5 by unveiling a sculpture of Rosa Parks in one of our most cherished locations, Harrison Square.\u201d\nTo view the Black History Month Lecture in its entirety, visit\nhttps://youtu.be/n_W4WzIx9dw .\nGeorgia Tech\u2019s Black History Month Lecture was sponsored by Institute Diversity and AASU.
