But new dashboards at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are sorting public health data to make it more productive, with the help of researchers from the\nGeorgia Tech Research Institute\n(GTRI).\nOne of the dashboards\nwas recently made accessible to the public.\n\u201cThe main value of that dashboard is tracking the relationship between human mobility \u2013 whether it\u2019s people going to stores or for entertainment or to workplaces \u2013 and the COVID-19 case counts and death counts,\u201d said Jason Poovey, head of the High-Performance Computing and Data Analytics branch at GTRI.\nThe dashboard\u2019s main pane displays total numbers of confirmed infections and deaths for the nation and also breaks them down for individual states and counties. On other pages, graphs trace people\u2019s presence at places such as shopping malls, restaurants, and transit stations \u2013 using data from Google and other sources \u2013 and display this together with graphs of COVID-19 data. On another page, trend lines for infection and death rates appear alongside trends for coronavirus testing.\n\u201cUnderstanding the timing and potential impact of stay-at-home or shelter-in-place policies on human mobility and COVID-19 transmission patterns can assist state and local public health partners in modifying these orders over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic,\u201d said Macarena Garcia, CDC\u2019s chief data scientist for the CDC COVID-19 Response. \u201cIn addition, dashboards increase the understanding of when and how to fully implement these strategies in future outbreaks where community mitigation may be required.\u201d\nInternal dashboards\nIn addition, COVID-19 responders and researchers at the CDC are using about a dozen internally facing dashboards built by the GTRI team to move data from CDC reports and presentations to a visualization platform. This allows the team to regularly update the data and make it widely accessible. Each dashboard is tailored to individual task force needs.\n\u201cThere are different aspects to the COVID-19 response and each group is handling a different part of it, so they each have different needs. One group might be cross-referencing data with outbreak hotspots. Another group may want to track mobility versus new infections by segments of the population,\u201d Poovey said.\n\u201cSome groups are directly doing COVID-19 response on the ground; others are doing studies using existing data, and we support both sides,\u201d said Charity Hilton, a health data analytics research scientist at GTRI and lead of the COVID-19 task group with the CDC. \u201cWe will also be working with the CDC\u2019s international task force on COVID-19 to help them collect and analyze global data.\u201d\n\u201cWe have worked closely with GTRI on the design and operationalization of data analytic tools and products to inform CDC response activities across many task forces,\u201d said CDC\u2019s Garcia. \u201cOur focused collaboration with GTRI on meeting emerging analytic needs across the response has resulted in quicker and more efficient tracking of localized outbreaks in the United States.\u201d\nCOVID-19 pivot\nWhen COVID-19 hit, GTRI engineers were already in place due to other collaborations with the CDC.\n\u201cWe have had a series of projects with CDC since October 2019 to get health data into useful platforms. We were able to pivot very quickly to COVID-19 work,\u201d said Jon Duke, a medical doctor and health informatics expert who leads the Center for Health Analytics and Informatics at GTRI.\nThe COVID-19 case and testing data are taken mainly from USAfacts.org, a public information outlet that publishes data compiled by government agencies. Testing and case numbers are updated on the public-facing CDC COVID-19 dashboard every day.\nData on how people move about in their daily lives comes from various anonymized mobile phone sources. They include Google mobility reports at the county level, anonymous GPS data from mobile carriers, and a mobile data service called Cuebiq Mobility, which provides median distances cell phone users travel over time.\nDistancing data\nThe group will create more custom dashboards to meet CDC COVID-19 groups\u2019 needs and expand many of the existing dashboards, including the public one.\n\u201cWe just added news report scouring, so the public can get a daily list of news from hotspot counties, and people can see corresponding reports of outbreaks maybe at a meatpacking plant or in a nursing home. Or they can see where there has been a boost in testing,\u201d Hilton said.\nThe public dashboard also provides easy access to data that is usually harder to find, such as local stay-at-home orders, travel restrictions, and public health laws. The GTRI team is also working to help Georgia Tech pandemic researchers who are modeling the development of COVID-19 in the state of Georgia by organizing data reflecting the population\u2019s degree of adherence to social distancing.\nResearch News\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\n177 North Avenue\nAtlanta, Georgia\u00a0 30332-0181\u00a0 USA\nMedia Relations Contact : John Toon (404-894-6986) (jtoon@gatech.edu).\nWriter : Ben Brumfield\nAdditional Images\nContact\nJohn Toon\nResearch News\n(404) 894-6986\nEmail\njtoon@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
