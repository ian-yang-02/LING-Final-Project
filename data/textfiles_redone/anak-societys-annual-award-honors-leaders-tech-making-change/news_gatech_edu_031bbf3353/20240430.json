The society\u2019s membership process is a secret, and its\nwebsite\noffers minimal information. (Fun fact: new members used to find out they\u2019d been selected by a tap on the shoulder during interfraternity council dances.)\nWhat is clear is that campus involvement and leadership skills are crucial to becoming a member. The ANAK Society\u2019s activities and members are hard to pin down, but every year, the ANAK Award is presented at the Faculty and Staff Honors Celebration to honor a faculty member who has demonstrated \u201coutstanding service to the Institute and to the student body.\u201d ANAK members vote on who to give the award to, and, starting this year, staff members will also be honored. Sidartha Rakuram, former ANAK president, talked about this year\u2019s ANAK Award and the decision behind naming Dr. Jennifer Hirsch and Dr. Benjamin Holton as this year\u2019s winners.\nBoth were honored at this year\u2019s virtual\nFaculty and Staff Honors Celebration\nin April. When asked about picking Hirsch as a recipient, Rakuram explained, \"She has been an amazing leader at the Center for Serve-Learn-Sustain in the Office of Undergraduate Education.\" Hirsch established the SLS Affiliated Courses Program and, under her leadership the past six years, the number of SLS affiliated courses has grown significantly. She is also a founding leader of the sustainability education network RCE Greater Atlanta, officially acknowledged by the United Nations University \u2013 one of more than 175 Regional Centres of Expertise on Education for Sustainable Development across the world.\nThis year, SLS was part of the Racial Injustice and Sexual Violence collective, which advances the United Nations\u2019 Sustainable Development Goal of Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions. The collective aims to develop a plan to address issues of inequality and accountability for racial injustice and sexual violence on campus by identifying \u201cgaps, systemic barriers, and areas for improvement that may exist within our institution due to policies, practices, and other norms.\u201d In Rakuram\u2019s words, Hirsch has \u201cpushed Georgia Tech forward in many ways and is an inspiration to the many students who work with her.\"\nWhen asked about the inaugural staff recipient, Rarkuram said, \u201cDr. Holton\u2019s impact this past year has been undeniable and his patience and empathy while working with students, faculty, staff, and parents has been clear to all of us.\u201d Dr. Holton has played a key role in coordinating Georgia Tech\u2019s Covid-19 response. His leadership has been vital in rolling out Tech\u2019s Covid-19 policies and protocols, as well as the Institute\u2019s surveillance testing and vaccination programs. \u201cGeorgia Tech is safer and healthier because of him and his team at Stamps Health Services,\" Rakuram said.\nFor more information on the ANAK Award, visit the ANAK Society\nwebsite .\nAdditional Images\nContact\nVanesa Vargas\nInstitute Communications\nEmail\nstucomm@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
