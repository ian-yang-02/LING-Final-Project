Shah shared his advice to Tech students and faculty during a conversation with President \u00c1ngel Cabrera Tuesday.\nShah noted that too often, many people settle for \"good enough\" in problem-solving and stop short of seeking comprehensive solutions.\nDrawing on his expertise after leading the U.S. response to the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, and working to increase access to immunizations worldwide, Shah outlined the framework of a \"big bet.\" It begins with identifying innovative solutions and building broad alliances to transform the lives of large numbers of people.\n\"If there's one message I hope people take away from the book, it's that these problems are actually solvable,\" he said. \"If 50% of the world's global birth cohort is not getting vaccinated and immunized from simple diseases, it may take 20 years and $30 billion, but we're going to solve the problem of universal childhood immunization. If an Ebola pandemic is ravaging West Africa and threatening the rest of the world, we're not going to settle for what we can do. We're going to really study the issue, invent new solutions, and engineer new solutions.\"\nGeorgia Tech's mission to advance technology and improve the human condition was on display throughout the Covid-19 pandemic as testing infrastructure and contingency plans were created and implemented. Cabrera and Shah discussed how such crises give way to creativity in developing solutions and how the Institute can use the same ambition to lead the world through the next decade's problems.\n\"Coming to Georgia is so exciting because what's happening in the state is very much the epicenter of clean technology and jobs \u2014 power, manufacturing, science, and technology all coming together to shape the future. The question is, are you going to shape a future that solves the problems we face? Or are we going to shape a future that just serves the human desire for luxury and optimizing for those who have plenty? That's a set of judgments that's in your hands,\" he said. \"To me, this is a great institution to be a part of because you have the position to be problem solvers.\"\nBefore the public conversation, Shah participated in a faculty roundtable discussion about combating climate change \u2014 a primary goal of the Rockefeller Foundation.\nWhen thinking of their own \"big bets\" or those that have a global impact, Shah encouraged students to simplify the problem they are trying to solve and apply what they've learned at Georgia Tech to change the world for the better.\n\"I'm a big believer that you all, especially students, can be change agents within whatever institutions you go to when you leave this great one, and I hope the book offers a bit of a playbook for how to do that,\" he said. \"Asking simple questions is a gift we all tend to lose as we grow up professionally, but I hope you will retain it.\"\nWatch the full conversation.\nAdditional Media\nRockefeller Foundation President Rajiv Shah participates in a faculty roundtable discussion at Georgia Tech about combating climate change.\nRockefeller Foundation President Rajiv Shah meets Associate Professor Shannon Yee while touring the Kendeda Building for Innovative Sustainable Design.\nRelated links\nConversations With Cabrera\nContact\nSteven Gagliano\n- Institute Communications\nEmail\nSteven.gagliano@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
