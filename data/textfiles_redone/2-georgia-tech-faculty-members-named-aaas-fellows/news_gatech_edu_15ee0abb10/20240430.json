Aaron Levine, associate dean for research and outreach in the Ivan Allen College of Liberal Arts, and Susan Margulies, professor in the Wallace H. Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering and the Georgia Research Alliance Eminent Scholar in Injury Biomechanics, are two of the 502 people named to the AAAS Fellows Class of 2023. The society has been awarding scientists, engineers, and innovators since 1874 for achievements and efforts on behalf of the advancement of science and its applications. AAAS Fellows are recognized for outstanding contributions to research, teaching, technology, and science communication. The organization chose\nLevine , who is also a professor in the School of Public Policy, for his contributions to biomedical research policy \u2014 including advancing understanding of how policy debates influence contentious areas of research. His work draws on ethics, policy, and biomedical research. He also studies the development and oversight of biomedical research and healthcare areas such as stem cell treatments, assisted reproductive technology, fetal tissue research, and\nCRISPR . The author of\nCloning: A Beginner\u2019s Guide , an accessible introduction to the science of cloning and the ethical and policy controversies it inspires, Levine was a member of the 2019-20 cohort of AAAS\u2019\nAlan I. Leshner Leadership Institute Public Engagement Fellows . Margulies\nleads the U.S. National Science Foundation\u2019s Directorate for Engineering, which provides academic institutions federal funding to support technologies that affect healthcare, agriculture, clean energy, infrastructure, advanced manufacturing, and communications systems. Her research spans the micro-to-macro scales in two distinct subfields: traumatic brain injury and ventilator-induced lung injury. Using an integrated biomechanics approach consisting of relevant animal models, cell and tissue experiments, and complementary computational models and human studies, her lab generates new knowledge about the structural and functional responses of the brain and lungs to their mechanical environment.\u202f Margulies\u202fis a fellow of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, the Biomedical Engineering Society, and the American Institute for Medical and Biological Engineering, and is also a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the National Academy of Engineering, and the National Academy of Medicine.\u202f Most recently, Margulies was one of six Georgia Tech researchers named to the National Academy of Fellows Class of 2023.\nContact\nKristen Bailey Institute Communications\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
