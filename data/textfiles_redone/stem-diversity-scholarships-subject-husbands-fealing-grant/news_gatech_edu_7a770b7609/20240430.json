Sloan Foundation to perform the first comprehensive study of its premier program to increase diversity among doctoral students in STEM fields.\nThe work could have broad-ranging policy implications for similar efforts to increase diversity in science, technology, engineering, and math fields \u2014 an area in which Husbands Fealing devotes much of her attention as a professor and fellow in the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS).\n\u201cThis is about evaluating what has gone on and how we can more successfully evaluate and run these programs, serve the communities that we need to serve and have these individuals be that much more effective and productive,\u201d said\nHusbands Fealing , the principal investigator on the grant.\nHer partner in the two-year project will be Samuel Myers Jr., professor and director of the Roy Wilkins Center for Social Justice and Human Relations in the Humphrey School of Public Affairs at the University of Minnesota. Two graduate students also are working on the project: Gabriel Carter, a master's student in Public Policy at Georgia Tech, and Man Xu, a graduate student at the University of Minnesota.\nImproving STEM Diversity\nDuring the two-year project, Husbands Fealing and Myers will evaluate the Sloan Foundation\u2019s Minority Ph.D. program, a university-based scholarship that is part of the Foundation\u2019s portfolio of programs designed to \u201cimprove the quality and increase the diversity of higher education in STEM\u201d fields. Their work will provide the first empirical analysis of the impact of the program by demographics and disciplinary categories.\n\"The Sloan Foundation has a trove of information about several generations of Ph.D. students in STEM fields at highly competitive universities in America,\u201d said Myers. \u201cTo date, the analysis of that data has generated useful information about who the fellowship recipients\u00a0were, what they did, and how they perceived their experiences. Using novel empirical techniques, this research project will answer questions about the impacts of the fellowship program on both the fellowship recipients\u00a0and their graduate institutions.\u201d\nThe pair want to understand the factors that increased the likelihood of successful completion of a doctoral program and entering a career in academics. They also want to understand what aspects of the scholarship and the universities attended by its recipients promote higher rates of retention, graduation, and academic employment.\n\u201cThe big finish isn\u2019t just the evaluation of what happened in the last 25 years,\u201d Husbands Fealing said. \u201cThe big finish is what can be done to improve these programs and how do we set up evaluative processes to increase the outcomes and positively impact this program and these individuals.\u201d\nSTEM Diversity: More Than Numbers\nFor instance, Husbands Fealing also has been asked to evaluate the Support of Competitive Research (SCORE) program sponsored by the National Institute of General Medical Sciences, an NIH committee on which she served until recently.\nAn evaluative framework such as the one they are working on for the Sloan Foundation project could help such other efforts to understand the factors for success and impact of efforts to increase diversity in STEM fields, she said.\nHusbands Fealing has researched and written widely on the issue of diversity in STEM field, including organizing a 2016 National Science Foundation\nsymposium\non broadening participation in STEM fields and a\njournal article\nlast year that summed up much of the research presented at the event.\nFor Husbands Fealing, understanding the impact of such programs is not just about numbers.\n\u201cMinority and underserved students who succeed at these programs are going to join the professorate and have their own labs. They will be there to mentor those who follow, and will also get to help determine what science gets produced, and that is, I think, important.\u201d\nThe\nSchool of Public Policy\nis a unit of the\nIvan Allen College of Liberal Arts .\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nStudy Probes Gender Pay Gaps in U.S. Federal Science Agencies\nKaye Husbands Fealing Elected NAPA Fellow\nSchool of Public Policy Climbs Again in U.S. News Graduate Program Rankings\nContact\nMichael Pearson\nmichael.pearson@iac.gatech.edu\n404.894.2290\nEmail\nmichael.pearson@iac.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
