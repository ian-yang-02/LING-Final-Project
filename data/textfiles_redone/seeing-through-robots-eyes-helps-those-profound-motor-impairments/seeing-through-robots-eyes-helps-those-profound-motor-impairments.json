The web-based interface displays a \u201crobot\u2019s eye view\u201d of surroundings to help users interact with the world through the machine.\nThe system, described March 15 in the journal\nPLOS ONE , could help make sophisticated robots more useful to people who do not have experience operating complex robotic systems. Study participants interacted with the robot interface using standard assistive computer access technologies \u2014 such as eye trackers and head trackers \u2014 that they were already using to control their personal computers.\nThe paper reported on two studies showing how such \u201crobotic body surrogates\u201d \u2013 which can perform tasks similar to those of humans \u2013 could improve the quality of life for users. The work could provide a foundation for developing faster and more capable assistive robots.\n\u201cOur results suggest that people with profound motor deficits can improve their quality of life using robotic body surrogates,\u201d said Phillip Grice, a recent Georgia Institute of Technology Ph.D. graduate who is first author of the paper. \u201cWe have taken the first step toward making it possible for someone to purchase an appropriate type of robot, have it in their home and derive real benefit from it.\u201d\nGrice and Professor\nCharlie Kemp\nfrom the\nWallace H. Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering at Georgia Tech and Emory University\nused a PR2 mobile manipulator manufactured by Willow Garage for the two studies. The wheeled robot has 20 degrees of freedom, with two arms and a \u201chead,\u201d giving it the ability to manipulate objects such as water bottles, washcloths, hairbrushes and even an electric shaver.\n\u201cOur goal is to give people with limited use of their own bodies access to robotic bodies so they can interact with the world in new ways,\u201d said Kemp.\nIn their first study, Grice and Kemp made the PR2 available across the internet to a group of 15 participants with severe motor impairments. The participants learned to control the robot remotely, using their own assistive equipment to operate a mouse cursor to perform a personal care task. Eighty percent of the participants were able to manipulate the robot to pick up a water bottle and bring it to the mouth of a mannequin.\n\u201cCompared to able-bodied persons, the capabilities of the robot are limited,\u201d Grice said. \u201cBut the participants were able to perform tasks effectively and showed improvement on a clinical evaluation that measured their ability to manipulate objects compared to what they would have been able to do without the robot.\u201d\nIn the second study, the researchers provided the PR2 and interface system to Henry Evans, a California man who has been helping Georgia Tech researchers study and improve assistive robotic systems since 2011. Evans, who has very limited control of his body, tested the robot in his home for seven days and not only completed tasks, but also devised novel uses combining the operation of both robot arms at the same time \u2013 using one arm to control a washcloth and the other to use a brush.\n\u201cThe system was very liberating to me, in that it enabled me to independently manipulate my environment for the first time since my stroke,\u201d said Evans. \u201cWith respect to other people, I was thrilled to see Phil get overwhelmingly positive results when he objectively tested the system with 15 other people.\u201d\nThe researchers were pleased that Evans developed new uses for the robot, combining motion of the two arms in ways they had not expected.\n\u201cWhen we gave Henry free access to the robot for a week, he found new opportunities for using it that we had not anticipated,\u201d said Grice. \u201cThis is important because a lot of the assistive technology available today is designed for very specific purposes. What Henry has shown is that this system is powerful in providing assistance and empowering users. The opportunities for this are potentially very broad.\u201d\nThe interface allowed Evans to care for himself in bed over an extended period of time. \u201cThe most helpful aspect of the interface system was that I could operate the robot completely independently, with only small head movements using an extremely intuitive graphical user interface,\u201d Evans said.\nThe web-based interface shows users what the world looks like from cameras located in the robot\u2019s head. Clickable controls overlaid on the view allow the users to move the robot around in a home or other environment and control the robot\u2019s hands and arms. When users move the robot\u2019s head, for instance, the screen displays the mouse cursor as a pair of eyeballs to show where the robot will look when the user clicks. Clicking on a disc surrounding the robotic hands allows users to select a motion. While driving the robot around a room, lines following the cursor on the interface indicate the direction it will travel.\nBuilding the interface around the actions of a simple single-button mouse allows people with a range of disabilities to use the interface without lengthy training sessions.\n\u201cHaving an interface that individuals with a wide range of physical impairments can operate means we can provide access to a broad range of people, a form of universal design,\u201d Grice noted. \u201cBecause of its capability, this is a very complex system, so the challenge we had to overcome was to make it accessible to individuals who have very limited control of their own bodies.\u201d\nWhile the results of the study demonstrated what the researchers had set out to do, Kemp agrees that improvements can be made. The existing system is slow, and mistakes made by users can create significant setbacks. Still, he said, \u201cPeople could use this technology today and really benefit from it.\u201d\nThe cost and size of the PR2 would need to be significantly reduced for the system to be commercially viable, Evans suggested. Kemp says these studies point the way to a new type of assistive technology.\n\u201cIt seems plausible to me based on this study that robotic body surrogates could provide significant benefits to users,\u201d Kemp added.\nThis work was supported by the National Institute on Disability, Independent Living, and Rehabilitation Research (NIDILRR), grant 90RE5016-01-00 via RERC TechSAge, National Science Foundation Award IIS-1150157, by a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program Award, and the Residential Care Facilities for the Elderly of Fulton County Scholar Award.\nKemp is a cofounder, a board member, an equity holder, and the CTO of Hello Robot Inc., which is developing products related to this research.
