In addition to Georgia Tech and GRA, the University of California San Diego, Duke University, Iowa State University, North Carolina State University, The Ohio State University, and University of Washington are the lead universities included in the 11 AI Institutes.\nThe AI Institutes at Georgia Tech\nThe three newly established Institutes will address societal challenges, including home care for aging adults; energy, logistics, and supply chains; sustainability; the widening gap in job opportunities; and changing needs in workforce development.\nNSF AI Institute for Collaborative Assistance and Responsive Interaction for Networked Groups (AI-CARING)\nwill seek to create a vibrant discipline focused on personalized, collaborative AI systems that will improve quality of care for the aging. The systems will learn individual models of human behavior and how they change over time and use that knowledge to better collaborate and communicate in caregiving environments. Led by Sonia Chernova, associate professor of interactive computing at Georgia Tech, the AI systems will help a growing population of older adults sustain independence, improve quality of life, and increase effectiveness of care coordination across the care network.\n\u201cThe AI-CARING Institute builds on our existing strengths in AI and in technology for aging. It will create not only novel solutions, but a new generation of researchers focused on the interaction between the two,\u201d said Charles Isbell, dean and John P. Imlay Jr. Chair in the College of Computing. \u201cOur aim is to build cutting-edge technologies that improve the lives of everyone, and I can\u2019t think of a better example than AI-CARING.\u201d\nNSF AI Institute for Advances in Optimization (AI4Opt)\nwill revolutionize decision-making on a large scale \u2013 fusing AI and mathematical optimization into intelligent systems that will achieve breakthroughs that neither field can achieve independently. Additionally, it will create pathways from high school to undergraduate and graduate education and workforce development training for AI in engineering that will empower a generation of underrepresented students and teachers to join the AI revolution. Led by Pascal Van Hentenryck, A. Russell Chandler III chair and professor in the H. Milton Stewart School of Industrial and Systems Engineering at Georgia Tech, AI4Opt will tackle use cases in energy, resilience and sustainability, supply chains, and circuit design and control.\n\u201cAI4Opt, with its focus on AI and optimization, will create new pathways for novel tools that allow better engineering applications to benefit society,\u201d said Raheem Beyah, dean of Georgia Tech\u2019s College of Engineering and Southern Company Chair. \u201cThis will allow engineers to build\u00a0higher quality\u00a0materials, more efficient renewable resources, new computing systems, and more, while also reinforcing the field as a career path for diverse students.\u00a0The new institute complements the College\u2019s commitment to the integration of AI in engineering disciplines.\u201d\nNSF AI Institute for Adult Learning and Online Education (ALOE)\nwill lead the country and the world in the development of novel AI theories and techniques for enhancing the quality of adult online education, making this mode of learning comparable to that of in-person education in STEM disciplines. Together with partners in the technical college systems and educational technology sector, ALOE will advance online learning using virtual assistants to make education more available, affordable, achievable, and ultimately more equitable. This Institute is led by the GRA, with support from Georgia Tech and the University System of Georgia (USG).
