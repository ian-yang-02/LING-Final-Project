Maybe You Should\nIt turns out, you may be giving away more than you think when you agree to Terms of Service.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nEmail\nApr 18, 2014\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nIf you're like a majority of web users, it's easy to skim or skip the Terms of Service (ToS) agreement. How do we know what we're reading, much less agreeing to? In an attempt to understand the personal effects of Terms of Service (ToS), Amy Bruckman and Ph.D. candidate, Casey Fiesler, from the College of Computing, surveyed ToS on popular websites like Facebook, LinkedIn and others. It turns out, you may be giving away more than you think.\u00a0 This infographic, created by the\nGVU Center at Georgia Tech , will help you understand the full reserach (found\nhere ) on what you're giving away to online services.
