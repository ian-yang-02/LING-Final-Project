The only problem: they\u2019re largely visual and not accessible for those who are blind or visually impaired.\nA research team led by\u00a0 Brian Magerko , professor of Digital Media at Georgia Tech, is working to solve this problem by adapting\u00a0 EarSketch , a platform designed to teach students to code in Python or JavaScript through music and creative discovery, for blind and visually impaired youth. Since launching in 2011, the free EarSketch platform has been used by more than a million students from all 50 U.S. states and in more than 100 countries.\nThe effort will be supported by an almost $3 million grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF).\n\u201cEarSketch is about using music as a mechanism for giving an expressive, interesting, and personally meaningful medium for kids to learn about programming,\u201d says Magerko. \u201cWith this grant, we\u2019re looking at the role of sonification, taking data and making it audible, as a way to improve accessibility not only for the blind and visually impaired but also as a more natural way for people to engage with these interfaces.\u201d\nMagerko, a professor in the School of Literature, Media, and Communication in the Ivan Allen College of Liberal Arts, will work with\u00a0 Jason Freeman , professor and chair of Georgia Tech\u2019s\u00a0 School of Music \u00a0in the\u00a0 College of Design ;\u00a0 Stephen Garrett , research scientist in the School of Music;\u00a0 Stephanie Ludi , professor of computer science at the University of North Texas;\u00a0 Bryan Pardo , professor of computer science at Northwestern University; and the California School for the Blind.\nThe group will also be working with blind and visually impaired musicians and producers to get their input on successful and unsuccessful musical interfaces.\n\"Over the years, we've received many requests from teachers to make our EarSketch platform more accessible to students who are blind or visually impaired. We're thrilled to embark on this project that will help the platform to better serve these students\u2014and indeed all students, engaging them in the unique combination of music and coding,\" says Freeman, co-creator of EarSketch.\nWhile a large part of the effort will be exploring what elements are needed to make EarSketch a successful learning tool for the blind and visually impaired, there are a few initial ideas including optimizing the system for screen reader compatibility and integrating collaborative AI (like ChatGPT) to discuss and help with building code, like an Alexa for coding, Magerko says.\n\u201cHopefully some of this work will influence how we design for everyone. There\u2019s an idea that by designing toward the margins you can capture everyone in between. That\u2019s really what we\u2019re trying to do,\u201d Magerko says.\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\n/node/661098\nContact\nMegan McRainey\nmegan.mcrainey@gatech.edu\nEmail\nmegan.mcrainey@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
