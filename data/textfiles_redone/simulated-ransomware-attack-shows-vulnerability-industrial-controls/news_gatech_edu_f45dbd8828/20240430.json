After gaining access, the researchers\u00a0were able to command programmable logic controllers (PLCs) to shut valves, increase the amount of chlorine added to water, and display false readings.\nThe simulated attack was designed to highlight vulnerabilities in the control systems used to operate industrial facilities such as manufacturing plants, water and wastewater treatment facilities, and building management systems for controlling escalators, elevators and HVAC systems. Believed to be the first to demonstrate ransomware compromise of real PLCs, the research is scheduled to be presented February 13 at the RSA Conference in San Francisco.\nThough no real ransomware attacks have been publicly reported on the process control components of industrial control systems, the attacks have become a significant problem for patient data in hospitals and customer data in businesses. Attackers gain access to these systems and encrypt the data, demanding a ransom to provide the encryption key that allows the data to be used again.\nRansomware generated an estimated $200 million for attackers during the first quarter of 2016, and the researchers believe it\u2019s only a matter of time before critical industrial systems are compromised and held for ransom.\n\u201cWe are expecting ransomware to go one step farther, beyond the customer data to compromise the control systems themselves,\u201d said David Formby, a Ph.D. student in the Georgia Tech School of Electrical and Computer Engineering. \u201cThat could allow attackers to hold hostage critical systems such as water treatment plants and manufacturing facilities. Compromising the programmable logic controllers (PLCs) in these systems is a next logical step for these attackers.\u201d\nMany industrial control systems lack strong security protocols, said\nRaheem Beyah , the Motorola Foundation Professor and associate chair in the\nSchool of Electrical and Computer Engineering\nand Formby\u2019s faculty advisor. That\u2019s likely because these systems haven\u2019t been targeted by ransomware so far, and because their vulnerabilities may not be well understood by their operators.\nFormby and Beyah used a specialized search program to locate 1,400 PLCs of a single type that were directly accessible across the internet. But most such devices are located behind business systems that provide some level of protection \u2013 until they are compromised. Once attackers get into a business system, they could pivot to enter control systems if they are not properly walled off.\n\u201cMany control systems assume that once you have access to the network, that you are authorized to make changes to the control systems,\u201d Formby said. \u201cThey may have very weak password policies and security policies that could let intruders take control of pumps, valves and other key components of the industrial control system.\u201d\nIn the past, control systems weren\u2019t designed for connection to the internet, and many users of the systems assume they aren\u2019t on the public network and therefore not susceptible to attack. Control systems may also have connections that are unknown to operators, including access points installed to allow maintenance, troubleshooting and updates.\n\u201cThere are common misconceptions about what is connected to the internet,\u201d said Formby. \u201cOperators may believe their systems are air-gapped and that there\u2019s no way to access the controllers, but these systems are often connected in some way.\u201d\nTo launch the research, the researchers identified several common PLCs in use at industrial facilities. They obtained three different devices and tested their security setup, including password protection and susceptibility to settings changes. The devices were then combined with pumps, tubes and tanks to create a simulated water treatment facility. In the place of chlorine normally used to disinfect water, the researchers used iodine. They also added starch to their water supply, which turned bright blue when a simulated attack added iodine to it.\n\u201cWe were able to simulate a hacker who had gained access to this part of the system and is holding it hostage by threatening to dump large amounts of chlorine into the water unless the operator pays a ransom,\u201d Formby said. \u201cIn the right amount, chlorine disinfects the water and makes it safe to drink. But too much chlorine can create a bad reaction that would make the water unsafe.\u201d\nVulnerabilities in control systems have been known for more than a decade, but until the growth of ransomware, attackers had not been able to benefit financially from compromising the systems. As other ransomware targets become more difficult, Beyah believes attackers may turn to easier targets in the industrial control systems.\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite likely that nation-state operators are already familiar with this and have attacks that they could use for political purposes, but ordinary attackers have had no interest in these systems,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we hope to do is bring attention to this issue. If we can successfully attack these control systems, others with a bad intention can also do it.\u201d\nIn addition to improving password security and limiting connections, Beyah says operators of these devices need to install intrusion monitoring systems to alert them if attackers are in the process control networks. Beyah and Formby have launched a company to make their strategies for protecting systems broadly available to control system operators.\nResearch News\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\n177 North Avenue\nAtlanta, Georgia \u00a0 30332-0181 \u00a0USA\nMedia Relations Contacts : John Toon (404-894-6986) (jtoon@gatech.edu) or Ben Brumfield (404-385-1933) (ben.brumfield@comm.gatech.edu).\nWriter : John Toon\nAdditional Images\nContact\nJohn Toon\nResearch News\n(404) 894-6986\nEmail\njtoon@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
