Learn more about the campaign here: http://gamep.org/faces-of-manufacturing/\nSep 28, 2015\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nAcross Georgia, nearly 360,000 people \u2014 through hard work, dedication, and a passion for what they do \u2014 form the backbone of a very important segment of the state\u2019s economy: manufacturing. These unsung everyday heroes account for about 9 percent of Georgia\u2019s total workforce, and as a sector, manufacturing contributes $52 billion to the state\u2019s economy each year.\u00a0 That represents 11.5 percent of Georgia\u2019s total gross domestic product. But beyond the facts and figures and the collection of plants, mills, and factories that are found across the state, the true story of manufacturing lies within the people who make the industry a critical component of the state. As part of a continuing initiative to honor and highlight those who found their careers in the sector, the Georgia Manufacturing Extension Partnership at Georgia Tech (GaMEP) is accepting nominations for the 2016\nFaces of Manufacturing . This continuing campaign is designed to showcase Georgia manufacturing and highlight the important role those who work in the industry play in the state. The Faces campaign also highlights the diversity of careers that can be found in the industry from robotics to process engineering to product design that are challenging and rewarding. GaMEP will highlight a different nominee each month in 2016 as that month\u2019s Face of Manufacturing.\u00a0 To be eligible, nominees must be employed in manufacturing or have ties to the industry. The nominations will be accepted through Friday, October 30, 2015. Nominations will be taken through an\nonline form . Those chosen as the Face of Manufacturing will be selected by a 12-member committee comprised of representatives from Georgia Tech, economic development groups, manufacturing companies, and related associations. \u201cThis past year, as we have travelled across the state and met with all of the Faces of Manufacturing, we learned so much from these men and women about how important manufacturing has been in their lives,\u201d said GaMEP Director Karen J. Fite. \u201cFrom LaFayette to Macon to Albany to Atlanta, so many of our Faces shared their inspirational stories of how manufacturing has not only changed their lives \u2014 some profoundly \u2014 but it also helped to keep their communities strong, and Georgia thriving.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nFaces of Manufacturing\nContact\nLaura Diamond\u00a0 Georgia Tech Media Relations 404-894-6016 \u00a0 Questions about the Faces of Manufacturing program?
