Bill McArthur, and Col. Tim Kopra came back to their alma mater to talk about their experiences with NASA and give advice to the future leaders of the space industry currently working on degrees at Georgia Tech.\nNov 12, 2018\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nThere have only been a few hundred people on the planet who have had the opportunity to launch into orbit.\nThat\u2019s what made the opportunity for Tech students to meet three astronauts \u2014 all three Georgia Tech graduates\u00a0 \u2014 incredibly special.\nAhead of Georgia Tech\u2019s Saturday matchup against Miami, three Yellow Jacket space veterans \u2014 Sandy Magnus, Col. Bill McArthur, and Col. Tim Kopra \u2014 took questions from students and shared the experiences that led them on their individual journeys.\nSandy Magnus (Ph.D., Materials Science and Engineering) was asked when she knew she wanted to be an astronaut.\n\u201cI loved physics in high school, but I discovered engineering in college. I didn\u2019t know it existed before then,\u201d Magnus said.\u00a0 \u201cI was like \u2018Wow! This is cool! You can take the physics and do something with it.\u2019\u201d\nMagnus says she followed her interests and where they led her.\n\u201cIf you have a goal \u2014\u00a0whether that\u2019s to be an astronaut or not \u2014 you need to go for it. You\u2019ll never know unless you try. I didn\u2019t want to be 50-years-old and look back at my life and wonder if I could have been an astronaut if I tried.\u201d\nMagnus flew two space missions, including the final mission of the Space Shuttle program.\nCol. Bill McArthur earned his master\u2019s degree in aerospace engineering from Georgia Tech before launching on four space missions with NASA. When asked about what areas of education students should focus on if they want to be astronauts themselves, McArthur had a bit of a surprise answer.\n\u201cEngineers hate this: grammar. You\u2019ve got to communicate,\u201d McArthur explained. \"If you're going to orbit the earth a little geography is good too.\"\nNext, an elementary school student asked the panel how flying in a space shuttle compared to flying in a plane.\nCol. Tim Kopra (M.S. Aerospace Engineering), a past commander of the International Space Station said the space shuttle is a lot rougher than a plane, likening it to a really long amusement park ride.\n\u201cAfter landing, you hit so hard that you spend about 10 seconds doing an inventory to make sure nothing is broken,\u201d Kopra said.\u00a0 \u201cThat\u2019s the longer answer to your question. Space flight is pretty darn cool.\u201d\nUnder Secretary of Defense for Research & Engineering Mike Griffin also joined the Georgia Tech astronauts on the panel.\nGeorgia Tech has produced 14 astronauts \u2014 tied for second among public universities. These astronauts include John Young (B.S. Aerospace Engineering\u00a01952), who walked on the moon and was on the first space shuttle. Col. Kopra was not the only Georgia Tech graduate to command the Space Station; Shane Kimbrough (M.S. Operations Research) followed in the same year. When Kimbrough flew on Endeavour in 2008, he was joined by Magnus and Eric Boe (M.S. Electrical Engineering 1997).\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nMeet Georgia Tech's last astronaut to travel to space: Shane Kimbrough\nEmail\nsnorris@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
