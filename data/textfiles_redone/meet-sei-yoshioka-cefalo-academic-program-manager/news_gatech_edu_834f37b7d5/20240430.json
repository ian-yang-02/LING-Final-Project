In November 2019 he became the academic program manager for the School of City and Regional Planning in the College of Design, where he oversees finance and budgeting, human resources, and general operations.\n\u201cI made a huge career change,\u201d said Yoshioka-Cefalo, who has a master\u2019s degree in counseling psychology from New York University and worked for City University of New York, Pepperdine University, and Emory University. He said he feared he wasn\u2019t going to be an expert anymore, and he was scared about trying something new.\n\u201cWhen I spoke with people who know me well, they all said that maybe it was time to step out of my comfort zone,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I took a leap of faith and accepted my current position. Each day has been exciting because I\u2019m learning a new set of skills and new systems.\u201d\nYoshioka-Cefalo said he is gaining a better understanding of the business of higher education and that will help him become a better administrator. He also values the encouragement he has received from his colleagues in the School of City and Regional Planning and across campus. It has helped him grow more comfortable in his new role.\n\u201cThe level of support that I\u2019ve gotten from the people I work with has been absolutely amazing. I appreciate their patience and their willingness to help,\u201d he said. \u201cEven if I make a mistake they provide me with the resources to make sure I don\u2019t make the same mistake again. That kind of accountability is something that I really appreciate.\u201d\nDrawing on his experience as a counselor, Yoshioka-Cefalo began facilitating virtual check-in meetings with graduate students last fall.\n\u201cThe meetings are casual and they give me an opportunity to see how our students are doing,\u201d he said. \u201cGraduate programs are hard. So this is an open forum for them to tell us what they need to succeed. It\u2019s important for them to know they have resources for support. If it\u2019s something that I can take care of at the School, I will. And If they need to be referred out for counseling, I call the Center for Assessment, Referral, and Education (CARE).\u201d\nAway From the Office\nYoshioka-Cefalo\u2019s interests include aromatherapy, candle making, and commercial aviation.\n\u201cI know that some people say aromatherapy is not science. But I believe that certain scents have an effect; lavender is calming, sweet orange is uplifting, and peppermint perks you up,\u201d said Yoshioka-Cefalo, who has been into aromatherapy for more than 20 years.\n\u201cOne day I just went into a shop and bought a few books and a few bottles of essential oils,\u201d he said, explaining how it began. Working with essential oils led to candle making.\n\u201cThe first time I made candles they were lopsided and ugly and the wicks were not placed properly. They weren\u2019t functional at all,\u201d he said, laughing. Then he watched YouTube videos and improved his technique.\n\u201cNow my candles are very nice,\u201d he said. He doesn\u2019t sell the candles, but he sometimes gives them to family, friends, and co-workers.\nHis fascination with commercial aviation began when he was a child and has never waned.\nAs he put it, \u201cMost people just want to get in and out of an airport, but I could literally sit at an airport and watch planes take off and land all day long.\u201d He has a collection of almost 200 diecast airplane models displayed at home in an airport layout.\n\u201cI have a small airport here in my office as well, but my airport at home is expansive,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has upper, mezzanine, and lower levels; terminals 1, 2, and 3; satellite terminals A, B, and C, and the Bucchi and Slinky Memorial Concourse \u2014 named for my two cats that I had for 17 years,\u201d he said.\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nMore Staff Stories\nContact\nVictor Rogers\nInstitute Communications\nEmail\nvictor.rogers@comm.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
