Last year, with the help of the campus community, GTPD packaged and distributed more than 150 care packages to individuals experiencing homelessness in and around the Tech community.\n\u201cFor the last six years we have surpassed our goal for the number of packages to create, so this year we will not set a goal. Our only mission is to fulfill our purpose of generously sharing with those in need,\u201d\u00a0said Lt. Jessica Howard, GTPD. \u201cAs we approach the holiday season, please remember those who find themselves in less fortunate circumstances than ourselves.\u201d GTPD will fill gallon-size bags with travel size toiletries, snacks, and food items.\nCollection bins are in the police department\u2019s lobby and patrol suite at 965 Hemphill Ave. NW, Atlanta, Georgia. If you would like a collection bin to place in your department, please email\noutreach@police.gatech.edu . Items will be collected until Friday, Dec. 15.\nItems needed include:\nToiletries/miscellaneous: hand sanitizer, lotion, wipes, deodorant, lip balm, hand warmers, gloves, beanie caps, socks, and feminine hygiene products.\nSnack/food items: tuna packets, noodles, granola bars, mints, fruit cups, Vienna sausages, jerky, and crackers.\nOther Ways to Give Back\nBecome an Angel of the Month in support of Klemis Kitchen.\nStudent Engagement and Well-Being is working with\nSTAR (Students\u2019 Temporary Assistance and Resources) to support one of its student programs,\nKlemis Kitchen , Georgia Tech\u2019s on-campus food bank.
