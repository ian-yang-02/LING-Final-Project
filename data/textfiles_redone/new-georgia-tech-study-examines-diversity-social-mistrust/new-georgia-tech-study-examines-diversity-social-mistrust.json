A new study led by a Georgia Institute of Technology economist has found new data-based evidence for that theory that also may help explain why it happens.\nInstead of relying on behavioral survey data, as key prior studies have,\nAssociate Professor Willie Belton\nand his coauthors looked at 15 years of county-level U.S. Census data with details on black, Latino, white, and Asian population, along with another data set tracking membership in social, religious, and political groups \u2014 measures researchers have argued are good proxies for social trust.\nThe study found that social capital increased in counties where one ethnicity dominates, but declined in communities with higher rates of diversity.\nLooking for Evidence of a Cause\nBelton and his coauthors scoured the data for evidence pointing to one of the three theories proposed to explain the link between social capital and diversity: the contact, hunker-down, and conflict theories.\nThe contact thesis suggests that rising diversity boosts social capital as people of different ethnicities become more tolerant of one another. The \u201chunker down\u201d theory suggests that \u00a0social capital declines because people retreat into their shells when faced with rising diversity\u2014rejecting newcomers but also pulling back on engagement with people of their own ethnic group in an effort to shelter themselves. The conflict model explains falling social capital as backlash against newcomers in a perceived fight over limited resources.\nBelton\u2019s study found sufficient evidence in the data to reject the contact hypothesis, but the results were less clear when it came to the remaining two propositions.\nTheir study found no evidence that increased immigration in the most ethnically similar counties caused reductions in social capital\u2014a finding the researchers said was inconsistent with what the hunker-down theory would predict. But they said they could not conclusively determine whether the hunker-down theory or the conflict theory was correct.\n\u201cWe reject the contact hypothesis, but find evidence consistent with the outcomes predicted in both the conflict hypothesis and (the) hunker-down hypothesis, in inter-ethnic relations,\u201d they wrote in the paper. \u201cDue to data limitations, we are unable to test directly which of these two thesis are more relevant for the U.S experience. However, we provide suggestive evidence in support of the conflict hypothesis over the hunker-down hypothesis.\u201d\nOther Influences Likely Outweigh Impact on Social Capital\nDespite reinforcing the negative link between diversity and social capital, Belton and his coauthors cautioned that their study does not capture the potential benefits of immigration and should not be seen as discrediting the widely held viewpoint that diversity provides an array of benefits that favor economic innovation and society. They say these benefits could outweigh the negative influences on social capital accumulation.\n\u201cThough diversity may lead to a decrease in social capital as captured by our measures, our results do not provide evidence of the impact of diversity on other welfare outcomes or alternative measures of social capital,\u201d wrote Belton and his coauthors, former\nSchool of Economics\nstudent Yameen Huq, and Ruth Uwaifo Oyelere of Agnes Scott College.\nThe paper,\n\u201cDiversity and Social Capital in the U.S.: \u00a0A Tale of Conflict, Contact, or Total Mistrust,\"\nappears in the June 2019 edition of the\nReview of Economics and Institutions .\nBelton is an associate professor.
