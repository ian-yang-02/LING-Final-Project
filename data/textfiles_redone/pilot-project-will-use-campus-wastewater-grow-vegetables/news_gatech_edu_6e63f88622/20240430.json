Water and land for growing crops are hard to come by in urban areas. Finding more sustainable methods for growing produce in urban areas would have enormous benefits. A pilot project by Georgia Tech\u2019s\nYongsheng Chen,\na professor in the\nSchool of Civil and Environmental Engineering , aims to use wastewater from the campus to do just that.\n\u201cThe overarching goal is trying to figure out a way to use wastewater nutrients to grow produce in urban areas so we can decentralize vegetable production,\u201d Chen said. A grant provides $5 million over five years from the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) to create and operate a hydroponic growing system using domestic wastewater extracted from the Georgia Tech campus sewer system. It is the largest USDA award Georgia Tech has received.\n\u201cCurrently we treat wastewater by taking all the nutrients from it,\u201d said Chen. \u201cThen we have to use an energy-intensive process to synthesize and add fertilizer to the food production process.\u201d\nThe proposed anaerobic membrane biological treatment process will transfer organic contaminants into biogas and remove pathogens such as E. coli to ensure food safety, but the nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium, for example) will remain. By using a smart membrane or nanomaterials to extract trace contaminants like endocrine disruptors, heavy metals and pharmaceuticals, the nutrients that are left can be pumped through a vertical hydroponic system to grow produce without adding fertilizer. The project will monitor water and produce quality and measure contamination from chemicals and microbes continuously.\nThe overall goal, said Chen, is to show that using the nutrients and water resources from domestic wastewater (DWW) in an urban controlled environment agriculture system (CEAs) is socially, environmentally and financially sustainable and can easily be replicated in other cities. The project will closely track nutrient requirements, energy needed to produce, handle and transport the fruits and vegetables, and water needs to determine what resources are needed to support this kind of CEA system (DWW-CEAs).\nEcological network analysis for DWW-CEA coupling will track material and energy flows across components that produce, consume and recycle food. Using a geodesign approach, Chen\u2019s team will then compare data from traditional agriculture and DWW-CEAs to see how the system performs and how it could be designed to perform better in terms of water, energy and nutrient needs.\n\u201cOur model will have options to calculate energy consumption for the system, water consumption, water balance and nutrient balance,\u201d said Chen. \u201cWe\u2019ll conduct a life-cycle analysis and techno-economic analysis to evaluate whether this type of system will be commercially feasible or profitable in different locations, not just Atlanta.\u201d\nChen will use machine learning in the controlled growing environment to seek a \u201crecipe\u201d for each plant type: the ideal amount of nutrients, growing temperature and humidity needed for lettuce, for example, so that each head of greens will taste the same. The project also provides an opportunity to test a number of other technologies, such as using solar power for cooling or biogas extracted from the wastewater and discarded food to power a micro chiller.\nOf course, showing that such a DWW-CEA system is feasible and profitable is one hurdle \u2013 another is getting consumers on board with the way the produce is produced. \u201cIf we are going to decentralize this system, what are the implications for policy related issues?\u201d Chen asked. \u201cWill people buy products produced by wastewater?\u201d The project will involve working with a number of collaborators at Georgia Tech and in Atlanta, including Kaye Husbands Fealing, professor and chair of the School of Public Policy at Georgia Tech, and the Mayor\u2019s Office of Sustainability.\n\u201cWe want to change the current wastewater treatment practice, step back a little bit and think outside the box,\u201d Chen said. \u201cThis could have a big impact locally, regionally or even nationally and internationally.\u201d\nThis research is supported by the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s (USDA) National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA), Agriculture and Food Research Initiative (AFRI) Water for Food Production Systems (Grant 2018-68011-28371).\nResearch News\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\n177 North Avenue\nAtlanta, Georgia \u00a030332-0181 \u00a0USA\nMedia Relations Contact: \u00a0John Toon\u00a0(404-894-6986) (john.toon@comm.gatech.edu).\nWriter : Kenna Simmons\nAdditional Images\nContact\nJohn Toon\nResearch News\n404-894-6986\nEmail\njohn.toon@comm.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
