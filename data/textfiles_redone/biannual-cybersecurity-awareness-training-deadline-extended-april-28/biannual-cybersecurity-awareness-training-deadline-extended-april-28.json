(Affiliates and employees on a leave of absence by April 3 are not required to complete the spring training.)\nRegularly occurring cybersecurity awareness training ensures that the Tech community remains vigilant, prepared, and empowered to identify cyber threats when they encounter them. Training also encourages employees to adopt practices that safeguard their information and technology from ransomware attacks and other compromises.\n\u201cHeightened awareness and shared responsibility around cybersecurity is paramount,\u201d said Leo Howell, chief information security officer at Georgia Tech. \u201cWe all must do our part to keep our campus safe from cyber threats. For the spring training, we will focus specifically on social engineering red flags, such as how to spot unsafe web and email addresses within a sender\u2019s email message to prevent phishing.\u201d\nAccessing the Training\nEmployees who are required to take the 2023 Spring Biannual Cybersecurity Awareness Training will receive an email on April 3, with further instructions on how to access the training. Only employees who receive this email are required to take the training.\nDue to campuswide technical issues, the deadline has been extended to Friday, April 28, to allow employees additional time to complete the training.\nEmployees can learn more about the training by visiting\n2023 Spring Cybersecurity Awareness Training FAQs\nand report issues related to the training course via the\nCompliance Training Request Help Page.\nContact\noit@gatech.edu\nAdditional information\nWhat Is Phishing?\nPhishing is the process of attempting to acquire sensitive information, such as usernames, passwords, and credit card details, by masquerading as a trustworthy entity via email. The Office of Information Technology Cyber Security department routinely phish tests the campus community by sending realistic but fake phishing emails to gauge user response and measure the effectiveness of campus cybersecurity training.\nIf you receive an email that you believe to be phishing, do not open it. Immediately forward the email to\nphishing@gatech.edu , then delete it.\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
