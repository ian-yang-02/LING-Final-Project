The Partnership already has 15 project sites across nine economic development regions and deployed more than 140 technologies. Public engagement and knowledge transfer remain\u00a0core components\u00a0of the Partnership\u2019s offerings, with nearly 700 attendees in events and active digital communications, including monthly newsletters.\nThe areas of focus and the Partnership\u2019s impact over the past year are reflected in three flagship programs.\nInnovate for All:\u00a0 To scale economic opportunity, Innovate for All funds and supports\u00a0proven programs, services, and technologies created by Georgia's innovators. In the past year, it funded\u00a0 the Georgia Mesh Network \u00a0and the\u00a0 Working Farm Fund .\nThe Georgia Mesh Network: \u00a0Augusta\u2019s\u00a0theClubhou.se\u00a0is piloting the statewide network with Atlanta, Columbus, Macon, and Savannah to offer skills training and certification to historically disadvantaged and underserved entrepreneurs. It is backed with the commitment of 21 capital partners to support entrepreneurs who graduate from the program.\nThe Working Farms Fund:\u00a0 Through the Conservation Fund, this effort is committed to the preservation of local farms that are increasingly falling victim to the pressures of rising costs, low margins, and corporate consolidation, which stresses the food supply chain. The fund, which is at the forefront of advocating for a healthier and more resilient food supply chain, secured $1 million in additional funding, acquired two farms: a certified organic produce farm in Mansfield, and a 21.2-acre farm composed of 15 immigrant and refugee smallholder farms in Conyers.\nSmart Community Corps:\u00a0 This summer program, supported by Microsoft, pairs students \u2014 from any Georgia college or university, any year and major \u2014 together\u00a0to work on Partnership projects.\u00a0Though experiential learning and public service, students can effectively advance technology and practice innovation by living and working with the communities.\u00a0The 2021 cohort of students from Georgia Tech, Morehouse College, Savannah College of Art and Design, and Valdosta State, logged 5,280 hours on their projects, which ranged from addressing blight in Savannah to traffic monitoring in Valdosta, to smart pedestrian planning in Clayton County.\nGeorgia Smart Community Challenge (GA Smart):\u00a0 Now in its fourth year, with 16 community projects, the program allows localities across the state to apply for research assistance that empowers them to envision, explore, and plan for a smart future. The 2021 cohort includes the cities of Woodbury and Concord, and Pike and Spalding counties. This cohort will work with Georgia Tech researchers to expand and enhance connectivity and explore additional applications that will improve their services, efficiencies, and cost savings.\nThe Partnership is expected to support $2.88 million of programming this coming year across the state. It maintains its lean operations model through key partners at Jabian Consulting, Brand Culture, Jackson Spalding, and Kilpatrick Townsend. \u201cWhile the Partnership has advanced much in its first year, we look forward to ongoing progress and growth utilizing innovation and technology to service Georgia today and tomorrow,\u201d Lam said.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nP\u00e9ralte C.
