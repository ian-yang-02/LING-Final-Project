As such, a process is underway to leverage this knowledge and develop a comprehensive, cross-cutting Climate Action Plan.\nThe Climate Action Plan, a key deliverable of the\nSustainability Next Plan , will support the Georgia Tech strategic plan efforts to\nlead by example\nin solving some of the most pressing issues of our time. Once developed, this plan will lay the pathway forward for the Institute to achieve its climate goals, including reaching carbon neutrality by 2050.\nAbout the Process\nThe planning process launched last year and will extend through 2023. Led by Infrastructure and Sustainability, the process will include developing a greenhouse gas inventory, modeling potential mitigation strategies, and engaging with faculty, students, and staff from across campus. The engagement process will include an advisory task force and individual working groups that focus on specific climate solutions. Once complete, the plan will align with Georgia Tech\u2019s broader commitments to address climate change and provide an actionable roadmap to achieving carbon neutrality and climate justice.\nGet Involved\nThe Georgia Tech campus community is invited to take part in helping to develop the Climate Action Plan.
