Georgia Tech\u2019s economic impact on the state of Georgia was $4.01 billion. That figure is up more than $1 billion from Georgia Tech\u2019s 2015 fiscal year economic impact of $2.87 billion.\nTogether, USG\u2019s institutions played a critical role in bolstering the state\u2019s economy during the Covid-19 pandemic, and economic impact actually grew 0.6 percent from 2019.\nCalculated by the Selig Center for Economic Growth at the University of Georgia\u2019s Terry College of Business, the annual report provides impact breakdowns for all USG colleges and universities. At more than $4 billion, Georgia Tech\u2019s impact tops the list of all USG schools - more than a billion dollars more in economic impact than any other school in the system.\nThis \u201coutput impact\u201d figure collected in the study was calculated by adding the initial spending to re-spending, or multiplier effect, for each institution in its community. According to the report, this \u201ctotal output impact\u201d figure is the largest, most inclusive measure of economic impact.\nThe report also calculated value-added economic impact, which signifies the specific benefits reaped by the businesses and households in an immediate region. USG\u2019s 26 institutions collectively generated $12.7 billion in value added to local communities in 2020. For Georgia Tech, the value added to the Atlanta metro area was $2.78 billion.\nIn addition, the report also found that the USG system, directly and indirectly, generated 155,010 jobs in the state of Georgia. The 2020 graduates of USG schools who have stayed to work in Georgia are forecast to earn $175 billion in lifetime earnings; $59 billion of that figure can be attributed to their degrees.
