The TikTok provision is part of foreign aid legislation signed by President Joe Biden on Wednesday, a day after it easily cleared the U.S. Senate following bipartisan approval in the House. It requires that TikTok\u2019s Chinese owner, ByteDance, sell the service or face a U.S. ban. Advocates of such a ban say TikTok is a national security threat: a backdoor for the Chinese government to sow disinformation and maliciously leverage the private data of U.S. users.\u00a0 However,\nMueller , whose research has been widely cited in the TikTok debate, has found no credible national security threat in TikTok \u2014 certainly nothing, he said, that isn\u2019t also an issue with any other social media service. \u201cThere are foreign influence campaigns going on right now on Facebook, X, and other platforms. There\u2019s nothing unique about TikTok in that regard,\u201d Mueller said. And while critics would argue that Chinese-owned TikTok is different than Facebook or X \u2014 both largely American companies \u2014 Mueller says that no matter who owns a social media platform, there\u2019s little national security value in the data of everyday Americans who post dances, silly animal videos, or even political commentary. Risk is inherent in any social media platform and focused on users closely connected to national security functions \u2014 risks the sale or closure of one social media platform won\u2019t solve, he said. Mueller\u2019s analysis of TikTok and the arguments swirling around it are published in a March 2023\nreport . He said he doubts that a sale of TikTok is likely, at least in its current form. China\u2019s government has said it sees the artificial intelligence that powers TikTok\u2019s algorithm as Chinese intellectual property that can\u2019t be transferred to the U.S. So, whatever might be sold would be, essentially, a different service. Mueller echoed many legal experts who have argued that a ban would trigger an immediate court challenge on free speech grounds. However, if such legal challenges were to fail, it would be a blow to the free flow of ideas around the world, Mueller argues. \u201cIf the ban goes through and is upheld by the courts, this would be a disaster for the freedom of information and the ethos of the internet, that we can all be connected,\u201d Mueller said.\nContact\nMichael Pearson Ivan Allen College of Liberal Arts\nEmail\nmichael.pearson@iac.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
