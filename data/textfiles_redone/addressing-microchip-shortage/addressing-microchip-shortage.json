He also \u00a0serves as director of the 3D Systems Packaging Research Center.\nAs an author of more than 450\u00a0technical publications who holds 29 patents, Swaminathan is one of the world\u2019s leading experts on semiconductors and the semiconductor chips necessary for many of the devices we use every day to function.\n\u201cAlmost any consumer device that is electronic tends to have at least one semiconductor chip in it,\u201d Swaminathan explains. \u201cThe more complicated the functions any device performs, the more chips it is likely to have.\u201d\nSome of these semiconductor chips process information, some store data, and others provide sensing or communication functions.\nIn short, they are crucial in devices from video games and smart thermostats to cars and computers.\nOur current shortage of these chips began with the Covid-19 pandemic. When consumers started staying at home and car purchases took a downward turn, chip manufacturers tried to shift to make more chips for other goods like smartphones and computers.\nBut Swaminathan explains that making that kind of switch is not simple. Entire production operations have to be changed. The chips are highly sensitive and can be damaged by static electricity, temperature variations, and even tiny specks of dust. The manufacturing environments must be highly regulated, and changes in the process can add months.\nThe pandemic highlighted another challenge with the\u00a0semiconductor chip industry, according to Swaminathan.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a major shortage of companies making chips,\u201d he says.\u00a0\u201cIf\u00a0you look worldwide, there are maybe four or five manufacturers making 80-90% of these chips and they are located outside of the United States.\u201d\nThis creates supply chain hiccups with the raw supplies needed to make these chips as well. Add in the fact that many of these companies only design their chips \u2013\u00a0they don\u2019t manufacture them directly.\n\u201cAmerican consumers use 50% of the world\u2019s chips,\u201d Swaminathan says, which creates a serious challenge when the overwhelming majority of those chips are manufactured in other nations.\nIn the short term, the costs of the chip shortage is being passed on to the consumer. We see this directly with products like PlayStations and Xboxes that are more and more expensive and harder to purchase when the chips necessary for the consoles to function are in short supply.\nBeyond 2022, Swaminathan says we need to work to revitalize the\u00a0industry domestically.\n\u201cWe need to bring more manufacturing back to the United States,\u201d he says. \u201cThe U.S. government has recognized the importance of this semiconductor chip shortage and is trying to address the issue directly.\u201d\nThat means investing in new plants to manufacture the\u00a0chips, but America's\u00a0journey toward\u00a0 chip self-sufficiency will continue to be a work in progress.\n\u201cThis is a cycle,\u201d Swaminathan explains. \u201cBut this is probably the first time where it has had such a major effect in so many different industries.\u201d\nBut consumers can take direct action on their own in the coming year.\u00a0\u201cReduce the number of times you purchase or upgrade electronic devices like phones and cars,\u201d he says. \u201cThen it becomes just a supply problem, not a demand and supply problem.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
