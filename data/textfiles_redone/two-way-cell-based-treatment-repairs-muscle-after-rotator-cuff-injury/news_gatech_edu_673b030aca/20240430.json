Major League Baseball All-Star pitchers Clayton Kershaw and Justin Verlander, for example, both had rotator cuff surgeries and made successful comebacks.\nFor those of us who can\u2019t throw baseballs 95 miles an hour, the rotator cuff may tear over time from repeated overhead motions (painters and carpenters, for instance). Or an injury can occur as we age and our body\u2019s tissues naturally degenerate. And although rotator cuff injuries are common, they can be serious, leading to muscle degeneration after surgery.\nNow, two professors from the\nWallace H. Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering , a joint department of Georgia Tech and Emory University, have addressed the problem with a novel cell-based dual treatment, which they describe in a study published recently in the journal\nTissue Engineering .\n\u201cWe\u2019re thinking mainly of an aging population with this study \u2014 the people most likely to have these injuries,\u201d said\nJohnna Temenoff , whose research group collaborated with the lab of\nEd Botchwey\non this work. \u201cThe great thing about this system is, it isn\u2019t specific to a particular population. These are cells we all have, and this treatment system might work even better in younger patients.\u201d\nLocal Delivery\nThe rotator cuff is a group of muscles and tendons surrounding and protecting the shoulder joint, keeping the head of the upper arm bone firmly in the shallow socket of the shoulder. It\u2019s tight jumble of tissues, and not an easy environment for muscle regeneration.\n\u201cWith a rotator cuff injury, you\u2019re actually tearing the tendon,\u201d said Temenoff, director of the NSF Engineering Research Center for Cell Manufacturing Technologies ( CMaT ) at Georgia Tech. \u201cAnd that causes the muscle to atrophy.\u201d\nWhile pro athletes have access to world-class training and rehabilitation to help rebuild the shoulder following surgery, for many patients that rotator cuff muscle doesn\u2019t fully regenerate, even after a successful surgery. Temenoff isn\u2019t sure why.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a big unknown,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s a big field of study right now, an active area of research. There is a need for regenerative therapies that can be used in conjunction with rotator cuff restoration surgery, as a long-term treatment option \u2014that is what we are addressing.\u201d\nIn previous studies using mouse models, Temenoff found that she could change the cellular environment in the muscle with the local injection of microparticles loaded with a protein called stromal cell-derived factor (SDF), which can attract various pre-regenerative cells circulating to the muscle.\nThe Push-Pull Effect\nThe idea is to mobilize the cells that can heal, the cells that rebuild muscle at the source. Getting enough of them to do the work is the trick.\nTemenoff\u2019s lab\nhas developed microparticles that use heparin, a natural sugar-based molecule found in the body that has a high negative charge. SDF is positive-charged, so that electrostatic interaction between the two particles allows for controlled release of SDF over time.\nSDF interacts almost magnetically with a receptor on pro-regenerative cells in bone marrow or circulation to \u201ccall\u201d them to a certain location. However, older people may not have enough of these cells in circulation to make much of a difference in healing. That\u2019s where\nBotchwey\u2019s lab\nentered with the major assist.\nHis team provided experience with a bone marrow mobilizing agent (called VPC01091) that can send healing cells into circulation around the body. In clinical settings, bone marrow mobilizing agents are used to \u201cpush\u201d stem cells out of the marrow and into the blood. These cells can regenerate and differentiate into all kinds of cells in multiple tissue environments.\nThe researchers set out to develop a single therapeutic option by combining the two technologies. Here's what happened when they tested the system in rats: The mobilizing agent was injected systemically while the SDF was injected locally into the shoulder. So, while the mobilizing agent \u201cpushed\u201d pro-healing cells into circulation, SDF\u2019s magnetic effect \u201cpulled\u201d them to the injury site, resulting in the desired regenerative effects.\nThe researchers found different levels of regeneration spatially\u2014in other words, where they applied the local injection really matters. Further research will aim to fine-tune the process, so clinicians can recruit healing cells to even more specific areas of the damaged muscle. Temenoff and her collaborators believe they are onto something that will result in better muscle regeneration, with potential applications beyond the rotator cuff.\nThis work was supported by the National Institutes of Health (grant no.
