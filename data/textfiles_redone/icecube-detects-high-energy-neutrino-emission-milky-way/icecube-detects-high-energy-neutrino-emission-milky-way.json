Now, for the first time, the\nIceCube Neutrino Observatory\nhas produced an image of the Milky Way using neutrinos \u2014 tiny, ghostlike astronomical messengers.\nIn an article to be published June 30, 2023, in the journal\nScience , the\nIceCube Collaboration , an international group of over 350 scientists, presents evidence of high-energy neutrino emission from the Milky Way.\nThe\ndetected\nhigh-energy neutrinos hold energies millions to billions of times higher than those produced by the fusion reactions that power stars.\nIceCube was built and is operated with\nNational Science Foundation (NSF)\nfunding and additional support from the fourteen countries that host institutional members of the IceCube Collaboration. IceCube\nObservatory\nsearches for signs of high-energy neutrinos originating from our galaxy and beyond, out to the farthest reaches of the universe.\nA cubic-kilometer neutrino detector operating at Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station observes these high-energy neutrinos , explains\nIgnacio Taboada , spokesperson for IceCube and a physics professor at\nGeorgia Institute of Technology .\n\u201cIceCube is truly unique,\u201d Taboada says. \u201cBuilt deep in Antarctic ice, its over 5,000 light sensors search for the flashes of blue light \u2014 Cherenkov radiation produced by neutrinos in the upper atmosphere, the Milky Way, and deep into the cosmos.\u201d\nSearching the southern sky\n\u201cWhat's intriguing is that, unlike the case for light of any wavelength, in neutrinos, the universe outshines the nearby sources in our own galaxy,\" says\nFrancis Halzen , a professor of physics at the\nUniversity of Wisconsin\u2013Madison\nand principal investigator of IceCube.\n\"As is so often the case, significant breakthroughs in science are enabled by advances in technology,\" says\nDenise Caldwell , director of\nNSF's Physics Division . \"The capabilities provided by the highly sensitive IceCube detector, coupled with new data analysis tools, have given us an entirely new view of our galaxy \u2014 one that had only been hinted at before. As these capabilities continue to be refined, we can look forward to watching this picture emerge with ever-increasing resolution, potentially revealing hidden features of our galaxy never before seen by humanity.\"\nInteractions between cosmic rays \u2014 high-energy protons and heavier nuclei, also produced in our galaxy, and galactic gas and dust inevitably produce both gamma rays and neutrinos. Given the observation of gamma rays from the galactic plane, the Milky Way was expected to be a source of high-energy neutrinos.\n\u201cA neutrino counterpart has now been measured, thus confirming what we know about our galaxy and cosmic ray sources,\u201d says\nSteve Sclafani , a physics Ph.D. student at\nDrexel University , IceCube member, and co-lead analyzer.\nThe search focused on the southern sky, where the bulk of neutrino emission from the galactic plane is expected near the center of our galaxy. However, until now, the background of muons and neutrinos produced by cosmic-ray interactions with the Earth\u2019s atmosphere posed significant challenges.\nTo overcome them, IceCube collaborators at Drexel University developed analyses that select for \"cascade\" events, or neutrino interactions in the ice that result in roughly spherical showers of light. Because the deposited energy from cascade events starts within the instrumented volume, contamination of atmospheric muons and neutrinos is reduced. Ultimately, the higher purity of the cascade events gave a better sensitivity to astrophysical neutrinos from the southern sky.\nMachine learning in the Milky Way\nHowever, the final breakthrough came from the implementation of machine learning methods, developed by IceCube collaborators at\nTU Dortmund University , that improve the identification of cascades produced by neutrinos as well as their direction and energy reconstruction. The observation of neutrinos from the Milky Way is a hallmark of the emerging critical value that machine learning provides in data analysis and event reconstruction in IceCube.\n\u201cThe improved methods allowed us to retain over an order of magnitude more neutrino events with better angular reconstruction, resulting in an analysis that is three times more sensitive than the previous search,\u201d says IceCube member, TU Dortmund physics Ph.D. student, and co-lead analyzer\nMirco\nH\u00fcnnefeld .\nThe dataset used in the study included 60,000 neutrinos spanning 10 years of IceCube data, 30 times as many events as the selection used in a previous analysis of the galactic plane using cascade events. These neutrinos were compared to previously published prediction maps of locations in the sky where the galaxy was expected to shine in neutrinos.\nThe maps included one made from extrapolating Fermi Large Area Telescope gamma-ray observations of the Milky Way and two alternative maps identified as KRA-gamma by the group of theorists who produced them.\n\u201cThis long-awaited detection of cosmic ray-interactions in the galaxy is also a wonderful example of what can be achieved when modern methods of knowledge discovery in machine learning are consistently applied.\u201d says\nWolfgang Rhode , professor of physics at TU Dortmund University, IceCube member, and H\u00fcnnefeld\u2019s advisor.\nThe power of machine learning offers great future potential, bringing other observations closer within reach.\n\u201cThe strong evidence for the Milky Way as a source of high-energy neutrinos has survived rigorous tests by the collaboration,\u201d says Taboada, the IceCube spokesperson. \u201cNow, the next step is to identify specific sources within the galaxy.\u201d\nThese and other questions will be addressed in planned follow-up analyses by\nIceCube.\n\u201cObserving our own galaxy for the first time using particles instead of light is a huge step,\u201d says\nNaoko Kurahashi Neilson , professor of physics at Drexel University, IceCube member, and Sclafani\u2019s advisor. \u201cAs neutrino astronomy evolves, we will get a new lens with which to observe the universe.\u201d\nAbout IceCube Neutrino Observatory\nThe IceCube Neutrino Observatory is funded and operated primarily through an award from the National Science Foundation to the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison.
