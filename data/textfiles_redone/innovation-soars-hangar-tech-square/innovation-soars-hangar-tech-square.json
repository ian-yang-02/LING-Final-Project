They developed a program to allow customers to pre-select on-board meals on some flights, guaranteeing their preferred entr\u00e9e will be available. Additional projects explore how to incorporate drones, autonomous vehicles and other forms of disruptive technology.\nDelta opened the doors to The Hangar Tuesday to showcase some solutions developed over the past year.\n\u201cFor us, it\u2019s really about a vehicle and a new channel to innovate,\u201d said Gil West, Delta\u2019s chief operating officer. \u201cWe\u2019ve got our normal channels within Delta to work and innovate, which do a great job \u2026 This gives us an agile type of development and innovation center that we\u2019re able to test ideas and fail and experiment.\u201d\nThe Hangar is one of 16 corporate innovation centers in Tech Square. Georgia Tech President G.P. \u201cBud\u201d Peterson said these centers allow larger companies to access the Institute\u2019s talent and technologies, while also collaborating with the area\u2019s startup community.\n\u201cThe ecosystem that Bud and Georgia Tech have created here is just really powerful,\u201d West said.\nA key part of that ecosystem is students like Veronica Young. Young, a senior majoring in industrial design, works in the center as a customer experience designer. She goes through each part of the customer experience with Delta and looks at how to make it better for the customer, as well as employees.\nShe\u2019s currently working on a project tied to the check-in process for the Delta Sky Club and flew up and down the East Coast, visiting different sky clubs.\n\u201cI absolutely love my job,\u201d said Young, who is graduating Saturday and\u00a0has been offered a full-time position with Delta. \u201cYou are not treated like an intern because you are part of the team. They trust us to lead projects and figure it out.\u201d\nWhile the innovation centers generate solutions for existing real-world challenges, they also identify potential future disrupters that will be need to be addressed.\nAs companies like Delta look for solutions to current and future problems, it\u2019s natural that they turn to Georgia Tech for help, Peterson said.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a bunch of really smart people that are looking for problems and Delta is looking for solutions,\u201d he said. \u201cThis allows us to marry those problems with solutions.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nInnovation Centers at Georgia Tech\nInnovation Thrives in Tech Square\nContact\nFor media inquiries about the innovation centers in Georgia Tech\u2019s Technology Square please contact Laura Diamond,\nlaura.diamond@gatech.edu\nFor other information about the innovation centers, please contact Greg King,\ngreg.king@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
