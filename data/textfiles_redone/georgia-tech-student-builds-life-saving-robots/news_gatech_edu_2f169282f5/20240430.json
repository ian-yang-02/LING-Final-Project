He also launched his own robotics startup called Ignite Labs, which develops affordable robotic equipment for industries and promotes robotics to students of all ages.\nThen, last year, just as Samnani was preparing to start a master\u2019s degree program at Georgia Tech in aerospace engineering, the Covid-19 pandemic struck. Suddenly traveling from Mumbai to Atlanta was no longer an option.\nFollowing some advice from his soon-to-be professor and his mother, Samnani started working on engineering solutions that might help his community, and he was inspired by the work he had already been doing.\n\u201cIf we can remotely explore Mars and Jupiter,\u201d he observed, \u201cwe should be able to figure out how to make that technology work in a hospital setting.\u201d\nUsing parts and pieces he had on hand from his robotic inventions, Samnani built a prototype for a medical assistance robot that could deliver food and medicine in the temporary Covid-19 hospitals established by the Indian government. The big idea: minimize the exposure for frontline workers interacting with infected patients, but also free up their time so they could handle more critical issues.\nSamnani\u2019s robot was built to use the same functions he had intended for exploring the red planet, but he retrofitted it for the unique setting of Covid-19 hospitals, where patients were isolated and care providers wore full protective equipment to avoid virus transmission.\nSamnani included a tank and nozzle spray apparatus, which could disperse disinfectant throughout the care unit. The arm of the robot has sensors that can determine a patient\u2019s temperature, heart rate, and oxygen level.\n\u201cAs soon as the patient puts their finger in, the doctor is able to remotely see the data from a safe location,\u201d Samnani explained.\nThe robot also has a tablet that can allow doctors and patients to interact with one another from a safe distance.\n\u201cThe nose or mouth of the robot is actually a camera,\u201d Samnani said.\nEventually the tablet connectivity allowed patients in isolation to be able to interact with family members, whom they were unable to see in person due to their Covid-19 isolation.\nThis roving bot was also used to stack up meal trays and deliver them to patients. In addition to freeing up healthcare workers\u2019 time, \u201cit also just brought a smile to people\u2019s faces,\u201d Samnani said.\nSamnani continued to develop robotic solutions to help healthcare workers. When he asked doctors if he could help with any other pressing issues, they let him know that deteriorating Covid-19 patients often have to receive up to 20 minutes of CPR if they go into cardiac arrest.\n\u201cI thought that process could be automated with a machine,\u201d Samnani said.\nSamnani built what has become India\u2019s first automated CPR device after calculating the exact rate and pressure needed to conduct CPR. He deployed the machine for use in a hospital just a day before leaving Mumbai for Atlanta to start his graduate program.\n\u201cI got a call from a doctor who let me know the machine had worked,\u201d Samnani said.\nThe patient, whose heart rate had dropped to gravely low numbers, was revived when doctors positioned the device over the patient\u2019s chest and allowed it to start running. Samnani says the news brought him tears of joy.\n\u201cI want to bring a positive effect to more people\u2019s lives,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that\u2019s what engineers do.\u201d\nSamnani is now completing his master\u2019s degree in aerospace engineering at Tech and working with Assistant Professor Christopher \u00a0Carr in Tech\u2019s Space Systems Design Lab. He\u2019s helping develop rover robots that could be used to detect signs of life in space, and he hopes to one day manage a space mission, namely to Europa \u2014\u00a0one of Jupiter\u2019s moons. But along the way he wants to help underprivileged communities gain access to quality healthcare and education.\n\u201cImprove life on Earth, and then head out for space,\u201d Samnani said.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nSteven Norris\nInstitute Communications\nsnorris@gatech.edu\nSiobhan Rodriguez\nInstitute Communications\nsar30@gatech.edu\nEmail\nsnorris@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
