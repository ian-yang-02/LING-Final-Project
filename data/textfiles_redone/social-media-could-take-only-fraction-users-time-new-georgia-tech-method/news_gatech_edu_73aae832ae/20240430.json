Where users might now commit minutes or hours on a single topic spanning thousands of posts, the Georgia Tech technique produces a\nsingle compiled social post\nthat reads almost like a headline. Users are able to immediately understand the conversation and interact with the words and ideas that are being talked about the most, whether they are from an election, major sporting event, or latest product release.\n\u201cThe technique seeks a balance between showing the most frequent words and preserving sentence structure,\u201d says lead researcher Mengdie Hu, a Ph.D. student in Human-Centered Computing. \u201cIt gives people a high-level overview of the most common expressions in a document collection and how they are connected to each other.\u201d\nImplemented in a web browser, the visualization tool, called SentenTree (short for Sentence Tree), has been used to take almost a quarter of a million tweets shared in a 15-minute window of time during the 2014 World Cup and filter the conversation. The resulting single 100-word social post revealed that Brazil scored a goal in its own net, putting them down 0-1 in their match against Croatia. In the example post, \u201cWorld Cup\u201d and \u201cown goal\u201d are larger than other words, signaling that they appear more frequently. In the middle of and connecting these two phrases are \u201c2014,\u201d \u201cbad,\u201d and \u201cBrazil,\u201d which together give an idea of the larger social conversation. If users want more context, SentenTree allows them to hover over any word and drill down to see more details, including the number of times the phrases appear along with the original tweets.\n\u201cEven if you don\u2019t know anything about soccer, there are visual cues to help users connect the concepts and play with the data,\u201d Hu says. \u201cThe central idea behind SentenTree is to take a large social media dataset, find the most frequent sequences of words, and build a visualization out of them that mirrors the real-time conversation.\u201d\nThe researchers say that while there are numerous analytical tools for social media data that highlight concept relationships, topical changes, or physical locations, less common are tools that visualize the actual text content itself. SentenTree is designed to remedy this by consolidating, finding patterns in, and delivering useful content from many sources into one simple interactive view.\nThe algorithms developed for SentenTree analyze the unstructured text data \u2014 developing a baseline sequential pattern of similar ideas and sentiments, all the while keeping a sentence-like structure \u2014 then incrementally add new words that build on the pattern as the algorithms search the text and kick out duplicate language. This allows the visualization to be a concise, readable representation of multiple thousands of threads. The visualization is even modified in length, based on the size of the screen, and is usually between 100-200 words.\n\u201cThere is an unwieldy volume of unstructured text on the web that continues to grow\u00a0explosively,\u201d says John Stasko, professor of Interactive Computing at Georgia Tech and part of the research team. \u201cSocial media text includes rich information on the public\u2019s interests and opinions, and we hope this technique can start to uncover important patterns and ideas that exist in this data.\u201d\nThe Georgia Tech researchers are developing their tool to allow for a broader cross section of ideas to surface on the social web \u2013 anywhere from YouTube to Facebook to Reddit \u2013 instead of simply relying on what social media influencers, such as celebrities or prominent public figures, post on their channels.\nSentenTree eventually will be available online for users to upload their own datasets to visualize. The work, presented in October at the IEEE Vis 2016 conference in Baltimore, Maryland, is published in the paper \u201cVisualizing Social Media Content with SentenTree.\u201d\n###\nThis research is supported in part by the DARPA XDATA program and the National Science Foundation, Award IIS-1320537.
