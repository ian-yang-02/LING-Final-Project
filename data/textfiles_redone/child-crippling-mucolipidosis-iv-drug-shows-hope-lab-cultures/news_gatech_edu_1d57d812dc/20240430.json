Now, lab tests using an existing prescription drug have shown initial hope for a future treatment.\nFingolimod is used to treat a form of multiple sclerosis and is already FDA-approved. Researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology, and at the Massachusetts General Hospital Research Institute have led successful testing of fingolimod,\nin vitro , i.e. on lab cultures, in cells originating from the brains of mice genetically augmented to mimic mucolipidosis IV (MLIV).\nThe next step will be tests in living mice, and researchers are hopeful that continued research progress may lead to a quicker than usual approval for human clinical drug trials. Fingolimod has not been tested on human MLIV cells and is not yet prescribed to treat MLIV.\nThe researchers published their\nstudy in the latest edition of the journal\nHuman Molecular Genetics . Their work was funded by the\nML4 Foundation .\nCellular junk accumulation\nMucolipidosis IV is a rare hereditary disease with a cruelty that can rival cerebral palsy\u2019s. MLIV strikes very early in life and goes from bad to worse.\n\u201cAround the age of 9 months, you see cognitive deficits,\u201d said\nLevi Wood, an assistant professor in Georgia Tech\u2019s School of Mechanical Engineering . Wood\u2019s research focuses on neurological diseases. \u201cThe children never learn to speak, and hardly at all to walk.\u201d\n\u201cWhen they go blind, it changes everything so badly, because the children stop recognizing faces, including their parents\u2019,\u201d said\nYulia Grishchuk, a junior faculty member at Mass General\nand Harvard Medical School. She co-led the study with Wood.\nMLIV is caused by a single mutated gene.\n\u201cIt disrupts the lysosome (a cell organelle), which is responsible for recycling waste, and this causes it to pile up in the cell,\u201d Grishchuk said. \u201cJunk accumulates in all the cells of the body, but the brain suffers the most, and the eyes.\u201d\nLab success: Astrocyte observation\nThe disease particularly throws off a group of cells in the brain called glial cells. One type, oligodendrocytes, produces the white sheathing called myelin that protects many neurons.\n\u201cThese patients, and also our lab mice, have ineffective myelination,\u201d Wood said. \u201cThat\u2019s one thing that may be impeding brain function.\u201d\nOther glial cells, microglia\u00a0and astrocytes, both have immune functions in the brain, and in this study, the researchers were able to observe for the first time that the latter were not behaving normally.\n\u201cThe astrocytes\u2019 activity is unusual in this disease and associated with increased inflammation,\u201d Grishchuk said.\nGrishchuk trained in the lab of\nSusan Slaugenhaupt , an MLIV pioneer who initially discovered the causal gene at Mass General and developed the mouse model used to study and fight the disease. Slaugenhaupt collaborated on this study.\nLab success: Astrocyte regulation\nA certain type of multiple sclerosis, remitting-relapsing MS (RRMS), shares this odd astrocyte behavior, which gave the researchers the idea of testing a drug used to treat that disease in MLIV cell samples.\n\u201cWe thought fingolimod would have a good chance because it works on astrocytes in MS,\u201d Wood said.\nIt tested successfully in the researchers\u2019 mouse-MLIV-astrocyte lab cultures, inhibiting the astrocytes\u2019 abnormal behavior. Now, the researchers want to move on to live mouse models to see if treatment helps brain function.\nFingolimod was recently improved for pediatric treatment of RRMS. Also, if it positively affects astrocytes in clinical trials, there is hope fingolimod could also improve other glial cells\u2019 functioning.\nMLIV\u2019s particular challenges\nVery few people carry the mutated gene that causes MLIV, and the gene is recessive, meaning that to get the disease, not only do both parents have to carry it, but both have to pass on their respective recessive gene to the child.\nSince the affliction is so rare, parents of a child with MLIV usually spend years going through misdiagnoses before correctly determining their child\u2019s disease. And, ironically, though the effects of the disease are obviously visible, early on, neural damage is not.\n\u201cIt\u2019s neurodevelopmental in very early childhood. The neurodegeneration kicks in much later in life,\u201d Grishchuk said.\nOnce a clinician or parent stumbles onto the disorder in medical literature, it can be confirmed by a genetic test. But then the parents are confronted with the cruel fact that there is no treatment at all for MLIV.\nResearch fight against MLIV\nAs with many rare diseases, research and development funding for MLIV is scarce, so researchers are pushed to find promise in existing FDA-approved medications for other conditions, so that clinical trials may become more likely.\nIf fingolimod does make it to a clinical trial to treat MLIV, it may be a one-shot proposition. If the trial fails, then subsequent clinical trials may not be possible for many years, since the patient pool is very small and participation in a failed clinical trial often rules out a patient\u2019s inclusion in further trials with different medications.\nIf the drug advances to become an available treatment, it would ideally be combined with early disease detection, so that therapy could begin as young as possible, thus preempting neurological ravages and rescuing brain function without delay.\nLike this article?\u00a0 Get our email newsletter here.\nThese authors collaborated in the study: Laura Weinstock and Sitara Sankar of Georgia Tech; Amanda Furness, Shawn Herron, Sierra Smith, Samantha DeRosa, Dadi Gao and Molly Mepyans of Massachusetts General, Anna Scotto Rosato and Diego Medina of Italy\u2019s Telethon Institute of Genetics and Medicine; Ayelet Vardi, Soo Min Cho and Anthony Futerman of Israel\u2019s Weizmann Institute of Science; and Natalia S.
