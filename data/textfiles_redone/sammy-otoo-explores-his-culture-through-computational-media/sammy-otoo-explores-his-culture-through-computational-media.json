Although he had imagined himself becoming a computer science major, Otoo fell in love with computational media on a visit.\n\u201cThe opportunity to not only learn computer science skills, but also history, media, culture, design, and communication skills, was a dream come true,\u201d he said. His major has allowed him to explore his many passions, which include photography, music, and video game design. It has also helped him apply computer skills to real-life situations.\nSome of Otoo\u2019s favorite classes may at first seem unrelated. One was CS 3750, which covers user interface design and how humans interact with their computers. Another was HTS 3025, the history of African Americans after 1865. For Otoo, a variety in curriculum let him create unique projects such as a short film.\n\u201cI want to stay involved in creative projects because I have not had as much time making music as I would like,\u201d he said. Culture is important to him, and media is a way to express his background in new ways. As a child of Ghanaian parents, his family\u2019s experiences help shape his creative projects. With access to studio quality equipment, he has been able to bring his culture into the Tech community. His short film, The Bench, premiered in April and served as a reflective moment as his time at Tech was ending. \u201cBe intentional about your time and how much you have available,\u201d Otoo advises.\nOtoo will spend the summer following graduation traveling throughout South Africa as part of the OMED Diversity Abroad and Global Innovation Project. This will be the first cohort of the program.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nConnor White\nInstitute Communications\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
