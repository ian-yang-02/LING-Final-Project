Their aim is to improve the success rate of transcatheter aortic valve replacements (TAVR) by picking the right prosthetic and avoiding a common complication known as paravalvular leakage.\n\u201cParavalvular leakage is an extremely important indicator in how well the patient will do long term with their new valve,\u201d said Zhen Qian, chief of Cardiovascular Imaging Research at Piedmont Heart Institute, which is part of Piedmont Healthcare. \u201cThe idea was, now that we can make a patient-specific model with this tissue-mimicking 3-D printing technology, we can test how the prosthetic valves interact with the 3-D printed models to learn whether we can predict leakage.\u201d\nThe researchers, whose study was published July 3 in the journal\nJACC: Cardiovascular Imaging , found that the models, created from CT scans of the patients\u2019 hearts, behaved so similarly to the real ones that they could reliably predict the leakage.\n\u201cThese 3-D printed valves have the potential to make a huge impact on patient care going forward,\u201d said Chuck Zhang, a professor in the Stewart School of Industrial and Systems Engineering at Georgia Tech.\nTens of thousands of patients each year are diagnosed with heart valve disease, and TAVR is often considered for patients who are at high risk for complications with an open-heart surgery to replace the valve.\nThe prosthetic valves are made in a variety of sizes from multiple manufacturers. Leakage occurs when the new valve doesn\u2019t achieve a precise fit and blood flows around the prosthetic rather than through it as intended. Reducing the chances for leakage is key to patient outcome for the procedure.\n\u201cIn preparing to conduct a valve replacement, interventional cardiologists already weigh a variety of clinical risk predictors, but our 3-D printed model gives us a quantitative method to evaluate how well a prosthetic valve fits the patient,\u201d Qian said.\nThe models are created with a special metamaterial design and then made by a multi-material 3-D printer, which gives the researchers control over such design parameters as diameter and curving wavelength of the metamaterial used for printing, to more closely mimic physiological properties of the tissue.\nFor example, the models can recreate conditions such as calcium deposition \u2013 a common underlying factor of aortic stenosis \u2013 as well as arterial wall stiffness and other unique aspects of a patient\u2019s heart.\n\u201cPrevious methods of using 3-D printers and a single material to create human organ models were limited to the physiological properties of the material used,\u201d Zhang said. \u201cOur method of creating these models using metamaterial design and multi-material 3-D printing takes into account the mechanical behavior of the heart valves, mimicking the natural strain-stiffening behavior of soft tissues that comes from the interaction between elastin and collagen, two proteins found in heart valves.\u201d\nThat interaction was simulated by embedding wavy, stiff microstructures into the softer material during the 3-D printing process.\nThe researchers created heart valve models from medical imaging of 18 patients who had undergone a valve replacement surgery. The models were outfitted with dozens of radiopaque beads to help measure the displacement of the tissue-mimicking material.\nThe researchers then paired those models with the same type and size prosthetic valves that interventional cardiologists had used during each patient\u2019s valve replacement procedure. Inside a warm-water testing environment controlled to maintain human body temperature, the researchers implanted the prosthetics inside the models, being careful to place the new valves in the exact location that was used during the clinical procedure for each case.\nSoftware was used to analyze medical imaging showing the location of the radiopaque beads taken before and after the experiment to determine how the prosthetics interacted with the 3-D printed models, looking for inconsistencies representing areas where the prosthetic wasn\u2019t sealed well against the wall of the valve.\nThose inconsistencies were assigned values that formed a \u201cbulge index,\u201d and the researchers found that a higher bulge index was associated with patients who had experienced a higher degree of leakage after valve placement. In addition to predicting the occurrence of the leakage, the 3-D printed models were also able to replicate the location and severity of the complication during the experiments.\n\u201cThe results of this study are quite encouraging,\u201d Qian said. \u201cEven though this valve replacement procedure is quite mature, there are still cases where picking a different size prosthetic or different manufacturer could improve the outcome, and 3-D printing will be very helpful to determine which one.\u201d\nWhile the researchers found that another variable \u2013 how much calcium had accumulated on the patient\u2019s natural valve \u2013 could also predict with high accuracy whether there would be a higher degree of leakage, results from their tests showed that the new method using 3-D printed valves was a better predictor in certain cases where balloons are used during the procedure to expand the prosthetic valve for a better fit.\nThe researchers plan to continue to optimize the metamaterial design and 3-D printing process and evaluate the use of the 3-D printed valves as a pre-surgery planning tool, testing a larger number of patient-specific models and looking for ways to further refine their analytic tools.\n\u201cEventually, once a patient has a CT scan, we could create a model, try different kinds of valves in there, and tell the physician which one might work best,\u201d Qian said. \u201cWe could even predict that a patient would probably have moderate paravalvular leakage, but a balloon dilatation will solve it.\u201d\nCITATION:\nZhen Qian, Kan Wang, Shizhen Liu, Xiao Zhou, Vivek Rajagopal, Christopher Meduri, James R.
