It follows the lives of ordinary citizens living in an occupied country who go deaf the moment a boy with a hearing impairment is shot and killed by soldiers. It is at once a fairy tale, an exploration of language in a time of crisis, and an intensely political text that questions indifference to oppression and violence.\n\u201cIlya Kaminsky\u2019s\nDeaf Republic\ncontinues to haunt me,\u201d said poet Rita Dove, one of the jurors for the award. \u201cIt\u2019s a parable that comes to life and refuses to die.\u201d\nThe jury also included author, filmmaker, critic and Harvard University professor Henry Louis \u201cSkip\u201d Gates; author Joyce Carol Oates; psychologist and author Steven Pinker; and Columbia University historian Simon Schama.\nThis is not the first award for\nDeaf Republic .
