In addition to the budget cut to state appropriations of 8.7% (or $29.1 million), Georgia Tech also planned for an additional reduction of 2.5% across the Institute to help account for expected shortfalls in student tuition and fee revenue. As the fall semester has begun, however, student enrollment is more favorable than expected, which translates into a lesser reduction to the overall budget.\n\u201cWe are grateful that fall enrollment is looking better than we thought it would be,\u201d said Kelly Fox, executive vice president for Administration and Finance. \u201cBecause of tuition and associated revenues, we are in a better position than we expected, and all of the proposed additional 2.5% budget cut will not be needed by all units at this time.\u201d\nIn total, the Institute is reducing its budget by $32.2 million. Specific unit reductions were distributed last week through the budget amendment process. In addition, an update on the remainder of the FY20 carry forward will be distributed to financial managers prior to the October budget amendment.\nIn line with the principles established when the budget revision began in May, all final budget action plans are to align with the following strategic priorities:\nProtecting student academic progression and quality of instruction.\nProtecting sponsored research that is self-funding and contributes to supporting our infrastructure and reputation.\nProtecting as much employment as possible while acknowledging that some personnel will inevitably be affected.\nGeorgia Tech will submit its updated FY21 budget, including proposed workforce strategies, to the University System of Georgia this week. It is expected that budget related action items will be implemented over the next month.\n\u201cEven with the better than expected enrollment, Georgia Tech is still taking a significant budget cut, which required that difficult decisions had to be made,\u201d added Fox. \u201cWe know that this uncertainty has caused\u202fstress and anxiety, and we remain deeply committed to ensuring that all actions\u202fwill be\u202ftaken\u202fwith fairness, compassion, and respect.\u201d\nThis fall, campus leadership will begin the process of reevaluating Georgia Tech\u2019s budgeting process to help ensure greater transparency as well as strategic alignment. Plans are to conduct a town hall for the greater campus community later this fall. More information will be coming soon.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nRachael Pocklington\nInstitute Communications\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
