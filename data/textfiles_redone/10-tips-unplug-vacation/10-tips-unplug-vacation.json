For some, a vacation is a time to relax and completely disconnect from the daily pressures of work. For those who find unplugging more difficult or even impossible, Joi Alexander, director of Health Initiatives, and Tiffiny Hughes-Troutman, director of the Center for Assessment, Referral, and Education (CARE), suggest 10 tips to unplug.\nRecognize that you need and deserve a vacation.\nTaking a vacation is a method to honor and take care of yourself and prioritize self-care.\nSet expectations with supervisors, colleagues, clients, and others.\nMake sure you communicate that when you are on vacation you will not respond immediately. Utilize your out-of-office email reply to inform individuals you are not in the office and the date of your return. Include the name of someone to contact in case of emergency.\nStart a mindfulness practice in the morning and before bed\nthat will help you relax during the day.\nAvoid multitasking.\nMinimize or close your email program, chat logs, and news or entertainment websites so you can focus and be present.\nSet up a time during the day to detox and get away from the digital world.\nRead a book, write in a journal, explore nature, or practice mindfulness and meditation.\nIt can be tempting to check your work email while on vacation.\nThe simplest way to avoid this is by turning off all work-related notifications. If you are one of those people who feel you should always be checking work emails, set up specific, limited times to check in each day.\nTry to avoid \u201cchecking in\u201d with your colleagues , as this opens the opportunity for you to be available for work and creates unrealistic expectations for you and your team while you are on vacation.\nConsider a staycation.\nIf you truly can\u2019t get away for an extended period, proactively schedule more long weekends that will still feel like a break and well-deserved time away. And make sure you actually unplug from work.\nMake yourself accountable to others.\nAsk your family, friends, and co-workers to call you out if they catch you working. Unplugging could be new and a little uncomfortable for you, and sharing this with others allows you to solidify your commitment.\nFor the final tip, Alexander suggests practicing self-compassion. \u201cDue to our heavy reliance on technology, you may find it challenging to unplug so take it one step at a time,\u201d she said. \u201cGive yourself grace and don\u2019t feel guilty for unplugging.\u201d\nHughes-Troutman added that the best way to unplug is to plan a vacation that demands your full attention. \u201cMake plans that include what you truly enjoy. It is much easier to avoid your electronics if you are genuinely engaged in your vacation.\u201d\nIf you are traveling, it is best practice to test for Covid-19 when you return to ensure it is safe to return to work.\nGeorgia Tech continues to offer asymptomatic Covid-19 testing on campus this summer .\nAdditional Images\nContact\nVictor Rogers\nInstitiute Communications\nEmail\nvictor.rogers@comm.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
