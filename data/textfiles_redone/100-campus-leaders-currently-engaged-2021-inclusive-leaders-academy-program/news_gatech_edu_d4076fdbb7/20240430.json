The participants represent the fifth cohort of the program and include more than 100 managers, directors, executives, senior researchers, and faculty administrators from across the Institute.\nThe Inclusive Leaders Academy is\u00a0designed to support managers and leaders in developing and honing global competencies and to positively shape Tech\u2019s culture towards inclusive excellence. Key learning benefits of the program and core curriculum topic areas facilitate social intelligence, self-awareness, resilience, and courage as leadership attributes. The curriculum provides an individualized path of self-guided learning as well as integration and practice techniques through virtual wisdom labs and dialogues.\nThis year\u2019s program will span 12 weeks. Participants who complete the program will gain the equivalent of 18 hours of learning and practice and will receive a \u201cCulture Champions\u201d certificate. Since the Academy\u2019s initiative, more than 300 have completed the program.\nThe program was launched in 2017 by\nInstitute Diversity, Equity, and\nInclusion \u2019s Staff Diversity, Inclusion and Engagement unit. Pearl Alexander, executive director of Diversity, Inclusion, and Engagement and Inclusive Leaders Academy director said, \u201cThe initiative was responsive to the need to cultivate skills to foster inclusivity and to meet the increasing desires for meaningful professional development. The Inclusive Leaders Academy offers practical guides and tools that help us \u2018thrive on diversity,\u2019 act ethically, nurture the wellbeing of our community, and more.\nCurriculum content has been curated from the NeuroLeadership Institute and\u00a0 Dare to Lead,\u00a0 the most recent book authored by and based on the research of\u00a0Bren\u00e9 Brown. \u201cContent is also inclusive of other research-based leadership practices that will support the Institute\u2019s aspirational goals and ensure that we deliver on the mission of progress and service outlined in our 2030 Strategic Plan,\u201d Alexander added.\nOne of the first instructor-led courses for the cohort was Stories We Live. Participants learned how stories shape individual identity and improve social intelligence and relational abilities.\nDuring the two-hour course, the cohort\u00a0worked with Georgia Tech story coaches -- including Alexander; Emma Blandford, assistant director for Living Learning Communities for the College of Sciences; Lindsey Laney, academic program manager for Georgia Tech Professional Education; Kathleen Schaag, Brittan Fellow with the School of Literature, Media, and Communication\u00a0(LMC); Stephanie Ray, associate dean of students and director of Diversity Programs for the Division of Student Life; and Wendy Truran, visiting lecturer with the School of LMC \u00a0-- who advised participants on how to excavate thought details and boost expression and creativity. Some stories may emerge for publication in Institute Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion\u2019s growing digital story library, the\nTransformative Narratives .\nThe cohort have also completed the NeuroLeadership Institute\u2019s Neuroscience of Smart Teams (INCLUDE) and Neuroscience of Breaking Bias (DECIDE) modules. Participants completed self-guided learning exercises and weekly reflections on the practices of creating inclusive team cultures and recognizing biases. Later into the program, NeuroLeadership\u2019s Jeff Salters and Ric Oslin facilitated the cohort through 60-minute interactive webinars to hone the module teachings.\n\u201cAt this point in the program participants should have a good sense of how to identify and mitigate their unconscious biases, the power of vulnerability, and stories to create connected, collaborative, and engaging work environments,\u201d Alexander said. \u201cAdditional sessions to come include instruction on antiracism empathy, creating a calling-in culture, and resilience. The session on resilience will be facilitated by Joi Alexander, director of Health Initiatives, and Sonia Alvarez-Robinson, executive director of Georgia Tech Strategic Consulting.\nAfter completing all of the basic certificate requirements, participants will be celebrated during a closing program in May. They will also be eligible for diversity, equity, and inclusion leadership and career coaching as part of a growing community of practice.\n\u201cThrough this award-winning initiative, we believe that Georgia Tech is leading by example,\u201d Alexander added. \u201cWe are already developing staff and faculty leaders at all levels who are inclusive, accountable, and determined to be exceptional champions of a culture where all contributors can thrive. The challenge ahead is to scale this and similar opportunities to more leaders at Tech, higher education, and the world.\u201d\nThe 2021 Inclusive Leaders Academy participants are:\u00a0Rashidah Bahar-Graham, Lula Baker, Kathryn Ballou, Susan Belmonte, Kelley Bennett, Ashton Bettis, James Black, Scott Bleiweis, Ilana Blumenfeld-Gantz,\u00a0Neil Bright,\u00a0L.
