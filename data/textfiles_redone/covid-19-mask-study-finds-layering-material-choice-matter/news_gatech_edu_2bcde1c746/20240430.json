For comparison, a human hair is about 50 microns in diameter while 1 millimeter is 1,000 microns in size.\n\u201cA submicron particle can stay in the air for hours and days, depending on the ventilation, so if you have a room that is not ventilated or poorly ventilated then these small particles can stay there for a very long period of time,\u201d said\nNga Lee (Sally) Ng , associate professor and Tanner Faculty Fellow in the\nSchool of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering\nand the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences.\nThe study was conducted during spring 2020, when the pandemic triggered a global shutdown of most institutions. Communities faced massive shortages of personal protective equipment, prompting many people to make their own homemade masks. Georgia Tech quickly set up the study since it already had \u201ca great system for testing filtration efficiency using existing instruments in the lab,\u201d Ng recalled.\nThe study\u2019s findings were used to shape homemade face mask recommendations\nhere\nlast April, with the comprehensive study findings published on March 22 in the journal\nAerosol Science and Technology .\nIn all, the researchers tested 33 different commercially accessible materials not limited to cloth fabrics, including single-layer woven fabrics such as cotton and woven polyester, blended fabrics, nonwoven materials, cellulose-based materials, materials commonly found and used in hospitals, and various filter materials.\n\u201cWe learned there was a lot of variability in filtration performance even in the same type of material,\u201d Ng said.\n\"We found commercially available materials that provide acceptable levels of submicron particle rejection while still maintaining air flow resistance similar to a surgical mask,\u201d said\nRyan Lively , an associate professor and John H. Woody Faculty Fellow in the School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering. \u201cThese materials combine fabric fiber density, a maze-like structure, and fiber surface chemistry to effectively reject submicron particles.\u201d\nThe best-performing materials for homemade masks were blackout drapery and sterilization wrap widely used for packing surgical instruments. Both materials are commercially available.\nThe researchers said people should avoid using filters such as a HEPA/MERV or vacuum bags unless they are certified to be fiberglass-free since often such filters on their own may release glass fibers that can be inhaled. Other materials to avoid for masks include loose-knitted material, batting fabric, felt, fleece, or shiny, reusable shopping bags.\nMultilayered samples performed much better than single-layer samples, but people should pay attention to breathability. The two-layered and three-layered samples tested show an overall filtration efficiency of about 50% for submicron particles. Mask fit is also important since particles can easily escape through gaps at the nose or through the sides of the mask.\nThe analysis showed that properly fitted and multilayer masks reject 84% of particles expelled by a person when one person wears it. Two people donning these types of masks reduces particle transmission by 96%.\nA final takeaway of the research was the importance of universal mask wearing.\n\u201cThe best way to protect ourselves and others is to reduce exhaled particles at the source, and the source is our face,\u201d Ng said, adding, \u201cThat really gets amplified when everyone starts wearing masks.\u201d\nShe expressed optimism that the findings will motivate people to more widely embrace mask wearing if they are sick and need to be in public.\n\u201cNot everyone understands the importance of airborne virus transmission, and the importance of wearing a mask,\u201d she said. \u201cI hope that the practice will continue to help reduce the release of these viral particles into the environment and help protect others.\u201d\nIn addition to Ng and Lively, the researchers included Taekyu Joo, Masayuki Takeuchi, Fobang Liu, Matthew P. Rivera, and Bahnisikha Dutta from Georgia Tech; Joy Barr and Eric Parker from theClubhou.se; Emily S. Blum and John H. Tipton from the Global Center for Medical Innovation; and Julia Varnedoef from Cobb County (Georgia) Schools.\nThe work was supported by the Center for the Science and Technology of Advanced Material and Interfaces (STAMI) at Georgia Tech.\nCITATION : Joo, Taekyu, et al, \u201cEvaluation of Particle Filtration Efficiency of Commercially Available Materials for Homemade Face Mask Usage.\u201d (Aerosol Science and Technology, 2021)\nhttps://doi.org/10.1080/02786826.2021.1905149 .\n***\nThe Georgia Institute of Technology, or\u00a0 Georgia Tech , is a top 10 public research university developing leaders who advance technology and improve the human condition.\nThe Institute offers\u00a0 business,\u00a0computing,\u00a0design,\u00a0engineering,\u00a0liberal arts,\nand\u00a0 sciences \u00a0degrees.
