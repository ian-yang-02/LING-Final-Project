They are now expanding their services by partnering with RAINN, a national sexual assault hotline service with trained staff that will provide additional service to the Georgia Tech community. This expansion centralizes the support service to a single phone number (404.894.9000) instead of calling one number during the day and the Georgia Tech Police Department (GTPD) after hours.\n\u201cVictims and survivors of sexual violence come from a diverse range of backgrounds, experiences, and identities. In order to effectively support them, we have to offer an array of options for them to reach out for assistance and support at Georgia Tech. This partnership with RAINN helps us expand beyond GTPD and other existing avenues for seeking help,\u201d said Luoluo Hong, vice president for Student Engagement and Well-Being, who is herself a campus rape survivor.\nRAINN has a national reputation for its 24/7/365 hotline that is used by peer institutions as a university-branded service. RAINN volunteers responding to calls will identify themselves as representatives of the VOICE hotline. They receive extensive training in the areas of sexual violence, trauma, and crisis intervention. They also receive training about Georgia Tech and Atlanta-specific resources. If students need to access additional services such as transportation to a rape crisis center or police department, assistance with a time-sensitive academic accommodation, or resolution of safety concerns, RAINN will convey those needs to the VOICE Advocate.\nAs part of Georgia Tech Health Initiatives,\nVOICE\nis a confidential resource, independent from law enforcement or the Title IX Office. During the summer of 2020, VOICE moved to enhance its system so that all students would feel safer and more comfortable accessing VOICE services.\nVOICE will continue to provide the same services to students who experience any form of sexual violence, including sexual assault, sexual harassment, intimate partner violence, or stalking. Classmates, friends, family members, and others who support survivors can also reach out for services and information on how to help.\nVOICE commemorates Sexual Assault Awarness Month (SAAM) in April with Teal Ribbon Day today, April 14. All Yellow Jackets are invited to pick up a teal ribbon on Tech Green and wear it on April 14 in honor of all sexual violence victims and survivors.\nFor more information about Georgia Tech VOICE :\u00a0 https://voice.gatech.edu .\u00a0To connect with a VOICE Advocate any time of day or night, call 404.894.9000.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nSara Warner Sara.warner@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
