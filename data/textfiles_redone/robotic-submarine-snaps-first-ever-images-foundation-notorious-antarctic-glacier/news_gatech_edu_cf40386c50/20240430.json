As the glacier flows into the ocean, it becomes sea ice and drives up sea-level. Thwaites Glacier's ice is flowing particularly fast, and some researchers believe it may have already tipped into instability or be near that point, though this has not yet been established.\u00a0Credit: NASA/James Yungel\nJan 29, 2020\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nDuring an unprecedented scientific campaign on an Antarctic glacier notorious for contributions to sea-level, researchers took first-ever images at the glacier\u2019s foundations on the ocean floor. The area is key to Thwaites Glacier\u2019s potential to become more dangerous, and in the coming months, the research team hopes to give the world a clearer picture of its condition.\nThe images, taken by a robotic underwater vehicle, were part of a broad set of data collected in a variety of experiments by an international team. The\u00a0 International Thwaites Glacier Collaboration \u00a0(ITGC)\u00a0 announced the completion of this first-ever major research venture \u00a0on the glacier coincident with the 200-year anniversary of the discovery of Antarctica in 1820.\nAlready, Thwaites accounts for about four percent of global sea-level rise. Researchers have had concerns that a tipping point in the stability at its foundations could result in a run-away collapse of the glacier and boost sea levels by as much as 25 inches. By studying multiple aspects of Thwaites, the ITGC wants to understand more about the likelihood that the glacier the size of Florida may reach such instability in the coming decades.\nLine of concern\nThe area of concern that the underwater vehicle visited is called the grounding line, and it is important to the stability of Thwaites Glacier\u2019s footing. It is the line between where the glacier rests on the ocean bed and where it floats over water. The farther back the grounding line recedes, the faster the ice can flow into the sea, pushing up sea-level.\n\u201cVisiting the grounding line is one of the reasons work like this is important because we can drive right up to it and actually measure where it is,\u201d said Britney Schmidt, an ITGC co-investigator from the Georgia Institute of Technology. \u201cIt's the first time anyone has done that or has ever even seen the grounding zone of a major glacier under the water, and that\u2019s the place where the greatest degree of melting and destabilization can occur.\u201d\nThe underwater robot,\u00a0 Icefin, was engineered by Schmidt\u2019s Georgia Tech lab . The Georgia Tech team was part of a greater collaboration between researchers from the U.S. and the British Antarctic Survey (BAS), who lived and worked on Thwaites in December and January. A BAS hot water drill melted a hole 590 meters deep (1,935 feet) to access the ocean cavity for Icefin.\n\u201cIcefin swam over 15 km (9.3 miles) round trip during five missions.\u00a0This included two passes up to the grounding zone, including one where we got as close as we physically could to the place where the seafloor meets the ice,\u201d said Schmidt, who is\u00a0 an associate professor in Georgia Tech\u2019s School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences . \u201cWe saw amazing ice interactions driven by sediments at the line and from the rapid melting from warm ocean water.\u201d\n[Ready for graduate school?\u00a0 Here's how to apply to Georgia Tech. ]\nHistoric research venture\nIn the coming months and years, the ITGC team made up of researchers from multiple universities and research institutions in the U.S. and the UK will publish studies with thorough findings based on the unprecedented data collected during the field campaign.\nThe array of research the scientists carried out research included seismic and radar measurements and using hot water drills to make holes between 300 and 700 meters (985 and 2,300 feet) deep down to the ocean and glacier bed below Thwaites\u2019 ice. Researchers also took cores of sediment from the seafloor and under parts of the glacier grounded on the bed to examine the quality of the foothold that it offers Thwaites.\n\u201cWe know that warmer ocean waters are eroding many of West Antarctica\u2019s glaciers, but we\u2019re particularly concerned about Thwaites. This new data will provide a new perspective of the processes taking place, so we can predict future change with more certainty,\u201d said Keith Nicholls, an oceanographer from the British Antarctic Survey.\nNicholls is a co-principal investigator on the project that involved Schmidt along with David Holland of New York University. The research is funded by the National Science Foundation, the UK Natural Environment Research Council, the U.S. Antarctic Program, and the British Antarctic Survey.\nAntarctica sea-level background\nOver the past 30 years, the amount of ice flowing to the sea from Thwaites and its neighboring glaciers has nearly doubled.\n\u201cWhile Greenland's contribution to sea level has already reached an alarming rate, Antarctica is just now picking up its contributions to sea level,\u201d Schmidt said. \u201cIt has the largest body of ice on Earth and will contribute more and more of sea-level rise over the next 100 years and beyond. It\u2019s a massive source of uncertainty in the climate system.\u201d\nWatch \u00a0 BBC News report on this research .\nExternal News Coverage:\nBBC News-\u00a0 Antarctica melting: Climate change and the journey to the 'doomsday glacier'\nThe Atlantic-\nThe New Video of One of the Scariest Places on Earth\nThe Washington Post-\u00a0 Unprecedented data confirms that Antarctica\u2019s most dangerous glacier is melting from below\nBBC Newsround-\u00a0 Climate change: Scientists concerned about future of Antarctic glacier\nDaily Mail Online-\u00a0 Scientists drill into Antarctica's 'doomsday' Thwaites glacier for the first time in a bid to stop dramatic sea level rise as the ice shelf the size of BRITAIN melts at an alarming rate\nYahoo News-\u00a0 Scientists drill into \u2018doomsday glacier\u2019 the size of Britain to see if it\u2019s going to collapse\nFox News-\u00a0 Antarctica\u2019s \u2018doomsday glacier\u2019 reveals alarming new trait to scientists\nCosmos Magazine-\nHere's what's below an unstable glacier\nPBS Newshour-\nA risky expedition to study the \u2018doomsday glacier\u2019\nNOVA Next-\u00a0 Scientists find warm water beneath Antarctica\u2019s most at-risk glacier\nMore reading: \u00a0 Instability in Antarctic Ice Projected to Make Sea Level Rise Rapidly \u00a0 and\nReframing Antarctica\u2019s Meltwater Pond Dangers to Ice Shelves and Sea Level\nAny findings, conclusions, or recommendations are those of the authors and not necessarily of the sponsors.\nWriter &\u00a0Media Representative : Ben Brumfield (404-272-2780), email:\u00a0 ben.brumfield@comm.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nAdditional Images\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
