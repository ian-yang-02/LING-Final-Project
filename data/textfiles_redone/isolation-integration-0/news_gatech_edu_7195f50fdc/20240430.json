Not so at Georgia Tech.\n\u201cUnlike other traditional universities, at which applications and enrollments in humanities fields have plummeted, the\nSchool of Literature, Media, and Communication\u2019s (LMC)\napplication rates have grown by more than 300 percent over the last five years,\u201d said Richard Utz, professor and LMC chair. \u201cI am convinced that one of the main causes for this increase is the unique degree work that offers the advantages of a liberal arts education within the context of a leading technological institute.\u201d\nOn April 19 and 20, LMC will host\nhumanTech , a symposium dedicated to exploring the future of the relationship between science and technology and the humanities, positioning Georgia Tech as a leader in the conscious discussion of the role of the humanities in an increasingly technology-driven world.\n\u201cThere really isn't wide recognition of the special roles the humanities play when they are at an institution where they collaborate deeply with STEM,\u201d Utz said. \u201cThe humanTech symposium strives to create an inventory of the specific environment within which humanists and scientists collaborate rather than focusing on the often-entrenched perception of differences.\u201d\nThe symposium connects to the School\u2019s stated vision, to introduce new models of intellectual inquiry and practice that bring diverse perspectives to bear on technological invention and innovation.\n\u201cOur role, we feel, is to add the perspectives of what's affective, invisible, unpredictable, and unmeasurable to science and engineering education, which focuses on the measurable, observable, quantifiable, and testable,\u201d Utz said.\nThe symposium features speakers at the forefront of designing and implementing practices that connect scientific and technological research with human-centered methodologies and practices, demonstrating how ethics and critical thinking are interrelated with innovation and complex problem-solving.\n\u201cAs a scholar of higher education whose background is within the liberal arts tradition, I have spent the past 15 years exploring the tensions between my scholarly training and that of my STEM colleagues at Georgia Tech,\u201d said Karen Head, associate chair in LMC and one of the symposium\u2019s organizers. \u201chumanTech offers a conscious attempt to foster more meaningful multidisciplinary collaborations that are necessary to solve the greatest problems of our times. Crossing disciplinary lines has always been part of my lexicon of interest and practice, so I am particularly pleased to be able to cohost this symposium.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nhumanTech\nAdditional information\nAbout the artwork:\nThe top image is a detail of \"Respite\" by artist and Georgia Tech alumna Nettrice Gaskins, whose current \"algorithmic art\" process includes the generation of images based on collaboration with artificial intelligence and machine learning.\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
