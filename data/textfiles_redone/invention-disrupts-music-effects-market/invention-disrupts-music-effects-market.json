Like many guitarists he uses pedals, electronic or digital devices that let musicians alter how their instrument sounds.\nBut Leff, a fourth-year mechanical engineering major, was frustrated with what he saw on the market. The existing effects were rigid and if he wanted a new sound effect he had to buy a new pedal.\n\u201cWhat I wanted was the freedom to customize my sounds, and I wanted that variety without having to spend a ton of money,\u201d said Leff, who is from Honolulu.\nHe teamed up with Dallas Condra, a fourth-year mechanical engineering major, and Vanya Padmanabhan, a fourth-year industrial design major, and together they started a company called\nPedalCreator .\nTheir first product, disruption, is one of six devices competing for this year\u2019s\nInVenture Prize , Georgia Tech\u2019s annual invention competition. The winner will be announced March 14.\nDisruption, they said, is an affordable guitar effects pedal that gives musicians the freedom to create distortion sounds. The patent-pending device is fully analog and customizable.\nTheir pedal system\u2019s design includes a modular base -- smaller than a TV remote \u2013 built to house two cartridges. One is a tone cartridge and the other is a distortion cartridge and they work together to create a desired sound. The cartridges can be switched out to change the effect. They have already developed six swappable cartridge options.\nBefore entering InVenture, they participated in\nCREATE-X , a series of entrepreneurship programs for undergraduate students.\nNow much of the circuitry work is done in the apartment shared by Leff and Condra. They store parts and tools on an open shelf in their kitchen. Other shelves hold canned goods and cereal.\nThe team went through several iterations to create the clean cartridge system design, said Padmanabhan, who is from Atlanta.\nProfessional musicians are trying out the device and offering feedback. The company is accepting pre-orders and they plan to attend the National Association of Music Merchants gathering this summer in Nashville.\n\u201cThe InVenture Prize validates what we\u2019re doing and shows us that we\u2019re on the right track,\u201d said Condra, who is from Knoxville. \u201cWe\u2019re ready for that next step.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nGeorgia Tech InVenture Prize\nContact\nLaura Diamond\nMedia Relations\u00a0 laura.diamond@gatech.edu\n404-660-2927\nEmail\nlaura.diamond@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
