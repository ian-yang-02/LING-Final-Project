The system is triggered by a thumb ring outfitted with a gyroscope and tiny microphone. As wearers strum their thumb across the fingers, the hardware detects the movement.\nIn a\nvideo demonstration , the \u201cwritten\u201d figures appear on an adjacent screen. In the future, the researchers say the technology could be used to send phone calls to voicemail or answer text messages \u2014 all without the wearer reaching for their phone or even looking at it.\n\u201cWhen a person grabs their phone during a meeting, even if trying to silence it, the gesture can infringe on the conversation or be distracting,\u201d said Thad Starner, the Georgia Tech School of Interactive Computing professor leading the project. \u201cBut if they can simply send the call to voicemail, perhaps by writing an \u2018x\u2019 on their hand below the table, there isn\u2019t an interruption.\u201d\nStarner also says the technology could be used in virtual reality, replacing the need to take off a head-mounted device in order to input commands via a mouse or keyboard.\nThe research team wanted to build a system that would always be available and easy to use.\n\u201cA ring augments the fingers in a way that is fairly non-obstructive during daily activities. A ring is also socially acceptable, unlike other wearable input devices,\u201d said Cheng Zhang, the Georgia Tech graduate student who created the technology.\nThe system is called Fingersound. While other gesture-based systems require the user to perform gestures in the air, Fingersound uses the fingers as a canvas. This allows the system to clearly recognize the beginning and end of an intended gesture by using the microphone and gyroscope to detect the signal. In addition to helping recognize the start and end of a gesture, it also provides tactile feedback while performing the gestures. This feedback is crucial for user experience and is missing on other in-air gestures\n\u201cOur system uses sound and movement to identify intended gestures, which improves the accuracy compared to a system just looking for movements,\u201d said Zhang. \u201cFor instance, to a gyroscope, random finger movements during walking may look very similar to the thumb gestures. But based on our investigation, the sounds caused by these daily activities are quite different from each other.\u201d\nFingersound sends the sound captured by the contact microphone and motion data captured by the gyroscope sensor through multiple filtering mechanisms. The system then analyzes it to determine whether a gesture was performed or whether it was simply noise from other finger-related activity.\nThe research was presented earlier this year at Ubicomp and the ACM International Symposium on Wearable Computing along with two other papers that feature ring-based gesture technology.\nFingOrbits\nallows the wearer to control apps on a smartwatch or head-mounted display by rubbing their thumb on their hand. With\nSoundTrak , people can write words or 3-D doodles in the air by localizing the absolute position of the finger in 3-D space, then see the results simultaneously on a computer screen.\nThe new technologies were developed by the same team that created a technique that\nallowed smartwatch wearers to control their device by tapping its sides .\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nPrevious Research with Smartwatches\nSchool of Interactive Computing\nMeet Thad Starner\nContact\nJason Maderer\nNational Media Relations\nmaderer@gatech.edu\n404-660-2926\nEmail\nmaderer@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
