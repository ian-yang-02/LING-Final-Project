Here are a few tips and resources that can help.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nEmail\nStudying outdoors on campus\nMar 10, 2023\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nWhether this is your first or final semester at Georgia Tech, final exams can bring about a familiar feeling of stress and anxiety, but there are several things you can do to boost your mood and help you power through your exams.\nEat Right\nEating a variety of foods consistently can go a long way in reducing stress.\u00a0The\u00a0 Cleveland Clinic \u00a0explains that eating right can reduce the body\u2019s cortisol levels \u2014 the hormone responsible for regulating stress response. The clinic advises that in addition to the usual fruits, vegetables, and lean proteins associated with a healthy diet, foods rich in magnesium can be \u201chugely beneficial in metabolizing cortisol and relaxing the body and mind.\u201d These include pumpkin seeds, almonds, spinach, cashews, dark chocolate, peanut butter, and\u00a0 other greens, nuts, dry beans, and whole grains .\nDietitians in the\nWellness Empowerment Center at Georgia Tech\nrecommend aiming for three or more food groups for meals and two or more food groups for snacks, remembering to plan ahead and eat before you're hungry \u2014 especially on\u00a0test and study days \u2014 and to stay hydrated.\nConversely, foods high in sugar, along with alcohol and caffeine, can be detrimental to your mental health.\nEqually as important as the foods you eat are the times you eat them. Staying on a regular eating schedule is important, as skipping meals or overeating can negatively affect your ability to cope with stress. If you\u2019re looking for more information or guidance on maintaining a healthy diet, the\u00a0Wellness Empowerment Center\u00a0can provide assistance.\nExercise\nTaking a study break to exercise can benefit your physical and mental health. Whether you\u2019re lifting weights or taking a stroll through campus or around Piedmont Park, just 30 minutes of exercise can relieve stress. Finding an activity you enjoy \u2014 basketball, yoga, cycling, or any other activity \u2014 can help take your mind off of exam prep for a short time. Among many other health benefits, regular exercise can also help improve your sleep quality, which is another important factor in managing stress.\u00a0Georgia Tech\u2019s\u00a0 Campus Recreation Center \u00a0provides an environment that promotes fitness, exercise, and\u00a0a culture of fun, relaxation, and a positive experience for students.\nSleep\nCramming for an exam and studying through the night may feel like the best way to prepare, but the\u00a0 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says otherwise . In fact, showing up to take your midterm after being awake for 17 hours straight, according to the agency, is similar to having a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of 0.05%. Add seven hours, and the effects are similar to a BAC of .10% \u2014 exceeding the DUI threshold in the U.S.\nAdditionally, the longer you go without sleeping, the more susceptible you become to confusion and mistakes. The CDC warns that no amount of motivation or professionalism can pay back the \u201csleep debt\u201d incurred by staying up all night.\nUnplug During Breaks\nWhile you\u2019re studying, you may be in front of a screen for long periods of time. So, when it\u2019s time for a break, step away and\u00a0 get some fresh air .\n\u201cIt is a simple way to improve your mood,\u201d Joi Alexander, director of the\u00a0Wellness Empowerment Center in the Division of Student Engagement and Well-Being, said. \u201cThe fresh air can help raise oxygen levels in your brain, which increases serotonin levels.\u201d Serotonin is the neurotransmitter that alters your mood.\nAlexander added that 20-30 minutes in the sun, while also giving your body the vitamin D it needs, can reduce cortisol levels and help regulate your sleep cycle.\nIndoors or outdoors, taking productive breaks can reignite your ability to focus and give you a much-needed energy boost.\nAsk for Help\nMany resources are available to help students year-round through the\u00a0 Center for Mental Health Care and Resources . Counseling sessions provide short-term therapy solutions and are free of charge for all Georgia Tech students. Additionally, the center has a variety of self-help resources on its website that offer on-demand advice to assist with stress, anxiety, and more. \u00a0 Togetherall \u00a0 is a free, 24/7 online community\u00a0for\u00a0sharing\u00a0feelings anonymously and getting support for mental health and well-being.\u00a0 Headspace , a free mindfulness and meditation app, helps students learn to stress less, reduce strain and burnout, and prepare for exams, presentations, etc.\u00a0 Thrive@GT \u00a0provides students with immediate support, connecting them with a counselor at any time.\nOn the academic side,\u00a0 Tutoring and Academic Support offers 1-to-1 sessions \u00a0that can assist you in exam prep, so don\u2019t hesitate to make an appointment.\nQuick Tips From the\u00a0Center for Mental Health Care and Resources\nPractice relaxation activities, such as progressive muscle relaxation and deep breathing, hot baths, massages, and yoga.\nTalk to friends and family who are supportive and positive influences. Isolating yourself can make things feel even worse.\nAttend to your spirituality. Go to church/synagogue/mosque, pray, read religious works.\nSelf-soothe using one or more of your senses. Watch the beauty of nature, listen to your favorite relaxing music, wear your favorite perfume, give someone a hug.\nChallenge negative self-talk. Pay attention to negative messages you may be giving yourself and challenge their validity.\nVisualize a pleasant memory, a relaxing place, an image of yourself feeling better. These can be real memories or imagined events and places. Visualize with lots of detail, using each of your senses to create as vivid an image as possible.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nSteven Gagliano\n- Communications Officer\nInstitute Communications\nEmail\nSteven.gagliano@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
