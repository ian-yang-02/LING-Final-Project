Abdallah, currently provost and executive vice president for academic affairs at the University of New Mexico, to be its new executive vice president for research (EVPR). The EVPR directs Georgia Tech\u2019s $824 million research program and is part of the Institute\u2019s four-member executive leadership team.\nAbdallah, who is a Georgia Tech alumnus with master\u2019s and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering, conducts research and teaches courses in the general area of systems theory with focus on control and communications systems. He will move into the EVPR role in mid-August, succeeding Stephen E. Cross, who is stepping down after serving as Georgia Tech\u2019s first EVPR for the past eight years.\n\u201cDr. Abdallah has a proven track record as an administrator, scholar and researcher, along with experience collaborating with industry, government and community partners,\u201d said Georgia Tech President G.P. \u201cBud\u201d Peterson. \u201cAs a Tech alumnus who has remained engaged with the Institute, he brings a unique perspective. We\u2019re looking forward to working with him to enhance Georgia Tech\u2019s basic and applied research and maximize economic impact.\u201d\nBeyond his service as provost and executive vice president for academic affairs, Abdallah is a professor in the Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) Department at the University of New Mexico. He has also served there as acting president, interim president and president, and was the first recipient of the New Mexico ECE department\u2019s Lawton-Ellis Award for combined excellence in teaching, research and student/community involvement. He has received research funding from the National Science Foundation, the Air Force Office of Scientific Research, the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory, other national laboratories and various companies.\n\u201cAfter an academic career of 30 years at the University of New Mexico, I am very excited to be joining one of the premier institutions of higher learning in the world,\u201d said Abdallah. \u201cI look forward to contributing to President Peterson's cabinet, to advocate for and lead the research enterprise at Georgia Tech, and to help \u2018create the next\u2019 in research.\u201d\nAbdallah is married to Catherine Cooper, a logistics expert who earned her bachelor\u2019s degree in industrial and systems engineering from Georgia Tech. Their twin sons, Carter and Calvin, are incoming Georgia Tech first-year students. Abdallah is fluent in English, French, and Arabic, and serves on Georgia Tech\u2019s ECE Advisory Board. Abdallah is a senior member of IEEE and a recipient of the IEEE Millennium medal.\nChristopher Jones, associate vice president for research, has agreed to serve as interim EVPR until Abdallah\u2019s arrival.\nCross plans to step down June 30 to return to his research faculty position in the Georgia Tech Research Institute (GTRI). In welcoming Abdallah, Peterson thanked Cross for his many accomplishments in leading the research program. In addition to dramatic growth in research volume, Cross led the formation of Georgia Tech\u2019s system of 11 interdisciplinary research institutes (IRIs) to coordinate research in areas of specific interest to industrial companies.\n\u201cI want to take this opportunity to thank Steve Cross, who has served us well as Georgia Tech\u2019s first EVPR,\u201d said Peterson. \u201cI am personally grateful for his leadership in the development of our 25-year strategic plan, \u2018Designing the Future.\u2019 In his EVPR role, he has worked to enhance Georgia Tech\u2019s research impact by bringing together GTRI, the Enterprise Innovation Institute, IRIs and other Institute research, encouraging collaboration, making it easier for government, business, and industry to partner with us, and building innovation neighborhoods around the campus.\u201d\nAbdallah\u2019s selection resulted from a national search led by Georgia Tech Provost Rafael L. Bras, who holds the K. Harrison Brown Family Chair.\nOverview of Georgia Tech research\nResearch News\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\n177 North Avenue\nAtlanta, Georgia\u00a0 30332-0181\u00a0 USA\nMedia Relations Contact : John Toon (404-894-6986) (jtoon@gatech.edu)\nAdditional Images\nContact\nJohn Toon\nResearch News\n(404) 894-6986\nEmail\njtoon@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
