There are also tremendous opportunities to accelerate carbon clean-up and advance sustainable ocean economies.\n\u201cA diverse approach is critical to address today\u2019s serious threats to ocean health,\u201d said\nBrian Davis , Ph.D., president and CEO of Georgia Aquarium. \u201cAs a mission-focused conservation leader, Georgia Aquarium is keen to host this multinational center that will connect innovative researchers with the resources to create and launch projects that may solve ocean-climate issues.\u201d\nIn affiliation with the Ocean Decade, run by the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC) of the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the Center\u2019s work will contribute to the UN\u2019s Sustainable Development Goals to achieve by 2030 that are a blueprint to achieve a better and more sustainable future for all.\n\u201cIn response to the need for partnership and investment in ocean science, and to help urgently mitigate the impact of climate change on the ocean, the Ocean Decade movement thanks Ocean Visions, Georgia Aquarium, and Georgia Institute of Technology for this generous support and long-term commitment,\u201d said\nJulian Barbi\u00e8re , Ocean Decade Global Coordinator and Head of the Marine Policy and Regional Coordination Section, IOC-UNESCO. \u201cSuch exemplary leadership by our Decade Collaborative Centers, spearheaded by the OV \u2013 UN DCC in the U.S.\u00a0 is an important step towards developing effective ocean-climate solutions.\u201d\nThe ocean nurtures 80% of all life on Earth. Billions of people rely on food from the ocean, and world economies depend upon it for fishing, tourism, shipping, energy and more. It is the world\u2019s largest carbon sink, vital to curbing the impacts of climate change. Healthy marine habitats defend coastal communities from intensifying storms and flooding.\n\u201cThe ocean crisis and the climate crisis are two sides of the same coin, and we cannot have a healthy ocean without resolving the climate crisis and the greenhouse gas pollution causing it,\u201d said\nBrad Ack , executive director and chief innovation officer at Ocean Visions, a nonprofit that develops solutions to complex ocean challenges.\n\u201cThis work will take bold imagination, greatly expanded innovation, and many more people from around the world engaged in this effort collectively. This new Center will give us a framework to build the innovation ecosystem we desperately need,\u201d said\nEmanuele Di Lorenzo , Ph.D., chairman and co-founder of Ocean Visions.\nThe ocean has buffered humanity from the worst effects to date of climate disruption by directly absorbing about 30 percent of humanity\u2019s carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and trapping more than 90 percent of the excess heat in the biosphere caused by CO2 pollution. However, both of these climate-buffering functions have come at a high cost \u2013 unraveling marine ecosystems and crippling the ability of the ocean to support the billions of people and other creatures dependent upon it.\nThe Ocean Visions \u2013 UN Decade Collaborative Center will work with an emerging global network of experts and collaborators associated with projects and programs to design, test and deploy viable solutions, such as Ocean Visions\u2019\nGlobal Ecosystem for Ocean Solutions ,\n1000 Ocean Startups\nand\nStride .\nFor example, one issue being solved is securing investment in ocean solutions. The Center is helping advance the development of a new open-source tool called The Ocean Impact Navigator, which consists of 30 prioritized key performance indicators (KPIs), grouped in six main impact areas. It captures effects that innovators are driving across ocean health, climate change, human wellbeing and equity.\n\u201cThis Center signals an urgent, strategic commitment to finding climate solutions,\u201d said\u00a0 Susan Lozier , Ph.D., dean of the College of Sciences and Betsy Middleton and John Clark Sutherland Chair at Georgia Tech and President of the American Geophysical Union (AGU). \u201cOcean health is also human health, and we must find effective ways to protect waters around the planet.\u201d\n\u201cAt this Center, the best and brightest minds\u2014including our researchers, staff and students\u2014will ensure that our ocean will remain vital for generations to come,\u201d added\nTim Lieuwen , Ph.D., executive director of the Strategic Energy Institute at Georgia Tech who also serves as Regents\u2019 Professor and David S. Lewis Jr. Chair in the Institute's Daniel Guggenheim School of Aerospace Engineering. \u201cThe solutions are there, and we look forward to working alongside Georgia Aquarium and Ocean Visions to find them, with the support of the Ocean Decade movement.\u201d\nFor more information about the Ocean Visions \u00ad\u00ad\u2013 UN Decade Collaborative Center for Ocean-Climate Solutions, visit the website at\noceanvisions.org/undcc/ .\n###\nAbout\nOcean Visions \u2013\nUN Decade Collaborative Center for Ocean-Climate Solutions\nThe\nOcean Visions \u2013\nUN Decade Collaborative Center for Ocean-Climate Solutions is an innovative partnership between Ocean Visions, Georgia Tech and Georgia Aquarium, with headquarters at the Aquarium in Atlanta. The Center, endorsed by the United Nations Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development, leads and supports processes to co-design, develop, test, fund and deploy scalable and equitable ocean-based solutions to reduce or reverse the effects of climate change, enhance food security and build climate-resilient marine ecosystems and coastal communities. The Center\u2019s work contributes to United Nations Sustainable Development Goals to achieve by 2030 that are a blueprint to achieve a better and more sustainable future for all.\nAbout the Ocean Decade:\nProclaimed in 2017 by the United Nations General Assembly, the UN Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development (2021-2030) (\u2018the Ocean Decade\u2019) seeks to stimulate ocean science and knowledge generation to reverse the decline of the state of the ocean system and catalyse new opportunities for sustainable development of this massive marine ecosystem. The vision of the Ocean Decade is \u2018the science we need for the ocean we want\u2019. The Ocean Decade provides a convening framework for scientists and stakeholders from diverse sectors to develop the scientific knowledge and the partnerships needed to accelerate and harness advances in ocean science to achieve a better understanding of the ocean system, and deliver science-based solutions to achieve the 2030 Agenda. The UN General Assembly mandated UNESCO\u2019s Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC) to coordinate the preparations and implementation of the Decade.\nAbout Georgia Aquarium\nGeorgia Aquarium is a leading 501(c)(3) non-profit organization located in Atlanta, Ga. that is Humane Certified by American Humane and accredited by the Alliance of Marine Mammal Parks and Aquariums and the Association of Zoos and Aquariums.
