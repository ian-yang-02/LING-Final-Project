(Photo by Allison Carter)\nNov 03, 2021\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nJerry Grillo is a lifelong communicator. He wrote for his high school newspaper, studied journalism in college, worked for years as a newspaper reporter, sportswriter, and editor, and spent another 15 years as an editor for\nGeorgia Trend\nmagazine before joining Georgia Tech as a research communications officer and writer in 2014.\n\u201cMy job is kind of like working for the community news service of an institution of tens of thousands of people with a bunch of alumni and students who are all interested in what's happening at Georgia Tech,\u201d Grillo said. \u201cSo, in many ways I have approached it the same way I did other jobs I\u2019ve had, which were community news oriented.\u201d\nHe covers stories for the Wallace H. Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering and for the office of the executive vice president for Research. He said his approach to writing is the same as his previous writing jobs in some ways, but the result and the goal are very different.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not out just covering the news,\u201d Grillo said. \u201cWe take a journalistic approach to telling our stories, both those targeting our own community here at Georgia Tech, and those stories that are about Georgia Tech that we think are interesting to a wider audience. We always hope the media finds them interesting enough so that our story about, say, Alzheimer's research will be picked up by the\nAtlanta Journal-Constitution, Science Daily , or some other news outlet.\u201d\nThe process of going live with a story isn\u2019t the same as it was when he was a magazine editor, said Grillo, who thinks of his writing for Georgia Tech as a hybrid between journalism and marketing. And what he\u2019s marketing is scientific research, so there is a real collaborative process involved in getting it right.\n\u201cI want my sources to read what I write, especially when I\u2019m talking to researchers who are working on biomolecular physics and the sort of topics that are over my head. I want to make sure I get it correct, and make sure they have a chance to review it so we have the science right,\u201d he said.\nThe most rewarding part of his work is when he puts the final touches on a story and sends it to the researchers involved for approval. He enjoys the camaraderie and the Georgia Tech environment that fosters creativity. The most challenging part of his job is \u201cgoing to school\u201d for almost every story.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a \u2018brain melting exercise,\u2019\u201d he joked. \u201cI\u2019m reshaping my brain to be a better brain each month. One week I\u2019m doing a story on a researcher creating nanocarriers to deliver RNA drugs to a brain tumor. The next week I\u2019m working on a story about how the chemistry in the liver works to process drugs,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not a scientist and was never trained as a scientist. So, that\u2019s a challenge, and it\u2019s one I welcome.\u201d\nAway From Work\nGrillo and his wife Jane have a 34-year-old daughter, Samantha, and a 20-year-old son, Joseph. Jane works for the school system as a parent mentor for the special education community and is a full-time disability advocate.\nGrillo occasionally writes freelance stories and his first book, a biography of legendary guitarist and bandleader Bruce Hampton, was released recently. It\u2019s a project that took eight years to complete.\n\u201cI took my time,\u201d he said. \u201cThe first six years were mostly interviews and information gathering.\u201d In total he interviewed 150 of Hampton\u2019s bandmates, family, friends, and fans, and quoted about 90 of them in the book.\nThe Music and Mythocracy of Col. Bruce Hampton: A Basically True Biography\n(University of Georgia Press, 2021) talks about Hampton\u2019s life and career, including how he died in 2017 \u2014 on stage at the Fox Theatre during an encore at his 70th birthday celebration. Released in April, it will debut as an audiobook in November.\n\u201cI knew Bruce well enough to know that he could hold the attention of everyone in the room, and he would tell stories accordingly. He was the classic southern storyteller,\u201d Grillo said.\nHe added that writing the book was quite a departure from his other work because it \u201crequired a lot of discipline that I typically don\u2019t have,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I\u2019m off work, I like to be off work. I hang out with my family and do other things. But this work was never-ending.\u201d\nThe experience taught Grillo that he can take a complex, meandering subject and boil it down to its essence without losing anything.\n\u201cThat seemed like the real trick,\u201d he said. \u201cAlong the way, I learned that I\u2019m a pretty good writer.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nRead More Staff Stories\nContact\nVictor Rogers\nInstitute Communications\nEmail\nvictor.rogers@comm.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
