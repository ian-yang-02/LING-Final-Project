The new unit will bring together three entities whose work underpins its mission and vision: Georgia Tech Professional Education (GTPE), the Center for Education Integrating Science, Mathematics, and Computing (CEISMC), and the Center for 21st Century Universities (C21U).\nThis launch means opportunities for new and expanded research, curricula, students, and professional support for educators at every stage \u201cfrom K to grey.\u201d\nEstablishing a new academic unit is a long process, and Tech is at the very beginning. Dean Nelson Baker and Dean Charles Isbell are leading the effort, which currently has three working groups:\nAcademic vision, research, faculty governance, and strategic planning\nBusiness model and operations\nChange management and communications\nThe Institute has engaged an external consultant, Accenture, to survey the existing state of the lifetime learning market and to provide guidance on possible benchmarks against peers and competitors inside and outside of higher education, market opportunities, and best practices of lifetime education ventures.\nIn the coming weeks, the working groups will ask members of the Georgia Tech community to contribute their knowledge and creative energy to the process. A series of listening sessions will be offered to members of CEISMC, C21U, and GTPE to provide input starting later this month. More information and a sign-up form will be provided to faculty and staff in those units in the next week. If you are outside of these units and wish to participate in the process, please fill out\nthis web form\nand you will be contacted for events in the spring. The working groups will integrate insights from the community, the consultants, and from earlier working groups into a detailed proposal for the Board of Regents and the University System of Georgia. That proposal will be submitted in early spring next year.\nThe idea of a lifetime learning unit has been in development for some time. Georgia Tech\u2019s Commission on Creating the Next in Education and its subsequent report led to the formation of an Institute Strategic Plan working group called \u201cGTPE Next,\u201d also chaired by Deans Baker and Isbell. That group made the recommendation to form the new unit.\nThe members of the lifetime learning working groups are as follows:\nAcademic Vision, Research, Faculty Governance & Strategic Planning\nCo-chaired by: Charles Isbell, Dean, College of Computing and Jonathan Clarke, Associate Professor of Finance, Scheller College of Business\nSonia Alvarez-Robinson, Executive Director of Strategic Consulting\nRichard Barke, Associate Professor, Public Policy\nJuana Cunningham, Senior Director of Strategic Consulting\nLizanne DeStefano, Executive Director, CEISMC and Professor, Psychology\nCharles Domercant, Senior Research Engineer, Georgia Tech Research Institute\nAshok Goel, Professor, Interactive Computing\nStephen Harmon, Interim Executive Director, C21U, Associate Dean of Research, GTPE, and Professor, Industrial Design\nBradley Hastings, Executive Director of Development, Colleges of Computing and Engineering\nDavid Joyner, Executive Director of Online Education & OMSCS, College of Computing\nGreg King, Associate Vice President for Economic Development, Institute Relations\nJulia Kubanek, Vice President for Interdisciplinary Research\nJ.
