Goldrush also was awarded third place in the D1A jazz division.\nGoldrush has competed in the event since 2018, but this is their first time taking home the top prize. The road to nationals began back in the fall, when the team started learning the routines and earned a bid to compete in the championship. As the months went on, the 30 dancers continued refining their moves. Team members described the Goldrush belief that every performance is a chance to prepare a bit more for nationals and to use every game and appearance as an opportunity to improve.\n\u201cEveryone has been so flexible, patient, and understanding as things were constantly changing and restrictions were being placed,\u201d said Sarah Rohlfsen, a fourth-year environmental engineering major and member of Goldrush. \u201cTo win a national championship, especially in a year where we could have easily given up and tried again when things were more \u2018normal,\u2019 has been such a gratifying experience.\u201d\nThe hip hop routine, available to watch\nhere , holds a special place in the dancers\u2019 hearts, as it has been in the works for nearly two years. The team first learned the choreography in the fall of 2019 in anticipation of being able to compete in the spring 2020 nationals competition. But the coronavirus pandemic forced the event\u2019s cancellation. The 2020-21 squad saw this as an opportunity to perfect the routine, updating some of the music and choreography with their eyes set on the 2021 competition.\n\u201cMost of our season typically consists of cheering on and supporting various athletic teams, while the work we do to prepare for our own competition really is all happening in the background,\u201d added coaches Claudia Cole and Taylor Edwards. \u201cIt's great not only seeing the team\u2019s hard work rewarded, but also being able to share that with supporters near and far.\u201d\nOutside of their competitions, Goldrush can be seen performing at every home football and men's and women's basketball game.
