HEAL will focus on applying big data analytics and artificial intelligence to large-scale medical claims databases \u2014 with a focus on medical imaging \u2014 to better understand how evolving health care delivery and payment models affect patients and providers.\n\u201cThe HEAL will provide needed research to inform the national medical imaging policy debate and develop new approaches for improving population health,\u201d said Danny R. Hughes, a Georgia Tech professor of economics and executive director of the Neiman Institute, who will lead the lab. \u201cDrawing on Georgia Tech\u2019s unparalleled strength in interdisciplinary research, the HEAL is uniquely positioned to exploit the vast stores of medical data now available to ensure we move toward a sustainable health care system.\u201d\nThe center aligns well with Georgia Tech\u2019s core research areas, said President G.P. \u201cBud\u201d Peterson.\n\u201cAt Georgia Tech, one of our fundamental missions is help solve society\u2019s most challenging questions,\u201d Peterson said. \u201cIssues of population health, cost, and access to health care are certainly among the most complicated we face. I am certain Georgia Tech\u2019s strong emphasis on data engineering and public policy will provide a firm foundation for Dr. Hughes and the HEAL team.\u201d\nThe lab will support full-time post-doctorate researchers, graduate research assistants, and affiliated Georgia Tech faculty to produce both methodological and policy-oriented research. A secondary aim of HEAL is to provide training and mentorship to radiologists interested in performing research into health economics and health policy.\nJacqueline Royster, dean of the Ivan Allen College of Liberal Arts, said the center will bring new possibilities for research and collaboration to Georgia Tech and the Neiman Institute.\n\u201cWe are excited by the opportunities HEAL will bring to both organizations,\u201d she said. \u201cThis new lab will benefit from the enormous breadth of top-notch interdisciplinary expertise across Georgia Tech and in the Ivan Allen College of Liberal Arts, from economics, public, policy, and data analysis to artificial intelligence, engineering, and computer science.\u201d\nIn addition to financial support, the Neiman Institute will provide HEAL researchers access to their extensive data resources, to include large-scale medical claims databases covering millions of U.S. residents.\n\u201cThis partnership provides a tremendous opportunity to leverage the Neiman Institute\u2019s policy expertise with the analytical capabilities of a world-class engineering institution to address the pressing problems of improving population health, increasing access to medical care, and reducing medical costs.\u201d\u00a0said Geraldine McGinty, chair of the American College of Radiology\u2019s Board of Chancellors.\nTo arrange an interview with a Neiman Institute spokesperson, contact Nichole Gay at (703) 648-1665 or\nngay@neimanhpi.org .\nAdditional Images\nContact\nMedia Contacts\nLance Wallace\n404.894.7460\nlance.wallace@comm.gatech.edu\nNichole Gay\n703.648.1665\nngay@neimanhpi.org\nEmail\nlance.wallace@comm.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
