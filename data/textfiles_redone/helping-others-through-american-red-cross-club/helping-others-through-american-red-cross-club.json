Among them is the American Red Cross Club (ARCC), which sponsors several initiatives to help communities in Atlanta and beyond. The group\u2019s major focus is on blood drives throughout the semester, and the next one will take place on March 9 in the Exhibition Hall.\nThe Red Cross is experiencing its worst blood shortage in over a decade. Coming out of the pandemic, blood donations must increase. There has been a 62% drop in college and high school drives. Fortunately, the ARCC makes it easy for students, faculty, and staff to give blood.\nMany of the club\u2019s drives are done in partnership with other student organizations for increased advertising and community building. Everyone involved, from the people donating to those volunteering, is brought closer together through this vitally important cause.\nIf you can\u2019t make it to this month\u2019s drive, the ARCC will host another on April 5-6. The club also offers many other volunteer opportunities, such as Food for Families, where participants sort, bag, and restock items at local food pantries. Transportation is provided for all outings, and the club welcomes students who are looking to help others and meet others who share that passion.\nSign up for a time slot to donate blood on March 9.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nConnor White\nInstitute Communicatinos\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
