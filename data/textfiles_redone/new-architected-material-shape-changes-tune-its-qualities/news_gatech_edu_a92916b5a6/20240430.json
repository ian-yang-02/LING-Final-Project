Or it can transition smoothly between those properties.\nArchitected materials are comprised of micron and nanoscale structures like crossbeams, arches, domes, and spirals, much like the elements of a building\u2019s architecture. Researchers from the California Institute of Technology, the Georgia Institute of Technology, and ETH Zurich have made an architected material that shifts the shapes of these structures.\nWhen a slight current is applied, nanoscale beams thicken and bend into arches that increasingly bow as the current is boosted. The material maintains the new shape even when the current is off, and the shape can be changed back by reversing the current. Both are novel characteristics.\nMost materials that are designed to change their internal structure require a persistent external stimulus to remain in the new form. The new nanomaterial deforms through an electrochemical silicon-lithium alloy reaction that holds its form without applied current.\nThe study\u2019s authors describe the material and its variable properties in detail in a\nstudy published in the journal\nNature\non Sept. 12, 2019. The research was funded by the Office of Naval Research and the National Science Foundation.\nBattery chemistry\n\u201cAt the core of this accomplishment, you\u2019re changing the geometry not by a little, which would be easy to do, but by a lot and variably, which is hard. And you\u2019re doing it by electrochemistry that works the way a battery does,\u201d said Claudio Di Leo,\nan assistant professor in the Daniel Guggenheim School of Aerospace Engineering at Georgia Tech .\nDi Leo\u2019s team modeled the architectures\u2019 nanoscale mechanics, which are driven by lithium ions and silicon, for the research, which was led by\nCaltech materials science professor Julia Greer . Her lab then created the material using an innovative ultra-high-resolution 3D printing process called\ntwo-photon lithography\nand tested it.\n[Ready for graduate school?\u00a0 Here's how to apply to Georgia Tech. ]\nArchitectures of this class of materials can be periodic \u2013 uniformly tiled or stitched like a lattice \u2013 or non-periodic, that is, a tailored knit that molds physical properties. They can also be applied creatively, as the study\u2019s first author, Caltech graduate research assistant Xiaoxing Xia, demonstrated by working structural \u201cdefects\u201d into the material. The defects formed Caltech\u2019s logo when current was applied.\n\u201cThe most intriguing part of this work to me is the critical role of defects in such dynamically responsive architected materials,\u201d Xia said.\n\u201cI have always had a particular liking for defects, and this time Xiaoxing managed to first uncover the effect of different types of defects on these metamaterials and then used them to program a particular pattern that would emerge in response to electrochemical stimulus,\u201d Greer said.\nIn the future, materials like this could make batteries and other energy storage devices lighter, safer, and more durable. Also, waves of\nphonons\n\u2013 special excitations in certain materials that help determine their conductivity \u2013 propagate through one architecture in the material, but then the shift in architecture blocks the waves. This was not the study\u2019s main achievement, but still a promising feature and possible opportunity for expanded research.\nAlso READ:\nNanohydrogel\u00a0Delivers Healing Stem Cells to Injured Elderly Muscles\nCoauthors include Caltech postdoctoral researcher Carlos Portela, as well as Arman Afshar of Georgia Tech, and Dennis M.
