Georgia Tech leads in training scientists who will direct space exploration in the 21st\u00a0century.\nOrganizers\nGeorge Tan\nchairs the organizing committee. He is a Ph.D. student of\nAmanda Stockton , in the School of Chemistry and Biochemistry. Working with Tan\nwere more than a dozen other Ph.D. students or postdoctoral researchers .\nOrganizers expect 96 attendees: 72 from the U.S. and 24 from overseas, Tan says.
