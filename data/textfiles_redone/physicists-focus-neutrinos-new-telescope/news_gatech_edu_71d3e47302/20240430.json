The effort was part of the EUSO-SPB2 collaboration, which wants to study cosmic-particle accelerators with detectors in space.\n\u201cThis was the first time our group had built an instrument for a balloon mission,\u201d Otte says. \u201cAnd the big question was if it would work at the boundary to space at -40F and in a vacuum. Even though we only flew 37 hours (of a 50-hour mission), we could show that our instrument worked as expected. We even accomplished some key measurements, like making a measurement of the background light, which no one has done before.\u201d\nThe search for neutrinos\nOtte is the second Georgia Tech physicist to lead a search for neutrinos. Professor\nIgnacio Taboada\nis the spokesperson for\nIceCube, an NSF neutrino observatory\nlocated at the South Pole. IceCube uses thousands of sensors buried in the ice to detect neutrinos.\nMeanwhile, Trinity telescopes will be especially sensitive to higher-energy neutrinos. \u201cWith Trinity, we can potentially open a new, entirely unexplored window in astronomy,\u201d Otte says. \u201cIceCube gives us a couple of good pointers on what to observe. That is also why we modified the building of the Trinity Demonstrator to point toward the only two high-energy neutrino sources\u201d already identified by IceCube scientists.\n\u2018Cherenkov lights\u2019 illuminate \u2018air showers\u2019\nThe Trinity Demonstrator telescope is not your typical astronomy telescope. Instead of looking into the sky, it is looking at the horizon, waiting for a flash of light to happen that only lasts tens of billionths of a second.\nThat flash is at the end of a chain of events that happens when a high-energy neutrino enters the Earth under a shallow angle. Upon penetrating Earth and traveling along a straight line for a hundred miles, the neutrino eventually interacts inside the Earth, producing a tau particle, which is like a short-lived massive electron.\nThe tau continues to travel through the Earth, and when it bounces out of the ground, it decays into millions of electrons and positrons, which zip through the air. Because the electrons and positrons travel faster than the speed of light in the air, they emit Cherenkov light, the short flash of light the Trinity Demonstrator telescope detects. Using computer algorithms, the recorded Cherenkov flashes are analyzed to reconstruct the energy and arrival direction of the neutrino.\nOtte and his team of Georgia Tech postdoctoral and graduate scholars developed and built the Trinity Demonstrator. Undergraduate students have also had significant responsibilities in designing its optics. \u201cIt is good for the students because they are involved in all aspects of the experiment. In big collaborations, you are an expert on one aspect only,\u201d Otte says.\nThe largest collaboration Otte is currently involved with is the\nCherenkov Telescope Array , which involves more than 2,000 researchers. That planned international project will involve 60 next-generation gamma-ray telescopes in Chile and on the Canary Island of La Palma.\nNext year, Otte says he and his researchers will apply for funding to build a much bigger telescope, which will be the foundation for the NSF 18-telescope array. For now, the team is busy observing with the Trinity Demonstrator atop Frisco Peak in Utah.\n\u201cWith a bit of luck, we will detect the first neutrino source at these energies,\u201d Otte said.\nFunding:\nNational Science Foundation (NSF)\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nIceCube Neutrinos Give Us First Glimpse Into the Inner Depths of an Active Gala\u2026\nIceCube Detects High-Energy Neutrino Emission from Milky Way\nIgnacio Taboada Elected Spokesperson for IceCube South Pole Neutrino Observatory\nJohn Wise Named Director of the Center for Relativistic Astrophysics at Georgia\u2026\nContact\nWriter: Renay San Miguel\nCommunications Officer II/Science Writer\nCollege of Sciences\n404-894-5209\nEditor: Jess Hunt-Ralston\nEmail\nrenay.san@cos.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
