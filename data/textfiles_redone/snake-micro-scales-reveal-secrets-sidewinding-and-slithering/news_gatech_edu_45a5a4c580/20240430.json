Sidewinders are pit vipers, specifically rattlesnakes, native to the deserts of the southwestern United States and adjacent Mexico.\nScientists had already described the microstructure of the skin on the ventral, or belly, surface of snakes. Many of the snakes studied, including all viper species, had distinctive rearward facing \u201cmicrospicules\u201d (micron-sized protrusions on scales) that had been interpreted in the context of reducing friction in the forward direction\u2014the direction the crawling snake\u2014and increasing friction in the backward direction to reduce slip.\nConsidered through the lens of a sidewinder\u2019s peculiar form of locomotion, however, it seemed that these microspicules would not function in the same manner. But no one had examined the microstructure of sidewinders, nor of a handful of unrelated African vipers that also sidewind.\nWorking with naturally-shed skins collected from snakes in zoos, researchers used atomic force microscopy to visualize and measure the microstructures of these scale protrusions in three species of sidewinding vipers as well as many other viper species for comparison. The results of the research, published this week in the journal\nProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , found that indeed the sidewinders have a unique structure distinct from other snakes.\nThe microspicules were absent in the African sidewinding species and reduced to tiny nubbins in the North American sidewinder. All three snakes also had distinctive crater-like micro-depressions producing a distinctive texture not seen in other snakes.\nDaniel Goldman , Dunn Family\nProfessor of Physics\nat the Georgia Institute of Technology, and\nJennifer Rieser , working as a postdoctoral researcher in Goldman\u2019s group and currently an assistant professor in the\nDepartment of Physics\nat Emory University, developed mathematical models to test how both the typical texture of rearward-directed microspicules and spicule-less cratered texture function as snakes interact with the ground. The models revealed that the microspicules would actually impede sidewinding, explaining their evolutionary loss in these species.\nThe models also revealed an unexpected result that microspicules function to improve performance of snakes that use lateral undulation to move. Lateral undulation is the typical side-to-side mode locomotion used by the majority of snake species. \u201cThis discovery adds a new dimension to our knowledge of the functionality of these structures, that is more complex than the previous ideas,\u201d said\nJoseph Mendelson , director of research at\nZoo Atlanta\nand adjunct associate professor in the Georgia Tech School of Biological Sciences.\nThe models indicate that the microspicules act a bit like corduroy fabric. \u201cFriction is low when you run your finger along the length of the furrowed fabric\u2014consistent with previous work\u2014but the furrows produce significant friction when you move your finger sideways across the fabric texture,\u201d said Goldman. The functionality of the distinct craters remains a mystery.\nThe findings could be important to the development of future generations of robots able to move across challenging surfaces such as loose sand. \u201cUnderstanding how and why this example of convergent evolution works may allow us to adapt it for our own needs, such as building robots that can move in challenging environments,\u201d Rieser said.\nIn terms of anatomy, this was a classic example of convergent evolution between a pair of snake species in Africa and a very distantly related snake in North America, Mendelson noted. Biogeographic reconstructions conducted by Jessica Tingle, a doctoral student at University of California Riverside, indicated that the African snakes are evolutionarily much older than the North American sidewinder, suggesting that the sidewinders represented an earlier phase in adaptation for sidewinding.\nTai-De Li, then at Georgia Tech in the lab of Prof Elisa Riedo and now at the City University of New York, did the AFM measurements.\nDrawing from the fields of evolutionary biology, living systems physics, and mathematical modelling, the team produced a study that explains some aspects of what these microstructures on the bellies of snakes do and how they evolved in snakes.\n\u201cOur results highlight how an integrated approach can provide quantitative predictions for structure-function relationships and insights into behavioral and evolutionary adaptions in biological systems,\u201d the authors wrote.\nThis research was supported by the Georgia Tech Elizabeth Smithgall Watts Fund; National Science Foundation Physics of Living Systems Grants PHY-1205878 and PHY-1150760; and Army Research Office Grant W911NF-11-1-0514.
