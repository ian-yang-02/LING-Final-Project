Smith Building Renewal\nRenovations include upgrades to the building\u2019s infrastructure, including strengthening compliance with the Americans With Disabilities Act by creating wheelchair access and adding an elevator, and new mechanical, electrical, and plumbing systems. A virtual lab and hoteling space will be created for the School of Public Policy. Interior demolition and abatement are underway, with the project targeting a high LEED certification. In support of our campus climate goals, electrification plans are in place, and the renovated building will no longer rely on steam from the central plant for daily operation. Renovations should be complete by mid-2025.\nEast Campus Streetscape\nRenovation of sidewalks and roadways on the east side of campus is underway to improve pedestrian and micromobility (lightweight, single-person vehicles such as bicycles, scooters, and skateboards) access while supporting the Institute\u2019s safety, connectivity, and carbon neutrality goals. Improvements to sidewalks, bicycle infrastructure, and lighting will align with paving, new curbing, and reconfigured access to Peters Parking Deck for alternative-mode routes. All updates will cohesively coordinate with the campus bus systems. Phase 1, addressing Fourth Street, Brittain Drive, and areas adjacent to Peters, is complete. Phase 2a is underway, encompassing the areas near the Third Street tunnel and adjacent sections of Techwood Drive. The project is expected to be complete by the end of 2024.\nRead more\nhere .\nFerst Drive Realignment and Cycle Track\nThis realignment, safety, and connectivity project will provide bicycle infrastructure and safety improvements via separation of bikes, pedestrians, vehicles, and buses at the bus stops. Phase 1 of the cycle track installation is underway along Ferst Drive near the CRC field to Atlantic Drive. Phase 2 will include installation of the cycle track from Atlantic Drive through Fowler Street.
