Good ideas must go hand-in-hand with good execution plans to disrupt it.\u201d\nRoper (Physics 2001, M.S. Physics 2002) spent 16 years in various defense-related positions, most recently as former assistant secretary of the U.S. Air Force for acquisition, technology, and logistics. In addition to his work in the\u00a0 Nunn School , where he focuses on mentoring students and continuing to shape the discussion at the intersection of international security and technology, he now serves on the boards of several businesses, including technology firms, and as an Honorary Group Captain in the U.K. Royal Air Force.\nDuring his time at the Pentagon, Roper helped develop cutting-edge military technology for the United States \u2014 from hypersonic weapons to the first artificial intelligence co-pilot. While working as the Air Force\u2019s and Space Force\u2019s top weapons buyer, he forged closer ties with Silicon Valley, placing more than 2,300 venture-backed companies on defense contracts. He also championed digital transformation technology to speed up innovation, crediting such technology with helping produce and fly the first \u201c6th-generation fighter\u201d flight demonstrator years ahead of schedule.\nOther members\u00a0 joining the board \u00a0along with Roper include Adm. Michael Mullen, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; former U.S. Rep. Mac Thornberry \u2014 a former chair of the Armed Services Committee; former CIA official Susan Gordon; and LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman. Businessman and former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg chairs the committee.\nThe board\u00a0 recently met \u00a0with Defense Department officials, including Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, who tasked the panel to work on accelerating experimentation and technology adoption, strengthening private-sector ties, focusing on the \u201cinnovation workforce,\u201d and advising on the National Defense Science and Technology Strategy.\nRoper is one of several current or former Nunn School faculty to hold defense-related positions. In May, President Joe Biden appointed Roper\u2019s colleague,\u00a0 Adm. James \u201cSandy\u201d Winnefeld , to the President\u2019s Intelligence Advisory Board. Early in his administration, Biden also tapped then Distinguished Professor of the Practice Elizabeth Sherwood-Randall to serve as his homeland security advisor.\nAdditionally, several faculty members, including former NATO commander\u00a0 Gen. Philip Breedlove , former Defense Department officials\u00a0 Mich\u00e8le Flournoy \u00a0and\u00a0 Robert Bell, \u00a0and\u00a0 Lawrence R. Rubin \u00a0and\u00a0 Margaret E. Kosal \u00a0\u2014 associate professors in the Nunn School \u2014 previously served in defense-related posts.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nMichael Pearson\nIvan Allen\u00a0College of Liberal Arts\nmichael.pearson@iac.gatech.edu\nEmail\nmichael.pearson@iac.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
