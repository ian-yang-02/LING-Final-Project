Though rain inhibited some events from happening on the first well-being day last week, this week holds a second opportunity to rest, recharge, and relax.\nMost events are open to all students, faculty, and staff, who are encouraged to get tested through the\ncampus Covid-19 testing program\nbefore and after they participate in events.\nInstructors have been asked to not schedule assignments during or immediately following these wellness days to give students a chance to recharge. And, staff are also being encouraged to prioritize wellness on these days, whether that\u2019s by incorporating exercise into their day or clearing nonessential meetings to allow for more focused mental activity.\nHuman Resources offers more suggestions for prioritizing well-being .\nSchedule of Events\n( View full event details and updates )\nTuesday, March 23:\nWell-being Weekly: TEDx Talk Tuesday\n11 a.m. \u2013 noon\nEach Tuesday, Health Initiatives hosts this event featuring a TED talk viewing and follow-up discussion.\nRegister to attend .\nScience Jazz Hands\n8 \u2013 10 p.m.\nGeorgia Tech\u2019s scientist comedians Lew Lefton and Pete Ludovice will share comedic bits about research as part of the Atlanta Science Festival.
