Meanwhile, scientists are evaluating the storm itself and reflecting on how it fits into the larger landscape of weather events.\nParts of California\nreceived 10 to 15 inches of rainfall in a day\n\u2014 the amount they might usually get in a season. Many areas experienced mudslides, landslides, flooding, power outages, and other issues.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not uncommon to see increased precipitation during the winter in California,\u201d said\nZachary Handlos , senior academic professional in the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences. \u201cThe problem is when it\u2019s too much at once, which is exactly what happened.\u201d\nAn atmospheric river, as it is called, is a weather phenomenon that transports water moisture from the ocean toward land areas following relatively narrow paths. As\nAnnalisa Bracco\nsaid, most of these are harmless and useful. In an El Ni\u00f1o year, though, the ocean is warmer than usual, and more moisture is carried in the atmosphere.\n\u201cIs this event exceptional? Yes and no. It is not the strongest recorded, but it\u2019s up there among the very strong,\u201d said Bracco, professor and associate chair for research in the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences. \u201cThe problem is that global warming is poised to make strong atmospheric rivers more common. Warming tends also to make the atmosphere more stable, which implies that weather systems evolve more slowly. And this atmospheric river indeed moved slowly, causing more damage.\u201d\nThough California\u2019s geography is somewhat unusual in having atmospheric rivers, other areas experience them as well. Handlos noted that, though the terminology is not used as often, a similar effect can take place with southwesterly winds from the Gulf of Mexico toward the Atlanta area when impacted by weather systems.\nBoth Bracco and Handlos cautioned against attributing a single event to climate change too quickly but said that the California storm has all the markings of one that was more intense because of warming. \u201cIt is in line with all global warming predictions: more extreme weather events, conducive to both floods and droughts.\"\nAs recovery efforts begin, Handlos noted that this storm was very much in line with forecasts. But even with preparations, damage can be severe.\n\u201cThe good news is that it wasn't some sort of day-before surprise, but even with excellent forecasting, you can only do so much to prepare for landslides and flooding,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are still going to be unfortunate consequences for people in the area, even with preparations.\u201d\nHe expects climatologists will look at the data from this event soon, and for several years to come.\nRelated links\nGeorgia Tech School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences\nAbout Annalisa Bracco\nAbout Zachary Handlos\nContact\nKristen Bailey\nInstitute Communications\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
