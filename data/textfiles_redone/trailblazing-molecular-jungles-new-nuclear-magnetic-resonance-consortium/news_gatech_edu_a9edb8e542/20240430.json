The consortium has been operating since July 2018.\nCrab pee\nTake, for example,\ncrab urine . It\u2019s packed with hundreds to thousands of varying metabolites, and researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology wanted to nail down one or two of them that triggered a widespread crab behavior. Without access to NMR they may not have found them at all even after an extensive search.\nThe spectrometer pulled the right two needles out of the haystack, so the researchers could test them on the crabs and confirm that they were initiating the behavior.\nEmory University, Georgia State University and Georgia Tech already have NMR technology, but the\nAtlanta NMR Consortium\nwill enable them to fully exploit it while cost-effectively staying on top of upgrades.\n\u201cNMR continues to grow and develop because of technological advances,\u201d said\u00a0 David Lynn , a chemistry professor at Emory University.\nThat means buying new machines every so often, and one new NMR spectrometer can run into the millions; annual maintenance for one machine can cost tens of thousands of dollars. Thus, reducing costs and maximizing usage makes good sense.\nMedicine, geochemistry\nThe human body, sea-side estuaries, and rock strata present huge collections of compounds. NMR takes inventory of complex samples from such sources via the nuclei of atoms in the molecules.\nA nucleus has a spin, which makes it magnetic, and NMR spectrometry\u2019s own powerful magnetism detects spins and pinpoints nuclei to feel out whole molecules. These can be large or small, from mineral compounds with three or four component atoms to protein polymers with tens of thousands of parts.\nResearchers in medicine, biochemistry, ecology, geology, food science \u2013 the possible list is exhaustive -- turn to NMR to untangle their particular molecular jungles. The consortium wants to leverage that diversity.\n\u201cAs we go in different directions, we will benefit from a cohesive community of people who know how to use NMR for a wide range of problems,\u201d said\u00a0 Anant Paravastu , an associate professor in Georgia Tech\u2019s School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering.\n\u201cThe most important goal for us is the sharing of our expertise,\u201d said\u00a0 Markus Germann , a professor of chemistry at Georgia State.\nConsortium members will benefit the most from the pooled NMR resources, but\nnon-partners can also book access .
