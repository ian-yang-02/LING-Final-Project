At the Georgia Institute of Technology, bioscience researchers are burning the midnight oil to produce key components for tests in the state of Georgia.\nThe goal is to supply a broad\u00a0 initiative by the governor\u2019s office \u00a0involving multiple universities and partners to rapidly produce and administer more tests. At least 35 volunteers at Georgia Tech, while adhering to social distancing, are reorienting labs normally used for scientific discovery to do larger-scale production of biochemical components.\n\u201cWe are inventing new ways of doing things like an electronic buddy system so people can be alone \u2013 but not alone \u2013 while they work in the lab. The technical part is actually the easiest. The logistics of testing, data security, and regulatory considerations \u2013 those things are more challenging,\u201d said Loren Williams, a\u00a0 professor in Georgia Tech\u2019s School of Chemistry and Biochemistry .\nWilliams and the researchers are supporting Georgia Governor Brian Kemp\u2019s COVID-19 State Lab Surge Capacity Task Force, which is a project managed through the Georgia Tech Research Institute (GTRI). GTRI is also leading the coordination and integration of data management across the lab surge effort.\n\u201cWe are providing technical and project management of the effort which is focused on increasing the state\u2019s ability to expand testing beyond current limitations,\u201d said Mike Shannon, GTRI\u2019s lead in the project and a principal research engineer at GTRI.\nExoplanets and coronavirus\nThe science behind coronavirus testing is complementary to the researchers\u2019 usual work. That includes understanding proteins associated with glaucoma, figuring out how RNA and DNA evolved in the first place, or whether ribosomes \u2013 lumps of RNA and protein key to translating\u00a0genetic code into life \u2013 may exist on exoplanets.\nWilliams\u2019 research team studies the last topic, and some of their work is related to the core of coronavirus testing, a chemical reaction that amplifies the virus\u2019 genetic fingerprint. It is called a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and it transcribes trace amounts of coronavirus\u2019 RNA code into ample amounts of corresponding DNA in the lab for easy analysis.\n\u201cHis lab members are very familiar with RT-PCR, and when the lack of tests became apparent, they swung into action. The group grew from there, based on the technical needs for the project,\u201d said Raquel Lieberman, another leading scientist in the effort and also a\u00a0 professor in Georgia Tech\u2019s School of Chemistry and Biochemistry .\n\u201cEvery day, very talented, hardworking people with perfect skill sets come out of the woodwork and ask to help,\u201d Williams said.\nThe group has teams that engineer the production of enzymes or other chemicals needed for RT-PCR to work: Two central enzymes are reverse transcriptase, which converts RNA to DNA and\u00a0 Taq \u00a0polymerase , which rapidly replicates DNA. Another important component is ribonuclease inhibitor, which slows coronavirus RNA decay.\nGlobal COVID allies\nOther researchers develop processes for mass production or implementation of COVID-19 safety procedures; the list goes on. Some colleagues telework; others work in labs but spaced far from each other while they wear masks.\n\u201cThe group is planning to produce enough enzyme components for hundreds of tests per day,\u201d said Vinayah Agarwal,\u00a0 an assistant professor in Georgia Tech\u2019s School of Chemistry and Biochemistry and School of Biological Sciences . \u201cUsing these components, we will also build cheaper and more robust testing kits going forward.\u201d\nInstructions already exist for some of the ingredients for the test, but they are not readily available because the rights to them are exclusive.\n\u201cIntellectual property and other proprietary issues hinder our effort,\u201d Lieberman said. \u201cBut we have received help from scientists all over the world to piece together protocols on how to make what we need.\u201d\nThe state wants to increase current testing capacities by 3,000 more tests per day. The task force also includes teams from Augusta University Health System, Georgia State University, Emory University, University of Georgia, and the Georgia Public Health Laboratory. The task force lead is Captain Kevin Caspary who is with the Georgia National Guard.\nRaw footage and images as press handouts for journalists.
