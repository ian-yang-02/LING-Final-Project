It can affect both individuals and larger networks utilized by entire companies.\nMany individuals opt to pay the ransom, but both Smoak and Downing recommend the opposite. Paying, they said, encourages more of this type of malware and, in addition, the user may not get their files back.\n\u201cRansomware authors want to give their victims\u00a0incentive to pay. This is their business model,\u201d said Downing, who is in his third year pursuing his Ph.D. in Computer Science.\n\u201cThey want to be able to be reliable and trustworthy to decrypt their victims' files so that word will spread to other victims\u00a0that they should just simply\u00a0pay the ransom to get their data back. If the ransomware actors did not do this, then they wouldn't be giving their victims any incentive to pay the ransom. The victims\u00a0would just simply wipe their hard drives,\u00a0reinstall their operating systems, and continue about their day.\"\nDowning, a self-described \"unrealistic\u00a0conservative\"\u00a0when it comes to the safety of online networks, said the decision whether to pay or not all comes down to a personal cost-benefit analysis.\n\u201cYou want to decide what you\u2019re willing to pay for, literally and figuratively,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat data can your business stand to lose? How quickly can your business recover from losing this data? How much money will an attack cost your company from\u00a0the lack of the\u00a0service your company provides? Is this all worth the risk of paying the ransom and possibly not getting your data back?\u201d\nDowning warns that regardless of your personal decision, it is never wise to pay the ransom.\n\u201cEither you get your data back and you've\u00a0aided a criminal financially, encouraging them to continue attacking others, or worse, you don't get your data back at all and you've still financially aided the criminal,\u201d Downing said. \u201cThere's an obvious common denominator here.\"\nBoth Smoak and Downing recommended a few things to prevent against such an attack in the future. Aside from an extreme solution\u00a0(simply utilizing old, unconnected technology), they advised frequent backups of data and avoiding continual connection of backup volumes, training users on use of email and visiting\u00a0websites, and classifying data according to its importance (giving backup\u00a0priority\u00a0to the most vital information).\nGeorgia Tech\u2019s\nInstitute for Information Security and Privacy presents the Cyber Security Summit\nannually.
