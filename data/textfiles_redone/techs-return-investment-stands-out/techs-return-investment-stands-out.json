The project, which provides national employment outcomes for USG graduates that has been published on the\nPSEO Explorer website , indicates that Georgia Tech stands out as a particularly advantageous financial decision. Georgia Tech had the highest earnings of all USG colleges for baccalaureate graduates at one ($43,579), five ($61,200), and 10 years ($74,633) after graduation.\n\u201cWe are proud that Tech consistently provides an excellent return on investment for our students and their families,\u201d said President \u00c1ngel Cabrera. \u201cThe returns are equally valuable for the economy of the state, as many of our talented students begin their careers in Georgia. In fact, 54% of our baccalaureate graduates still work in the state five years after graduating.\u201d\nComputer and information services graduates had the highest average salaries at $73,936 one year after graduation, $94,314 five years after graduation, and $124,663 10 years after graduation.\nGeorgia Tech also rose to the top in the ROI realm in February when Georgetown University shared\ndata\nfrom the College Scorecard on 4,500 colleges and universities to compare net present value (NPV). The NPV calculation considers costs, future salaries, investing, and earning a specific amount of money. Tech ranked highest among public universities in Georgia for 20-year NPV, at $958,000, and it ranked No. 20 at the 20-year mark out of all 4,500 schools listed, placing it solidly as one of the best choices for NPV in the country.\nPayScale.com also\nranks\nTech as No. 1 in Georgia and No. 13 among all U.S. colleges for providing the best 20-year return on investment. In 2020, the average starting salary for a Georgia Tech graduate was $75,000, compared to the national average of $55,200.\n\u201cWe are fortunate to find ourselves growing, hitting records in both enrollment and applications,\u201d said Cabrera. \u201cThanks to state investments, enrollment growth and fiscal prudence, we are able to offer a growing number of excellent students an affordable education with one of the best values in higher education.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nContact\nmediarelations@comm.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
