But it turns out that being too emotive in a pitch can make investors feel manipulated and dissuade them from giving money.\nThis finding comes from the latest research out of the Georgia Institute of Technology\u2019s\nScheller College of Business . Researchers interviewed investors and then conducted an experiment with crowdfunding platforms to determine which pitches were successful.\n\u201cThey don't trust the displayed enthusiasm or passion by entrepreneurs,\u201d said\nDong Liu , a professor of organizational behavior at Georgia Tech.\nInstead, entrepreneurs with expertise in their area and demonstrated competence were more likely to receive funding. Once expertise and competence are evident, entrepreneurs can effectively use enthusiasm to win over investors.\nThe researchers presented these conclusions in \u201c The More Enthusiastic, the Better? Unveiling a Negative Pathway From Entrepreneurs\u2019 Displayed Enthusiasm to Funders\u2019 Funding Intentions \u201d in the journal\nEntrepreneurship Theory and Practice.\nPitch Breakdown\nAlthough research conventionally suggests that enthusiastic entrepreneurs engage investors, in interviews, investors said they often see emotional pitches as impression management, or trying to create a positive impression on an audience.\n\u201cWhen people feel your behaviors are triggered by impression management motives, they feel you are not reputable and what you\u2019re proposing isn\u2019t rigorous,\u201d Liu said. \u201cSo, they really doubt the value of your presentation.\u201d\nTo test if this was the general opinion of investors, the researchers surveyed 1,811 potential investors looking at a random sample of 182 videos on the popular crowdfunding website, Kickstarter. The site is an ideal testbed because most participants don\u2019t know each other, making the pitch video their main interaction. About 10 participants viewed each video.\nThe researchers eliminated bias by running a second study with 273 random participants and hired an actor to give the same pitch with and without enthusiasm (as determined by facial expression, body language, tone of voice, and vocal pitch). Before watching the video, the researchers offered participants different background information on the entrepreneur, either indicating they had a lot of experience or none in the area they were pitching.\nParticipants in both studies were asked if they would fund it or buy the advertised product using a seven-point Likert scale from \u201cvery unlikely\u201d to \u201cvery likely.\u201d Finally, they were asked about their general impressions of the entrepreneur\u2019s enthusiasm, expertise, and their projects using a similar Likert scale.\nPitch Perfect\nThe findings showed that enthusiasm is a double-edged sword. Strong emotions can appear manipulative when an entrepreneur seems inexperienced.\n\u201cFunders are more likely to be positively influenced by entrepreneurs\u2019 enthusiasm when they saw those entrepreneurs are actually very capable of completing the project and have a strong expertise in the field,\u201d Liu said.\nThe researchers believe these findings could also apply to job interviews and plan to study that next. For now, Liu shares the research with his students.\n\u201cIt's definitely good to show enthusiasm, but don't forget, at the beginning of their presentation, they need to show their expertise,\u201d he said. \u201cOtherwise, their passion and excitement about the job may even backfire.\u201d\nCITATION: Jiang, L., Yin, D., Liu, D., & Johnson, R.
