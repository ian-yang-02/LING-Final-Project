An event concept developed by The Brookings Institution and The Rockefeller Foundation, 17 Rooms convenes 17 distinct groups of specialists to identify, in concert, high-impact objectives that can be met in 18 months to advance the SDGs.\nFollowing the event last October, the 17 Rooms Planning Committee \u2014 aided by more than 20 student, faculty, and staff volunteers representing all 17 discussions \u2014 worked to identify key takeaways from the event. They then synthesized these takeaways into recommendations that link research, teaching, operations, and partnerships while aligning with priorities in the Institute's new strategic plan.\nBetween October 2020 and January 2021, the Committee reviewed and refined those recommendations into the following six recommended actions to be implemented over the next 18 months:\n1. Strengthen External Partnerships and Regional Collaborations\n2. Integrate the SDGs into the Curriculum\n3. Lead by Example\n4. Engage Students in Institute Planning\n5. Enhance Student Well-Being\n6. Advance SDG Research\nRead the full report\nfor detailed descriptions of all six recommended actions, steps proposed to advance them, their connections with the SDGs and the Institute's new strategic plan, and estimates of the resources required to achieve them.\nSince launching in Fall 2020,\nGeorgia Tech\u2019s long-term sustainability initiative\nhas hosted events, designed courses, and engaged the greater campus community to introduce the SDGs, discuss their global importance and relevance to Tech, and demonstrate how the Institute can lead the region in implementing and advancing them.\nAdditional Images\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
