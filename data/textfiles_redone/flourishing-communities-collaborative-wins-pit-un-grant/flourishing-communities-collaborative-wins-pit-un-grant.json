The proposal,\u00a0 Westside Neighborhood \u2013 English Avenue: Building a Sustainable Community through Design and Technology \u00a0received the highest PIT-UN award at Georgia Tech this year.\n\u201cWe have seen what happens when technology that is meant for mass scale audiences, communities, or public citizens of a region, state, or country is designed without their input or considerations for how it might affect them or society at large,\u201d said\u00a0 Anne-Marie Slaughter , CEO of New America.\n\u201cNew America\u2019s Public Interest Technology University Network (PIT-UN) was designed to turn that dynamic on its head by making sure that those most proximate to problems are directly present in the crafting of solutions and empowered to do so from an early age. We\u2019re excited to support a new group of grantees that are catalyzing public interest technology on their campus,\u201d Slaughter said.\nFlourishing Communities Collaborative At Work\nFor several months, Kim, her fellow faculty, and their undergraduate and graduate students have leveraged Georgia Tech resources to address critical problems in Atlanta\u2019s Westside neighborhood.\n\u201cThat\u2019s why this grant is so special,\u201d Kim said. \u201cWe\u2019re working hand in hand with the community. We\u2019re providing them with specific tools that allow them to understand how to use design thinking to solve their problems.\u201d\n\"In this specific circumstance, design thinking is the space of improvisation to address complex problems and to expand the scope of design outside the traditional architectural design studio,\" she said.\nThe Flourishing Communities Collaborative began working in Westside last summer with a goal of offering strategies and choices for current residents that help stabilize their community. Along with extensive field research and getting to know pillars in the community, Kim\u2019s group focused on critical opportunities in the neighborhood.\n\u201cThe need in this neighborhood is great,\u201d Kim said. \u201cJust looking at the figures is eye opening. Nearly 80% of the households in this community earn less than the median Atlanta household. Forty-four percent of the housing is vacant. Neighborhood concerns include mounting pressures from external developments and hydrology challenges exacerbated by climate change. Yet, the neighborhood is poised for change through the Westside Land Use Framework Plan (2017), already approved by the community and the city. So, that\u2019s where we start, by building on momentum already in place to set positive steps forward to stabilize the community while also bolstering retention.\u201d\nThe neighborhood lacks safe places like libraries, conveniences like food markets, and places for people to gather.\n\u201cWhen we were out on the site last Friday, my students saw a woman who was sitting at a bus stop. So they asked her about her thoughts on the community, and which bus she was waiting for. The woman told them she wasn\u2019t waiting for a bus; she was sitting there because her friend was getting their hair cut in the nearby barber shop and there wasn\u2019t anywhere else to sit.\u201d\nDesign Thinking and Technology\nThe PIT-UN grant allows Kim (the project\u2019s principal investigator) and her colleagues to focus on community engagement and social outreach through the lens of technology. Kim said the Flourishing Communities Collaborative would leverage co-PI\u00a0 Tarek Rakha\u2019s \u00a0research and expertise in\u00a0 high performance building , as well as co-PI\u00a0 Danielle Willkens\u2019 \u00a0work using 3D documentation technologies (e.g. LiDAR, UAVs) alongside community outreach and service-learning projects.\n\u201cThe technology might play out as some innovative kind of fabrication or construction methods,\u201d she said, \u201cor we could look at leveraging the neighborhood\u2019s finite resources and develop a strategy for repurposing and reusing.\u201d These technological possibilities are driven by design thinking, Kim said.\n\u201cWhen you think about technology, you can say that it\u2019s ubiquitous. It\u2019s all around us, all the time. But it\u2019s not equally accessible across all communities.\u201d\nSmart-home and smart-city technologies like photo voltaic panels and other energy saving strategies can have high initial price tags, even if they pay for themselves in the long run, Kim said. But for a family like those in the Westside neighborhood, an unexpected increase in their electric bill could mean choosing between a week\u2019s worth of groceries or paying the higher bill.\nThe challenge in Westside isn\u2019t just to save money, though. As the name of Kim\u2019s lab implies, her team is trying to find ways to help Westside flourish. A community needs four things to flourish, she said: housing, education, healthcare, and jobs.\nKim, Rakha, and Wilkens will propose actionable and affordable housing strategies, suggest new, community-related businesses and jobs that in turn generate local expertise, and research ways to close service gaps.\n\u201cI\u2019ve always thought of the Flourishing Communities Collaborative as similar to a teaching hospital, where you have students working alongside faculty and professionals, just the same way you have residents working alongside attending physicians,\u201d Kim said.\n\u201cUltimately we look at empowering through design, through optimistic acts of making and thinking. One of our beliefs is that good design is a human right; it should be accessible to all. And it makes perfect sense for Georgia Tech to be a part of good design, because our motto is \u2018Progress and service for all\u2019.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nContact\nAnn Hoevel\nDirector of Communications\nGeorgia Tech College of Design\nEmail\nann.hoevel@design.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
