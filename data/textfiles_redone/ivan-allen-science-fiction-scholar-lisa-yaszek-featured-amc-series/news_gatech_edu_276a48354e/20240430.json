(Credit: Rob Felt, Georgia Tech)\nApr 27, 2018\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nGeorgia Institute of Technology science fiction scholar Lisa Yaszek will be featured on the upcoming AMC program,\u00a0 James Cameron\u2019s Story of Science Fiction\u00a0 \u2014 a new series from the director of science fiction \u00a0blockbusters such as\u00a0 Avatar , \u00a0Alien , and \u00a0The Terminator.\nThe six-part series, which airs Mondays at 10 p.m. ET, explores the \u201cevolution of science fiction from its cult beginnings in pulp to the engine for blockbuster film and television success it is today,\u201d according to the network.\n\u201cI think people are going to learn a lot from this, and I think they will be entertained,\u201d said Yaszek, a professor of science fiction studies in the\u00a0 School of Literature, Media, and Communication . She researches and teaches science fiction as a global language crossing centuries, continents, and cultures.\nYaszek \u00a0said she was surprised to get the call from producers seeking to interview her about appearing on the show. Fellow academics, and a former student, recommended her for the role, she said.\nShe ended up filming interviews for all six episodes. The episodes each focus on a distinct theme: aliens, time travel, outer space, dystopian futures, monsters, and finally, robots, cyborgs and other \u201cintelligent machines.\u201d\nYaszek also wrote a chapter for a companion book to the series, also titled\u00a0 James Cameron\u2019s Story of Science Fiction.\nThe book includes the full versions of interviews Cameron conducted for the series, bonus materials from Cameron\u2019s archives, and\u00a0essays corresponding to the main themes around which the show is organized.\n\u201cThe book publishers reached out to me and asked me to write the time travel chapter after watching the first cut of the series,\u201d Yaszek said. \u201cIt was a challenging but fun task that involved balancing what was covered in the show with a carefully curated selection of other important science fiction time-travel texts across media \u2014 and believe me, there are a lot!\u201d\nYaszek, who is particularly interested in issues of gender, race, and science and technology in science fiction, has written several books, including\u00a0 Sisters of Tomorrow: The First Women of Science Fiction ,\u00a0 Galactic Suburbia: Recovering Women\u2019s Science Fiction ,\u00a0 and The Self Wired: Technology and Subjectivity in Contemporary Narrative.\nShe said the team involved in the production seemed extraordinarily well-informed about science fiction\u2019s past, present, and future.\nHer first interview with the team, in April 2017, lasted two hours. The discussion went deep into science fiction topics and allowed the producers to decide if Yaszek would be relatable to a mass audience.\n\u201cIt was sort of like taking your graduate school comprehensive exams all over again,\u201d she said.\nShe apparently passed, because they flew her out to Los Angeles a month later to film her part in the first three episodes.\n\u201cThe first day was supposed to be a three-hour shoot, but we were there for six or seven hours,\u201d she said.\nShe later filmed three segments in New York for three additional episodes.\nIt was the first time filming a television series for Yaszek, who is often quoted in the news on topics related to science fiction literature, her area of expertise as a professor at Georgia Tech\u2019s\u00a0 Ivan Allen College of Liberal Arts.\n\u201cIt was fascinating to work with visual media creatives,\u201d Yaszek said. \u201cScience fiction scholars tend to approach the genre intellectually, asking questions like, \u2018How does this author contribute to ongoing public debates about some aspect of science or technology, and what techniques do they use to make that contribution?\u2019 Creative professionals working in film and TV tend to approach science fiction from an emotional context, asking, \u2018How would it feel to have this scientific or technological experience? What\u2019s the human angle here, and what techniques can I use to convey that?\u2019\u201d\nShe will appear in segments sandwiched between discussions featuring Cameron and science fiction luminaries such as George Lucas and Steven Spielberg.\nFor more information about the series, go to\u00a0 AMC\u2019s website .\nAdditional Images\nContact\nRebecca Keane\nDirector of Communications\nrebecca.keane@iac.gatech.edu\n404.894.1720\nEmail\nrebecca.keane@iac.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
