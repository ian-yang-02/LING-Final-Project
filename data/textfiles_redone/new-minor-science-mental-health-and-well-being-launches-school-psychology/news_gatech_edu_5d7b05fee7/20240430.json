The same can be said about mental health.\n\u201c The concept of mental health is a euphemism,\u201d explains\nTiffiny Hughes-Troutman , a professor of practice in the\nSchool of Psychology\nand a licensed psychologist. \u201cOften people use the term \u2018mental health\u2019 as a catch-all phrase when they're really talking about mental\nillness . But mental illness and mental health are actually discrete and dichotomous terms. Good health is indicated by positive emotions and productive functioning, not just the absence of illness.\u201d\nWith a new minor in the\nScience of Mental Health and Well-Being\nin the School of Psychology, Hughes-Troutman is hoping to balance the conversation .\nLaunching this fall, the minor will work to give students practical tools to build mental wellness and gain the ability to conceptualize mental health, well-being, and other constructs firmly grounded in neuroscience.\n\u201cIt\u2019s critical that we create a psychologically safe atmosphere in the classroom, the lab, and other spaces so that students have opportunities to connect with others and build resilience and other key skills,\u201d says Hughes-Troutman. \u201cI view this new minor as a really great opportunity not only to infuse content about health and well-being into the curriculum for students, but also, it\u2019s a pivotal step that students can take to foster a greater sense of health and well-being for themselves. Through this minor, we aim to help students cope with pressures and stress, and ensure that they understand the relation between increased well-being, higher productivity, enhanced learning, and a stronger sense of connectedness and purpose.\u201d\n\u201cAs we aim to instill students with a wide range of fundamental knowledge and skills that can benefit them throughout their lives,\u201d says\nTansu Celikel , professor and chair in the School of Psychology, \u201cthis minor will be of interest to all students across the Institute.\u201d\nExploring the link between brain, behavior, and mental health and well-being\nCultivating well-being\nis a key component of Georgia Tech\u2019s\nstrategic plan . With courses like\nFlourishing: Strategies for Well-Being and Resilience\n(APPH 1060) and\nResilience Building Strategies\n4801/8801 , bringing wellness into the curriculum has been a vital step toward that goal across the Institute.\n\u201cWe have excellent courses that span topics fundamental to human well-being offered on campus, and this new minor gives students another option on a rich menu,\u201d said Hughes-Troutman. \u201cUnique elements of this minor include a focus on the distinct psychological processes and neural mechanisms of well-being. Psychological science plays a distinct role in improving the human condition for individuals and communities on many levels; students who take our courses will be exposed to the latest research and practice innovations.\u201d\nThe minor will debut\nNeuroscience of Mental Health: Research and Practice\n(PSYC 3803), a new course co-taught by Celikel and Hughes-Troutman. In the course, Hughes-Troutman says, \u201cwe're taking a deep dive into what happens in the brain, practical applications to enhance well-being, and other ways that students can increase positive affective states such as joy and happiness while minimizing stress.\u201d\nThat course will be linked with a Vertically Integrated Project (VIP) team led by Celikel and Hughes-Troutman that will give students hands-on experience assessing and building mental health and wellness. \u201cWell-Being VIP students will work with students in the class using survey and biosensing data to give them accurate data and monitoring of their mental health,\u201d says Hughes-Troutman. \u201cThey\u2019ll use apps and other e-tools to measure their levels of mindfulness, help them meditate, and reach their goals related to focus, attention, and relaxation. By the end of the class, students will have developed a portfolio that allows them to reflect upon and document a cadre of skills and experiences.\u201d\nStudents in the minor will also choose 12 credits of\nother courses\noffered as part of the program, including\nScience of Stress, Anxiety, and Happiness\n(PSYC 3000),\nMindfulness: Science and Practice\n(PSYC 3005),\nHealth Psychology\n(PSYC 3009), and many more exploring the neuroscience and psychology of mental health.\n\u201cThe Science of Mental Health and Well-Being curriculum highlights the importance of a comprehensive approach that considers both psychological and neurological factors maintaining mental well-being,\u201d adds Celikel, the School of Psychology chair. \u201cA deeper appreciation for the complexities of mental health conditions and their underlying mechanisms will help to reduce stigma and drive research and innovation in the field.\u201d\nThe minor is open to all students across Georgia Tech, though Hughes-Troutman and Celikel are hopeful that psychology, neuroscience, and pre-health students will take particular interest in the program.\n\u201cWhen I think about students going to medical school or entering clinical programs in particular, there is a need to take an inclusive and holistic approach to health so that they can attend to the mind, body, and spirit of their clients and patients,\u201d says Hughes-Troutman. \u201cSo many medical models ignore the concept of wellness when solely focusing on eradicating illness and this can lead to an unfortunate disconnect.\u201d\n\u201cThese are skills that pre-health, public health, counseling, and clinical students are going to learn very early,\u201d she says. \u201cI think that will augment their education and their future careers as they provide excellent care to clients and patients as well as help themselves.\u201d\n\u201cThe degree to which we can provide education about health and well-being,\u201d Hughes-Troutman adds, \u201cthat we can get students excited about those concepts, and that we can contribute to the greater good of our community at Georgia Tech so students are equipped with the skills to help themselves and others \u2014 it's just fantastic.\u201d\nThe minor is officially launching this fall and is currently accepting enrollment.
