The disease is often overlooked, but commercially available app-based technology now makes early detection easier, allowing for proactive treatment.\nThe lymphedema monitoring technology originated through research at the Georgia Institute of Technology and was further developed for market by the company LymphaTech, which also emerged from Georgia Tech. Now,\u00a0 a new study \u00a0has benchmarked the technology, finding that it effectively detects early arm swelling associated with\u00a0 lymphedema \u00a0in breast cancer patients.\nThe detection technology is intended to improve not only patients\u2019 physical health but also their peace of mind and finances.\nSevere depression\n\u201cThe most immediate awful consequence of lymphedema is seen in mental health. Severe depression is very high,\u201d said Brandon Dixon, who co-led the study and is an\u00a0 associate professor in Georgia Tech\u2019s George W. Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering . \u201cIf you detect it early, managing it could cost as little as $2,500 in a patient\u2019s lifetime. If you catch it too late, the costs can rise as high as $200,000.\u201d\n\u201cLymphedema is under-researched, so we don\u2019t know directly how it may lead to deadly health conditions, but there are more cases than AIDS, Parkinson\u2019s disease, and Alzheimer\u2019s disease combined, and it diminishes patients\u2019 health,\u201d Dixon said.\nThe researchers published the detector\u2019s test results\u00a0 in the journal\u00a0 Physical Therapy \u00a0in February\u00a02019 . Dixon and Georgia Tech graduates founded LymphaTech through the initiative\u00a0 TI:GER, Technology Innovation: Generating Economic Results \u00a0at Georgia Tech\u2019s Scheller College of Business. The startup received early funding from the Georgia Research Alliance.\nNo cure\nLymphedema can strike breast cancer survivors if surgery includes the removal of a lymph node, slowing the flow of\u00a0 lymph . The liquid waste can congest the arm, at first subtly but later so drastically that patients may no longer fit into their clothing.\n\u201cIt makes the stigma of cancer stick out,\u201d Dixon said. \u201cAnd it is a very underappreciated disorder in medical treatment, so patients can feel stuck with it with no way out.\u201d\nA German device called a perometer accurately detects arm swelling caused by lymphedema, but perometers are seldom available in the U.S. The research team could find only one in metropolitan Atlanta to benchmark the\u00a0 LymphaTech \u00a0system against. It was located at\u00a0 TurningPoint Breast Cancer Rehabilitation , a non-profit center that co-led the new study in collaboration with Dixon.\nThe advantages of the new technology over\u00a0 perometers \u00a0are cost and convenience. Perimeters are bulky, costly machines, while the LymphaTech system runs on iPhone or iPad and requires only a $400 camera attachment and a paid smartphone app. Both perometers and the app technology\u00a0simply determine total volume of the arm for swelling diagnosis.\nThe new app system performed comparably in its accuracy to the perometer in the study.\n[Ready for graduate school?\u00a0 Here's how to apply to Georgia Tech. ]\nAwareness barriers\nDeveloping LymphaTech has faced a more challenging component \u2013 spreading lymphedema awareness \u2013 and a less challenging component \u2013 arriving at the technology to make the app measurements work.\n\u201cIn the past 20 years, depth-sensor cameras have become significantly cheaper and better. Video games, self-driving cars, robotics \u2013 they have all required better depth sensors, and we took advantage of that by using a commercially available lens attachment,\u201d Dixon said.\nThe camera attachment creates point clouds, 3D representations of objects, in this case of human arms, which the app uses to calculate the total arm volume. Usually, only one arm is afflicted with lymphedema, allowing clinicians to compare it with the unaffected arm for easier gauging of disease severity.\nAs with perometers, the LymphaTech technology avoids human error that creeps in when recording arm volume with a tape measure, a currently common method to assess lymphedema.\n\u201cThe real battle has been to convince a medical market that has not much cared about lymphedema in the past or sought solutions to care,\u201d Dixon said. \u201cHopefully, the high accessibility of our solution will make it easier to care.\u201d\nIn a separate study involving the LymphaTech system, a research team traveled to Sri Lanka to measure lymphedema in legs, Dixon said. And in Germany, the technology is catching on with medical garment manufacturers to help them custom-fit compression sleeves to treat lymphedema.\nAlso read:\nExperimental flickering light device to treat Alzheimer's triggers special brain chemistry\nHere's how to\nsubscribe to our free science and technology\u00a0newsletter\nThese researchers and clinicians co-authored the study: Jill Binkley and Lauren Bober from TurningPoint Breast Cancer Rehabilitation, and LymphaTech\u2019s Michael Weiler and Nathan Frank, both of whom graduated from Georgia Tech.
