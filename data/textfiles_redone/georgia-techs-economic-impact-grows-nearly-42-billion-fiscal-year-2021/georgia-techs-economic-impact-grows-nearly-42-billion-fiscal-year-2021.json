The data calculated by the Selig Center for Economic Growth at the University of Georgia\u2019s Terry College of Business includes a breakdown of Georgia Tech\u2019s benefit to the state.\nThe study shows that the USG contributed a total of $19.3 billion to Georgia\u2019s economy during the 2021 fiscal year. Georgia Tech\u2019s economic impact is the highest of any USG institution, with nearly $4.2 billion \u2014 a 4.6% increase from FY 2020.\nThe report also found that,\u00a0collectively, the 26 USG institutions generated a labor income impact on their host communities of $8.9 billion and generated an employment impact of 152,629 jobs in FY 2021. Georgia Tech alone generated 9,256 on-campus jobs and 18,849 off-campus jobs.\nThis \u201coutput impact\u201d figure collected in the study was calculated by adding the initial spending to re-spending, or the multiplier effect, for each institution in its community. According to the report, this \u201ctotal output impact\u201d figure is the largest, most inclusive measure of economic impact.\nIncluded in the initial spending by the institutions are rounds of funding from the Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund \u2014 federal funds allocated by the Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act that provided emergency grants for postsecondary education.\nRead the full economic impact report on\u00a0 USG\u2019s website .\nAdditional Images\nContact\nAyana Isles\nMedia Relations\nEmail\naisles3@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
