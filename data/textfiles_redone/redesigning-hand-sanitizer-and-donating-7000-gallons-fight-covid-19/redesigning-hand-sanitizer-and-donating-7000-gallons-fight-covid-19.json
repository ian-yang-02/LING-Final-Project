Then they donated 7,000 gallons to hospitals and nursing homes.\u00a0Credit:\u00a0Georgia Tech / Christopher Moore\nJun 15, 2020\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nSo many people Seth Marder spoke to didn\u2019t see the hand sanitizer crisis brewing. The country was going to run dangerously short if someone did not act urgently.\nThe professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology rallied colleagues and partners around the cause in March, and by early June, they had replaced a key component of hand sanitizer, created a new supply chain, and initiated their own donation of 7,000 gallons of a newly designed sanitizer to medical facilities.\nIts name: Han-I-Size White & Gold, named for the colors of Georgia Tech. The new supply chain also may ensure that hand sanitizer producers across the country do not run out of the main active ingredient, alcohol, but the team\u2019s path to success was a stony labyrinth.\n\u201cThis project was on life support so many times because people did not understand how severe this shortage was going to be,\u201d said\u00a0 Marder, a Regents Professor \u00a0in Georgia Tech\u2019s School of Chemistry and Biochemistry. \u201cI called hospitals and institutions to assess the need and heard the same thing over and over: \u2018No, we just got a delivery. We have no need. You\u2019re wasting your time.\u2019\u201d\nMarder was not. Contacts at major chemical suppliers of hand sanitizer ingredients said that a critical shortage of alcohol, particularly the one usually in hand sanitizer, isopropanol, was coming.\n\u201cIsopropanol plants in the U.S. were running at full capacity and still didn\u2019t have enough. People were using pharmaceutical-grade ethanol now, too, but it was also in short supply. We weren\u2019t going to have enough of either; I mean the whole United States was running low,\u201d Marder said.\nClean hands cabal\nMarder hastily drafted\u00a0 Chris Luettgen , a professor of practice in Georgia Tech\u2019s School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering,\u00a0 George White , interim vice president of Georgia Tech\u2019s Office of Industry Collaboration, and Atif Dabdoub, a Georgia Tech alumnus and owner of a local chemical company, Unichem Technologies, Inc.\nTo the three chemists and the business professional, it seemed simple: Mix alcohol with water, peroxide, and the moisturizer glycerin then bottle and ship it. That bubble burst quickly.\nLuettgen, who had worked in the consumer products industry for 25 years at Kimberly-Clark Corporation and knew how to take products to market, had to plow through constant unexpected supply chain barriers and bureaucracy while White forged connections between companies. Neither the supply chain nor the business relationships had existed before, and the teams\u2019 phones stayed glued to their ears night and day as they created them from scratch.\n\u201cWhen I worked for Kimberly-Clark, getting a new product out would take the company nine to 18 months, and the three of us had to get this done in weeks. The demand was there, and people were getting sick in some cases from lack of sanitizing. We felt speed was necessary to meet the growing demand. Seth told me to push this across the goal line, and I put everything into it,\u201d Luettgen said.\n\u201cGeorgia Tech is about the power to convene. Companies and stakeholders are eager to come to the table here to make things happen,\u201d White said about forging new business ties. \u201cNot everyone has that incredible recognition as a problem solver with the brainpower amassed here.\u201d\nStinking of gin\nPurchasing truckloads of alcohol was priority one.\nBoutique liquor distilleries in Georgia were already converting to sanitizer ethyl alcohol production, but output was nowhere near enough to meet demand. ExxonMobil connected the team with Eco-Energy, a company that handles fuel-grade ethanol as a gasoline additive.\n\u201cThe amount of ethanol that\u2019s made for fuel in the U.S. is 1,500 times the amount of the isopropanol made. They could drain off about 1 percent of what is used for fuel and double or triple the amount of alcohol available for hand sanitizer in this country. And the fuel companies wouldn\u2019t even notice it was gone, especially since hardly anyone was driving anymore,\u201d Marder said.\nBut then prospective hand sanitizer distributors crimped their noses at that ethanol, saying it smelled odd.\n\u201cI thought, \u2018This has the makings of a screenplay.\u2019 I asked the distributor if we could come over to smell a sample for ourselves,\u201d White said. \u201cIt needed a little love.\u201d\nEco-Fuels produced the highly refined ethanol and then processed it through carbon filtration to increase purity and reduce odor.\u00a0Atlanta-based chemical manufacturer,\u00a0 Momar, Inc ., oversaw production, packaging, and distribution of\u00a0 Han-I-Size White & Gold .\nThe Georgia Tech team garnered funding through a donation from insurer Aflac Incorporated allocated through the\u00a0 Global Center for Medical Innovation (GCMI) , a Georgia Tech affiliated non-profit organization that guides new experimental medical solutions to market. Aflac\u2019s gift of $2 million through GCMI has also expedited the development, production, and purchase of other PPE to donate to health care workers.\nIn addition, GCMI helped guide the hand sanitizer through regulatory processes and to market. In a another development, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration was also aware of the dire shortage of alcohol for sanitizer and issued waivers for the pandemic to allow\u00a0for use of ethanol in sanitizers without having to meet usual specifications.\nWater, water everywhere\nArkema, Inc. \u00a0donated hydrogen peroxide, which was delivered to PSG Functional Materials, which mixed and packaged the product then shipped with no delivery fee to Atlanta. Though water is ubiquitous, hand sanitizer requires purified water, and the Coca-Cola Company donated a tanker truck of it just when White was pondering desperate measures.\n\u201cIf I have to get a truck to go pick up water and drive it, I\u2019ll do it myself,\u201d he said.\nFinally, the first few hundred gallons of donated Han-I-Size White & Gold rolled into Piedmont Healthcare in Atlanta and Brightmoor Nursing Center in Griffin, Georgia, in the second week of June 2020.\nGCMI is facilitating donations of the 7,000 gallons nationwide. Separate from the Aflac-financed donations, Momar will continue to manufacture the new hand sanitizing formula commercially to include in its regular product lineup, and Georgia Tech will be able to purchase it at a reduced rate to help protect researchers now returning to their labs.\nThe new supply chain, the first of its kind, of \u201cwaiver-grade\u201d ethanol has given hand sanitizer producers across the country a new opportunity to re-supply America.\n\u201cHopefully, we helped solved a national need,\u201d Luettgen said.\nRead about what else we are doing to help in the Covid-19 crisis.\nHere's how to\u00a0 subscribe to our free science and technology email\u00a0newsletter\nWriter & media inquiries : Ben Brumfield,\u00a0 ben.brumfield@comm.gatech.edu \u00a0or\u00a0John Toon (404-894-6986), jtoon@gatech.edu.\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nAdditional Images\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
