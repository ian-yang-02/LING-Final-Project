Georgia Tech was also named No. 5 overall in Best Undergraduate Computer Science programs. More than 66% of Georgia Tech\u2019s undergraduate students are enrolled in either engineering or computing. Georgia Tech was also ranked among the top 20 Best Undergraduate Business programs in the country.\nOverall, Georgia Tech ranks No. 15 in the Best Public University category. Georgia Tech is ranked No. 44 among universities both public and private, sharing the spot with Brandeis University, Case Western Reserve University, Northeastern University, and Tulane University. Among the nation\u2019s Most Innovative Universities, Georgia Tech ranks No. 8. In other categories highlighting academic excellence, Georgia Tech ranks No. 5 for Co-op/Internship Programs, and moved up to No. 16 for Senior Capstone Projects.\n\u201cWe are proud to see our programs in engineering, computing, and other disciplines among the best in the nation,\u201d said \u00c1ngel Cabrera, president of Georgia Tech. \u201cWe also appreciate being listed again among the best public universities in the nation, even if this year we showed five spots lower than last. Our successful efforts to serve more students and lower costs penalize us in these rankings, which is unfortunate. At the same time, the rankings rightfully point out the need for us to do better in terms of social mobility. We have one of the best graduation rates in the nation for Pell students, but we serve far fewer Pell students than we should, and we need to keep working to change that.\u201d\nDigging deeper into the numbers for the College of Computing, four of Tech\u2019s computer science programs are ranked among the top 5 in the country, with game development at No. 3 and cybersecurity at No. 4. Georgia Tech\u2019s artificial intelligence program ranks No. 6 among national universities. In holding its No. 5 overall computer science ranking, Georgia Tech is tied with Cornell University, Princeton University, and the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.\nIn maintaining its No. 4 overall ranking for Best Undergraduate Engineering Programs, two Schools at Tech earned No. 1 rankings. The Guggenheim School of Aerospace Engineering earned the No. 1 position for the first time, and the H. Milton Stewart School of Industrial and Systems Engineering earned that recognition for the 28th straight year.\nThe Scheller College of Business holds the No. 19 spot for Best Undergraduate Business Programs, in a tie with the University of Wisconsin Madison, the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities, and the University of Washington. Three of Scheller\u2019s business programs ranked in the top 5, with quantitative analysis at No. 4 and both business analytics and management information systems at No. 3.\nGeorgia Tech\u2019s rankings also moved up for Best Undergraduate Teaching, going from No. 58 to No. 41.\nThis is the season in which many college rankings are announced by organizations that follow higher education. Each of those ranking groups use different criteria to arrive at their evaluations. Here are some of this year\u2019s other recent results:\nNo. 3 Public University, according to Niche.\nNo. 6 Best Value College in America, as ranked by Money.\nNo. 12 Public University, according to Forbes.\nNo. 8 for Return on Investment, as ranked by Payscale.com.\nFor additional ranking information please click\nhere .\n*Please note that this summary includes the latest rankings issued by\u202fU.S. News & World Report\u202fthis year.
