It\u2019s a philosophy that\u2019s taken her from welder on the third shift to human resources manager at Roper Corp. in LaFayette, Ga. \u201cThere were times I thought, \u2018I can\u2019t do this,\u2019\u201d Beasley said,\nrecounting her journey in manufacturing . But just as quickly she thought, \u201c\u2018yes, I can.\u2019\u201d The Georgia Manufacturing Extension Partnership (GaMEP) is proud to announce Beasley as the first Face of Manufacturing, a program designed to honor the hard-working, dedicated people throughout the state who work within or are affected by the industry. Each month, GaMEP, a unit of Georgia Institute of Technology\u2019s Enterprise Innovation Institute, will profile a Georgian who is involved in manufacturing for the Faces of Manufacturing campaign. The idea is designed to highlight the critical role the industry plays in the state\u2019s economic vitality. The nearly 10,000 manufacturers in the state employ 486,000 people with a total manufacturing output of $53 billion a year. But the Faces of Manufacturingis about more than just numbers. It\u2019s to share the compelling stories of those who work in manufacturing, such as Beasley, who went back to school to get her bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees while working full-time and raising her two young sons as a single mother. \u201cWe know manufacturing contributes a lot to Georgia\u2019s economy,\u201d said GaMEP Director Karen J. Fite. \u201cBut on a deeper level, it makes a difference in the Georgia communities our manufacturers call home; and more than that, it changes the lives of so many Georgians and their families. Rhonda Beasley and her family are a great example.\u201d A strong proponent of manufacturing careers, Beasley touts how it has changed her life. She also tells how the industry itself has changed and offers countless options in engineering and other specialties as career choices, especially for women. \u201cIt\u2019s important that kids know there are great careers in manufacturing,\u201d Beasley said.\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nFaces of Manufacturing\nContact\nLaura Diamond\u00a0 Georgia Tech Media Relations 404-894-6016\nEmail\nlaura.diamond@gatech.edu\nAdditional information\nAbout the Faces of Manufacturing Each month, GaMEP will highlight a different person as the Face of Manufacturing.
