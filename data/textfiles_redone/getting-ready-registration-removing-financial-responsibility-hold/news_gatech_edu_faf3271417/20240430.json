Once the demand of the hold is addressed, it is released by the appropriate department.\nThe Financial Responsibility Agreement hold tends to be the most discussed account hold. It was put in place to ensure that students understand their financial obligations to the University System of Georgia upon registering for courses. (A detailed description can be found\nhere .)\nThe process of clearing a\nFinancial Responsibility Agreement\nhold is fairly straightforward and can be done by students themselves, without the need of the bursar\u2019s office. In order to clear the hold, students should log in to\noscar.gatech.edu , then access the registration menu on their account. Once on the registration menu page, locate the Financial Responsibility Agreement link. From there, read the agreement, enter your initials, and click \u201csubmit.\u201d\nOnce you have done this, your hold will be released, and you will be able to continue with the registration process.\n\u201cOur staff loves working with students and we are always available to help students find solutions to their issues,\u201d said Robert Zuco, customer service manager for the Office of the Bursar. Questions may be emailed to\nbursar.ask@business.gatech.edu , or call 404.894.4618.\nPhase 1 registration is underway through Friday, Dec. 16.
