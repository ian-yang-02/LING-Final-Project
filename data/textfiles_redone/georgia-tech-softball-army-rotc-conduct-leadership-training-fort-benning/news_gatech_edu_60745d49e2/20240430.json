The Yellow Jackets softball team, along with a few of the cadets from the battalion, split into squads to tackle two different training events: the Field Leaders Reaction Course (FLRC) and the Speed Course.\nThe day began with a brief explanation of the values of leadership in the Army and how the squads would be assessed during the first event. Next, the squads split off to begin the FLRC. Each squad rotated through mission obstacles that required quick thinking and teamwork. For each iteration, a different squad leader was in charge. The obstacles ranged from moving a casualty across treacherous gaps to delivering payloads across makeshift bridges. Each of the iterations was graded by a senior cadet from the program.\n\u201cIt was awesome working with Tech\u2019s softball team and sharing leadership knowledge with them,\u201d said cadet Jay Fluet, who helped grade participants during the exercises. \u201cOne of the best skills you can gain from the Army is how to lead a group of your peers, and getting to share what I\u2019ve spent three years learning and developing felt like coming full circle.\u201d\nIn the Speed Course, the squads tested their teamwork and leadership skills in a fast-paced, endurance-based challenge. The course featured obstacles that required the squads to climb, crawl, and sprint while maintaining integrity and motivating their teammates. The course also required the squads to memorize a puzzle at the beginning and then reproduce it at the end, after pushing their physical limits, to test their mental agility.\nFollowing the Speed Course, the cadets and team members came back together to watch a demonstration by the United States Army Marksmanship Unit in skeet and trap shooting. In addition to an entertaining and informative presentation, two units of Olympic athlete-soldiers spoke about their experiences, pursuing their goals, and techniques to build perseverance.\n\u201cI think we learned a lot about each other and our communication and teamwork strategies,\u201d said Yellow Jackets infielder Meghan Cassidy.\nThe opportunity to develop leadership skills and teamwork was invaluable, and the team embraced the Army spirit of pushing through difficult circumstances and excelling in stressful environments.\n\u201cI\u2019m glad we all got to come together as a team for this opportunity,\u201d said catcher Emma Kauf. \u201cIt was really cool working with the cadets and meeting a lot of new people.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nContact\nBy Evelyn Ayers\nKristen Bailey\nInstitute Communications\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
