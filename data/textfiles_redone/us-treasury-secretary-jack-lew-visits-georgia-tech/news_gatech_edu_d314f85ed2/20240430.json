Lew came to ATDC to meet with entrepreneurs and discuss the national economy, as well as hear the challenges they face in accessing capital and solutions they had.\nJan 14, 2016\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew came to the Georgia Institute of Technology Jan. 14 to discuss the national economy and meet with technology entrepreneurs at the Institute\u2019s Advanced Technology Development Center (ATDC). The secretary, who was joined by Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed, was also touting the Treasury Department\u2019s\nmyRA\n(my Retirement Account) program, a key initiative designed for individuals who want to save for retirement but don\u2019t have access to traditional, employer-sponsored retirement accounts. The initiative is a fee-free Roth Individual Retirement Account that invests in a new U.S. Treasury retirement savings bond. Lew and Reed toured ATDC, Georgia\u2019s technology startup incubator that works with entrepreneurs who want to launch successful companies in the state. Headquartered in Technology Square, ATDC has operations across the state, including in Savannah, Athens and Augusta. Lew and the mayor toured ATDC\u2019s Tech Square operations and learned about how the incubator helps entrepreneurs through its education and coaching curriculum. They also met with some of the startup entrepreneurs in ATDC\u2019s highly competitive Signature program, comprised of those companies that receive intensive one-on-one coaching and guidance and are deemed most likely to succeed as stand-alone enterprises. \u201cThere\u2019s no shortage of ideas here,\u201d Lew said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about ideas, it\u2019s about getting funding and being able to have a business come out of the idea.\u201d Lew and Reed hosted a roundtable with several CEOs and startup founders in ATDC Signature to talk to them about access to the financial system and hear challenges entrepreneurs face, and listen to their ideas. \u201cWhat we see going on here is what we\u2019re talking about when we describe the U.S. economy as being a place where innovation will come in the future because it involves your dreams,\u201d Lew said. Entrepreneurs\u2019 ideas can only become actual businesses if startups have sufficient access to the nation\u2019s financial system. \u201cFinancial inclusion is a big part of that,\u201d Lew added, \u201cbecause if you don\u2019t have a history or a relationship with the financial system, it\u2019s going to be really hard to get the loan or the financing necessary to take an idea and make it a reality.\u201d \u2014 P\u00e9ralte C.
