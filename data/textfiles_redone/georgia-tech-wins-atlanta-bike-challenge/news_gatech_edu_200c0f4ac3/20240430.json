GTRI\u2019s Thighs won first place, and ISyE Crew won second place. Tech also captured first place among workplaces with more than 2,000 employees. In the challenge, riders form teams and compete against other workplaces for who can log the most miles and get new cyclists to join.\nGTRI\u2019s Thighs\u2019 first place win brought the top trophy back to campus for the first time since 2019. In 2020, GTRI\u2019s Thighs lost to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention by just 5 points. Georgia Tech, with three of the top five teams in the challenge (GTRI\u2019s Thighs, ISyE Crew, and Vicious Cycles), was the top organization competing. Atlanta was second in the U.S., behind Portland, Oregon.\n\u201cThe state of Georgia came in fifth in the nation,\u201d said team member Joshua Forester, who works in the CIPHER lab. \u201cNot bad considering we are competing with California, Texas, and Florida, which are in a different population category.\u201d\nMembers of GTRI\u2019s Thighs are: Jason Bryan, Kellen Denny, Joshua Forester, Jett Marks, Abby Perry, Kit Plummer, John Rose, and Josh Wells.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nVictor Rogers\nInstitute Communications\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
