In an effort to help as many local students as possible earn a Georgia Tech degree, beginning this spring any first-year applicant not admitted will have a guaranteed transfer offer via the newly launched\nAPS Pathway Program .\nHere\u2019s how it works: students will attend another college for one to two years, completing a minimum of 30 credit hours of specified courses for their intended major and earning a 3.3 GPA or higher. At that point, they can apply as a transfer student and have a guaranteed spot at Tech.\n\"APS produces some of the best and brightest students,\u201d said Raheem Beyah, dean and Southern Company Chair in the College of Engineering and graduate of Frederick Douglass High School in Atlanta. \u201cI\u2019m thrilled that we have an additional mechanism to encourage them to choose Georgia Tech.\u201d\nWhile this program is new, admission efforts in the APS are not. In 2014 Tech launched the\nAPS Scholars program , which offers automatic acceptance to APS valedictorians and salutatorians. Georgia Tech now enrolls more APS valedictorians and salutatorians than any other college in the nation. Additionally, each year the Undergraduate Admission team delivers acceptance packets to several APS high school students in person. This year\nPresident Cabrera participated virtually in that effort , personally congratulating admitted students and their families.\nTransfer enrollment continues to grow significantly as well, aligning with the focus area of\nExpand Access\nin the Institute\u2019s strategic plan. In 2020, the campus welcomed a\nrecord 1,146 new transfer students . Nearly one-third of last year\u2019s Tech graduates started their college career at another college or university.\n\u201cAt many elite colleges in the country, entering as a first-year student is your only viable route. While Tech has an international reputation, we are deeply committed to serving as a public good for our city,\u201d said Rick Clark, director of Undergraduate Admission. \u201cThe APS Pathway is a perfect example of those efforts.\u201d\nThe APS Pathway makes the eighth articulated\ntransfer pathway\noffered to students who do not begin their studies at Tech. Other pathways center around\nfirst-generation students ,\nPell-eligible students ,\nveterans , and students pursuing\nspecific majors .\nAdditional Images\nContact\nBecky Tankersley\nEnrollment Management\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
