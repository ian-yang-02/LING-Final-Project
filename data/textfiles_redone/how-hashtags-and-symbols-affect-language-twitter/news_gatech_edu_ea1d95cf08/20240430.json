Research from the Georgia Institute of Technology shows that when tweeters use hashtags -- a practice that can enable messages to reach more people -- they tend to be more formal and drop the use of abbreviations and emoticons. But when they use the @symbol to address smaller audiences, they\u2019re more likely to use non-standard words such as \u201cnah,\u201d \u201ccuz\u201d and \u201csmh.\u201d The study also found when people write to someone from the same city, they are even more likely to use non-standard language \u2013 often lingo that is specific to that geographical area. Jacob Eisenstein, an assistant professor in Georgia Tech\u2019s School of Interactive Computing, led the research. His team sifted through three years of tweets \u00ad\u2013 a pool that included 114 million geotagged messages from 2.77 million users. He says the study helps explain a puzzle about language in social media. \u201cSince social media facilitates conversations between people all over the world, we were curious why we still see such a remarkable degree of geographical differentiation in online language,\u201d said Eisenstein. \u201cOur research shows that the most geographically differentiated language is more likely to be used in messages that will reach only a local audience, and therefore, will be less likely to spread to other locations.\u201d For example, while the emoticon :) is used everywhere, the alternative ;o is significantly more popular in Los Angeles. Similarly, \u201cmayne,\u201d a drawn out way of pronouncing \u201cman,\u201d is more likely to be found in Houston than anywhere else. \u201cPeople want to show their regional identity or their tech savviness, using Twitter-specific terms, to their close social network ties,\u201d said Umashanthi Pavalanathan, a Georgia Tech graduate research scientist who worked on the study. Eisenstein has looked at popular Twitter word trends and their origins for the last seven years. The more he studies, the more he realizes that Twitter users are smarter than most people give them credit for. \u201cThis research shows that for many people on Twitter, non-standard English is not a question of ability, but of reserving standard English for the right social situations,\u201d said Eisenstein. \u201cIn this sense, heavy social media users have an especially nuanced understanding of language, since they maintain multiple linguistic systems. They know to use each system when it\u2019s socially appropriate.\u201d The paper, \u201c Audience-Modulated Variation in Online Social Media ,\u201d is published in the journal American Speech.\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nRead the study\nContact\nJason Maderer National Media Relations 404-660-2926\nEmail\nmaderer@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
