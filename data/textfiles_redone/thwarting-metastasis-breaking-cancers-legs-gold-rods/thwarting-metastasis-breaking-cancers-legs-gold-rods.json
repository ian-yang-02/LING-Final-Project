I\u2019m sorry,\u201d is something no one wants to hear a doctor say.\nCancer cells\nkill most often\nby crawling away from their original tumors to later re-root in vital parts of the body in a process called\nmetastasis . Now, a research team led by the Georgia Institute of Technology\nhas developed a new treatment\nto thwart cancer's spread through the body by, in a sense, breaking cancer cells\u2019 legs.\nCancer cells often cover themselves with bristly leg-like protrusions that enable them to creep. The researchers have used minuscule gold rods heated gently by a laser to mangle the protrusions,\naccording to a new study . The treatment prevented cell migration, a key mechanism in metastasis, in experiments on common laboratory cultures ( in vitro ) of cancerous human cells.\nThe method could potentially, in the future, offer clinicians going after individual tumors a weapon to combat cancer\u2019s deadly spread at the same time. The medical field is currently less than well-equipped to stop metastasis.\n\u201cIf cancer stays in a tumor in one place, you can get to it, and it\u2019s not so likely to kill the patient, but when it spreads around the body, that\u2019s what really makes it deadly,\u201d said lead researcher\nMostafa El-Sayed, Julius Brown Chair and Regents Professor\nat Georgia Tech\u2019s\nSchool of Chemistry and Biochemistry.\nThe treatment can also easily kill cancer cells, but in this experiment, it was vital to specifically show that it greatly slowed cell migration. The method is not scheduled for human testing.\nHalting cancer softly\nThe experimental treatment also spared healthy cells, in these and in prior experiments, making the method potentially much less\ntaxing on patients than commonly used chemotherapy . In past tests in animal models, the researchers have uncovered no toxic side effects from the gold used in the treatment, and have found no observable damage to healthy tissue from the low-energy laser.\nAnd they did not see recurrence of the treated cancer.\n\u201cThe method appears to be very effective as a locally administered treatment that also protects the body from cancer\u2019s spread away from the treated tumors, and it is also very mild, so it can be applied many times over if needed,\u201d El-Sayed said.\nEl-Sayed,\nco-lead author Ronghu Wu , and first authors Yue Wu and Moustafa Ali published the results of their current\nin vitro\nexperiments, a new development in\nphotothermal gold nanorod therapy , on June 26, 2017, in the\nProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\nThe research was funded by the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health.\nHow it works: Icky legs\nTo understand how the treatment works, let\u2019s take a close-up look at a cell and some things that happen to it in malignant cancer.\nMany people think of cells as watery balloons -- fluid encased in a membrane sheath with organelles floating around inside. But that picture is incomplete. Cells have support grids called\ncytoskeletons\nthat give them form and that have functions.\nThe cytoskeletons also form bristly\nprotrusions called filopodia, which extend out from a weave of fibers called lamellipodia\nthat are on the cell\u2019s fringes. The protrusions normally help healthy cells shift their location in the tissue that they are part of.\nBut in malignant cancer, normally healthy cell functions often lunge into destructive overdrive. Lamellipodia and filopodia are wildly overproduced.\n\u201cAll these lamellipodia and filopodia give the cancer cells legs,\u201d said Yue Wu, a graduate student in bioanalytical chemistry. \u201cThe metastasis requires those protrusions, so the cells can travel.\u201d\nHow it works: Sticky rods\nThe\ngold nanorods\nthwart the protrusions in two ways. The rods are comprised of a small collection of gold atoms \u2013 nano refers to something being just billionths of meters (or feet) in size.\nFirst, El-Sayed\u2019s nanorods are introduced locally, where they encumber the leggy protrusions on cancerous cells. The rods are coated with molecules ( RGD-peptide s) that make them stick specifically to a type of cell protein called\nintegrin .\n\u201cThe targeted nanorods tied up the integrin and blocked its functions, so it could not keep guiding the cytoskeleton to overproduce lamellipodia and filopodia,\u201d said Yan Tang, a postdoctoral assistant in computational biology who worked on the study. The binding of the integrin alone slowed down the migration of malignant cells.\nBut healthy cells were not targeted. \u201cThere are certain, specific integrins that are overproduced in cancerous cells,\u201d said Moustafa Ali, one of the study\u2019s first authors. \u201cAnd you don\u2019t find them so much in healthy cells.\u201d\nHow it works: Gentle laser heating\nIn the second phase, researchers hit the gold nanoparticles with a low-energy laser of near-infrared (NIR) light. It brought the migration of the cancer cells to an observable halt.\n\u201cThe light was not absorbed by the cells, but the gold nanorods absorbed it, and as a result, they heated up and partially melted cancer cells they are connected with, mangling lamellipodia and filopodia,\u201d Ali said. \u201cIt didn\u2019t kill all the cells, not in this experiment. If we killed them, we would not have been able to observe whether we stopped them from migrating or not.\u201d\nIf desired, the treatment can also be adjusted to kill the cells.\nEarly experiments in animal models\nin vivo\nwith hotter lasers didn\u2019t work as well. \u00a0\u201cThat caused inflammation, which made it possible to heat one time only,\u201d Ali said. \u201cAs a result, that high temperature would wipe out many cancer cells, but not all of them. Some hidden ones might have survived, and also still been able to migrate.\u201d\n\u201cThis gentle laser didn\u2019t burn the skin or damage tissue, so it could be dosed multiple times and more thoroughly stop the cancer cells from being able to travel,\u201d said researcher Ronghu Wu.\nMedical possibilities\nThe researchers presently envision treating head, neck, breast, and skin cancers with direct, local nanorod injections combined with the low-power near-infrared laser, which can hit the gold nanorods 2-3 centimeters (a bit under or over an inch) deep inside tissue. \u201cBut it could go as deep as 4-5 centimeters,\u201d Ali said.\nDeeper tumors could conceivably be treated with deeper injections of nanorods. \u201cThen you\u2019d need to go in with a fiber optic or endoscopic laser,\u201d El-Sayed said. Injecting the nanorods directly into the bloodstream as a broad treatment would not currently be a viable option.\nEl-Sayed\u2019s group has previously published\nin vivo \u00a0experiments in mice\nin the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences together with Emory University School of Medicine . That study showed no observable toxicity from the gold in mice 15 months after treatment.\n\u201cA lot of it ended up in the liver and spleen,\u201d El-Sayed said. \u201cBut the functions of these organs appeared intact upon examination, and treated mice were alive and healthy over a year later.\u201d\nPresidential honors\nMostafa El-Sayed is one of the world\u2019s most highly decorated and cited living chemists, and a pioneer of nanoscience and technology. Among his many recognitions are\nthe President\u2019s National Medal of Science, awarded by President George W. Bush , and the\nPriestley Medal , the American Chemical Society\u2019s highest honor.\nPresident Barack H. Obama appointed El-Sayed to the President\u2019s National Medal of Science Committee . El-Sayed also participated in the nomination of chemistry\nNobel Laureate Ahmed Zewail.\nEl-Sayed is known throughout physical chemistry for \u201c El-Sayed\u2019s Rule ,\u201d which handles complexities of electron spin orbits, and which has found a lasting place in photochemistry textbooks. After losing his wife to cancer in 2005, El-Sayed dedicated his knowledge and research to ending the scourge.\nAlso read: Cancer and Technology\nAlso read: Punching Cancer with RNA Knuckles\nThe following authors also contributed to this research: Haopeng Xiao and Tiegang Han from Georgia Tech, and Kuangcai Chen and Ning Fang from Georgia State University.
