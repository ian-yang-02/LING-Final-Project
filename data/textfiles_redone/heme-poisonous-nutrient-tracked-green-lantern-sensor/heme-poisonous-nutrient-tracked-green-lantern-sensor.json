In minuscule amounts, it works in cells as an essential catalyst called a cofactor and as a signaling molecule to trigger other processes. Now, for the first known time, researchers have tracked those activities inside of cells. But too high of a concentration is toxic. \u201cPoor heme management can cause things like Alzheimer\u2019s, heart disease, and some types of cancers, so cells have to do a good job of managing how much heme is available,\u201d said Amit Reddi, a biochemist and assistant professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology. \u201cBy having biosensors that can monitor heme in cells, we have this new window into how cells make this essential toxin available in carefully sparse concentrations,\u201d he said. \u2018Heme\u2019 as in \u2018hemoglobin\u2019 People may recognize heme from its role at the core of hemoglobin, the component of red blood cells responsible for transporting oxygen. The ionic iron in the heme molecule is what attracts the oxygen\u00a0molecule. In hemoglobin, the heme is embedded tightly in protein, rendering it non-toxic. Many scientists have long assumed that heme, even in other cells, is basically always static, held tight by the proteins it works with. But the researchers\u2019 results shatter that assumption. They published their findings in the journal\u00a0 Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, on May, 30, 2016 . \u00a0Their research is funded by the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health. Misconception dispelled? Working with baker\u2019s yeast cells, which, like human cells, are eukaryotes, the researchers observed heme being freed up to float around and participate in life processes. \u201cI think that we have possibly put a misconception to rest,\u201d said lead researcher David Hanna, a graduate student at at the School of Chemistry and Biochemistry and Parker Petit Institute for Bioengineering and Biosciences, where Reddi also researches. He was expecting to observe a pool of free, or \u201clabile,\u201d heme in the cells, and he did. \u201cA lot of scientists believe in these fixed bonds, that all heme is tied up and buried inside proteins, but there are processes going on that defy that notion that they haven\u2019t been able to explain.\u201d Now the research team lead by Hanna and Reddi can explain some of them via the labile heme pool. \u201cNo one\u2019s shown this before. We have demonstrated that there is a pool of heme that increases and decreases. We\u2019ve shown that there is an exchangeable pool of heme.\u201d Potentially hazardous nutrient\nThe labile heme serves as a nutrient instead of a poison. But to make sure things stay that way, heme needs to be carefully trafficked through the cell, Reddi said. The research team designed a fluorescent sensor molecule to keep tabs on that. With heme at very low baseline levels, the sensor lit up bright green, then as heme concentration increased, it caused the light to fade out. Using the heme sensors, Georgia Tech graduate student Osiris Martinez-Guzman found an enzyme, GAPDH, known for its involvement in breaking down sugar, that the team observed helping buffer cellular labile heme (iron protoporphyrin IX), which got\u00a0tied up in proteins, leaving only a limited amount free for biochemical reactions. When more labile heme is needed, nitric oxide, a signaling molecule, rapidly released heme from entangling proteins, so it could do jobs such as regulating gene expression. \u2018Green Lantern\u2019 glow\n\u201cIf you increase nitric oxide, you see the green glowing sensor dim as the heme becomes labile then the glow brightens back up over time as heme gets bound up again,\u201d Reddi said. Not having a sensor was one reason labile heme has not been previously observed, so the Georgia Tech researchers used a ratiometric fluorescence approach to design one that could be described a little like the comic book superhero \u201cGreen Lantern.\u201d As hemes are attracted to him like, say, fans, they become clutter, said Reddi, the paper\u2019s principal investigator. \u201cHe holds them in front of his green light, and they block it, making it appear dimmer.\u201d \u201cRatiometric fluorescent techniques have been around for a while, but our technique is new, because it specifically senses heme,\u201d Reddi said. \u201cWe took a heme binding protein from bacteria and clipped it onto to green fluorescent protein.\u201d The researchers used a blue laser to charge up the lamp part of the sensor protein pair like a glow-in-the-dark sticker, then it re-emitted the green light. \u201cYou see this green image disappearing and reappearing depending on how much heme is available,\u201d Reddi said. \u201cYou can see what\u2019s happening in real time.\u201d Raven M.
