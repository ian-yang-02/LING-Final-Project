They identified how altered protein folding drives multicellular evolution.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nEmail\nMar 11, 2024\nThis news was originally released in the University of Helsinki newsroom. Read the full story\nhere .\nIn a new study led by Georgia Tech and University of Helsinki, researchers have discovered a mechanism steering the evolution of multicellular life.\nCo-authored by the School of Biological Sciences\u2019\nDung Lac ,\nAnthony Burnetti ,\nOzan Bozdag , and\nWill Ratcliff,\nthe study, \u201c Proteostatic tuning underpins the evolution of novel multicellular traits \u201d, was published in\nScience Advances\nthis month, and uncovers how altered protein folding drives multicellular evolution.\nThe team\u2019s research centers on the ongoing Multicellularity Long Term Evolution Experiment (MuLTEE) experiment, in which laboratory yeast are evolving novel multicellular functions, enabling researchers to investigate how these functions arise.\nAmong the most important multicellular innovations is the origin of robust bodies: over 3,000 generations, these \u2018snowflake yeast\u2019 started out weaker than gelatin but evolved to be as strong and tough as wood.\nFrom an evolutionary perspective, this work highlights the power of non-genetic mechanisms in rapid evolutionary change.\n\u201cWe tend to focus on genetic change and were quite surprised to find such large changes in the behavior of chaperone proteins,\u201d says Ratcliff. \u201cThis underscores how creative and unpredictable evolution can be when finding solutions to new problems, like building a tough body.\"\nContact\nContact:\nJess Hunt-Ralston\nEmail\njess@cos.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
