Such technology can perform tasks that formerly only a human could: see, identify patterns, make decisions, and act.\nThe new co-design center, known as the Center for ARtificial Intelligence-focused Architectures and Algorithms (ARIAA), funded by DoE\u2019s\nOffice of Science , will promote collaboration between scientists at the three organizations as they develop core technologies important for the application of AI to DoE mission priorities, such as cybersecurity, electric grid resilience, graph analytics, and scientific simulations.\nPNNL Senior Research Scientist Roberto Gioiosa will be the center\u2019s director and will lead the overall vision, strategy, and research direction.\nTushar Krishna , an assistant professor in Georgia Tech\u2019s\nSchool of Electrical and Computer Engineering\n(ECE), and Siva Rajamanickam, a computer scientist at Sandia, will serve as deputy directors.\nEach institution brings to the collaboration a unique strength: PNNL has expertise in power grid simulation, chemistry, and cybersecurity and has research experience in computer architecture and programming models, as well as computing resources such as systems for testing emerging architectures. Sandia has expertise in software simulation of computer systems, machine learning algorithms, graph analytics, and sparse linear algebra, and will provide access to computer facilities and testbed systems to support early access to emerging computing architectures for code development and testing. Georgia Tech has expertise in modeling and developing custom accelerators for machine learning and sparse linear algebra and will develop and provide access to novel hardware prototypes.\n\u201cNew projects like the center were made possible by the strategic collaboration between Sandia and Georgia Tech for the past few years,\" said Sandia\u2019s Rajamanickam.\nSpecial-purpose hardware can enable AI tasks to run faster and use less energy than on conventional computing devices such as CPUs and GPUs. ARIAA is centered around a concept known as \u201cco-design,\u201d which refers to the need for researchers to weigh and balance the capabilities of hardware and software \u2013 and corral the vastly different types of architectures and algorithms possible to best solve the problems at hand.\nKrishna\u2019s lab will lead the effort on architecting and evaluating reconfigurable hardware accelerators that can adapt to the rapidly evolving needs of AI applications. In particular, running sparse computations efficiently will be a key focus. Sparse computations are critical to several computational areas of interest to the DoE because they greatly reduce the number of computations on problems with large amounts of data. One way of thinking about sparsity is that there might be millions or even billions of users on a social media site, but a user cares about updates only from a few hundred friends.\nKrishna, the ON Semiconductor Junior Professor in ECE, works on custom hardware accelerators for AI. In 2015, he co-developed the Eyeriss Deep Learning ASIC (in collaboration with MIT), which was one of the earliest prototypes demonstrating real-time inference on a state-of-the-art deep neural network then known as AlexNet. More recently his lab has been working on an analytical microarchitectural design-space exploration tool for AI accelerators known as MAESTRO (developed in collaboration with NVIDIA) and a reconfigurable AI accelerator platform known as MAERI. Both of these will be leveraged to perform co-design as part of the ARIAA center.\n\u201cGeorgia Tech provides a great environment to carry out research in hardware-software co-design due to a rich collaborative environment across ECE and the College of Computing, and vibrant research centers such as Machine Learning at Georgia Tech (ML@GT) and the Center for Research into Novel Computing Hierarchies (CRNCH) that bring together researchers with experience in algorithms, compilers, architecture, circuits, and novel devices, fostering collaboration and innovation,\u201d said Krishna.\n- Adapted from an article by the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory\nResearch News\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\n177 North Avenue\nAtlanta, Georgia\u00a0 30332-0181\u00a0 USA\nMedia Relations Contact : John Toon (404-894-6986) (jtoon@gatech.edu)\nAdditional Images\nContact\nJohn Toon\nResearch News\n(404) 894-6986\nEmail\njtoon@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
