Three projects connected to Georgia Tech, which have collectively received $119 million from ARPA-H, are doing just that.\nWith a grant worth up to $50 million, Georgia Tech will lead development of a new generation of cancer tests capable of detecting multiple types of tumors earlier than ever. Led by biomedical engineer\nGabe Kwong , the project will map the unique cellular profiles of cancer cells and leverage that knowledge to build new bioengineered sensors to detect those profiles. The goal is to create a new kind of multi-cancer early detection test that would allow oncologists to start treating the tumors sooner, when they\u2019re still small and most responsive.\nThe project is the third with ties to Georgia Tech received in recent weeks. Professor Philip Santangelo, professor in the Wallace H. Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering at Georgia Tech and Emory University,\nreceived the first tranche of funding from the agency\n\u2014 $24 million \u2014 for a project building a toolbox of mRNA drugs to activate or shut off specific genes to help the immune system fight cancer and other disorders.\nJosiah Hester in the School of Interactive Computing\nis co-principal investigator of a $45 million Rice University-led effort to develop an implant to help the body better respond to cancer treatments.\nCeline Lin , associate professor in the School of Computer Science, is working with Hester to develop ultra-energy-efficient chips for signal processing and embedded control. Together, they will develop a robust platform that is energy-efficient enough to last for months.\n\u201cAt ARPA-H, we recognize the urgency of the health challenges facing cancer patients and their families.\u201d said ARPA-H Director Renee Wegrzyn, \u201cand we are committed to funding truly transformative research that can improve health outcomes for everyone.\u201d\nRead more about the three projects:\n$50M Cancer Moonshot Grant Will Build an Atlas for Earlier Cancer Detection\nComputing Faculty Supporting Research That Could Cut Cancer Deaths in Half\nBME Researchers Lead $24M Project Using mRNA to \u2018Turn On\u2019 Helpful Immune Responses\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\n$50M Cancer Moonshot Grant Will Build an Atlas for Earlier Cancer Detection\nComputing Faculty Supporting Research That Could Cut Cancer Deaths in Half\nBME Researchers Lead $24M Project Using mRNA to \u2018Turn On\u2019 Helpful Immune Respo\u2026\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
