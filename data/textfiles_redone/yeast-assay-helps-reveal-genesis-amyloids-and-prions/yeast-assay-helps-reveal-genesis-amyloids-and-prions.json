They are strongly implicated in Alzheimer\u2019s disease, a leading cause of dementia in elderly people. Mad cow disease, a neurodegenerative disease, results from infection by prions, which are amyloids that can spread between cells and organisms.\nDespite voluminous research on amyloids and prions, researchers still cannot explain how harmless, normal protein sequences go awry and assume the deadly amyloid shape.\n\u201cThe initial amyloid \u2018nucleation\u2019 is extremely difficult to investigate in animal models,\u201d says\nYury Chernoff , a professor in the School of Biological Sciences. \u201cTo begin with, initial nucleation is extremely rare. We have no idea where the initial amyloid \u2018nucleus\u2019 comes from and what promotes its formation. And then accumulation of an amyloid to detectable levels takes a very long time.\u201d\nFor these reasons, Chernoff\u2019s Georgia Tech team and collaborators in Germany and Russia (St. Petersburg State University, where Chernoff also directs a research group) turned to yeast as a model to study the human amyloids. They published their findings in the\nJournal of Biological Chemistry\nin early January 2018.\nAccording to Chernoff, yeast also form prions, and the initial nucleation of a yeast prion is also rare. \u201cHowever,\u201d he says, \u201cit is easier to detect prion nucleation in yeast that in humans, because it is possible to analyze large numbers of yeast cells, and because yeast prions cause easily detectable traits.\u201d\nThe researchers fused mammalian amyloid-forming proteins to the yeast prion-forming protein. They found that the resulting chimeric proteins nucleate an amyloid state in yeast much more frequently than yeast prion-forming protein does on its own. \u201cBecause the resulting amyloid nucleus further converts a normal yeast protein,\u201d Chernoff says, \u201camyloid formation could be detected by the appearance of an easily observable trait, such as growth on specific medium.\u201d\nThe researchers successfully applied the method to several proteins, including amyloid beta (associated with human Alzheimer\u2019s disease), PrP (associated with mad cow disease), alpha synuclein (associated with Parkinson\u2019s disease), and amylin (associated with type II diabetes).\n\u201cThis assay opens a wide window to the early stages of dreadful human diseases caused by abnormal protein aggregation,\u201d Chernoff says. \u201cThe more we understand how these diseases originate, the better we can develop treatments.\u201d\nBeyond revealing how human proteins undergo amyloid nucleation, Chernoff says, the assay will help researchers discover factors affecting amyloid nucleation in cells, find agents that favor the development of diseases, and identify treatments and conditions that can prevent the triggering cause of a disease.\nChernoff\u2019s Georgia Tech team working on this project included current \u00a0Ph.D. student\nPavithra Chandramowlishwaran \u00a0and former Ph.D. student\nMeng Sun , who are co-first authors on the paper, as well as undergraduate researcher\nKristin Casey\nand research scientist\nAndrey Romanyuk .\nFigure Caption\nGrowth of the specially designed yeast strain on a specific medium enables researchers to detect nucleation of disease-related fibrils by human amyloid beta protein, associated with Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\nThis work was supported by grants from the National Institute of Aging, NIH (through Emory University\u2019s Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Research Center) and the Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease Foundation, as well as the Russian Science Foundation and the Russian Foundation for Basic Research (to the St. Petersburg group).\nAdditional Images\nContact\nA.
