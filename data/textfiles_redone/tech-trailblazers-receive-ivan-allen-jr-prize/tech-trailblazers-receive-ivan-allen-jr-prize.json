Williams.\nJan 19, 2022\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nFord Greene, Ralph Long Jr., and Lawrence Williams, Georgia Tech\u2019s first Black students, and Ronald Yancey, Tech\u2019s first Black graduate, will receive the 2022 Ivan Allen Jr. Prize for Social Courage.\nThe likenesses of the four men are permanently enshrined in campus sculptures, but now, decades after breaking the color barrier at Georgia Tech, they will join the ranks of past awardees that include Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter, John Lewis, Andrew Young, and other pathbreaking leaders.\n\u201cThe Ivan Allen Jr. Prize recognizes exemplary,\u00a0courageous leaders \u2014 those who, like Mayor Allen, take on personal risks in an effort to improve the lives of others,\u201d said Georgia Tech President \u00c1ngel Cabrera. \u201cWith great determination, Ford Greene, Ralph Long Jr., Lawrence Williams, and Ronald Yancey withstood hazards and adversity of every kind to prove to the world that Black students had the right to study at Georgia Tech, paving the way for the thousands of Black Yellow Jackets who have earned their degrees here since.\u201d\nGreene, Long, and Williams, dubbed the \u201cthree pioneers\u201d in the Harrison Square sculpture that depicts them on their first day at Tech, began classes in the fall of 1961. And, although their arrival didn\u2019t elicit violence as it had at other southern universities, it was not easy. They often felt isolated and unwelcome, and they were acutely aware that many around them assumed they wouldn\u2019t be able to succeed here. As Ronald Yancey, who entered Tech a year later, recalled, \u201cIt was a lonely and difficult time. \u2018Glares and stares\u2019 is the best way I can put it.\u201d\nBut they persevered. Greene studied chemical engineering at Georgia Tech. He completed his bachelor\u2019s degree in mathematics and computer science at Morgan State University and worked in telecommunications and information technology systems. He died in 2020 at the age of 76. After attending Tech, Long completed his bachelor\u2019s degree at Clark College (now Clark Atlanta University) in mathematics and physics, and was the first Black systems engineer for the Large Systems Group in the southeastern U.S. at IBM Atlanta. Williams served honorably in the Air Force during the Vietnam War, earning several distinctions and honors. A week after graduating, Yancey began a successful career with the U.S. Department of Defense.\n\u201cWe rarely award the Ivan Allen Jr. Prize to our own students and alumni, but we were long overdue in bestowing it to these four pioneers,\u201d Cabrera said. \u201cWe are honored to celebrate the legacies of four brave young men who helped make Georgia Tech \u2014 and, by\u00a0extension, our society \u2014 fairer and better for all. Their personal sacrifice, their determination, and their belief that a better reality was possible made a lasting and transformative impact on the Institute that\u2019s still visible more than 60 years after they first set foot on campus.\u201d\nThe Ivan Allen Jr. Prize for Social Courage was established in 2010 to honor Tech alumnus and former Atlanta Mayor Ivan Allen Jr. Funded in perpetuity by a grant from the Wilbur and Hilda Glenn Family Foundation, the prize includes a $100,000 stipend for recipients. The inaugural prize was awarded in March 2011.\nAdditional details about the timing of this year\u2019s award presentation will be announced soon.
