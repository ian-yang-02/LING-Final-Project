Like pressure treatments, the process is performed in an airtight chamber, but in this case the chamber is at low pressures to help the gas molecules permeate the entire wood structure.\n\u201cIt was really important that this coating be applied throughout the interior of the wood and not just on the surface,\u201d said\nMark Losego , an assistant professor in the\nSchool of Materials Science and Engineering . \u201cWood has pores that are about the width of a human hair or a little smaller, and we used these holes as our pathways for the gases to travel throughout the wood\u2019s structure.\u201d\nAs the gas molecules travel down those pathways, they react with the pore\u2019s surfaces to deposit a conformal, atomic-scale coating of metal oxide throughout the interior of the wood. The result is wood that sheds water off its surface and resists absorbing water even when submerged.\nIn their experiments, the researchers took finished pine 2x4s and cut them into one-inch pieces. They then tested infusing the lumber with three different kinds of metal oxides: titanium oxide, aluminum oxide and zinc oxide. With each, they compared the water absorption after holding the lumber under water for a period of time. Of the three, titanium oxide performed the best by helping the wood absorb the least amount of water. By comparison, untreated lumber absorbed three times as much water.\n\u201cOf the three chemistries that we tried, titanium oxide proved the most effective at creating the hydrophobic barrier,\u201d said Shawn Gregory, a graduate student at Georgia Tech and lead author on the paper. \u201cWe hypothesize that this is likely because of how the precursor chemicals for titanium dioxide react less readily with the pore surfaces and therefore have an easier time penetrating deep within the pores of the wood.\u201d\nLosego said that the same phenomena exist in atomic layer deposition processes used for microelectronic devices.\n\u201cThese same titanium oxide precursor chemistries are known to better penetrate and conformally coat complex nanostructures in microelectronics just like we see in the wood,\u201d Losego said. \u201cThese commonalities in understanding fundamental physical phenomena \u2013 even in what appear to be very different systems \u2013 is what makes science so elegant and powerful.\u201d\nIn addition to being hydrophobic, lumber treated with the new vapor process also resists the mold that eventually leads to rot.\n\u201cInterestingly, when we left these blocks sit in a humid environment for several months, we noticed that the titanium oxide treated blocks were much more resistant to mold growth than the untreated lumber,\u201d Gregory added. \u201cWe suspect that this has something to do with its hydrophobic nature, although there could be other chemical effects associated with the new treatment process that could also be responsible. That\u2019s something we would want to investigate in future research.\u201d\nYet another benefit of the new process: vapor-treated wood was far less thermally conductive compared to untreated wood.\n\u201cA lot of attention is paid in home building to insulating the cavities between the structural components of a home, but a massive amount of the thermal losses are caused by the wood studs themselves,\u201d said\nShannon Yee , an associate professor in the\nGeorge W. Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering\nand a co-author on the paper with expertise in thermal systems. \u201cLumber treated with this new process can be up to 30 percent less conductive, which could translate to a savings of as much as 2 million BTUs of energy per dwelling per year.\"\nThis material is based upon work supported by the Office of Naval Research through grant No. N00014-19-1-2162, the Department of Defense through the National Defense Science & Engineering Graduate Fellowship Program, the Gulf Research Program managed by the National Academies, and a donation from Roxanne Westendorf.
