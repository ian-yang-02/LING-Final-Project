Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans most often lives peacefully in the mouth until circumstances lead it to become infectious. It forms flower-like colonies, here under a microscope sporting a colorful stain added by a researcher. Aa is gram-negative.\u00a0Credit: Derren Ready (2012) CIL:38942, CIL.

Bacteria living in the same space, like the mouth, have evolved collaborations so generous that they are not possible with outside bacteria. That was long held to be true, but\u00a0 in a new, large-scale study \u00a0of microbial interactions, the resounding answer was \u201cfalse.\u201d\nResearch led by the Georgia Institute of Technology found that common mouth bacteria responsible for acute periodontitis fared better overall when paired with bacteria and other microbes that live anywhere but the mouth, including some commonly found in the colon or in dirt. Bacteria from the oral microbiome, by contrast, generally shared food and assistance more stingily with gum infector\u00a0 Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans , or\u00a0 Aa \u00a0for short.\nLike many bacteria known for\u00a0infections they can cause \u2013 like\u00a0 Strep \u00a0\u2013\u00a0 Aa\u00a0 often live peacefully in the mouth, and certain circumstances turn them into infectors. The researchers and their sponsors at the National Institutes of Health would like to know more about how\u00a0 Aa \u00a0interacts with other microbes to gain insights that may eventually help fight acute periodontitis and other ailments.\n\u201cPeriodontitis is the most prevalent human infection on the planet after cavities,\u201d said\u00a0 Marvin Whiteley, a professor in Georgia Tech\u2019s School of Biological Sciences \u00a0and the study\u2019s principal investigator. \u201cThose bugs get into your bloodstream every day, and there has been a long, noted correlation between poor oral hygiene and prevalence of heart disease.\u201d\nUnnatural pairing\nThe findings are surprising because bacteria in a microbiome have indeed evolved intricate interactions making it seem logical that those interactions would stand out as uniquely generous. Some mouth microbes even have special docking sites to bind to their partners, and much previous research has tightly focused on their cooperations. The new study went broad.\n\u201cWe asked a bigger question: How do microbes interact with bugs they co-evolved with as opposed to how they would interact with microbes they had hardly ever seen. We thought they would not interact well with the other bugs, but it was the opposite,\u201d Whiteley said.\nThe study\u2019s scale was massive. Researchers manipulated and tracked nearly all of\u00a0 Aa \u2019s roughly 2,100 genes using an emergent gene tagging technology while pairing\u00a0 Aa \u00a0with 25 other microbes \u2014 about half from the mouth and half from other body areas or the environment.\nThey did not examine the mouth microbiome as a whole because multi-microbial synergies would have made interactions incalculable. Instead, the researchers paired\u00a0 Aa \u00a0with one other bug at a time \u2014\u00a0 Aa \u00a0plus mouth bacterium X,\u00a0 Aa \u00a0plus colon bacterium Y,\u00a0 Aa \u00a0plus dirt fungus Z, and so on.\n\u201cWe wanted to see specifically which genes\u00a0 Aa \u00a0needed to survive in each partnership and which ones it could do without because it was getting help from the partner,\u201d said\u00a0 Gina Lewin, a postdoctoral researcher \u00a0in Whiteley\u2019s lab and the study\u2019s first author. They published their results\u00a0 in the\u00a0 Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .\nQ & A\nHow could they tell that\u00a0 Aa \u00a0was doing well or poorly with another microbe?\nThe researchers looked at each of\u00a0 Aa \u2019s genes necessary for survival while it infected a mouse -- when\u00a0 Aa \u00a0was the sole infector, when it partnered with a fellow mouth bacterium and when paired with a microbe from colon, dirt, or skin.\n\u201cWhen\u00a0 Aa \u00a0was by itself, it needed a certain set of genes to survive \u2013 like for breathing oxygen,\u201d Lewin said. \u201cIt was striking that when\u00a0 Aa \u00a0was with this or that microbe that it normally didn\u2019t live around, it no longer needed a lot of its own genes. The other microbe was giving\u00a0 Aa \u00a0things that it needed, so it didn\u2019t have to make them itself.\u201d\n\u201cInteractions between usual neighbors \u2014 other mouth bacteria \u2014 looked more frugal,\u201d Whiteley said. \u201c Aa \u00a0needed a lot more of its own genes to survive around them, sometimes more than when it was by itself.\u201d\n[Ready for graduate school?\u00a0 Here's how to apply to Georgia Tech. ]\nHow did the emerging genetic marking method work?\nTo understand \u201ctransposon sequencing,\u201d picture a transposon as a DNA brick that cracks a gene, breaking its function. The brick also sticks to the gene and can be detected by DNA sequencing, thus tagging that malfunction.\nEvery\u00a0 Aa \u00a0bacterium in a pile of 10,000 had a brick in a random gene. If\u00a0 Aa \u2019s partner bacterium, say,\u00a0 E. coli, \u00a0picked up the slack for a broken function,\u00a0 Aa \u00a0survived and multiplied even with the damaged gene, and researchers detected a higher number of bacteria containing the gene.\nAa \u00a0surviving with more broken genes meant a partner microbe was giving it more assistance.\u00a0 Aa \u00a0bacteria with broken genes that a partner could not compensate for were more likely to die, reducing their count.\nDoes this mean the mouth microbiome does not have unique relationships?\nIt very likely does have them, but the study\u2019s results point to not all relationships being cooperative. Some microbiomes could have high fences and share sparsely.\n\u201cOne friend or enemy may be driving your behavior, and other microbes may just be standing around,\u201d Lewin said.\nSmoking, poor hygiene, or diabetes \u2014 all associated with gum disease \u2014 might be damaging defensive microbiomes and allowing outside bacteria to help\u00a0 Aa \u00a0attack gum tissue. It\u2019s too early to know that, but Whiteley\u2019s lab wants to dig deeper, and the research could have implications for other microbiomes.\nAlso read:\u00a0 Test for Life-Threatening Nutrient Deficit Made From Bacteria Entrails\nThese researchers coauthored the study: Apollo Stacy from the National Institute of Infectious Diseases and the National Institute of General Medical Sciences, Kelly Michie from Georgia Tech, and Richard Lamont from the University of Louisville.
