It was started to remove some of the confusion that inevitably surrounds registering for classes.\n\u201cWe started working on this a while ago when we realized signing up for classes, we don't know what we're signing up for,\u201d said Megan Dass, the SGA joint vice president of IT. The class description in the registration system cannot give the full scope of a class, and some students may want more detail, such as how many tests there are or how the grades are distributed. These factors can help \u00a0students when planning their workload and scheduling, which is why SGA began developing the project months ago. They have been working to create something they would want to use themselves.\nThe idea of a service created by students that supports other fellow students is at the core of the project. It is a way to help build a sense of togetherness among the Georgia Tech community, as this database will be completely based off student contributions. \u201cWhen you give to the repository, it helps the project as a whole,\u201d Dass said.\nSGA is now asking students to submit their syllabuses to be included in the repository. Submitting a syllabus is easy \u2014 simply fill out\nthis form , which asks a few questions and should only take a few minutes to complete. Submissions will be accepted until Tuesday, Oct. 12. On Oct. 20, the syllabus repository will be made available to all students in time for spring registration. This \u00a0project will continue into future semesters, becoming more helpful as time goes on and as more students submit their syllabuses.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nConnor White\nInstitute Communications\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
