If adopted, the policies would replace \u201ccampus closure\u201d and \u201cclass canceled\u201d designations with Modified Campus Operations for faculty and staff and Digital Learning Days for students.\nExplaining the genesis of the reshaped policies, the policy owners emphasized that closures result in the loss of valuable instruction, research, and operational time campuswide. The new procedures attempt, when possible, to limit emergency and hazardous weather impact on the Institute\u2019s operations by optimizing remote work and virtual teaching and learning.\nModified Campus Operations\nUnder the proposed \u201cmodified operations\u201d designation, departments will continue offering essential services on-site (when necessary) and virtually. Each department will identify the employees needed remotely when the Institute enters modified operations and communicate expectations accordingly.\nWhen on-campus activities are suspended under Modified Campus Operations, Digital Learning Days will provide a way for instruction to continue if possible. Students will be expected to check Canvas or other communication methods for updates and expectations from their instructors.\nEmployees who are not needed on campus and cannot perform their work virtually will see no change under the proposed updates to the policy.\nDigital Learning Days\nWith developments and improvements to digital instruction over the past few years, the goal of this policy is to leverage digital learning as much as reasonably possible. When the Institute moves to \u201cmodified operations,\u201d it is proposed that classes be shifted to a virtual setting, whenever viable.\nProfessors will be given discretion on the scheduling of digital instruction and/or makeup classes due to Modified Campus Operations.\nShould an exam fall on a Modified Campus Operations day or Digital Learning Day, the best practice is for the faculty member to administer the exam during the next in-person class meeting. If a long-term interruption occurs (more than three days), the Office of the Provost reserves the right to determine the need for makeup classes.\nWith the safety of the campus community in mind, the proposed changes afford managers and instructors the discretion to assess individual situations rather than using a one-size-fits-all approach \u2014 while minimizing interruptions to Institute operations.\nNotification of Campus During Modified Campus Operations and Digital Learning Days\nIn the event of hazardous weather, students, faculty, and staff can find out about campus closures and Tech's response in several ways:\nAll announcements, including specific changes to campus services, such as transportation or dining services, will be shared on the\nGeorgia Tech homepage .\nIn the event of Modified Campus Operations, an alert will be sent via the Georgia Tech Emergency Notification System (GTENS). Concurrently, notifications will be announced across the official Georgia Tech social media accounts.\nStaff can expect to be notified directly by their supervisor of their role during Modified Campus Operations and Digital Learning Day implementation.\nIt is expected that students will receive communication from their instructors regarding digital instruction schedules and makeup classes or exams.\nFinally,\nInstitute Communications\nwill immediately notify local radio and television stations to include Georgia Tech on their lists of closures in the area.\nCampus Comment Period\nThe campus comment period for both proposed policies opens today, April 3, and will remain open for two weeks.\nIf you would like to read the detailed proposed policy documents, they are available for review at\npolicylibrary.gatech.edu/policy-announcements/opencampuscomment .\nIf you have questions or comments about these policies, please submit feedback about the Digital Learning Days for Modified Campus Operations policy via the\nfeedback form , and submit feedback about the Modified Operations During Emergencies and Campus Interruptions policy to\noem@groups.gatech.edu .\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nPolicies Open for Campus Comment\nContact\nBrittany Aiello\nFaculty Communications Program Manager\nOrganizational, Academic, and Research Communications\nEmail\nbrittany.aiello@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
