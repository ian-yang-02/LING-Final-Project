With that, many are taking to the great outdoors \u2014 often by bike to make the most of the convenience, health benefits, and environmentally friendly aspects of this mode of transportation. Unfortunately, criminals want to make the most of bikes, too.\nThe Georgia Tech Police Department (GTPD) is currently investigating several thefts involving bicycles and scooters from the East and West Campus Residence Halls. In each of these thefts, officers are seeing the use of inferior equipment being used to secure bikes.\n\u201cAlthough we're operating in unfortunate circumstances, given the pandemic, criminals are still out and we have had several reports of stolen bicycles,\u201d said Sergeant Jessica Howard.\u00a0\u201cWe encourage students to lock bikes using a quality, durable U-lock, use the designated locations to lock your bike, and make sure you register your bike with us. That helps us identify the owner of a stolen bike when it is recovered.\u201d\nBikes can be registered with the GTPD at\npolice.gatech.edu/crime-prevention/safety-tips/bicycle\n\u2014 no matter the type. Those who register their bikes with GTPD also receive a free water bottle. Officers will be on campus in the coming weeks doing in-person registration on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 2 to 4 p.m. Find out where to find them by following GTPD on social media ( facebook.com/GaTechPD ,\ninstagram.com/gatechpd , and\ntwitter.com/gatechpd ).\nHere are some additional tips to help prevent a criminal from taking your bike for a ride.\nAvoid using lightweight cables or chains, or low-quality U-locks, as these can be cut with relative ease.\nThe lock should always go through the frame. If possible, attach bicycles to bike racks through the frame and both wheels. If both wheels cannot be attached, be sure to attach the frame and one wheel.\nDo not attach the lock to parts of the bicycle that may be easily removed, such as the seat post or only the wheel.\nCheck the lock before departing to ensure it is secured.\nIf you have a quick release for the seat or front wheel, take these items with you.\nDo not leave any free or easily detachable parts, such as headlights or bags, on the bike.\nAvoid leaving bicycles locked outside overnight.\nMore information on bicycling on campus can be found at\npts.gatech.edu/bicycling-georgia-tech\nand\npolice.gatech.edu/crime-prevention/safety-tips/bicycle .\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nAlternative Transportation\nProperty and Bicycle Registration\nContact\nKristen Bailey\nInstitute Communications\nAdditional information\nLearn more about safe riding and how to secure your bike or scooter through the virtual Ride Smart class.\nJoin the Atlanta Bike Challenge this month to log your miles, earn rewards, and encourage others to get on their bike.\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
