Some of you may have planned your outfits months ago. (Hopefully you've at least taken your regalia out of the plastic to let the wrinkles fall out.)\nThere is no official Commencement dress code, but for those who are still scrambling for picture-perfect attire, here are some practical tips to help dress and prep for the big day.\nThis semester\u2019s five ceremonies will take place in McCamish Pavilion. One ceremony will honor Ph.D. graduates, and the other four will honor bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s graduates.\nSpring 2024 Commencement is a rain or shine event. Graduates and guests are advised to monitor the weather forecast and dress as needed.\nCommencement Dress DO\u2019s:\nDon\u2019t bring a bag.\nIf you must have a bag, make it clear. Commencement events at McCamish Pavilion are subject to the venue\u2019s clear bag policy. See the full policy at\nramblinwreck.com/clearbag .\nTravel light.\u00a0 This will save you the hassle of carrying a bag or going through bag check when you arrive.\u00a0 Any belongings brought with you will have to be taken to your seat for the ceremony \u2014 so leave the bags, laptops, or tablets at home.\u00a0 If you\u2019re wearing a dress or skirt, try to find one with pockets to carry small items such as keys or your cell phone. If you must have a purse, consider a wristlet or small clutch within the\nbag policy size limits .\nDress comfortably.\nYou will be at McCamish Pavilion for about three and a half hours. The event will be a combination of standing and sitting, so make sure you\u2019re dressed comfortably enough for both. Students will process in front of the stage as their names are called, so be sure you can walk in your shoes. If you\u2019re wearing pants, consider a lighter color such as khaki. If you\u2019re planning to wear heels, consult the \u201cdon\u2019t wear new shoes\u201d section, and consider a low heel. Keep in mind that if you wear a coat or jacket, it will have to go with you into the ceremony. (Consider light layers instead.)\nSuggest that your guests dress business casual.\nAlthough there is no dress code, many guests like to dress up for this special day. Parents and alumni can often be seen donning Tech colors and gear, and sometimes international guests wear their country\u2019s traditional dress clothes. Tell them about the clear bag entry policy so they, too, can plan accordingly.\nWhatever you choose to wear, the photos you take will be around for a while, so pick something you won\u2019t mind seeing a few years down the road. When in doubt, you can\u2019t go wrong with white and gold.\nCommencement Dress DON\u2019Ts:\nDon\u2019t think that because you\u2019re wearing a robe it doesn\u2019t matter what you\u2019re wearing underneath.\nThroughout the day you\u2019ll be taking numerous photos, and you may at some point want to take off your regalia.\nDon\u2019t wear new shoes.\nCommencement is not the day to break in new shoes. Another tip: Don\u2019t wear high heels if you are not used to walking in them. On your walk across the stage you should be focusing on the moment you\u2019ve been waiting for during the past four (or five) years, not worrying about tripping.\nDon\u2019t spend too much time styling your hair.\nKeep in mind you\u2019ll be wearing a graduation cap for a few hours. If you\u2019re planning an elaborate hairstyle, try it out with your cap before graduation day to make sure that the cap still sits properly.\nDon\u2019t make your mortar board too epic . Remember that someone has to sit behind you, and if you adorn your cap with anything 3D, try to keep it no more than an inch or two off the board.\nDon\u2019t forget your regalia.\nMake sure you have your cap, gown, tassel, cords, and stole (and hood, for graduate students). There will not be extras at the event. And, don\u2019t wait until Commencement day to unwrap it. Take it out of the plastic, make sure you have it all, and hang it up to let some of the wrinkles fall out. (If you\u2019re feeling ambitious, give it an iron or steam.)\nOther Commencement Tips:\nSet an alarm, especially for morning ceremonies . Gates will open one hour before the start of the ceremony. Graduates must report to the venue 30 minutes prior to ceremony start. Set your alarm and have a buddy system to make sure you wake up. ( See the full Commencement schedule ).\nCharge your phone . You will scan a virtual name card as you process into McCamish Pavilion, and you will want to find family members after the ceremony. Bring a phone with a full charge. Pro tip: take a screen shot of your grad pass before you arrive. Better yet, print\nyour GradPass\nand never worry about your phone\u2019s battery life.\nStay hydrated and take a bathroom break before you arrive.\nTry to be well-rested, fed, hydrated, and prepared to sit through the ceremony.\nPlan in advance where to meet your guests after the ceremony.\nThere will be no formal processional in or out of the venue. Suggest a specific meeting spot beforehand, even if it\u2019s not in the vicinity of McCamish, to ensure you are away from others but can still find family members and reunite easily.\nView a seating chart of where in the venue your guests can look for you during the event.\nSend your guests parking information.\nNote available parking areas at\ncommencement.gatech.edu/venue-parking .\nMost importantly, remember to enjoy the day and reflect on all that you\u2019ve achieved at Georgia Tech. Congratulations, graduates!\nFor faculty and staff members: Volunteers are still needed to help Commencement run smoothly.\nLearn more and sign up .\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nCommencement Website\nContact\nKristen Bailey\nInstitute Communications\nAdditional information\nFor more information about Commencement, including parking, maps, and ticket instructions, visit\ncommencement.gatech.edu .\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
