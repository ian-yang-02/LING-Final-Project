Keynote speaker Marc Morial, president and CEO of the National Urban League, set the tone for the event by stating, \u201cAmerica is in a state of change. Embracing this change is what diversity in the 21 st\ncentury is all about. Diversity is a value for this country; it isn\u2019t limited to an office or a symposium.\u201d This \u201cstate of change\u201d was explored by James H. Johnson, Jr., distinguished professor and director of the Urban Investment Strategies Center at the University of North Carolina, during the morning sessions of the Diversity Symposium. Johnson shared how demographic disruptions will impact higher education in the next 25 years, such as the growing population in the South; the shifting immigration-driven population; the approaching \u201cSilver Tsunami\u201d from changing life expectancy, declining fertility, and aging Baby Boomers; and the increasing rate of intermarriage. \u201cOur next generation of talent must be more diverse than the current generation,\u201d said Johnson. \u201cInstitutions cannot afford to leave out anyone in the future. To anticipate these changing demographics, we must provide an alternative model of greater access and affordability.\u201d To conclude the morning sessions, ADVANCE Professors Mary Frank Fox, Pinar Keskinocak, Wing Suet Li, Dana Randall, Catherine Ross, and Beril Toktay discussed equity in faculty hiring, and Institute Diversity Associate Vice President Julie Ancis analyzed how unconscious thoughts influence behaviors at work. \u201cThis event is important because we don\u2019t pay enough attention to diversity issues in general,\u201d said Ashok Goel, professor in the School of Interactive Computing. \u201cBeing a good citizen of the community means being inclusive and embracing diversity in all of its forms.\u201d During the Diversity Symposium Awards Luncheon, Morial addressed how to redefine civil rights in the 21 st\ncentury through his \u201cThree D\u2019s of Diversity\u201d: Defend democracy by pushing against the ideas of voter suppression (or voter self-suppression). Develop human capital by educating people to be self-sufficient and successful in this society. Demand jobs for all and economic opportunity for the next generation. Prior to the keynote address, eight Diversity Champion Award winners were recognized for actively demonstrating and positively promoting the concepts of diversity, equity, and inclusion within the Georgia Tech campus community. This year\u2019s winners are Mary Lynn Realff (faculty co-winner), Stephen Ruffin (faculty co-winner), Madison Cario (staff co-winner), Matthew Hall (staff co-winner), Alex Berry (student co-winner), Andrea Welsh (student co-winner), Division of Student Life (unit co-winner), and School of Mathematics (unit co-winner). Following the Diversity Symposium Awards Luncheon, faculty, staff, and students had the opportunity to attend afternoon sessions on LGBTQIA rights; sexual violence; or bullying, incivility, and lack of collegiality in the workplace and classroom.\u00a0 \u201cThank you to the campus community members who participated in and contributed to the Diversity Symposium,\u201d said Archie W. Ervin, vice president of Institute Diversity. \u201cEvents like these are important in helping us build an inclusive community where every human being is valued and respected\u2014especially in light of recent discrimination issues.\u201d To learn more about the Diversity Symposium and/or view Johnson\u2019s presentation on disruptive demographics, visit\ndiversity.gatech.edu/seventh-annual-diversity-symposium .\nAdditional Images\nContact\nAnnette Filliat Communications Manager Institute Diversity annette.filliat@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
