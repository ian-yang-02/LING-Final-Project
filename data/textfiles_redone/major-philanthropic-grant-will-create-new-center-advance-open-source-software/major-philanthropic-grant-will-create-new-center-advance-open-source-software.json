The new center will hire half-a-dozen software engineers to write scalable, reliable, and portable open-source software for scientific research.\n\u201cScientific research involves increasingly complex software, technologies, and platforms,\u201d said\u00a0 Alessandro Orso , the software engineer and professor of computer science who is heading up the project. \u201cAlso, platforms constantly evolve, and the complexity and amount of data involved is ever-growing.\u201d\nThe result is that these software systems are often developed as prototypes that are difficult to understand, maintain, and use, which limits their efficacy and ultimately hinders scientific progress.\nSoftware engineers are trained to address these kinds of issues and know how to build high-quality software, but their time is too expensive for a typical research project\u2019s budget. In typical grants, software is often treated as a byproduct of research, meaning that limited funding is allocated for it.\nThat\u2019s where\u00a0 Schmidt Futures \u00a0comes in. Schmidt Futures is\u00a0a philanthropic initiative\u00a0founded by\u00a0 Eric \u00a0and\u00a0 Wendy \u00a0 Schmidt \u00a0that bets early on exceptional people\u00a0making the world better.\u00a0They are investing $40 million in VISS over five years at four universities: Georgia Tech, University of Washington, Johns Hopkins University, and University of Cambridge.\n\u201cSchmidt Futures\u2019 Virtual Institute for Scientific Software is a core part of our efforts to mobilize exceptional talent to solve specific hard problems in science and society,\u201d said Executive Vice President\u00a0 Elizabeth Young-McNally .\nAt Georgia Tech, the funds will hire a software engineering lead, as well as three senior and two junior software engineers. A faculty director and an advisory board will help guide the group\u2019s work, which will include collaborations with Georgia Tech scientists.\n\"We are very proud to host one of the four inaugural Schmidt Futures Virtual Institute of Scientific Software centers,\u201d said\u00a0 Charles Isbell , Dean and John P. Imlay Jr. Chair of Computing.\n\u201cGeorgia Tech\u2019s center will advance and support scientific research by applying modern software engineering practices, cutting-edge technologies, and modern tools to the development of scientific software. The center will also engage with students and researchers to train the next generation of software engineering leaders.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nContact\nAnn Claycombe, Director of Communications claycombe@cc.gatech.edu\nEmail\nclaycombe@cc.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
