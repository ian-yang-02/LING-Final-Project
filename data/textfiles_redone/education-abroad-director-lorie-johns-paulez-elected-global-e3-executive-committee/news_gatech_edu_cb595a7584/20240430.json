With more than 70 member institutions in 20 countries, the program exchanges about 300 students each year and also offers intensive language instruction and paid internship opportunities .\nJohns P\u00e1ulez will serve a three-year term on the committee, a group of faculty and staff elected by consortium members that leads the consortium.\n\u201cI am proud to represent Georgia Tech on this international stage,\u201d said Johns P\u00e1ulez. \u201cWe\u2019re proud to have been a founding member of Global E3, and we\u2019ve seen firsthand the transformative power this exchange program has for both our own undergraduates and those we\u2019ve hosted from abroad. I look forward to supporting the consortium\u2019s future and growth.\u201d\nRecognizing a growing demand for internationally experienced engineering graduates, leading universities around the world, including Georgia Tech, worked together to establish Global E3 in 1995. Since the program\u2019s inception, Georgia Tech has either sponsored or hosted more than 100 students.\nGlobal E3 is an integral part of Georgia Tech\u2019s commitment to expanding its global connectivity, which is included among the six focus areas in the Institute\u2019s strategic plan. Before the pandemic, more than 56% of Tech undergraduates participated in an international experience before graduation, and the Institute aspires to be a national leader in study abroad participation.\nTo that end, the\nEducation Abroad team in the Office of International Education\nis collaborating with faculty to offer students greater access to international programs and experiences.\n\u201cGeorgia Tech is proud to be part of Global E3, and we are thrilled that Lorie will be representing us on the consortium\u2019s executive committee,\u201d said Bernard Kippelen, vice provost for International Initiatives. \u201cGeorgia Tech is committed to developing students into globally minded and interculturally competent leaders, and we are grateful to Global E3 and other trusted international partners for offering our students such transformative experiences.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nContact\nThe Office of International Education\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
