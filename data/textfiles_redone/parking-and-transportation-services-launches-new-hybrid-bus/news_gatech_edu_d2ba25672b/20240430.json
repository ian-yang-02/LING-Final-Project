The EZ Rider II was unveiled this week and added to the Gold Route as Georgia Tech Parking and Transportation Services (PTS) takes another step toward decreasing its carbon footprint by reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\nAccording to senior director of PTS, Sherry Davidson, \u201cOur transportation team took a hard look at how we could build the future that we all wanted to see. The result was changing the way in which we operate. Moving to hybrid\u00a0improves sustainability while maintaining fiscal responsibility.\u201d\nPTS is continually looking for ways to reduce its environmental impact, and this new bus is a significant step in that direction. One of the key advantages\u00a0is its zero-emission electric mode, which allows the bus to operate fully electric for about 20% of the route. This not only helps to improve air quality but also reduces noise pollution.\n\u201cHybrid\u201d means that this new bus can switch between electric and gasoline power as needed, reducing emissions and increasing fuel efficiency. It also features advanced technologies such as regenerative braking, which captures energy normally lost during braking and uses it to recharge the bus's batteries. This not only improves fuel economy but also extends the life of the bus's braking system.\nThis new bus will also allow PTS to improve the customer experience and the efficiency of the overall transportation system. It also features automated passenger counters, automated stop announcements, and bike racks, and its low floor ramp will improve accessibility and ease of boarding for passengers.\nThis new addition to the Gold Route is the first of nine hybrid\u00a0buses to come to the Georgia Tech campus. The remaining fleet will arrive in April.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nShizelle Small-Martin\nStudent Engagement and Well-Being\nEmail\nsmartin319@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
