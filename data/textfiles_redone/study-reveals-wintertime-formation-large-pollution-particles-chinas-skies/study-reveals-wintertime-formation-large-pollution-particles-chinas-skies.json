How is it that China can produce such extreme pollution loaded with sulfates in the winter, when there\u2019s not as much sunlight and atmospheric oxidation is slow?\nYuhang Wang , professor in the\nSchool of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences\nat Georgia Tech, and his research team have conducted a study that may have the answer: All the chemical reactions needed to turn sulfur dioxide into sulfur trioxide, and then quickly into sulfate, primarily happen within the smoke plumes causing the pollution. That process not only creates sulfates in the winter in China, but it also happens faster and results in larger sulfate particles in the atmosphere.\n\u201cWe call the source \u2018in-source formation,\u2019\u201d Wang says. \u201cInstead of having oxidants spread out in the atmosphere, slowly oxidizing sulfur dioxide into sulfur trioxide to produce sulfate, we have this concentrated production in the exhaust plumes that turns the sulfuric acid into large sulfate particles. And that's why we're seeing these large sulfate particles in China.\u201d\nThe findings of in-source formation of larger wintertime sulfate particles in China could help scientists accurately assess the impacts of aerosols on\nradiative forcing\n\u2014 how climate change and global warming impact the Earth\u2019s energy and heat balances \u2014 and on health, where larger aerosols means larger deposits into human lungs.\n\u201cWintertime Formation of Large Sulfate Particles in China and Implications for Human Health,\u201d\nis published in\nEnvironmental Science & Technology ,\nan\nAmerican Chemical Society\npublication. The co-authors include\nQianru Zhang\nof Peking University and\nMingming Zheng\nof Wuhan Polytechnic University, two of Wang\u2019s former students who conducted the research while at Georgia Tech.\nExplaining a historic smog\nChina still burns a lot of coal in power plants because its costs are lower compared to natural gas, Wang says. It also makes for an easy comparison between China\u2019s hazy winters and a historic event that focused the United Kingdom\u2019s attention on dangerous environmental hazards \u2014 the Great London Smog.\nThe event, depicted in the Netflix show\n\u201cThe Crown,\u201d\nsaw severe smog descend on London in December 1952. Unusually cold weather preceded the event, which brought the coal-produced haze down to ground level. UK officials later said the Great London Smog (also called the Great London Fog) was responsible for 4,000 deaths and 100,000 illnesses, although later studies estimated a higher death toll of 10,000 to 20,000.\n\u201cFrom the days of the London Fog to extreme winter pollution in China, it has been a challenge to explain how sulfate is produced in the winter,\u201d Wang says.\nWang and his team decided to take on that challenge.\nAerosol size and heavy metal influence?\nThe higher sulfate levels in China, notably in January 2013, defy conventional explanations that relied on standard photochemical oxidation. It was thought that nitrogen dioxide or other mild oxidants found in alkaline or neutral particles in the atmosphere were the cause. But measurements revealed the resulting sulfate particles were highly acidic.\nDuring Zheng\u2019s time at Georgia Tech, \u201cShe was just looking for interesting things to do,\u201d Wang says of the former student. \u201cAnd I said, maybe this is what we should do \u2014 I wanted her to look at aerosol size distributions, how large the aerosols are.\u201d\nZheng and Wang noticed that the size of the sulfate particles from China\u2019s winter were much larger than those that resulted from photochemically-produced aerosols. Usually measuring 0.3 to 0.5 microns, the sulfate was closer to 1 micron in size. (A human hair is about 70 microns.) Aerosols distributed over a wider area would normally be smaller.\n\u201c The micron-sized aerosol observations imply that sulfate particles undergo substantial growth in a sulfur trioxide-rich environment,\u201d Wang says. Larger particles increase the risks to human health.\n\u201cWhen aerosols are large, more is deposited in the front part of the respiratory system but less on the end part, such as alveoli,\u201d he adds. \u201cWhen accounting for the large size of particles, total aerosol deposition in the human respiratory system is estimated to increase by 10 to 30 percent.\u201d\nSomething still needs to join the chemical mix, however, so the sulfur dioxide could turn into sulfur trioxide while enlarging the resulting sulfate particles. Wang says a potential pathway involves the catalytic oxidation of sulfur dioxide to sulfuric acid by \u201ctransition metals.\u201d\nHigh temperatures, acidity, and water content in the exhaust can greatly accelerate catalytic sulfur dioxide oxidation \u201ccompared to that in the ambient atmosphere. It is possible that similar heterogeneous processes occurring on the hot surface of a smokestack coated with transition metals could explain the significant portion of sulfur trioxide observed in coal-fired power plant exhaust,\u201d Wang says.\n\u201cA significant amount of sulfur trioxide is produced, either during combustion or through metal-catalyzed oxidation at elevated temperatures.\u201d\nAn opportunity for cleaner-burning coal power plants\nThe impact of in-source formation of sulfate suggests that taking measures to cool off and remove sulfur trioxide, sulfuric acid, and particulates from the emissions of coal-combustion facilities could be a way to cut down on pollution that can cause serious health problems.\n\u201cThe development and implementation of such technology will benefit nations globally, particularly those heavily reliant on coal as a primary energy source,\u201d Wang says.\nDOI:\nhttps://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.3c05645\nFunding:\nThis study was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (nos. 41821005 and 41977311).
