Such topics are discussed at length in the annual report, which is published by the Georgia Tech Information Security Center (GTISC) and the Georgia Tech Research Institute (GTRI). The report will be released this week at the 12 th\nGeorgia Tech Cyber Security Summit (GT CSS), which has become the Atlanta IT community\u2019s foremost event on cyber security. In the report, Georgia Tech covers five major areas. Observations that summarize findings in each area are as follows: Technology enables surveillance, while policy lags behind. Attackers continue to target the trust relationship between users and machines. Mobile devices fall under increasing attack, stressing the security of the ecosystem. Rogue insiders cause significant damage, but solutions are neither simple nor easy. Low-intensity online nation-state conflicts become the rule, not the exception. \u201cWe must continue to invest in research and develop technology, processes and policies that help society deal with these developments,\u201d said GTISC Director Wenke Lee. \u201cResearchers from academia, the private sector, and government must continue to work together and share information on emerging threats, make improvements to policy, and educate users.\u201d The 2014 GT CSS will be held at the GTRI Conference Center on October 29 from 9:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. The event gives researchers and stakeholders from different spheres an opportunity to come together and prepare for challenges in securing cyberspace, critical data, and cyber-connected devices.\u00a0 The event keynote will be delivered by Dave Aitel, CEO of Immunity Inc. A panel discussion, research presentations, and Birds-of-a-Feather sessions will follow.
