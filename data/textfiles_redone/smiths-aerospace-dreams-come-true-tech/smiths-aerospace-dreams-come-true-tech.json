When the time came to apply for college, he knew he wanted to study\naerospace engineering , and he knew he wanted to go to Georgia Tech \u2014 where his uncle, Robert Glenn, graduated with a degree in chemical engineering in 1994.\nNow, Smith is preparing to wrap up one chapter of his life at this weekend\u2019s Commencement ceremony, and begin a new one in Seattle, Washington, at SpaceX as an ion propulsion test engineer.\nAs he looks forward to \u201ccelebrating everything that my friends and I have been through and achieved,\u201d he takes a moment to reflect on how far he\u2019s come. \u201cGeorgia Tech was everything I expected and more,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was just as difficult as I anticipated, but people were so incredibly supportive and collaborative that I never felt like I was alone on this journey.\u201d\nAlong the way, Smith seized opportunities outside of the classroom and the lab, from being a member of the men\u2019s rowing team to promoting LGBTQ representation in the engineering sector. \u201cI try to make any team I'm on a safe space for all identities, realizing that a strong team is a diverse team,\u201d he said. One opportunity that eluded Smith as an undergraduate was study abroad. He\u2019d signed up for the Aerospace India program for Summer 2020, but Covid-19 made it impossible.\nStill, he credits Tech with \u201cpushing me to my academic limits and making me extremely resilient.\u201d Just as importantly, he said, \u201cI feel like I have the context I need about every corner of the aerospace industry to know exactly what I want to pursue and how to do it successfully.\u201d\nAnd, as many graduating seniors do, Smith has advice for students just beginning their own Georgia Tech journeys. \u201cHave fun. Tech is tough, but going through it alone is tougher,\u201d he said. \u201cOur time at the Institute really isn't that long, so I urge you to enjoy it and make as many friends as you can here. The students at Tech are some of the brightest people I've met in my life, and I've only been enriched by spending time with them and learning as much as I can from them.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nGeorgia Tech Commencement\nFall 2022 Commencement Speakers\nMission Accomplished: An Army Veteran\u2019s Path to Commencement at Georgia Tech\nBalancing Parenthood and the Pursuit of a Ph.D.\nWhat Not to Wear: Commencement Edition\u2026and Other Tips For Your Graduation Day\nCommencement Wishes\nBeth Quay: Taking Care of Unfinished Business\nReflection Speakers Highlight Tech Community\nContact\nStacy Braukman\nInstitute Communications\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
