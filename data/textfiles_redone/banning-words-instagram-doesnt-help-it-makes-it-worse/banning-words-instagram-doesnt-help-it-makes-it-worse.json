The use of those terms decreased when they were censored in 2012. But users adapted by simply making up new, almost identical words, driving up participation and support within pro-ED groups by as much as 30 percent. The Georgia Tech researchers found that these communities are still very active and thriving despite Instagram\u2019s efforts to moderate discussion of the dangerous lifestyle. People in pro-ED communities share content, and provide advice and support for those who choose eating disorders, such as anorexia or bulimia, as acceptable and reasonable ways of living. They use specific hashtags to form very connected groups, often using anonymous names to keep their lifestyle choice a secret from the families and friends. Instagram banned some of the most common pro-ED tags four years ago. People can still post these censored terms, but the words no longer show up in search results. Banned examples include \u201cthighgap,\u201d \u201cthinspiration\u201d and \u201csecretsociety.\u201d Other pro-ED words received advisories. They can be searched, but notifications about graphic content were added, along with public service links for people looking for help. The Georgia Tech researchers looked at 2.5 million pro-ED posts from 2011 to 2014 to study how the community reacted to Instagram\u2019s content moderation. \u201cPeople pretty much stopped using the banned terms, but they gamed the system to stay in touch,\u201d said Stevie Chancellor, a doctoral student who led the study. \u201c\u2019Thinspiration\u2019 was replaced by \u2018thynspiration\u2019 and \u2018thynspo.\u2019 \u2018Thighgap\u2019 became \u2018thightgap\u2019 and \u2018thygap.\u2019\u201d The 17 moderated terms morphed into hundreds of similar, new words. Each had an average of 40 variables. Some had more: the researchers found 107 variables of \u201cthighgap.\u201d Instagram\u2019s censorship polarized the pro-ED community. \u201cLikes and comments on these new tags were 15 to 30 percent higher compared to the originals,\u201d said Munmun De Choudhury, assistant professor in Georgia Tech\u2019s School of Interactive Computing. \u201cBefore the ban, a person searching for hashtags would only find their intended word. Now a search produces dozens of similar, non-censored pro-ED terms. That means more content to view and engage with.\u201d The team also found that the content on these so-called lexical variants discussed self-harm, isolation and thoughts of suicide more often than the larger community of sufferers of eating disorders. Instagram has also blacklisted words related to sex, racism and self-harm. What is more effective than banning tags? The Georgia Tech team suggests a few alternatives. \u201cAllow them to be searchable. But once they\u2019re selected, the landing page could include links for help organizations,\u201d said Chancellor. \u201cMaybe the search algorithms could be tweaked. Instead of similar terms being displayed, Instagram could introduce recovery-related terms in the search box.\u201d The study,\n\u201c#thyghgapp: Instagram Content Moderation and Lexical Variation in Pro-Eating Disorder Communities ,\u201d was presented at the\nACM Conference on Computer-Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing\non March 1 in San Francisco.\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nRead the study\nContact\nJason Maderer National Media Relations maderer@gatech.edu 404-660-2926\nEmail\nmaderer@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
