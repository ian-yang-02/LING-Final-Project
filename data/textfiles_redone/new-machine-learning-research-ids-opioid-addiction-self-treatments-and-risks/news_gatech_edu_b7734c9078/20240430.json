According to the study, the three most commonly used are:\nKratom \u2013 an unregulated herbal stimulant\nImodium \u2013 a common anti-diarrheal medication\nXanax \u2013 a psychiatric medication used to treat anxiety and panic disorders\nThe findings \u2013 part of what the researchers say is one of the first large-scale social media study of clinically unproven, alternative treatments (ATs) used in opioid addiction recovery \u2013 indicate that these treatments offer:\nRisky results\nPotentially substantial side effects\nHigh chance of abuse for those struggling with recovery\n\u201cAlong with identifying what potentially are the most commonly used alternative treatments, we documented a number of important trends and gained valuable insights into how people use ATs, which will be used in part to better inform current treatment strategies,\u201d said\nStevie Chancellor , Georgia Tech College of Computing Ph.D. student and chief author of the study.\n[PODCAST:\u00a0Social Media's Role in Opioid Addiction Recovery\u00a0with Stevie Chancellor]\nOne of the key trends documented among AT users is the growing use of \u201cstacks\u201d or \u201ckits.\u201d These combine several substances\u00ad \u2013 prescription drugs, illicit drugs, over the counter medications, vitamins/minerals, or other substances \u2013 to combat withdrawal symptoms and facilitate recovery.\nAn anonymous Reddit post evaluated in the study read, \u201cI\u2019ve decided to quit [opioids] for good - what you guys think about my withdrawal strategy?\u201d The post goes on to list what can reasonably be considered as a risky mix of anti-anxiety drugs, OTCs, alcohol, and more. Added to this, the study also found that many of these \u201cstacks\u201d have specific dosing patterns that users follow.\nTo identify these posts from among the initial dataset of 1.44 million posts from 63 subreddits, Chancellor and her colleagues developed a machine learning binary classifier. The classifier, which used a transfer learning approach to improve results as it scanned from one subreddit to the next, automatically labeled each post as either recovery or non-recovery related.\n[RELATED:\u00a0Researchers Plumb Reddit to Reveal New Insights into Stress Following Campus Violence]\nThe research team \u2013 which included an addiction research scientist \u2013 applied natural language processing techniques to the resulting dataset of 93,104 recovery-related posts. Known as \u201cword embeddings,\u201d the process allows a system to find and learn contextual relationships between words and phrases in a large dataset. These relationships often reveal connections between words that may be misspelled or slang terms for common words.\nThe results were verified through a series of automated and human-in-the-loop validation tests of the machine learning algorithm.\n\u201cWe found that Imodium, commonly used to relieve nausea and diarrhea, is often referred to as \u2018lope\u2019, which is short for the active ingredient Loperamide. We also confirm that it is prone to misuse and dependence,\u201d said Chancellor.\nIt\u2019s this kind of insight the Georgia Tech team wants to share with treatment and recovery researchers and care providers.\n\u201cBecause there is little empirical research into alternative treatments for opioid use disorder, professionals overseeing detoxification and behavioral interventions are at a disadvantage,\u201d said Munmun DeChoudhury, School of Interactive Computing assistant professor and co-author of the research study.\n\u201cBroadly speaking, we\u2019re interested in reducing harm that can be caused by alternative treatments. We are moving in the right direction by identifying and giving some context to the most commonly used of these, which ultimately gives behavioral health clinicians more insight into how ATs impact their patients.\u201d\nChancellor and De Choudhury\u2019s work on this project was supported in part by a grant from the National Institutes of Health, #R01GM112697.\nComplete details about the study are in a paper titled\nDiscovering Alternative Treatments for Opioid Use Recovery Using Social Media , which has been accepted to the 2019 ACM CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, set for May 4 through 9 in Glasgow, UK.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nAlbert Snedeker, Communications Manager\nalbert.snedeker@cc.gatech.edu\nEmail\nalbert.snedeker@cc.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
