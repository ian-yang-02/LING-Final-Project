Known as Real-Time Captcha, the technique uses a unique challenge\u00a0that\u2019s easy for humans \u2014 but difficult for attackers who may be using machine learning and image generation software to spoof legitimate users.\nThe Real-Time Captcha requires users to look into their mobile phone\u2019s built-in camera while answering a randomly-selected question that appears within a Captcha on the screens of the devices. The response must be given within a limited period of time that\u2019s too short for artificial intelligence or machine learning programs to respond. The Captcha would supplement image- and audio-based authentication techniques that can be spoofed by attackers who may be able to find and modify images, video and audio of users \u2014 or steal them from mobile devices.\nThe technique was described February 19th at the Network and Distributed Systems Security (NDSS) Symposium 2018 in San Diego, Calif. Supported by the Office of Naval Research (ONR) and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the research was conducted by cyber security specialists at the Georgia Institute of Technology.\n\u201cThe attackers now know what to expect with authentication that asks them to smile or blink, so they can produce a blinking model or smiling face in real time relatively easily,\u201d said Erkam Uzun, a graduate research assistant in Georgia Tech\u2019s\nSchool of Computer Science\nand the paper\u2019s first author. \u201cWe are making the challenge harder by sending users unpredictable requests and limiting the response time to rule out machine interaction.\u201d\nAs part of efforts to eliminate traditional passwords for logins, mobile devices and online services are moving to biometric techniques that utilize a human face, retina or other biological attribute to verify who is attempting to log in. The iPhone X is designed to unlock with the user\u2019s face, for instance, while other systems utilize short video segments of a user nodding, blinking or smiling.\nIn the cat-and-mouse game of cybersecurity, those biometrics can be spoofed or stolen, which will force companies to find better approaches, said\nWenke Lee , a professor in Georgia Tech\u2019s School of Computer Science and co-director of the Georgia Tech\nInstitute for Information Security and Privacy.\n\u201cIf the attacker knows that authentication is based on recognizing a face, they can use an algorithm to synthesize a fake image to impersonate the real user,\u201d Lee said. \u201cBut by presenting a randomly-selected challenge embedded in a Captcha image, we can prevent the attacker from knowing what to expect. The security of our system comes from a challenge that is easy for a human, but difficult for a machine.\u201d\nIn testing done with 30 subjects, the humans were able to respond to the challenges in one second or less. The best machines required between six and ten seconds to decode the question from the Captcha and respond with a faked video and audio. \u201cThis allows us to determine quickly if the response is from a machine or a human,\u201d Uzun said.\nThe new approach would require login requests to pass four tests: successful recognition of a challenge question from within a Captcha, response within a narrow time window that only humans can meet, and successful matches to both the legitimate user\u2019s pre-recorded image and voice.\n\u201cUsing face recognition alone for authentication is probably not strong enough,\u201d said Lee. \u201cWe want to combine that with Captcha, a proven technology. If you combine the two, that will make face recognition technology much stronger.\u201d\nCaptcha technology \u2013 originally an acronym for \u201cCompletely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart\u201d \u2013 is widely used to prevent bots from accessing forms on websites. It works by taking advantage of a human\u2019s superior ability to recognize patterns in images. The Real-Time Captcha approach would go beyond what\u2019s required on websites by prompting a response that will produce live video and audio that would then be matched against a user\u2019s stored security profile.\nCaptcha challenges might involve recognizing scrambled letters or solving simple math problems. The idea would be to allow humans to respond before machines can even recognize the question.\n\u201cMaking a still image smile or blink takes a machine just a few seconds, but breaking our Captcha changes takes ten seconds or more,\u201d said Uzun.\nIn trying to improve authentication, the researchers studied image spoofing software and decided to try a new approach, hoping to open a new front in the battle against attackers. The approach moves the attacker\u2019s task from that of generating convincing video to breaking a Captcha.\n\u201cWe looked at the problem knowing what the attackers would likely do,\u201d said Simon Pak Ho Chung, a research scientist in Georgia Tech\u2019s School of Computer Science. \u201cImproving image quality is one possible response, but we wanted to create a whole new game.\u201d\nThe real-time Captcha approach shouldn\u2019t significantly change bandwidth requirements since the Captcha image sent to mobile devices is small and authentication schemes were already transmitting video and audio, Chung said.\nAmong the challenges going forward is overcoming the difficulty of recognizing speech in a noisy environment and securing the connection between the device camera and the authenticating server.\n\u201cFor any security mechanism that we develop, we need to worry about the security of the mechanism first,\u201d Lee said. \u201cOnce you develop security technology, it becomes a target for the attackers, and that certainly applies to biometric technology.\u201d\nThis research was supported by the ONR under grants N0001409-1-1042, N00014-15-1-2162 and N00014-17-1-2895, and by the DARPA Transparent Computing program under contract DARPA-15-15-TCFP-006.
