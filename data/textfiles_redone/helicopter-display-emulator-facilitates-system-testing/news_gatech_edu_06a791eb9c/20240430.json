That includes evaluating how information is represented on the multi-function display (MFD) and multi-purpose display (MPD), which use symbology to display threats to aviation platforms. Until recently, that testing required the use of a real helicopter or costly display components that must be configured to operate in a laboratory environment. Thanks to an MFD/MPD emulator developed by the Georgia Tech Research Institute (GTRI) in collaboration with the Army Reprogramming Analysis Team (ARAT), the testing can now be done on ordinary laboratory computers anytime it is needed. The new emulator saves a significant amount of money and can help get software updates to deployed Army aviation forces faster. \u201cThis is an exact replica of what\u2019s on the helicopter, so when they\u2019re testing the software upgrades in the laboratory, they see exactly what the pilot is going to see in the helicopter cockpit,\u201d said William Miller, a GTRI principal research scientists who helped lead the project. \u201cWhen the final software for the electronic warfare system is deployed to the field, it is already tested with the display. That saves money and time.\u201d The project began with two days of observation into the operation of a multi-function display in operational helicopters at Dobbins Air Reserve Base north of Atlanta and Redstone Arsenal in Alabama. GTRI engineers watched as the pilots put the Aviation Survivability Equipment (ASE) through all its operations and recorded what happened on video. Next, a development team led by GTRI Research Scientist Heyward Adams began developing the emulator in a standard military Windows-based computer, using cards to simulate the sensors that would normally be providing data to the MFD. The emulator plugs into the aircraft\u2019s 1553 bus, and can simulate inputs from two radar warning receivers: the AN/APR 39A(V)1/4 and AN/APR 48A . Though the lab-based computer isn\u2019t flight-worthy, it provides the exact look-and-feel of the Apache and Black Hawk EW systems so Army mission software developers can make sure the graphical elements are clear and correct. \u201cWe ingest the data that\u2019s coming out of the cards just like the real hardware would in the helicopter and represent it accurately,\u201d Adams said. \u201cThe graphics we generate provide the exact look and feel, which we showed to pilots of the helicopter to make sure we were accurate.\u201d The emulator is already in use by Army mission software developers in the ARAT laboratories in Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD. The GTRI researchers say the system could be easily adapted to other aircraft. \u201cThe framework we used to develop the emulator is scalable, so it\u2019s not tied to just one specific multi-function display,\u201d Adams said. \u201cOur system is set up in such a way that we could quickly and cost-effectively emulate other systems, or even an entire cockpit.\u201d The ASE tracks threats such as surface-to-air missiles. Because the helicopters fly at low altitudes, there\u2019s little time to react, and no time for errors. Most threats are handled automatically, but the crew needs to know what is happening at all times. \u201cFor pilots flying these helicopters, this is a primary display for all the threat information they are encountering,\u201d said Miller. \u201cThis is their lifeline, and pilots have to be confident that the system will work right every time.\u201d Research News Georgia Institute of Technology 177 North Avenue Atlanta, Georgia 30332-0181 USA Media Relations Contacts : John Toon (404-894-6986) ( jtoon@gatech.edu ) or Ben Brumfield (404-385-1933) ( ben.brumfield@comm.gatech.edu ).
