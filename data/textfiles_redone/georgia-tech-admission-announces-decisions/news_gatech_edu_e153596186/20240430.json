Of those applicants, 18% were offered admission, including 2,785 on Saturday, March 13. They join the 5,320 students who were admitted in December and January as part of the Early Action 1 and 2 rounds.\nThis year\u2019s admitted students are not only academically talented, but also extremely diverse. The\n2021 admitted class\nincludes 28% more Black students, 20% more first-generation students, and 12% more Hispanic students than were offered admission last year.\n\u201cGeorgia Tech\u2019s new strategic plan is clear that expanding access and amplifying impact are institutional priorities. As a result, we are growing the size of our incoming class by 5%, to 3,450, as well as enrolling more Georgians than ever before,\u201d said Rick Clark, director of Undergraduate Admission.\nAfter months of reading applications, the admission team now turns its attention to convincing these students to choose Tech. \u201cMost of our accepted students not only have admission offers from several other great schools around the country, but frequently they receive generous scholarships and financial aid awards as well,\u201d Clark said.\nIn a normal spring, several thousand students and their families would visit Atlanta for tours of campus and sessions tailored to their academic interests. Due to the pandemic, however, that will not be the case this year. Instead, Undergraduate Admission will be hosting virtual programs and events to connect admitted students to current students and one another.\nClark noted that, \u201cThis year, more than ever before, it is imperative that our entire campus community step up to congratulate, welcome, and engage our admitted students and their families.\u201d\nSince Tech\u2019s deposit deadline is Monday, May 3, most academic units have begun hosting virtual information sessions, and several deans and school chairs are writing and calling their admitted students. Departments looking for ways to engage in these efforts should contact the Office of Undergraduate Admission.\nOn March 12, Raheem Beyah, dean and Southern Company Chair in Georgia Tech\u2019s College of Engineering, joined the recruitment efforts by\nvirtually congratulating two students\nfrom Peach County High School in Peach County, Georgia on their acceptances.\n\u201cHaving the opportunity to tell Kennede and Ariam that they got in was an honor,\u201d Beyah said. \u201cThese high school seniors who will join us in the fall are the absolute best and brightest, and we at the College are lucky to have them choose Georgia Tech to pursue their degree. All of our newly accepted students will do amazing things here at Tech, and we are all looking forward to witnessing their journey.\u201d\nGeorgia Tech\u2019s overall decision breakdown (including Early Action 1 and 2, and Regular Decision):\nAdmitted: 18%\nGeorgia Admit Rate: 32%\nNon-Georgia Admit Rate: 14%\nWhile many applicants were not offered admission to the first-year class, more than 8,500 received a one- or two-year transfer pathway. Over the last few years the Office of Undergraduate Admission has consistently added these programs to provide students another route to a Georgia Tech degree, including the newest one, the\nAtlanta Public Schools Pathway Program . In fact, last year 53% of Tech\u2019s more than 1,100 transfer students entered through one of these eight\npathways .\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\n2021 Admitted Class\nTransfer Pathway Programs\nContact\nVictor Rogers\nInstitute Communications\nEmail\nvictor.rogers@comm.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
