Of those applicants, 17% were offered admission.\nThe admitted class is comprised of 11% first-generation college students (neither parent graduated from college); 21% identify as Black or Hispanic; and 56% are men and 44% are women. The admission goal for the new first-year class is 3,575 students.\n\u201cIn a year when many colleges around the country are experiencing enrollment and application declines, Georgia Tech is thriving,\u201d said Rick Clark, director of Undergraduate Admission. \u201cExpanding access to more students from a variety of backgrounds is core to our mission and strategic plan. As a result, this year we will enroll our largest first-year class in Institute history \u2014 500 larger than it was three years ago when President Cabrera began his tenure on campus.\u201d\nAdmitted students hail from 102 nations, all 50 states (plus the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico), and 112 Georgia counties. The admit rate for Georgia students is 35%; for non-Georgia students the admit rate is 13%.\n\u201cThese students are incredibly talented academically and have had a significant impact and influence on their high schools and local communities,\u201d Clark said. \u201cAt this point, most of them are weighing admission offers and generous financial aid packages from some of the very best colleges in the U.S. In the weeks ahead, many admitted students will be on campus for tours or information sessions.\u00a0Ultimately, enrolling a new class of Yellow Jackets is a community effort, and I\u2019m thankful we have invested partners across our amazing campus to accomplish that collective goal. If you have the opportunity to speak with an admitted student leading up to the May 1 national deposit deadline, my hope is you will share your Tech experience, answer their individual questions, and help them make meaningful connections.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nContact\nVictor Rogers\nInstitute Communications\nEmail\nvictor.rogers@comm.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
