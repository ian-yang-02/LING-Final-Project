The overall admit rate was 36% for Georgia residents and 12% for non-residents.\nOverall, admitted students hail from 103 countries, all 50 states plus the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, 125 Georgia counties, and 3,250 high schools. The admitted class is comprised of 10% first-generation college students (neither parent graduated from college), and 55% are men and 45% are women.\n\u201cOur goal is to enroll students who will not only thrive on campus, but also help Tech fulfill its mission to develop leaders who advance technology and improve the human condition,\u201d said Rick Clark, assistant vice provost and executive director of Undergraduate Admission. \u201cThe students we have offered admission to this year are incredibly talented academically and have had a significant impact and influence on their high schools and local communities.\u201d\nExpanding access, growing undergraduate enrollment, and creating more options for students are key pieces of the Institute's strategic plan. To achieve those goals, Tech plans to enroll a first-year class of approximately 3,750 students, which is about 100 more than last year and will represent a record high for the Institute. Also, 500 of the first-year students will begin on the Atlanta campus this summer, and 100 students will begin either at GT-Europe or in Oxford, England.\n\u201cUnlike many of our peer institutions nationally, we are intentionally increasing enrollment,\u201d Clark said. \u201cIn fact, between first-year, transfer, and dual enrollment students, Tech will enroll more than 6,000 new undergraduates in 2023.\u201d\nIn the weeks ahead, the\nOffice of Undergraduate Admission\nwill host a variety of programs on campus for admitted students, as well as\ncustomized tours and information sessions . Currently, 1,800 students have committed to attend Tech, but admitted students have until May 1 to make their deposit.\n\u201cRecruitment and enrollment are a community effort,\u201d Clark added. \u201cI\u2019m deeply thankful that we have engaged campus partners who are committed to helping us achieve our goals and bring in the best new class of Yellow Jackets possible.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nAdmission Delivers Early Action 2 Decisions\nGeorgia Tech Admission Delivers Early Action 1 Decisions\nContact\nVictor Rogers\nInstitute Communications\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
