Earl L. \u201cBuddy\u201d Carter from Georgia\u2019s 1st\u00a0District visited Atlanta recently, one of his top priorities was meeting with the experts at Georgia Tech\u2019s 20,000-square-foot\u00a0 Advanced Manufacturing Pilot Facility \u00a0(AMPF). Carter was recently named the House Energy and Commerce Committee\u2019s chair of the Environment, Manufacturing, and Critical Materials Subcommittee, a group that concerns itself primarily with contamination of soil, air, noise, and water, as well as emergency environmental response, whether physical or cybersecurity. Carter was recently named the House Energy and Commerce Committee\u2019s chair of the Environment, Manufacturing, and Critical Materials Subcommittee, a group that concerns itself primarily with contamination of soil, air, noise, and water, as well as emergency environmental response, whether physical or cybersecurity. Because AMPF\u2019s focus dovetails with subcommittee interests, the facility was a fitting stop for Carter, who was welcomed for an afternoon tour and series of live demonstrations. Programs within Georgia Tech\u2019s\u00a0 Enterprise Innovation Institute \u00a0\u2014\u00a0specifically the\u00a0 Georgia Artificial Intelligence in Manufacturing \u00a0(Georgia AIM) and\u00a0 Georgia Manufacturing Extension Partnership \u00a0(GaMEP) \u2014 were well represented. \u201cInnovation is extremely important,\u201d Carter said during his April 1 visit. \u201cIn order to handle some of our problems, we\u2019ve got to have adaptation, mitigation, and innovation. I\u2019ve always said that the greatest innovators, the greatest scientists in the world, are right here in the United States. I\u2019m so proud of Georgia Tech and what they do for our state and for our nation.\u201d Carter\u2019s AMPF visit began with an introduction by Tom Kurfess, executive director of the\u00a0 Georgia Tech Manufacturing Institute ; Steven Ferguson, principal research scientist and\u00a0 managing director at Georgia AIM ; research engineer\u00a0 Kyle Saleeby ; and Donna Ennis, the\u00a0 Enterprise Innovation Institute \u2019s director of community engagement and program development, and co-director of Georgia AIM. Ennis provided an overview of Georgia AIM, while Ferguson spoke on the Manufacturing 4.0 Consortium and Kurfess detailed the AMPF origin story, before introducing four live demonstrations. The first of these featured\u00a0 Chuck Easley , Professor of the Practice in the Scheller College of Business, who elaborated on supply chain issues. Afterward Alan Burl of\u00a0 EPICS: Enhanced Preparation for Intelligent Cybermanufacturing Systems \u00a0and mechanical engineer Melissa Foley led a brief information session on hybrid turbine blade repair. Finally, GaMEP project manager Michael Barker expounded on GaMEP\u2019s cybersecurity services, and Deryk Stoops of\u00a0 Central Georgia Technical College \u00a0detailed the Georgia AIM-sponsored AI robotics training program at the\u00a0 Georgia Veterans Education Career Transition Resource \u00a0(VECTR) Center, which offers training and assistance to those making the transition from military to civilian lif e. The topic of artificial intelligence, in all its subtlety and nuance, was of particular interest to Carter. \u201cAI is the buzz in Washington, D.C.,\u201d he said. \u201cWhether it be healthcare, energy [or] science, we on the Energy and Commerce Committee look at it from a sense [that there\u2019s] a very delicate balance, and we understand the responsibility. But we want to try to benefit from this as much as we can.\u201d He continued: \u201cI heard something today I haven\u2019t heard before, and that is instead of calling it artificial intelligence, we refer to it as \u2018augmented intelligence.\u2019 I think that\u2019s a great term, and certainly something I\u2019m going to take back to Washington with me.\u201d Said Ennis, \u201cIt was a pleasure to host Rep. Carter for a firsthand look at AMPF, which is uniquely positioned to offer businesses the opportunity to collaborate with Georgia Tech researchers and students and to hear about Georgia AIM.\u201d She added, \u201cAt Georgia AIM, we\u2019re committed to making the state a leader in artificial intelligence-assisted manufacturing, and we\u2019re grateful for Congressman Carter\u2019s interest and support of our efforts.\u201d\nAdditional Media\nContact\nEve Tolpa eve.tolpa@innovate.gatech.edu\nEmail\neve.tolpa@innovate.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
