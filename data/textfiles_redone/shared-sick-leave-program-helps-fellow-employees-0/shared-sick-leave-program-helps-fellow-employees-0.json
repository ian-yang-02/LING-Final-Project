The Shared Sick Leave Program allows employees to donate unused sick leave to a pool where it can be used by other Georgia Tech employees who have used all of their accumulated paid leave but are experiencing serious health conditions.\nTo enroll in the Shared Sick Leave program, a minimum donation of eight hours (prorated for part-time employees) is required. (Donations may not exceed 80 hours.) After making your donation, employees must have a minimum of 40 sick leave hours (prorated for part-time employees) remaining as of Jan. 1, 2023 The transfer of your donated leave to the Shared Leave pool is expected to occur during the first week of January 2023. Only employees who are enrolled in the Shared Sick Leave program are eligible to receive donations from the pool if they run out of their own accrued sick leave.\nIf you are already a member of the Shared Sick Leave program, donations are not required each year and are voluntary unless the pool is considered depleted. If you are not sure if you are already a member of the Shared Sick Leave program, contact the\nAdministrative Service Center online\nor by phone at 404.385.1111.\nQualified requests for leave hours from the pool include conditions or circumstances that meet the Family and Medical Leave Act\u2019s definition of a serious health condition, including the birth of a child.\nMembership in the pool is open to full-time and part-time employees who have met their six-month probationary period. Shared sick leave cannot be used in conjunction with Workers Compensation, or short- or long-term disability.\n\u201cBeing a member of the program was a life saver,\u201d said one enrollee who benefited from it. \u201cHaving this extra layer of income protection at a time when I needed it most was greatly appreciated.\u201d\nLeave donations cannot be withdrawn, but members are allowed to withdraw or resume membership each year during Open Enrollment. Employees enrolled in the Optional Retirement Plan who are nearing retirement are encouraged to consider participating, because their unused sick leave hours\u00a0 cannot be cashed in or used toward creditable service at retirement.\nGeorgia Tech Human Resources is the administrator for the Shared Sick Leave program. If the pool drops to fewer than 120 hours, all members will be notified of the depleted pool status, and each member will automatically be charged eight hours of sick time to replenish the pool.\nRegistration for the pool will be available during 2023 Open Enrollment, which runs from Oct. 24 through Nov. 4. For questions about qualified requests, donating hours, or involvement in the pool, contact the\nAdministrative Service Center online\nor by phone at 404.385.1111.\nMore details about the program can be found at\nhr.gatech.edu/shared-sick-leave .\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nShared Sick Leave Program\nContact the Administrative Services Center\nOpen Enrollment Information\nOneUSG Connect\nContact\nChaundra Grant\nHuman Resources\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
