Credit:\u00a0Georgia Tech / Ayazi lab\nApr 15, 2020\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nDuring a stroll, a woman\u2019s breathing becomes a slight bit shallower, and a monitor in her clothing alerts her to get a telemedicine check-up.\u00a0 A new study \u00a0details how a sensor chip smaller than a ladybug records multiple lung and heart signals along with body movements and could enable such a future socially distanced health monitor.\nThe core mechanism of the chip developed by researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology involves two finely manufactured layers of silicon, which overlay each other separated by the space of 270 nanometers \u2013 about 0.000001 inches. They carry a minute voltage.\nVibrations from bodily motions and sounds put part of the chip in very slight motion, making the voltage flux, thus creating readable electronic outputs. In human testing, the chip has recorded a variety of signals from the mechanical workings of the lungs and the heart with clarity, signals that often escape meaningful detection by current medical technology.\n\u201cRight now, medicine looks to\u00a0 EKGs (electrocardiograms ) for information on the heart, but EKGs only measure electrical impulses. The heart is a mechanical system with muscles pumping and valves opening and shutting, and it sends out a signature of sounds and motions, which an EKG does not detect. EKGs also say nothing about lung function,\u201d said\u00a0 Farrokh Ayazi, Ken Byers Professor in Georgia Tech\u2019s School of Electrical and Computer Engineering .\nStethoscope-accelerometer combo\nThe chip, which acts as an advanced\u00a0 electronic stethoscope \u00a0and accelerometer in one, is aptly called an accelerometer contact microphone. It detects vibrations that enter the chip from inside the body while keeping out distracting noise from outside the body's core like airborne sounds\n\u201cIf it rubs on my skin or shirt, it doesn\u2019t hear the friction, but the device is very sensitive to sounds coming at it from inside the body, so it picks up useful vibrations even through clothing,\u201d Ayazi said.\nThe detection bandwidth is enormous -\u00a0from broad, sweeping motions to inaudibly high-pitched tones. Thus, the sensor chip records all at once fine details of the heartbeat, waves the heart sends through the body, and respiration rates and lung sounds. It even tracks the wearer\u2019s physical activities such as walking.\nThe signals are recorded in sync, potentially offering the big picture of a patient\u2019s heart and lung health. For the study, the researchers successfully recorded a \u201cgallop,\u201d a faint third sound after the \u201club-dub\u201d of the heartbeat. Gallops are normally elusive clues of heart failure.\nThe researchers published their results\u00a0 in the journal\u00a0 npj Digital Medicine \u00a0on February 12, 2020. The research was funded by the Georgia Research Alliance, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the National Science Foundation, and the National Institutes of Health. Study coauthor Divya Gupta, M.D., a cardiologist at Emory University, collaborated in testing the chip on human participants.\nHermetically sealed vacuum\nMedical research has tried to make better use of the body\u2019s mechanical signals for decades but recording some \u2013 like waves traversing multiple tissues \u2013 has proven inconsistent, while others \u2013 like gallops \u2013 have relied upon clinician skills influenced by human error. The new chip produces high-resolution, quantified data that future research could match to pathologies in order to identify them.\n\u201cWe are working already to collect significantly more data matched with pathologies. We envision algorithms in the future that may enable a broad array of clinical readings,\u201d Ayazi said.\nThough the chip\u2019s main engineering principle is simple, making it work and then manufacturable took Ayazi\u2019s lab ten years, mainly because of the Lilliputian scale of the gap between the silicon layers, i.e. electrodes. If the 2-millimeter by 2-millimeter sensor chip were expanded to the size of a football field, that air gap would be about an inch wide.\n\u201cThat very thin gap separating the two electrodes cannot have any contact, not even by forces in the air in between the layers, so the whole sensor is hermetically sealed inside a vacuum cavity,\u201d Ayazi said. \u201cThis makes for that ultralow signal noise and breadth of bandwidth that are unique.\u201d\nDetects through clothing\nThe researchers used a manufacturing process developed in Ayazi\u2019s lab called the\u00a0 HARPSS+ platform (High Aspect Ratio Poly and Single Crystalline Silicon) \u00a0for mass production, running off hand-sized sheets that were then cut into the tiny sensor chips. HARPSS+ is the first reported mass manufacturing process that achieves such consistently thin gaps, and it has enabled high-throughput manufacturing of many such advanced MEMS, or microelectromechanical systems.\nThe experimental device is currently battery-powered and uses a second chip called a signal-conditioning circuit to translate the sensor chip\u2019s signals into patterned read-outs.\nThree sensors or more could be inserted into a chest band that would triangulate health signals to locate their sources. Someday a device may pinpoint an emerging heart valve flaw by turbulence it produces in the bloodstream or identify a cancerous lesion by faint crackling sounds in a lung.\nHere's how to\u00a0 subscribe to our free science and technology\u00a0newsletter\nAlso read:\nDigital tool helps with tough COVID19 decision\nThese researchers co-authored the study: Pranav Gupta (first author), Mohammad Moghimi, Yaesuk Jeong and Omer Inan from Georgia Tech.
