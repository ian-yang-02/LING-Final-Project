However, much of the work has progressed via instinct and trial and error. Now, researchers from Princeton Engineering and Georgia Tech have developed a general formula that analyzes how structures can be configured to thin, remain unaffected, or thicken as they are stretched, pushed, or bent.\nIn a\npaper\npublished August 3 in the\nProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , the researchers lay out their general rule for the way a broad class of origami responds to stress. The rule applies to origami formed from parallelograms (such as a square, rhombus, or rectangle) made of thin material. In their article, the researchers use origami to explore how structures respond to certain kinds of mechanical stress \u2013 for example, how a rectangular sponge swells in a bowtie shape when squeezed in the middle of its long sides. Of particular interest was how materials behave when stretched, like a stick of chewing gum that thins as it is pulled at both ends. The ratio of compression along one axis with stretching along the other is called the Poisson ratio.\n\u201cMost materials have a positive Poisson ratio. If, for example, you pick up a rubber band and stretch it, it will become thinner and thinner before it breaks,\u201d said\nGlaucio Paulino , professor at Princeton. \u201cCork has a zero Poisson ratio, and that is the only reason you can put the cork back in a wine bottle. Otherwise, you would break the bottle.\u201d\nThe researchers were able to write a set of equations to predict how origami-inspired structures will behave under this kind of stress. They then used the equations to create origami structures with a negative Poisson ratio \u2013 origami structures that grew wide instead of narrower when their ends were pulled, or structures that snapped into dome shapes when bent instead of sagging into a saddle shape.\n\u201cWith origami you can do this,\u201d said Paulino, who is a professor of civil and environmental engineering and the Princeton materials institute. \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing effect of geometry.\u201d\nJames McInerney , who is the study\u2019s first author and a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Michigan, said the team created the equations to understand the property of symmetry in the structures. Symmetry means something that remains the same under certain transformation. For example, if you spin a square 180 degrees around an axis running between the centers of two sides, its shape remains the same.\n\u201cThings that are symmetrical deform in expected ways in certain conditions,\u201d McInerney said. By finding those symmetries in the origami, the researchers were able to create a system of equations that governed how the structure would respond to stress.\nMcInerney said that the process was more complex than defining the symmetry rules because some of the folds resulted in deformations that did not obey the rules. He said generally the deformations made in the same plane as the paper (or thin material being folded) obeyed the rules, and those out of the plane broke the rules. \u201cThey broke the symmetry, but they broke the symmetry in a way that we could predict,\u201d he said.\nD. Zeb Rocklin , an assistant physics professor at the Georgia Tech School of Physics and a co-author, said that origami presented a fascinating and contradictory behavior.\n\u201cUsually, if you take a thin sheet or slab and you pull on it, it will retract in the middle. If you take the same sheet and bend it upwards, it will usually form a Pringle \u2013 or saddle \u2013 shape. Some materials instead thicken when you pull on them, and those always form domes rather than saddles. The amount of thinning\u00a0always\u00a0predicts the amount of bending\u201d he said. \u201cThe bending of these origami is exactly the opposite of all conventional materials. Why is that?\u201d\nResearchers have spent years seeking to define rules governing different classes of origami, with different folding patterns and shapes. But Rocklin said the research team discovered the class of origami was not important. It was the way the folds interacted that was key. To understand why origami seemed to defy movement usually defined by Poisson\u2019s ratio \u2013 growing wider when pulled, for example \u2013 he researchers needed to understand how the interaction affected the movement of the entire structure. When artists fold the sheet so that it moves along its plane \u2013 for example, corrugating it so it can expand and contract \u2013 they also introduce a bend that moves the sheet into the saddle shape.\n\u201cIt is a hidden mode that comes along for the ride,\u201d Rocklin said.\nRocklin said by examining this hidden connection, the researchers were able to explain \u201cthis weird mode of the sheet doing opposite of what was expected.\u201d\n\u201cAnd we have a symmetry of that that explains why it does the exact opposite,\u201d he said.\nIn the future, the researchers intend to build on their work by examining more complex systems.\n\u201cWe would like to try to validate this for different patterns, different configurations; to make sense of the theory and validate it,\u201d Paulino said. \u201cFor example, we need to investigate patterns such as the blockfold pattern, which is quite intriguing.\u201d\nThe research article\nDiscrete symmetries control geometric mechanics in parallelogram-based origami\nwas published online Aug 3 in the\nProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .\nAdditional Images\nContact\nGeorgia Parmelee\nEmail\ngeorgia.parmelee@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
