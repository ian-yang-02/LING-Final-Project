The Fulbright U.S Student Program provides grants for individually designed study/research projects or for English Teaching Assistant Programs. Candidates submit a proposal defining activities to take place during one academic year in a participating country outside the U.S.\nFulbright grants vary by country and type of award, and they typically cover travel costs and living expenses for the grantee and the dependents who accompany them.\nThis year\u2019s Fulbright recipients are:\nNicholas Isaf graduated in May with a bachelor\u2019s degree in mechanical engineering and a minor in Chinese. He is eager to begin his placement as an English teaching assistant in Taiwan, a country he visited briefly before starting at Georgia Tech. While in Taiwan he realized the impact he could have on the lives of young people, and he plans to embrace every opportunity to share his infectious sense of adventure with his students.\nChloe Kiernicki graduated in May with a B.S. in architecture and a minor in international affairs and global development. She will expand her knowledge of sustainable architecture while studying for her master\u2019s degree at Tampere University in Finland. She will study environmental design, especially as it relates to housing and public spaces, and the reuse of Nordic materials in new construction.\nMorgan Knowlton graduated in May with a bachelor\u2019s degree in industrial engineering and a minor in engineering and business through the Steven A. Denning Technology & Management Program. She will be a teaching assistant in the English language classroom in La Rioja, Spain, which borders the Basque region where her father\u2019s family comes from. She is looking forward to representing the U.S. as a cultural ambassador in Spain, having held ambassadorial roles as a Georgia Tech student.\nAndrew White, a 2019 graduate with a B.S. in civil engineering, will pursue a master\u2019s in environmental management at Lancaster University in the United Kingdom. He will examine the complex environmental challenges related to global food systems, water resources, and renewable energy. He aspires to build a career devoted to improving the security of interdependent food, energy, and water systems through planning and development.\n\u201cI am thrilled with the success of our Fulbright applicants this year \u2014 a year described by the Fulbright U.S. Student Program as \u2018the most competitive Fulbright selection process in its 75-year history\u2019 due to the impacts of Covid-19,\u201d said Karen Mura, prestigious fellowships advisor in the Office of Undergraduate Education. \u201cI am confident that our four award recipients will embrace their new roles as cultural ambassadors and global representatives of Georgia Tech with curiosity, compassion, and integrity.\u201d\nFulbright applications are open for 2022-23.
