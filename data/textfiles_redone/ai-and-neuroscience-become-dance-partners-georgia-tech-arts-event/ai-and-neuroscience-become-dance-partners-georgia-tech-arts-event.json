With assistance from College of Engineering researchers,\nGeorgia Tech Arts\nand\nTerminus Ballet Theatre (TMBT)\nwill mix dance with the fields of neuroscience, technology, and artificial intelligence (AI) to create a unique performance. TMBT dancers will perform excerpts of\nInterActions | Boundaries of Sensory Experience , a work-in-progress that is a physical embodiment of neuroscience and an exploration of the ethics and mechanics of how it\u2019s used in AI technologies.\nGeorgia Tech researchers have been meeting with the choreographer, Troy Schumacher, and the ballet company for the last year and a half to shape the concept, which explores ideas at the forefront of mechanical interventions into the human body and mind.\n\u201cI think the arts can be a really powerful way to bring people from all backgrounds into a conversation about science and technology,\u201d said\nChris Rozell , a professor in the\nSchool of Electrical and Computer Engineering\nwho has worked on the project since its genesis. \u201cMy goal is to facilitate that conversation by helping to translate between the scientists doing amazing work and the artists who are approaching these ideas from the perspective of making something beautiful.\u201d\nGeorgia Tech Arts and TMBT have dubbed the project the \u201cGrand Neuroethics Challenge.\u201d\n\u201cA lot of the concepts, technologies, research, and ethics we've been discussing in this work are extremely complicated, but what's come through for me is that a lot of their work is going to have profound implications for the future of humanity,\u201d said Schumacher. \u201cSo, for this ballet, I've decided to focus on the emotional relationship to brain-machine interfaces, while touching on what I've learned so far. I've spent most of my career collaborating with artists with little to no relationship to dance, but nothing quite as complex and fascinating as this.\u201d\nAaron Shackelford, director of Georgia Tech Arts, said the project is a worthwhile endeavor because it offers a case study as to the importance of collaboration between artists and researchers, while demonstrating the importance of the arts in the mission and strategic plan of Georgia Tech.\n\u201cWe recognize that the arts are critical to championing innovation and creativity at Georgia Tech,\u201d said Shackelford. \u201cOur mission is to develop leaders who advance technology and improve the human condition. The arts \u2014 and artists \u2014 provide a vital avenue for pursuing this work. This project illuminates the impact of artists and researchers coming together to mutually inspire and learn from each other, while inviting audiences to participate in the discussions about their discoveries.\u201d\n\u201cAs a director coming from an arts/dance background and facilitator to this project, I have become fascinated with the work of the scientists during the conceiving/creation process and how this gets interwoven into the choreography and dancers\u2019 bodies,\u201d said John Welker, TMBT\u2019s artistic director.\u00a0\u201cIn any collaboration,\u00a0there are surprises that are part of my joy for discovery, but this particular process has made me so much more aware and appreciative of the intimate\u00a0connection between our minds' intention and how that is carried out through the movement of our bodies.\u201d\nThis Friday will be more than a dance performance. It will also include talks from the researchers involved in the project and opportunities for audience to ask questions. Rozell will discuss his work on AI and its applications in treating depression.\nChethan Pandarinath , assistant professor in the\nWallace H. Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering at Emory University and Georgia Tech , will talk about his AI research and how the brain controls movement. They\u2019ll be joined by Karen Rommelfanger, director of Emory\u2019s Neuroethics Program.\nRommelfanger knows the field of neuroscience can introduce complex words and concepts. When mixed with dance, however, she sees the project as a powerful opportunity for audiences to engage with multiple modalities of sensation and comprehension.\n\u201cI believe neuroscience brings great hope and promise for humanity. But my\u00a0fear is that the promise of the field will be undermined by a deterioration of trust related to a real and hyped threats of unconsidered ways neuroscience might interface with individuals and society,\u201d said Rommelfanger.\u201d My hope is that this project will invite audiences, including myself, to challenge and surface our unspoken values and assumptions about the brain and technologies that interface with it.\u201d\nFriday\u2019s event starts at 8pm at the\nFerst Center for the Arts .\nTickets are just $10 . The full work, which is made possible in part through a grant from the Charles Loridans Foundation, will premiere on campus next fall.\n\u201cI\u2019m excited to see how something as abstract as the concepts in neuroscience, neurotechnology, and neuroethics can be translated into dance,\u201d Rozell said. \u201cAs a researcher, we can get really caught up in the technical details. I can\u2019t wait to see how those details turn into an overall impression that is both beautiful and gives us a new way to think about what we do.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nContact\nJason Maderer\nCollege of Engineering\nmaderer@gatech.edu\nEmail\nmaderer@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
