For the four students selected as reflection speakers, it presents an opportunity to address their fellow graduates, professors, and family members.\nAt each of Georgia Tech\u2019s Spring Commencement ceremonies (master\u2019s, Ph.D., and two bachelor\u2019s), a graduating student is given three minutes to deliver an inspiring message. The bachelor\u2019s speakers are Daivi Patel, a computer science major, and Enyinda Boms, a chemical and biomolecular engineering major. The master\u2019s speaker is Nicholas Ohl, who is earning a degree in computer science. And the Ph.D. speaker is Ruxandra Duca in aerospace engineering.\nStudents must apply to become a reflection speaker. A panel of faculty, staff, and students selects a group of finalists who present a full version of their speech to the committee. The reflection speakers are required to work with Tech\u2019s Communication Center in preparation for the ceremony.\nDaivi Patel\nDaivi Patel applied to be a reflection speaker because she thought it would be a unique opportunity to express herself and share her Georgia Tech experience.\n\u201cThe bigger aspect was that I thought it would make my parents proud,\u201d she said. \u201cIt did end up annoying my younger sister because she doesn\u2019t want to watch me speak. It\u2019s a sibling rivalry thing, but she is actually excited.\u201d\nPatel will speak about how resilient the class has been during the pandemic.\n\u201cI asked my peers and professors to describe us, and a lot of them mentioned how we\u2019ve persevered through these difficult times. When I reflected on my own experience, I felt so proud of how I got through college during such a huge change in everyone\u2019s lives,\u201d she said. \u201cWe all did that.\u201d\nPatel will work as a software engineer at Microsoft in Seattle beginning in August. Her parents and her sister, Aishvi, are coming from Denver for Commencement. Two of her friend groups, Beyblades and Hibmos, also will be there.\n\u201cI would like to thank the members of Alpha Kappa Psi, the business fraternity, who taught me to speak well enough to be given this honor, and the members of Ramblin\u2019 Raas, a competitive team for dance and Indian culture, who gave me the confidence and courage to do this.\u201d\nEnyinda Boms\nSince attending New Student Convocation, Enyinda Boms has known he wanted to be the reflection speaker at Commencement. He dreamed of sharing the memories gained and inspiring his fellow graduates as they transition into the next phase of life.\n\u201cBeing a speaker will be one of the few ways I can pour back into the Institute, hoping to have the same effect Georgia Tech has had on me,\u201d he said. The theme of his speech is how resiliency can be an important factor in life beyond college.\n\u201cI believe resiliency is one of the key traits we should possess as we progress through life,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom relationships, to work, to passion projects, resiliency can wear many hats, but it does not change the impact it can have in one\u2019s life.\u201d\nBoms was born in Port Harcourt, Nigeria and grew up in Nolensville, Tennessee. He will work with Capital One beginning this fall, and he plans to go back for a master\u2019s in computer science or MBA.\nHe will celebrate Commencement with his family, close friends, and supporters. \u201cWithout them, I would not be who I am today,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to thank every single person who has been here along the journey with me. It has not been easy, and it does not stop here.\u201d\nNicholas Ohl\nNicholas Ohl enjoys public speaking. So, he thought being a speaker at Commencement was a good way to reflect on his two years as a student in the Online Master of Science in Computer Science (OMSCS) program and cap off the program in a meaningful way.\n\u201cI think that being selected as the graduation speaker substantiates the value of the online program, and I hope to represent my fellow master\u2019s graduates and OMSCS community well,\u201d he said.\n\u201c As an online student, my master\u2019s program was inherently different from the traditional picture we have of higher education. I approached writing my speech from this lens, wanting to acknowledge that each graduate had their own unique master\u2019s experience while emphasizing the commonalities that we share,\u201d Ohl said.\nThe main theme of his speech is leveraging the knowledge gained in graduate school to make a difference in our communities, and to pursue lifelong learning beyond formal education.\n\u201cI am incredibly thankful to have had the opportunity to earn a master\u2019s degree from Georgia Tech. I do not think that I would have pursued one without a non-traditional option like the OMSCS program, and am proud to be a new alumnus of Tech.\u201d\nHis parents, sister, and partner will celebrate Commencement with him. \u201cMy family does not know that I am speaking yet, so that will be a nice surprise for them once they arrive in Atlanta,\u201d he said.\nRuxandra Duca\nFor Ruxandra Duca, the Ph.D. experience has been different from any other student experience she has had. She has thought about it a lot over the last couple of years, trying to get to the root of her emotions.\n\u201cMy friends seemed inspired by ideas I shared in random conversations, and we had a few \u2018aha\u2019 moments. I thought it would be cool to share them further,\u201d Duca said, and she wrote and submitted a speech to be the student speaker.\n\u201c\u200bThe first part of my speech is a reflection on the Ph.D. journey, while the second focuses on the future and on the duality of wanting to achieve grand things while understanding the importance of stillness and everyday joy,\u201d she said.\nDuca will be a systems engineer at Wisk Aero, a company working on autonomous, electrical air taxis aiming to reduce urban congestion and emissions.\nHer parents will travel from Romania for Commencement, joining her partner and friends for the celebration.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nVictor Rogers\nInstitute Communications\nEmail\nvictor.rogers@comm.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
