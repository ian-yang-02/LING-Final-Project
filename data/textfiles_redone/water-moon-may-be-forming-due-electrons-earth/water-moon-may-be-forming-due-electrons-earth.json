This is absolutely necessary for sustained human presence on the Moon.\u201d\nThe role of solar wind\n\u201cWater production on airless bodies is driven by a combination of solar wind, heat, ionizing radiation and meteorite impacts,\u201d Jones explains.\nSolar wind\n\u2014\na continuous stream of protons and electrons emitted by the Sun, traveling at 250 to 500 miles per second\n\u2014\nis widely thought to be one of the primary ways in which water has been formed on the Moon.\nWhile solar wind buffets the Moon\u2019s surface, Earth is protected due to its magnetosphere, a shield that forms as a result of the magnetic fields associated with the hot metals circulating in the Earth\u2019s molten interior layers. However, solar wind is affected by the magnetosphere, forming the\nnorthern lights (aurora borealis) and southern lights (aurora australis)\nat Earth\u2019s poles, and stretching the spherical shield into having a long \u201ctail\" \u2014 the magnetotail \u2014 which the Moon passes through periodically on its orbit around Earth.\u00a0 When the Moon is in the magnetotail region, it is temporarily shielded from the protons in solar wind, but still exposed to photons from the Sun.\n\"This provides a natural laboratory for studying the formation processes of lunar surface water,\" says University of Hawai\u2018i (UH) at M\u0101noa Assistant Researcher\nShuai Li , who led the research study . \"When the Moon is outside of the magnetotail, the\nlunar surface\nis bombarded with solar wind. Inside the magnetotail, there are almost no solar wind protons and water formation was expected to drop to nearly zero.\"\nSurprisingly, while the Moon was within the magnetotail, and shielded from solar wind, the researchers found that the rate of water formation did not change. Since water was still forming in the absence of solar wind, the researchers began to theorize what could be responsible for forming the water.\nBuilding on previous research, Orlando and Jones hypothesized that electrons from Earth could be responsible.\nA work in progress\n\u201cThis work was actually based, in part, on our previous studies examining the role of ionizing radiation in metal-oxide particles present in nuclear waste storage tanks,\u201d Orlando explains, adding that in a previous project as part of an Energy Frontier Research Center called IDREAM, they showed that water forms when a mineral called boehmite is irradiated with electrons produced by energetic particles after radioactive decay.\nWhile boehmite does not exist on the Moon\u2019s surface, minerals with similar compositions are present, and Orlando and Jones theorized that, like the boehmite, irradiation from electrons might be producing water on lunar surface grains. \u201cDespite the incredibly different physical environments,\u201d Orlando says, \u201cthe chemistry and physics is likely very similar.\u201d\nThe solar wind water cycle has the potential to make huge impacts on human discovery of the Moon and beyond.\n\u201cWhile some of these water\u00a0molecules will be destroyed by the Sun, some will eventually\u00a0make it to the cold spots in permanently shadowed regions at higher latitudes,\u201d Orlando says,\nin \u201cthe regions where some of the planned Artemis landings will be.\u201d\nThe next step? \u201cOur hope is to prove that the hypothesis is correct!\u201d\nOrlando and Jones have been studying the role of solar wind on the\nin situ\nproduction of water on the\u00a0Moon,\u00a0Mercury, and other airless bodies as part of the NASA Solar System Exploration Research Virtual Institute (SSERVI) center called\nRadiation Effects on Volatile Exploration of Asteroids and Lunar Surfaces\n(REVEALS).\nThe realization that electrons from Earth were part of the dynamic lunar water cycle was a direct result of the interactions of several scientists with diverse backgrounds made possible by the SSERVI support. The work, which will further expand on the solar wind water cycle \u2014 including other sources of energy beyond surface temperature like meteorite and electron impacts \u2014 will continue in a new Georgia Tech-led SSERVI program, the\nCenter for Lunar Environment and Volatile Exploration Research\n(CLEVER).\nAdditional Images\nContact\nWritten by Selena Langner\nEditor: Jess Hunt-Ralston\nEmail\njess.hunt@cos.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
