The research was supported by the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation.\nThe field of neuroscience studies how the nervous system functions, and how genes and environment influence behavior. By using new technologies to understand natural and dysfunctional states of biological systems, neuroscientists hope to ultimately bring cures to diseases. Before that can happen, neuroscientists first must understand which cells in the brain are driving behavior but mapping the brain activity cell by cell isn\u2019t as simple as it appears.\nNo Two Brain Cells Are Alike\nTraditionally, scientists established a coordinate system to map each cell location by comparing images to an atlas, but the notion in literature that \u201call brains look the same is absolutely not true,\u201d said\nHang Lu , the Love Family Professor of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering in Georgia Tech\u2019s\nSchool of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering .\nTaking a coordinate approach presents two main challenges: first, the sheer number of cells in which none look that distinct; second, cells vary from individual to individual.\n\u201cThis is a current huge bottleneck \u2013 you can record neuron activities all you want but if you don\u2019t understand which cells are doing what, it\u2019s difficult to compare between brains or conditions and draw meaningful conclusions,\u201d Lu said.\nAccording to graduate researcher Shivesh Chaudhary, there are also noises in data that make establishing correspondence between two different regions of the brain difficult.\n\u201cSome deformations may exist in data or some portions of the shape may be missing,\u201d he said.\nFocusing on Cell Relationships, Not Just Geography\nTo overcome these challenges, the Georgia Tech researchers borrowed from two disciplines \u2013 graphical models in machine learning and metric geometry approach to shape matching in mathematics \u2013 and built a computational method to identify cells in their model organism, the nematode\nC.elegans .\nThe team used frameworks from other fields such as natural language processing to build their own modeling software. In natural language processing, the computer can determine what sentences mean by capturing dependencies between words in a statement.\nThe researchers embraced a similar model but instead of capturing dependencies among the words, \u201cWe captured them among the neurons to identify cells,\u201d Chaudhary said, noting that this approach limits error propagation as compared to other methods that examine the geographic location of each cell.\n\u201cUsing relationships among the cells was actually more useful in defining a cell\u2019s identity,\u201d Lu said. \u201cIf you define one, you will have the implications of the identity of the other cells.\u201d\nThe approach, say the research team, is significantly more accurate than the current method of identification. The algorithm, while not perfect, performs significantly better in the face of imperfect data, and \u201cgets less rattled\u201d by noise or errors, Lu said.\nThe algorithm has huge implications for many developmental diseases, since once scientists can understand the mechanism of a disease, they can find interventions.\n\u201cYou can use this to do drug and genetic screens to assess genetic risks. You can take someone\u2019s genetic background and examine how this background makes cells behave differently from the standard reference genetic background,\u201d Lu said.\n\u201cOne cool thing about this approach is that it is data driven, and therefore, it captures the variations among individual worms. This method has a high potential to be applicable to a wide range of studies on development and function under normal as well as disease-like conditions,\u201d said Yun Zhang, professor, Department of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology, Center for Brain Science at Harvard University.\nFaster Data Analysis\nThe algorithm greatly accelerates the speed of analyzing whole-brain data. The researchers explained that before this advance, their lab might take 20 minutes to record a set of data, but it would take them weeks to identify cells and analyze data. With the algorithm, the analysis takes \u201covernight at most on a desktop,\u201d said Chaudhary.\nThe technique also supports crowdsourcing, collaborative online platforms that open up the algorithm to a larger community, which can test the algorithm and build atlases.\n\u201cEvery researcher working on the same problem could do recordings and contribute to further building these atlases that will be widely usable in all contexts,\u201d Lu said.\nThe researchers credit the success of the project to being able to draw upon multiple disciplines across physics, biology, math, and chemistry. Chaudhary, who has an undergraduate degree in chemical engineering, took advantage of developments in computer science and math to solve this particular neuroscience problem.\n\u201cIn our labs, we have a physicist working on building microscopes, we have biologists, we have people like me who are inclined more towards computer science. We also collaborate with a pure mathematician,\u201d he explained. \u201cThe neuroscience field has everything. You can go any direction that you want to.\u201d\nIn addition to Lu and Chaudhary, other Georgia Tech researchers contributing to this work were Sol Ah Lee, Yueyi Li, and Dhaval S.
