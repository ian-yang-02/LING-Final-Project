It is an extension of 80 acres of greenspace throughout Georgia Tech\u2019s campus that follow the original naturally occurring stream paths of this region before urbanization. These revitalized greenspaces are designed and engineered to reduce stormwater runoff while also supporting increased biodiversity and living-learning laboratories on campus. Within the most recently completed 8 acres of the EcoCommons are three distinct programmed areas \u2014 an area to engage, an area to learn, and an area to reflect.\nGeorgia Tech President \u00c1ngel Cabrera is already a frequent visitor. \u201cIn the Institute\u2019s new strategic plan, we pledge to lead and inspire by example \u2014 to become a model of efficiency, sustainability, ethics, equity, and inclusion through deliberate innovation in all our practices,\u201d he said. \u201cThe EcoCommons beautifully showcases each of these values.\u201d\nRead the full story and explore the EcoCommons.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nCathy Brim\nFaciliities Management\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
