And how can instructors incorporate practices into their courses to challenge students and support their growth? These questions and others were the topic of conversation at the biannual Georgia Tech Retreat Exploring Effective Teaching (GTREET), held on Jan. 19.\nHosted by the\nCenter for Teaching and Learning\nand the\nUndergraduate Research Opportunities Program , GTREET brought together more than 60 faculty members for a day of learning and exploration.\nThe event began with a poster exhibition highlighting projects from the\nTransformative Teaching and Learning (TTL)\ninaugural faculty cohort, who shared their work redesigning courses using evidence-backed, experiential learning practices. These projects, which reached more than 850 undergraduate students last fall, demonstrated the cross-disciplinary potential of experiential learning embedded within the curriculum.\n\u201cStudents enter the class with one view of the world and its possibilities, and exit the class inspired, with their view of the world and its possibilities transformed,\u201d said Roberta Berry, associate vice provost for Undergraduate Education, who attended the event.\nFollowing the poster exhibition, participants engaged in a workshop introducing two transformative teaching principles: high-impact practices (HIPs) and course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs). A faculty panel discussed how to plan courses with open-ended research questions that help students connect to broader community concerns. The final workshop of the day gave faculty practical tools to innovate their classrooms.\n\u201cI was struck by the inventive ways the roles of faculty and students are being transformed toward greater partnership in the learning process,\u201d said Linda Wills, associate professor in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering. \u201cMany faculty members tap into the creativity, personal interests, and unique experiences students bring to the classroom, and in the process, students not only actively participate in their own learning, but enrich and encourage their peers as well. I came away with a wealth of new ideas to try.\u201d\nGTREET was part of the Transformative Teaching and Learning Initiative in the Institute\u2019s strategic plan, which calls faculty to provide all students with \u201ctransformative learning experiences\u201d that create socially responsible, autonomous thinkers who can define and solve problems from different perspectives. The second round of the TTL Innovation Incubator grant invites faculty to apply for internal grants of up to $12,000 to support the design and facilitation of a course-based undergraduate research experience. These grants are funded by the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program and the Office of Undergraduate Education.\nApplications are due March 1 .\nThe strong faculty engagement in GTREET underscores Georgia Tech\u2019s commitment to championing innovative teaching and learning practices. By creating meaningful connections between students\u2019 academic pursuits and the world around them, faculty in the Transformative Teaching and Learning initiative are working together to foster an environment where all students can participate in meaningful experiential learning.\nFaculty are invited to learn more about the TTL Innovation Incubator grant, including a proposal planning workshop, by visiting the Center for Teaching and Learning online at\nctl.gatech.edu .\nRelated links\nTransformative Teaching and Learning Faculty Initiatives\nCenter for Teaching and Learning\nContact\nBethany Harris\nCenter for Teaching and Learning\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
