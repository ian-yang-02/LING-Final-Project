She has a long and distinguished history in corporate communications leadership, leading the development of strategic communications programs and campaigns in higher education, pharmaceuticals, food and beverage, and technology.\nAt Georgia Tech, Kopkowski provides leadership, oversight, and strategic direction for marketing and communications across the Institute. In addition to restructuring Institute Communications, Kopkowski also built stronger relationships and dual-line reporting structures with the communicators in the Colleges, Schools, and units. This has allowed the campuswide communications network to better support a wider breadth of communications focused on academics and research; campus life and culture; and reputation, and, ultimately, helped further the goals of the strategic plan. Kopkowski also led the crisis communications team as part of the Covid-19 Task Force and planning team, helping students, faculty, and staff stay informed throughout the pandemic.\n\u201cI am grateful for Renee\u2019s service at the Institute,\u201d said President \u00c1ngel Cabrera. \u201cHer counsel to me has been invaluable, and her commitment to elevating communications at Georgia Tech has been inspiring to her team and colleagues.\u201d\nKopkowski joins Yale University in the role of chief communications officer. Her last day at Tech will be March 31.\nThe search for Georgia Tech\u2019s new vice president of Institute Communications will be chaired by Frank Neville, senior vice president for Strategic Initiatives and chief of staff.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nMichael Hagearty\nInstitute Communications\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
