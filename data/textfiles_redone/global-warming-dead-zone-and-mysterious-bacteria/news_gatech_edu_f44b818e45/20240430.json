The team has produced unambiguous evidence that the bacteria play a major role in denitrification.\n7 questions, 7 answers\nThe new bacteria impact global nutrient supplies and greenhouse gas cycles. Below are questions and answers that illuminate the discovery and its significance.\nThe researchers\npublished their findings in the journal\nNature\non Wednesday, August 3, 2016 . They produced genomic and enzyme analyses that pave the way for further study of carbon and nitrogen cycles in oxygen minimum zones.\nThe research has been funded by the National Science Foundation, the NASA Exobiology Program, the Sloan Foundation and the U.S. Department of Energy.\n1. Why does denitrification matter?\nWhile melting ice caps and dying polar bears splash across headlines, climate change is stressing oceans in other ways, too \u2013 such as warming and acidifying waters. Loss of ocean oxygen and nitrogen are pieces of that bigger puzzle.\nAs to nitrogen: Anyone who has picked up a bag of fertilizer knows it as a building block of life.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an essential nutrient,\u201d said Frank Stewart, an assistant professor at Georgia Tech\u2019s School of Biological Sciences, who headed the team. \u201cNitrogen is used by all cells for proteins and DNA.\u201d\nTaking it away makes it harder for algae and other organisms to grow, or even live. But it doesn\u2019t stop there. Algae absorb carbon dioxide, so, when algae are diminished, that leaves more of that greenhouse gas in the atmosphere.\nBut it\u2019s not yet clear how heavily this particular loss of CO 2\nabsorption weighs in the global balance.\n2. How do these newly discovered bacteria deplete nitrogen?\nIn OMZs, with O 2\ngone, the newly discovered strains of SAR11 bacteria (and some other bacteria) respire NO 3\n(nitrate) instead, the Georgia Tech researchers found.\u00a0They kick off a chemical chain that leads to nitrogen disappearing out of the ocean.\n\u201cThey take nitrate, convert it into nitrite (NO 2 ), and that can ultimately be used to produce gaseous nitrogen,\u201d Stewart said. Plain nitrogen, N 2 , and nitrous oxide, N 2 O, would result.\u00a0 \u201cBoth of those gases have the potential to bubble out of the system and leave the ocean.\u201d\nThat makes the oxygen-barren waters even less hospitable to life while putting more nitrogen into the air, as well as nitrous oxide, a key greenhouse gas.\nThe newly discovered members of the SAR11 bacteria clade \u2013 clade means a branch of living species -- appear to be the single largest contingent of bacteria in OMZs. That makes them a very significant player in nitrogen loss.\n3. Ocean zones with no oxygen? Sounds wild. Did climate change do that?\nNo. Oxygen minimum zones are natural. The issue is that global warming is making them grow, just like it\u2019s making ice caps shrink.\nOMZs form mostly in the tropics, off coastlines where wind pushes surface waters out to sea, allowing deeper waters to rise up. These are full of nutrients and boost the growth of simple aquatic life like algae.\n\u201cEventually, the algae die and sink slowly,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cBacteria munch on it, and in the process, they breathe oxygen.\u201d There\u2019s so much algae that the bacteria consume oxygen at a dizzying rate, depleting the water of it.\nGlobal warming is causing OMZs to spread because it makes seawater less able to hold oxygen.\u00a0As OMZs expand, so does the potential for denitrification, tipping global balances of nitrogen, greenhouse gases, and nutrients.\n4. I\u2019ve heard of the disease SARS, but what is SAR11?\nThe two are unrelated.\nSARS is caused by a virus and is potentially deadly. SAR11 bacteria are not only harmless to humans; hypothetically, we might starve without them. They\u2019re at the base of an oceanic food chain, which is very important to the global food supply.\n\u201cAfter they eat dissolved organic carbon (dead stuff), then the bacteria are eaten by bigger cells, which are eaten by larger plankton, and so on up the food chain,\u201d Stewart said.\nPreviously known SAR11 are so incredibly widespread in the ocean, it\u2019s surprising they\u2019re not a household name.\u00a0 They may even comprise the largest number of living organisms on Earth.\nUnder the microscope, SAR11 bacteria pretty much look the same. \u201cThey\u2019re usually short little slightly bent rods,\u201d Stewart said.\u00a0Until now, SAR11 have been known to require oxygen to live, so finding SAR11 that respire nitrate is new and surprising.\n5. Where did the team get these new nitrate breathing SAR11 strains?\nStewart and his team sailed for four days aboard a research vessel from San Diego, California, to an area off the Pacific coast of Mexico\u2019s Calimo state. There, they dropped a carousel of tube-like bottles about four feet long down to the center of the world\u2019s largest OMZ 1,000 feet below.\n\u201cThe bottoms and tops of the bottles are open,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cWhen you get to the depth you want, you close them to get your sample.\u201d\nThe new bacteria don\u2019t have species names yet, but their genomes, which were sequenced in the study, indicate they\u2019re members of the SAR11 bacteria clade.\n6. Why is this discovery scientifically significant?\nIt upends quite justified scientific doubts.\nScientists thought SAR11 wouldn\u2019t have strains that flourish in the harsh OMZ environment, because the SAR11 clade doesn\u2019t have a reputation for being very adaptable. \u201cWhen their genomes do change, they\u2019re usually very subtle changes,\u201d Stewart said.\nMany other bacteria, by contrast, plunk in and out big chunks of their DNA, making them widely adaptable. Also, though researchers had already detected genetic signatures of SAR11 bacteria in OMZs, they didn\u2019t think the bacteria were actually at home there.\nThese facts put Stewart and his team under a heavy burden of proof.\n7. How did the scientists answer the doubts?\nThey flushed out the genomes of 15 individual new bacteria strains they had captured as intact single cells. Surprisingly, the researchers found the blueprints for an enzyme, nitrate reductase, which could allow the bacteria to breathe nitrate in place of oxygen.\nSince the novel bacteria have not yet been grown in the lab, the researchers inserted their nitrate reduction gene sequences into E. coli bacteria to see if they would use the DNA to produce the enzyme and if the enzyme would then work.\nIt did.\n\u201cNot all studies that do this kind of genome-based analysis take that extra step,\u201d Stewart said with a long exhale. But it nailed nagging doubts.\nThe thorough analyses produced a critical dataset for science to build upon. More research will be needed to find out what adaptations allow SAR11 bacteria to exist under such harsh conditions.
