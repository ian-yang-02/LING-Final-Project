But choosing proper analysis methods for identifying biomarkers from high throughput data remains a critical challenge for most users.\nFor instance, RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) is an NGS technology that examines the presence and quantity of RNA in biological samples, and it requires bioinformatics analysis to make sense of it all. However, there are hundreds of bioinformatics tools with different data analysis pipelines that result in various results for the same dataset. This can significantly hinder the ability to reliably reproduce RNA-seq related research and applications, especially for the regulatory approval process by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\nChoosing the right analysis model and tool to do the proper job for high throughput data analysis remains a great challenge. So the FDA invited a team of researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology to conduct a comprehensive investigation of RNA-seq data analysis pipelines for gene expression estimation to recommend best practices.\n\u201cNo common standard for selecting high throughput RNA-seq data analysis tools has been established yet. This has been a huge challenge for studying hundreds of tools that form tens of thousands of analysis pipelines,\u201d noted\nMay Dongmei Wang , a professor in the\nWallace H. Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering\nat Georgia Tech and Emory University who led the investigation.\nWang and her colleagues presented their results in the journal\nNature Scientific Reports . In their study, the researchers developed three metrics \u2013 accuracy, precision, and reliability \u2013 and systematically evaluated 278 representative NGS RNA-seq pipelines.\n\u201cWe demonstrate that those RNA-seq pipelines performing well in gene expression estimation will lead to the improved downstream prediction of disease outcome. This is an important discovery,\u201d said Wang, corresponding author of the paper, \u201c Impact of RNA-seq Data Analysis Algorithms on Gene Expression Estimation and Downstream Prediction .\u201d\nShe added, \u201cBecause the FDA is a regulatory agency for approving novel medical devices for NGS-genomics to be utilized in daily clinical practices for personalized and precision medicine and health, it is critical to see whether gene expression generated from RNA-seq acquisition and analysis pipeline are reproducible and reliable.\u201d\nThe team\u2019s comprehensive investigation revealed that the high throughput RNA-seq data quantification modules \u2013 mapping, quantification, and normalization \u2013 jointly impacted the accuracy, precision, and reliability of gene expression estimation, which in turn affected the downstream clinical outcome prediction (as shown in two cancer case studies of neuroblastoma and lung adenocarcinoma).\n\u201cClinicians and biomedical researchers can use our findings to select RNA-seq pipelines for their clinical practice or research,\u201d Wang said. \u201cAnd bioinformaticians can use these benchmark datasets, results, and metrics to develop and evaluate new RNA-seq tools and pipelines.\u201d\nBut one size does not fit every need, as in any machine learning paradigm, Wang noted.\n\u201cThe machine learning and algorithms are heavily dependent on goals,\u201d she said. \u201cThus, based on our extensive experience in biomedical big data analytics and AI for almost two decades, we suggested that the FDA identify top goals for clinical genomics applications first. Based on different needs, different RNA-seq pipelines will be selected to achieve the optimal performance.\u201d\nIn addition to Wang, the research team included lead author Li Tong, Po-Yen Wu, John H. Phan, Hamid R. Hassazadeh, Weida Tong, and members of the FDA\u2019s Sequencing Quality Control project (Wendell D. Jones, Leming Shi, Matthias Fischer, Christopher E.
