But a research team at the Georgia Institute of Technology has found that the benefits to indoor air quality of one type of purifying system can be offset by the generation of other pollutants that are harmful to health.\nLed by Associate Professor\nNga Lee \u201cSally\u201d Ng\nin Georgia Tech\u2019s School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering and the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences, the team evaluated the effect of a hydroxyl radical generator in an office setting. Hydroxyl radicals react with odors and pollutants, decomposing them, and hydroxyl radical generators have been marketed to inactivate pathogens such as coronaviruses.\nHowever, Ng\u2019s\nstudy\nfound that in the process of cleaning the air, the hydroxyl radicals generated by the device reacted with volatile organic compounds present in the indoor space. This led to chemical reactions that quickly formed organic acids and secondary organic aerosols that can cause health problems. Secondary organic aerosols is a major component of PM 2.5\n(particulate matter with a diameter smaller than 2.5 mm), and exposure to PM 2.5\nhas been associated with cardiopulmonary diseases and millions of deaths per year.\nThe paper, \u201cFormation of oxidized gases and secondary organic aerosol from a commercial oxidant-generating electronic air cleaner,\u201d is published in the journal\nEnvironmental Science and Technology Letters .\nWhile the pandemic has made various types of electronic cleaners increasingly popular, Ng explained that consumers are probably not aware of the secondary chemistry taking place in the air, with the pollutants generated not being directly emitted by the cleaning device itself.\n\u201cThere are increasing concerns regarding the use of electronic air cleaners as these devices can potentially generate unintended byproducts via oxidation chemistry similar to that in the atmosphere,\u201d Ng said.\nTwo types of air cleaning technologies are commonly used to remove indoor pollutants such as particles or volatile organic compounds and to inactivate pathogens: mechanical filtration and electronic air cleaners that generate ions, reactive species, or other chemical products such as photocatalytic oxidation, plasma, and oxidant-generating equipment (e.g., ozone, hydroxyl radical), among others.\nNg\u2019s team selected a hydroxyl generator for the study to measure the oxygenated volatile organic compounds and the chemical composition of particles generated by the device in an office on the Georgia Tech campus.\nWhile previous research reported pollutant formation from various electronic air cleaners (ionizers, plasma systems, photocatalytic systems with ultraviolet lamps, etc.), Ng believes that her team\u2019s study is the first to monitor the chemical composition of secondary pollutants in both gas and particle phases during the operation of an electronic device that dissipates oxidants in a real-world setting.\nAdvanced instrumentation made Ng\u2019s study possible. Gas-phase organic compounds were measured using a high-resolution time-of-flight chemical ionization mass spectrometer, purchased through a National Science Foundation major instrumentation grant. The study received support from Georgia Tech\u2019s Covid-19 Rapid Response fund.\nNg noted that future studies on air cleaning technology should not be limited to inactivation of viruses or reduction of volatile organic compounds, but should also evaluate potential oxidation chemistry and the formation of unintended harmful gaseous and particulate chemicals.\n\u201cMore studies need to be conducted on the effects of these devices in a variety of environments,\u201d Ng said. \u201cElectronic air cleaners greatly rose in prominence because of the pandemic, and now there are a lot of these devices out there. Millions of dollars are being spent on these devices by businesses and schools. The market is huge.\n\u201cOur results show that care must be taken when choosing an adequate and appropriate air cleaning technology for a particular environment and task,\u201d she said.\nNg stressed the importance of future studies concerning the unintended effects of electronic purifiers, as these devices are not currently well regulated and do not have testing standards.\n\u201cThere needs to be more peer-reviewed scientific data on electronic air cleaners,\u201d Ng said. \u201cWe hope that additional studies will lead to more government guidelines and regulation.\u201d\nCITATION: Joo et al., \u201c Formation of oxidized gases and secondary organic aerosol from a commercial oxidant-generating electronic air cleaner .\u201d (Environmental Science & Technology Letters)\u00a0 https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.estlett.1c00416\nAbout the Georgia Institute of Technology\nThe Georgia Institute of Technology, or Georgia Tech, is a top 10 public research university developing leaders who advance technology and improve the human condition.\nThe Institute offers business, computing, design, engineering, liberal arts, and sciences degrees.
