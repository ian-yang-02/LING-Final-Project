And chances are they\u2019re figuring out exactly how to make those big ideas a reality. So what happens when Tech students get an idea to break a world record? They get to work.\n\u201cIt was one of those ideas that comes to you and in hindsight you can\u2019t remember how you got it,\u201d said record organizer and physics major Ashleigh Henning.\nHenning is a member of SEE(k)\u00a0D(iscomfort), or SEED,\u00a0a first-year leadership organization dedicated to helping members develop their leadership and personal potential through unique, once-in-a-lifetime experiences that challenge their perceived limitations.\nChallenges like a record-breaking hopscotch.\nHenning says the group wanted to engage students with campus in a hands-on way, and that\u2019s where hopscotch came into play.\nThe student organizers drew up plans for a 4.2-mile course across all corners of Georgia Tech\u2019s campus \u2014\u00a0and in true Tech fashion there was an element of engineering ingenuity that brought this record attempt to fruition.\nHenning helped lead the design and construction of stamps that could be used to mark the course quickly. The stamps were dipped in a cornstarch and water solution that allowed the chalky squares to be applied to sidewalks quickly and efficiently.\n\u201cWe love solving problems,\u201d Henning explained. She says it was the stamps that really made this attempt possible.\nOrganizers had been in contact with officials from Guinness World Records since October, when the idea came about, and there were some rules they\u2019d need to follow to break the previous record. The course would have to be drawn completely before anyone could begin traversing it. The competitors would have to hop the entire course, and it would need to be filmed.\nCheck, check, and check. Henning says the students who ended up hopping the course \u2014\u00a0many of them distance runners or elite athletes \u2014\u00a0felt like this might be harder than a 10K because of the hopping. She helped optimize hoppers\u2019 movement, so they could hit every square while saving their energy to complete the entire course.\nNow the team is waiting for verification from Guinness that the world record has been officially broken. That could take a few days or weeks, but all signs are pointing to success. And as Henning noted, \u201cI want to encourage people who might have a big idea \u2014 it\u2019s very possible at Tech.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nContact\nAyana Isles\nGeorgia Tech Media Relations\nSteven Norris\nInstitute Communications\nEmail\naisles3@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
