Astronomer Carl Sagan coined this \u201c the Faint Young Sun Paradox ,\u201d and for decades, researchers have searched for the right balance of atmospheric gases that could have kept early Earth cozy.\nA\u00a0 new study \u00a0led by the Georgia Institute of Technology suggests that nitrous oxide, known for its use as the dental sedative\u00a0 laughing gas , may have played a significant role.\nThe research team carried out experiments and atmospheric computer modeling that in detail substantiated an existing hypothesis about the presence of nitrous oxide (N 2 O), a powerful greenhouse gas, in the ancient atmosphere. Established research has already pointed to high levels of carbon dioxide and methane, but they may not have been plentiful enough to sufficiently keep the globe warm without the help of N 2 O.\nJennifer Glass,\u00a0 an assistant professor at Georgia Tech , and Chloe Stanton, formerly an undergraduate research assistant in the Glass lab at Georgia Tech, published\u00a0 the study in the journal\u00a0 Geobiology \u00a0on Wednesday, August 22, 2018. Their work was funded by the NASA Astrobiology Institute. Stanton is now a graduate research assistant at the Pennsylvania State University.\nNo \u2018boring billion\u2019\nThe study focused on the middle of the\u00a0 Proterozoic Eon , over a billion years ago. The proliferation of complex life was still a few hundred million years out, and the pace of our planet\u2019s evolution probably appeared deceptively slow.\n\u201cPeople in our field often refer to this middle chapter in Earth\u2019s history roughly 1.8 to 0.8 billion years ago as the \u2018boring billion\u2019 because we classically think of it as a very stable period,\u201d said Stanton, the study\u2019s first author. \u201cBut there were many important processes affecting ocean and atmospheric chemistry during this time.\u201d\nChemistry in mid-Proterozoic ocean was heavily influenced by abundant soluble\u00a0 ferrous iron \u00a0(Fe 2+ ) in oxygen-free deep waters.\nAncient iron key\n\u201cThe ocean chemistry was completely different back then,\u201d said Glass, the study\u2019s principal investigator. \u201cToday\u2019s oceans are well-oxygenated, so iron rapidly rusts and drops out of solution. Oxygen was low in Proterozoic oceans, so they were filled with ferrous iron, which is highly reactive.\u201d\nIn lab experiments, Stanton found that Fe 2+ \u00a0in seawater reacts rapidly with nitrogen molecules, especially nitric oxide, to yield nitrous oxide in a process called chemodenitrification. This nitrous oxide (N 2 O) can then bubble up into the atmosphere.\nWhen Stanton plugged the higher fluxes of nitrous oxide into the atmospheric model, the results showed that nitrous oxide could have reached ten times today\u2019s levels if mid-Proterozoic oxygen concentrations were 10 percent of those today. This higher nitrous oxide would have provided an extra boost of global warming under the Faint Young Sun.\nBreathing laughing gas\nNitrous oxide could have also been what some ancient life breathed.\nEven today, some microbes can breathe nitrous oxide when oxygen is low. There are many similarities between the enzymes that microbes use to breathe nitric and nitrous oxides and enzymes used to breathe oxygen. Previous studies have suggested that the latter evolved from the former two.\nThe Georgia Tech model provides a plentiful source of nitrous oxide in ancient iron-rich seas for this evolutionary scenario. And prior to the Proterozoic, when oxygen was extremely low, early aquatic microbes could have already been breathing nitrous oxide.\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite possible that life was breathing laughing gas long before it began breathing oxygen,\u201d Glass said. \u201cChemodenitrification might have supplied microbes with a steady source of it.\u201d\nAlso READ:\nCold Suns, Warm Exoplanets, and Methane Blankets\nLike this article?\u00a0 Subscribe to our email newsletter\nThe paper was co-authored by Chris Reinhard of Georgia Tech, James Kasting of the Pennsylvania State University, Nathaniel Ostrom and Joshua Haslun of Michigan State University, and Timothy Lyons of the University of California Riverside.
