Until now, making such structures has involved multiple steps, more than one material, and assembly from smaller parts.\n\u201cWhat we have here is the proof of concept of an integrated system for manufacturing complex origami. It has tremendous potential applications,\u201d said\nGlaucio H. Paulino , the Raymond Allen Jones Chair and professor at the\nSchool of Civil and Environmental Engineering\nat the Georgia Institute of Technology and a leader in the growing field of origami engineering, or using the principles of origami, mathematics and geometry to make useful things. Last fall Georgia Tech became the first university in the country to offer a course on origami engineering, which Paulino taught.\nThe researchers used a relatively new kind of 3D printing called Digital Light Processing (DLP) to create groundbreaking origami structures that are not only capable of holding significant weight but can also be folded and refolded repeatedly in an action similar to the slow push and pull of an accordion. When Paulino first reported these structures, or \u201czippered tubes,\u201d in 2015, they were made of paper and required gluing. In the current work, the zippered tubes \u2013 and complex structures made out of them \u2013 are composed of one plastic (a polymer) and do not require assembly.\nThe work was reported in a recent issue of\nSoft Matter , a journal published by the Royal Society of Chemistry. The primary authors are Paulino;\nH. Jerry Qi , The Woodruff Faculty Fellow in Georgia Tech\u2019s\nGeorge W. Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering ; and Daining Fang of Peking University and the Beijing Institute of Technology. Other authors are Zeang Zhao, a visiting student at Georgia Tech now at Peking University; Qiang Zhang of Peking University; and Xiao Kuang and Jiangtao Wu of Georgia Tech.\nAn Emerging Technology\nThere are many different types of 3D printing technologies. The most familiar, inkjet, has been around for some 20 years. But until now, it has been difficult to create 3D-printed structures with the intricate hollow features associated with complex origami because removing the supporting materials necessary to print these structures is challenging. Further, unlike paper, the 3D-printed materials could not be folded numerous times without breaking.\nEnter DLP and some creative engineering. According to Qi, a leader in the emerging field collaborating with Fang\u2019s group at Peking University, DLP has been in the lab for a while, but commercialization only began about five years ago. Unlike other 3D printing techniques, it creates structures by printing successive layers of a liquid resin that is then cured, or hardened, by ultraviolet light.\nFor the current work, the researchers first developed a new resin that, when cured, is very strong. \u201cWe wanted a material that is not only soft, but can also be folded hundreds of times without breaking,\u201d said Qi.\u00a0 The resin, in turn, is key to an equally important element of the work: tiny hinges. These hinges, which occur along the creases where the origami structure folds, allow folding because they are made of a thinner layer of resin than the larger panels of which they are part. (The panels make up the bulk of the structure.)\nTogether the new resin and hinges worked. The team used DLP to create several origami structures ranging from the individual origami cells that the zippered tubes are composed of to a complex bridge composed of many zippered tubes. All were subjected to tests that showed they were not only capable of carrying about 100 times the weight of the origami structure, but also could be repeatedly folded and unfolded without breaking. \u201cI have a piece that I printed about six months ago that I demonstrate for people all the time, and it\u2019s still fine,\u201d said Qi.\nWhat\u2019s Next?\nWhat\u2019s next? Among other things, Qi is working to make the printing even easier while also exploring ways to print materials with different properties. Meanwhile, Paulino\u2019s team recently created a new origami pattern on the computer that he is excited about but that he has been unable to physically make because it is so complex. \u201cI think the new system could bring it to life,\u201d he said.\nThe principal funders of the work were the Air Force Office of Scientific Research (FA9550-16-1-0169), the National Science Foundation (CMMI-1462894, CMMI-1462895, and CMMI-1538830), the Raymond Allen Jones Chair at Georgia Tech, the National Natural Science Foundation of China, and the National Materials Genome Project of China.\nCITATION : Zeang Zhao, et al., \u201c3D printing of complex origami assemblages for reconfigurable structures,\u201d (Soft Matter 39, 2018)\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8sm01341a\nResearch News\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\n177 North Avenue\nAtlanta, Georgia\u00a0 30332-0181\u00a0 USA\nMedia Relations Contact : John Toon (404-894-6986) (jtoon@gatech.edu).\nWriter : Elizabeth Thomson\nAdditional Images\nContact\nJohn Toon\nResearch News\n(404) 894-6986\nEmail\njtoon@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
