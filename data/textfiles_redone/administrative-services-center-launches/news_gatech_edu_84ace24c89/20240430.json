The center, located at 500 Tech Parkway, will serve as the \u201cfront door\u201d for all human resources related inquiries, the initiation of hiring transactions for all types of employees, and employee data management.\n\u201cWe are excited to introduce this multifunction, shared services model for the entire campus community,\u201d said Mike Shannon, interim executive vice president for Administration and Finance and interim chief business officer. \u201cThe Institute will experience a fundamental transformation in how we provide and receive business services at Georgia Tech.\u201d\nThe ASC is an outcome of Administrative Excellence ( AdminX ) \u2013 a strategic initiative that is delivering on operational excellence and providing an exceptional quality of service and customer satisfaction.\nShannon added that the creation of the ASC is a manifestation of the Institute\u2019s strategic plan, and this initiative is about the people of Georgia Tech and will help employees focus on the core aspects of their roles by streamlining administrative tasks.\u200b\nIra Bragg, executive director of the Administrative Services Center, is responsible for all aspects of designing, implementing, and overseeing the ASC. Bragg noted, \u201cThe growth and changes Tech has experienced over the past several years have created the need for a customer service-focused organization like the ASC. I\u2019m eager to create a culture dedicated to making the many processes around campus simpler and more efficient.\u201d\nThe first wave of the ASC is focused on navigating human resources activities and providing much-needed improvements to the hiring process. This is a multiyear initiative, and the scope will include transactional activities in information technology, finance, and support to research administration.\nNew Processes\nWhat\u2019s changing? The ASC is now the one-stop shop for onboarding activities, including BuzzCard and I-9. With the new HR service delivery model, the ASC consolidates approvals at the local unit level and, beginning Wednesday, Oct. 19, will remove many of the central office approvals.\nWhen it comes to hiring, units will continue to follow the current process for traditional hires (i.e., candidates who need to be selected through an interview process), using OneUSG Connect Careers and submitting any requisite Manager Self-Service (MSS) transactions. ASC will work closely with the hiring manager throughout the hiring process and create the job offer transaction in Careers on behalf of the unit.\nIn instances when an interview process is not required (i.e., student direct hires), the OneUSG Connect Direct Hire Form is no longer needed. Instead, units will utilize the new eRequest through ServiceNow and the ASC will use this information to complete the hiring transaction in OneUSG Connect. Units will no longer submit MSS transactions related to direct hires.\nGTRI\u2019s Talent Management Division will submit an eRequest after recruiting a candidate via PageUp.\nFor all hiring transactions, there will be early creation of the employee ID number, with the ASC submitting on the unit\u2019s behalf. In addition, if a candidate is a foreign national, ASC will submit the applicable iStart eForms and work in conjunction with GTHR Global HR to ensure a smooth process.\nUnits will continue to follow the current process (with reduced approvals) for all post-hire MSS transactions.\nNew Portal\nThe new\nASC portal\nis intuitive and easy to navigate. It provides a high-quality user experience and improves searchability of HR content (job aids, knowledge articles, most viewed articles). The portal can also be used to schedule appointments, request help, and submit the new Direct Hire eRequest. This will greatly streamline the process for direct hires, including student employees.\nPortal access is role-based, displaying the most relevant information. At this time, only OneUSG Connect Level1/Level 2 approvers and provisioned initiators are authorized to submit an eRequest.\nNew Location\nEffective Monday, Oct. 17, the ASC walk-up location will be open from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday through Friday, on the first floor of the building at 500 Tech Parkway, which is shared with GTHR. ASC staff will assist with the following services:\nOnboarding paperwork and processing (e.g. Form I-9).\nThe work and documentation required for international employees.\nCreation of BuzzCards.\nResolving hiring and payment issues.\nApproval of name changes.\nAssisting employees with questions and concerns.\nNew Teams \u00a0and Deliverables\nHR Service Delivery\nThe HR Service Delivery team, led by Laura Hessler, senior director of HR Support Services, is comprised of experienced personnel in Talent Services and Workforce Administration. This team will partner with many organizations across Georgia Tech to support hiring and onboard new hires to improve the employee experience.\nCustomer Service\u202fExcellence\nStacy Whitman, director of Customer Service Excellence, is leading a team of customer service professionals dedicated to providing live support for HR transactions and questions via phone, walk-ins at 500 Tech Parkway, and the new\nASC Portal . Additionally, there will be customer relationship managers assigned to support the three largest areas on campus \u2013 academics, research, and Administration and Finance. These customer relationship managers will serve as customer advocates, identify blind spots, and work with the ASC to improve the service experience.\nOperational Excellence\nThe ASC will produce integrated metrics to track, report on, and improve key performance indicators and metrics such as HR inquiries, resolution cycle times, hiring process error rate, and average time to hire. This data will be used to help make informed business decisions to improve administrative service delivery.\nWith a focus on continuous improvement, this team will provide training, communications, and resources to support affected stakeholders as changes are introduced.\nThe ASC team is looking forward to partnering with you.
