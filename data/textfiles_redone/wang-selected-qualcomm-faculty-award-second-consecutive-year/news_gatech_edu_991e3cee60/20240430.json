This is the second year in a row that Wang has won this award.\nThe QFA supports key professors and their research, with the goal of strengthening Qualcomm\u2019s engagement with faculty who also play a key role in Qualcomm\u2019s recruiting of top graduate students.\nThere is a rapidly growing need for high-performance RF, millimeter wave (mm-Wave), and terahertz (THz) front-end circuits and transceiver systems to address the numerous 5G and Beyond 5G wireless communications and sensing applications. Wang's research group has pioneered a variety of novel circuit topologies and system architectures that are agnostic to process technology platforms and can radically improve the bandwidth, energy-efficiency, robustness, and reconfigurability of RF, mm-Wave, and THz circuits and systems. Wang's research has led to multiple papers in premier venues every year, including the International Solid-State Circuits Conference (ISSCC) and the\nIEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits\n(JSSC).\nWang is an associate professor in the Georgia Tech School of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE). He is the director of the Georgia Tech Center of Circuits and Systems (CCS), and he leads the Georgia Tech Electronics and Micro-Systems (GEMS) Lab. His research interests include innovating analog, RF, mm-Wave, and THz integrated circuits and hybrid systems for wireless communications, sensing, and bioelectronics applications.\nWang is also the recipient of the 2020 DARPA Director's Fellowship, 2020 Qualcomm Faculty Award, 2018 DARPA Young Faculty Award, 2017 IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society Outstanding Young Engineer Award, and 2015 National Science Foundation CAREER Award. He held the Georgia Tech ECE Demetrius T. Paris Professorship from 2014-2018.\nWang has authored or co-authored over 190 peer-reviewed journal and conference papers. His GEMS research group has won multiple academic awards and best paper awards, including the 2021 Barry Goldwater Scholarship, 2019 Marconi Society Paul Baran Young Scholar, the IEEE Radio Frequency Integrated Circuits (RFIC) Symposium Best Student Paper Awards (2014, 2016, and 2018), the IEEE Custom Integrated Circuits Conference (CICC) Outstanding Student Paper Awards (2015, 2018, and 2019), the IEEE CICC Best Conference Paper Award (2017), the 2016\nIEEE Microwave Magazine\nBest Paper Award, and the IEEE SENSORS Best Live Demo Award (2016).\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nHua Wang\nSchool of Electrical and Computer Engineering\nGeorgia Tech Electronics and Micro-Systems (GEMS) Lab\nGeorgia Tech\nQualcomm\nContact\nJackie Nemeth\nSchool of Electrical and Computer Engineering\nEmail\njackie.nemeth@ece.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
