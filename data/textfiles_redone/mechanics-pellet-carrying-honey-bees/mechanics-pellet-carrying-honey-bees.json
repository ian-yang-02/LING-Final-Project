The honey bees then deposit the pellets into a cell within the hive by carefully scraping them off using their other legs.\nThe study, from the lab of\u00a0 George W. Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering \u00a0Professor\u00a0 David Hu , sought to better understand the mechanics of this process which could inspire new ways to manufacture and manipulate soft materials. Hu holds a joint appointment in the\u00a0 School of Biological Sciences .\nThe paper, \u201c Biomechanics of Pollen Removal By the Honey Bee ,\u201d is published in the Journal of the Royal Society Interface.\n\u201cWe measured the viscoelastic material properties of a pollen pellet,\u201d said Marguerite Matherne, a recent Georgia Tech mechanical engineering Ph.D. graduate who now teaches at Northeastern University. \u201cWe found that the pellets have a really long relaxation time, which means they remain mostly in a solid form during the transport process. This is good because it keeps the pellet from melting or falling apart from vibration during flight.\u201d\nMatherne and the Georgia Tech research team also tried to replicate how honey bees remove the pellets from their hind legs in the lab. They built a device that scraped adhered pollen pellets from bee legs. The invention produced two discoveries. The first was that the honey bees were much more efficient in removing the pellet than the scraping device they built (the device left much more pollen residue on the leg). They also found that slower removal speeds reduce the force and work required to remove pellets under shear stress.\n\u201cIf you remove it slowly, you can avoid applying the excessive force required to remove it quickly,\u201d said Hu, Matherne\u2019s former Georgia Tech advisor. \u201cRemoving a pollen pellet is like the opposite of ripping off a Band-Aid.\u201d\nMatherne said that there are two key components to the efficiency of the honey bees transporting these pellets. First, the pellets are gooey, allowing them to stick to the hind legs. But, she said, the bees also have a special structure on their legs called the corbicula. It\u2019s fringed with long, curved hairs and becomes embedded into the pellet, allowing for adhesion.\nIn addition, honey bees can collect pollen particles in various shapes and sizes, while also developing a way to transport them. This is different from other species of bees, which only collect and carry specific types of pollen that are similar in size. They also use different transport techniques.\n\u201cHoney bees collect from flowers miles and miles away,\u201d said Hu. \u201cThe pollen can change in size by a factor of 10. They must collect all these individual particles and bring it back to one place. And they must do a dozen foraging trips each day, all while keeping their bodies clean. They solve it all by this special method they created to exploit the pellet\u2019s soft material properties.\u201d\nThe research team believes further studies could lead to new developments in medical patches or fastener applications for soft materials.\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of like smart gooey Velcro for soft materials,\u201d said Hu. \u201cIt could be a fastener and it knows when you\u2019re trying to remove it so that you don\u2019t have to use an excessive amount of force.\u201d\nMatherne suggests that it\u2019s also important to understand the pollinating process since 35% of the world\u2019s crop production depends on pollinators.\n\u201cHoney bees are really important pollinators,\u201d said Matherne. \u201cIf we want to create a world where we can keep up our pollinators, I think it\u2019s important to understand exactly what they\u2019re doing.\u201d\nCITATION: Matherne, M., et.al., \"Biomechanics of pollen pellet removal by the honey bee.\" (Journal of the Royal Society Interface)\u00a0 https://doi.org/10.1098/rsif.2021.0549\nAdditional Images\nContact\nCandler Hobbs\nCollege of Enigneering\ncandler.hobbs@coe.gatech.edu\nEmail\ncandler.hobbs@coe.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
