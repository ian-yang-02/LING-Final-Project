Evolution appears, through the ages,\u00a0to have weeded out genetic influences that promote disease, while promulgating influences that protect from disease. But there's also a hint of bad news for us modern folks.\u00a0That generally healthy trend might have reversed in the last 500 to 1,000 years.\nSo, who appears to have had the healthier genes? The \u201ccavemen?\u201d\u00a0We moderns? And who was more genetically susceptible\u00a0to mental illness?\nREAD about \u00a0our genomic health heritage here, and meet our Copper Age ancestor, the \u201cIceman.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nContact\nBen Brumfield\nSenior Science Writer\nben.brumfield@comm.gatech.edu\n404-660-1408\nEmail\nben.brumfield@comm.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
