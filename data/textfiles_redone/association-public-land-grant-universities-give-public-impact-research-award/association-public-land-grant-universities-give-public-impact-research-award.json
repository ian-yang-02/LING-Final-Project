It is one of three announced by the APLU\u2019s Council on Research (COR), which also included the University of Alaska Fairbanks (Advancing Diversity and Inclusion in Research Award) and the University of New Hampshire (Research Safety and Accountability Award).\n\u201cCongratulations to this year\u2019s COR Award winners,\u201d Howard Gobstein, senior vice president for STEM Education and Research Policy and advisor to the president at APLU, said in a statement. \u201cWe\u2019re delighted to recognize their leadership and outstanding work done in advancing public impact research, diversity and inclusion in university research, and enhancing safety.\u201d\nAPLU, based in Washington, D.C., is a research, policy, and advocacy association of more than 250 research universities and land-grant institutions in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico.\nThe\nPublic Impact Research Award\nrecognizes multi-project research efforts focused on community and public impact.\nTh e Partnership, formed in 2020, is a regional public-private consortium tasked with leading strategic, statewide efforts to position Georgia as the leader for innovation, opportunity, and shared economic success.\nAPLU noted the Partnership\u2019s work to foster collaborative projects across 34 institutes of higher learning, including historically Black colleges and universities.\nIn 2023, the Partnership\u2019s Student Engagement program\nbrought 63 student interns\nfrom 25 universities across the country to work on 35 projects in 15 communities.\nOther Partnership efforts have led to more than 45 multidisciplinary researchers focusing on community-driven needs such as\nincreasing the use of data science\nat small and mid-sized farms across the state of Georgia to enhance production. Another project, in Valdosta, Georgia, led to\nimproved emergency vehicle response times through the implementation of traffic signal preemption technology. Overall, the $2.36 million in funding awarded by the Partnership to support projects has garnered an additional $17.3 million in funding from other sources.\n\u201cW e are honored to have been selected for this recognition,\u201d said Debra Lam, the Partnership\u2019s founding executive director. \u201cTackling the complex challenges our communities face requires novel approaches to how we innovate. By leveraging the unique strengths of the public and private sectors, our model at the Partnership proves we can have substantive impact that promotes geographic and community inclusion and supports economic mobility for overall shared economic success.\u201d\nThe APLU award is the second such recognition received by Georgia Tech. In 2014, the APLU named Georgia Tech\none of four recipients\nof its Innovation and Economic Prosperity Universities Awards. Georgia Tech was selected because of its efforts through its Enterprise Innovation Institute, the oldest and largest university-based economic development organization of its kind in the country.\n\u201cImproving the human condition through research, and more importantly, applying those research innovations to solving real-world challenges, has been our core focus since our founding in in 1885,\u201d said Chaouki T. Abdallah, Georgia Tech\u2019s executive vice president for Research. \u201cThe Partnership is the embodiment of that mission and our continued commitment to economic development in Georgia and beyond.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nContact\nP\u00e9ralte C.
