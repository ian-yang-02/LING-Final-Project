While virtual gatherings are still the safest way to spend time with friends, those wanting to do so in person still have options with lower risk of transmitting the virus.\nAvoid large gatherings.\nThe likelihood that someone in a group is infected increases as the size of the group grows. While there\u2019s no official number that constitutes a \u201csafe\u201d small group, public health guidance has recommended limiting groups to 10 people.\nFollow all appropriate protocols.\nMaintain at least 6 feet of distance between yourself and others when spending time together in person. Face coverings are also required while inside campus facilities and buildings where 6 feet may not always be possible (though not inside one\u2019s own living space). Masks aren\u2019t a substitute for social distancing; the two should be practiced in tandem. And while masks aren\u2019t required outdoors, you\u2019re still safest when wearing one, even if you\u2019re already social distancing.\nThere are several\nguidelines\nfor events hosted throughout the spring. If you\u2019re hosting a student event, make sure to review those a few weeks in advance. Click\nhere\nfor more formal processes and recommendations for in-person gatherings.\nHang out outside.\nThere are several outdoor spaces on campus for students to utilize, including Tech Green on East Campus and Burger Bowl and Roe Stamps Recreation Fields (SAC Fields) on West Campus. Note that the SAC Fields are sometimes\nreserved in advance\nby different organizations. Many small courtyards and lawns, perfect for small outdoor hangouts, are located between various sets of on-campus dorms and apartments.\nIn addition, there are tents located around campus equipped with heaters and lawn chairs. Tents can be reserved through the\nonline event management system (log in with Georgia Tech credentials).\nRemember that others will also want to take advantage of outdoor spaces.\nWhile it\u2019s important to spread out, don\u2019t do so in a way that takes up more space than you need. If you\u2019re participating in an activity that involves moving around, make sure you don\u2019t cross over into someone else\u2019s personal space.\nAvoid sharing food, drinks, and other items.\nIt\u2019s possible that Covid-19\ncan be spread from an object\nthat has the virus on it. Therefore, it\u2019s safest to avoid sharing anything with your friends, especially food and drinks.\nUtilize the contact tracing app NOVID.\nGeorgia Tech is using NOVID, a contact tracing app that will anonymously notify those who might have been exposed to Covid-19. Keeping the app on standby mode whenever you\u2019re outside of your usual living space can help keep track of those you come into contact with and notify you when someone you\u2019ve been around tests positive for Covid-19. Learn more about the app\nhere .\nRegularly sanitize your hands while socializing, and wash them thoroughly once you get home.\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that everyone\nfrequently wash their hands , especially after returning from a public place. If you can\u2019t wash your hands, use hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.\nGet tested regularly.\nConsistent testing is one of the most important parts of containing the spread of the coronavirus on campus. Georgia Tech offers free surveillance testing for asymptomatic students at multiple locations on campus, and students are encouraged to get tested once a week. Register for testing at\nmytest.gatech.edu\nand\nsee testing site locations here . Symptomatic students can\nget tested at Stamps Health Center .\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nEvent Management System\nContact\nGrace Wyner\nInstitute Communications\nAdditional information\nThe Institute has established formal and informal processes and recommendations for incorporating accountability into safety guidelines.\nLearn more about the Georgia Tech Covid-19 Student Educational and Response Team (GT CO-SERT).\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
