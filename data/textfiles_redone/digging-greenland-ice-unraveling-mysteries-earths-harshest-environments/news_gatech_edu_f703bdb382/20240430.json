There are no living animals there. There are no plants there. The only animals you see are birds. They might be lost.\u201d\nThat\u2019s how\nRachel Moore\ndescribes the view from the top of the Greenland Ice Sheet. \u201cIt's a really challenging environment, but it was really, really interesting to be there. I was there for nearly 50 days.\u201d\nMoore is an expert at collecting data in difficult research environments, traveling to some of the most extreme places on Earth in order to research microbes, and what hints they might give regarding astrobiology.\n\u201cIt all started in grad school, when I joined a microbial ecology lab,\u201d Moore recalls. \u201cI pretty quickly learned that I love to do really difficult, challenging projects. I got interested in working around fire, biomass burning and forests, and I started collecting bacteria from the air. That was a challenge in and of itself, just trying to collect these really tiny things while standing in the smoke from the forest fires. But from that I learned that I loved to go out into the environment and collect things and try to understand everything around me.\u201d\n\u201cI have a lot of different projects, but they all connect through astrobiology,\u201d Moore says. \u201cI\u2019m interested in anything that hasn't been answered yet.\u201d Moore is also leading a project called EXO Methane, which is investigating if different Archaea could survive in Martian and Enceladus-like environments. She\u2019s also collaborating on a project that will send a probe to Venus next year.\nMoore started her postdoctoral research at Georgia Tech, and is now continuing her work as a Research Scientist\nin the same laboratory . \u201cThe first project I started in this lab focused around how microbes can survive a really, really dry environment,\u201d she adds. To study this, Moore traveled to the Atacama desert in Chile \u2014 the driest place on Earth, and also one of the best analogs to the surface of Mars. \u201cWhat we were interested in there is how organisms survive intense radiation and intense desiccation. And how does that change as you look at different sites in the Atacama?\u201d\nThen, this past summer, Moore traveled to another extreme environment \u2014 Greenland. \u201cInstead of being hot and dry, Greenland is extremely cold and dry,\u201d Moore explains. \u201cSo it was similar in some aspects, but completely different in terms of logistics and sampling methods. Because we were there in the summer, the sun never set. We were also at high elevation \u2014 10,530 feet above sea level.\u201d\nBeneath the ice\nThe project was started by\nNathan Chellman\nand\nJoe McConnell\nfrom the\nDesert Research Institute (DRI) , and Moore\u2019s role this year was to investigate the microbiology component of the research. \u201cThey had been seeing some anomalies in methane and carbon monoxide in ice samples,\u201d Moore says. \u201cWe were curious if microbes might be producing some of this, either in the ice core after it\u2019s been sampled, or while it\u2019s still in the glacier.\u201d\n\u201cThe microbes would not be swimming around or anything\u201d in the ice cores, Moore explains, \u201cbut it\u2019s possible that their metabolism is still active, and they\u2019re potentially able to make some of the gases, like methane, in this frozen environment. Our goal was to measure these things in the environment.\u201d\nGathering samples wasn\u2019t easy. \u201cWe set up a lab on the glacier, and we set it up in a trench to try to keep any of the ice cores that we pulled out roughly at the same temperature as the glacier itself,\u201d Moore says. Because of that, \u201cweather was a huge, huge thing. Anytime it would get stormy, the wind would blow all of the snow around, and it would fill the entrance to our trench. We had to dig ourselves out several times. People would put out flags so that you could see your way back to the main house or back to your dorms.\u201d\nThe team hopes that this research will give a more defined record of the past from the Greenland Ice Sheet, improving climate change predictions. Moore also notes applications in astrobiology, adding that \u201cthere are a lot of icy worlds like Mars, Enceladus, and Europa, with either an icy crust over the ocean or glaciers on the northern and southern poles.\u201d\nMoore was also able to test new technology in the field, using a tool built by Georgia Tech undergraduates alongside her advisor\nChristopher Carr , assistant professor in the\nSchool of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences . An ice melter that can be used to take and clean ice samples, the tool is a miniaturized prototype that may be able to help take measurements on Mars, or in similar remote environments in the future.\n\u201cBeing able to take a tool that Georgia Tech undergraduates made to Greenland and test it on 600-year-old ice in the field was a really cool experience,\u201d Moore adds. \u201cWe brought Starlink with us, and so I was able to video call the undergraduate team while I was testing their tool, which was really special.\u201d\nThe team is now lab-analyzing ice cores that they brought back from Greenland, unraveling which microbes might be present and potentially active. \u201cIt's really interesting to see: Is this all chemistry? Is it biology based? Or is there some intersection of the two?\u201d Moore says. \u201cMaybe there's some chemistry or photochemistry happening, plus some biology happening. Whatever it is, we'll have to wait and see.\u201d\nAdditional Media\nContact\nWritten by Selena Langner\nEditor: Jess Hunt-Ralston\nEmail\njess.hunt@cos.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
