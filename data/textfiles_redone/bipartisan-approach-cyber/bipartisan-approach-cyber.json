Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz. 9) hold a panel discussion at Georgia Tech to talk about cybersecurity policy and technical challenges. Peter Swire, a professor in the Scheller College of Business, was also on the panel.\nMay 01, 2017\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nAs the threat of cyberattacks continues to grow, government officials are asking what can individuals and businesses do to protect themselves.\n\u201cWe are starting this conversation of when it is time to go on the offensive as it relates to cybersecurity,\u201d said Rep. Tom Graves (R-Ga 14). \u201cThis creates a lot of policy, ethics and privacy questions.\u201d\nGraves and Rep. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz. 9) heard some answers to those questions during a panel discussion they held at Georgia Tech Monday. The bipartisan event examined how public policy can help people and companies go on the offense to defeat and unmask cyber attackers.\nIn March, Graves put forth a\ndiscussion draft of a bill\nto allow the use of limited defensive measures to identify and stop attackers. While cyber policy discussions are taking place in Washington, Graves said they wanted to hear from others.\n\u201cQuite frankly we\u2019re not satisfied with the direction of where policy has gone as it relates to cybersecurity,\u201d he said.\nMonday\u2019s panel allowed for a robust discussion on cybersecurity from a policy perspective, an academic perspective and the private sector perspective.\nIn addition to Graves and Sinema, the other panelists were:\nJohn Lens, a vice president for the Network and Security Business Unit at VMware.\nStephen Pair, co-founder and CEO of BitPay.\nPeter Swire, the Huang Professor of Law and Ethics in the Scheller College of Business.\nCandace Worley, chief technical strategist for McAfee.\nGeorgia Tech is a place \u201cwhere government, industry and universities can come together to talk about some very, very challenging problems in the world,\u201d said Stephen E. Cross, the Institute\u2019s executive vice president for research.\nThe Institute has been developing cybersecurity solutions for more than 20 years. Tech\u00a0houses nearly a dozen labs and centers dedicated to cybersecurity, and has more than 450 scientists, faculty and students involved with this research.\nGeorgia Tech is also home to the\nAdvanced Technology Development Center\n(ATDC), the state's technology incubator. ATDC is currently incubating seven companies in the cybersecurity space and assisting 33 entrepreneurs and early-stage startups\u00a0statewide with entrepreneurial education in cybersecurity.\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nGeorgia Tech\u2019s Institute for Information Security & Privacy\nEmail\nlaura.diamond@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
