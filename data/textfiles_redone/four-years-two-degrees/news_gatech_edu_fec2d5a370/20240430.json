This week, Bryan Gomez will earn two: one in biochemistry and the other in neuroscience.\nThe Hoschton, Georgia, native has made the most of his time at Tech. Outside of the classroom, he worked as a student pharmacy technician at Stamps Health Services, filling prescriptions, managing inventory, and handling data entry and billing insurance as well as point of sales operations. This work-related opportunity was made available through Georgia Tech\u2019s\nPharmacy School to Work Learning Program .\nAs an advocate for mental health reform and improving accessibility to mental health services, Gomez volunteered as a crisis counselor with Crisis Text Line while at Georgia Tech and worked with the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention\u2019s advocacy committee.\n\u201cI've been so fortunate to be surrounded by people who know what they love and how they can equip that love to do something good in the world, and I'm going to miss that fervent passion as I leave,\u201d Gomez said. \u201cThe people at Tech are just so incredibly passionate about their interests and fields and have, what I feel, is an unmatched desire to channel that passion into solutions and innovations.\u201d\nHe was able to use his own knowledge, skills, and passion to do something good during the pandemic by helping with Georgia Tech\u2019s vaccine distribution. In Spring 2021, Gomez assisted Stamps pharmacists and pharmacy technicians by preparing labels, managing inventory, and physically unpackaging hundreds of syringes and needle tips daily. \u201cIn a week where we were doing over 2,000 vaccinations, that means it's somebody's job just to open up thousands of individual wrappers and packages,\u201d he said. \u201cNot glamorous, but necessary and time-consuming.\u201d\nAs he learned more and as summer approached, he began to prepare the vaccines himself \u2014\"thawing vials, inverting solutions, pulling up diluent (a sodium chloride solution that you add to the main vaccine to dilute it to its for-use concentration and volume) and mixing it with the vaccine, equalizing vial pressure, and so on.\u201d Gomez estimated that he was personally able to actively mix up hundreds of vaccines during the summer.\nFor him, Commencement represents the culmination of years of hard work, but it also marks the beginning of a new chapter. After graduation, he plans to pursue a Doctor of Pharmacy degree and a master\u2019s in public health at the University of Georgia, and ultimately he wants to work as a clinical pharmacist in in-patient settings or in the field of regulatory affairs.\nAnd while his sights are set firmly on the future, he knows he will miss the campus. \u201cI am still stunned by the beauty of Georgia Tech every time I walk to class or to meetings,\u201d Gomez said. Whether it\u2019s Tech Green, the EcoCommons, Tech Tower, Harrison Square, or any number of other sites, \u201cThere are simply places on this campus that emanate warmth, positivity, and joy, and I've come to love them over the past few years.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nStacy Braukman\nInstitute Communications\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
