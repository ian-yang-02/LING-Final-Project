Photo from February 2020.\nDec 08, 2020\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nOn Jan. 29, 2021,\nTEDxGeorgiaTech\nwill host a virtual speaker salon focusing on the accomplishments of women at Georgia Tech. All students, faculty, and staff with a story that would fit the theme are eligible to apply to speak by 11:59 p.m. on Tuesday, Dec. 15.\nTEDxGeorgiaTech hosts both salons and conferences each year. Salons usually feature members of the Georgia Tech community (often students), while the larger conferences host professional speakers from across the country. The upcoming salon is part of TEDxGeorgiaTech\u2019s theme for the 2020-21 academic year, \u201cEmbark.\u201d The organization chose this theme to encourage listeners to try new things even amid the pandemic, whether it\u2019s starting a new hobby or exploring a new idea.\n\u201cWe might not be able to go anywhere, but we can still embark on a new journey in a figurative sense,\u201d said Alea Legg, an industrial engineering major and director of media for TEDxGeorgiaTech. With this next salon, listeners will be able to experience the spirit of the \u201cEmbark\u201d theme while also celebrating Georgia Tech women.\nEveryone is welcome to attend. The event is free, and those interested in speaking or attending can learn more\nhere .\nAdditional Images\nContact\nGrace Wyner\nInstitute Communications\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
