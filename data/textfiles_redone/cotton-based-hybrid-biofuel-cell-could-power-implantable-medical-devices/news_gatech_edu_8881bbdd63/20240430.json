The new fuel cell, which provides twice as much power as conventional biofuel cells, could be paired with batteries or supercapacitors to provide a hybrid power source for the medical devices.\nResearchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology and Korea University used gold nanoparticles assembled on the cotton to create high-conductivity electrodes that helped improve the fuel cell\u2019s efficiency. That allowed them to address one of the major challenges limiting the performance of biofuel cells \u2013 connecting the enzyme used to oxidize glucose with an electrode.\nA layer-by-layer assembly technique used to fabricate the gold electrodes \u2013 which provide both the electrocatalytic cathode and the conductive substrate for the anode \u2013 helped boost the power capacity to as much as 3.7 milliwatts per square centimeter. Results of the research were reported October 26 in the journal Nature Communications.\n\u201cWe could use this device as a continuous power source for converting chemical energy from glucose in the body to electrical energy,\u201d said Seung Woo Lee, an assistant professor in Georgia Tech\u2019s Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering. \u201cThe layer-by-layer deposition technique precisely controls deposition of both the gold nanoparticle and enzyme, dramatically increasing the power density of this fuel cell.\u201d\nFabrication of the electrodes begins with porous cotton fiber composed of multiple hydrophilic microfibrils \u2013 cellulose fibers containing hydroxyl groups. Gold nanoparticles about eight nanometers in diameter are then assembled onto the fibers using organic linker materials.\nTo create the anode for oxidizing the glucose, the researchers apply glucose oxidase enzyme in layers alternating with an amine-functionalized small molecule known as TREN. The cathode, where the oxygen reduction reaction takes place, used the gold-covered electrodes, which have electrocatalytic capabilities.\n\u201cWe precisely control the loading of the enzyme,\u201d Lee said. \u201cWe produce a very thin layer so that the charge transport between the conductive substrate and the enzyme is improved. We have made a very close connection between the materials so the transport of electrons is easier.\u201d\nThe porosity of the cotton allowed an increase in the number of gold layers compared to a nylon fiber. \u201cCotton has many pores that can support activity in electrochemical devices,\u201d explained Yongmin Ko, a visiting faculty member and one of the paper\u2019s co-authors. \u201cThe cotton fiber is hydrophilic, meaning the electrolyte easily wets the surface.\u201d\nBeyond improving the conductivity of the electrodes, the cotton fiber could improve the biocompatibility of the device, which is designed to operate at low temperature to allow use inside the body.\nImplantable biofuel cells suffer from degradation over time, and the new cell developed by the U.S. and Korean team offers improved long-term stability. \u201cWe have a record high power performance, and the lifetime should be improved for biomedical applications such as pacemakers,\u201d Lee said.\nPacemakers and other implantable devices are now powered by batteries that last years, but may still require replacement in a procedure that requires surgery. The biofuel cell could provide a continuous charge for those batteries, potentially extending the time that devices may operate without battery replacement, Lee added.\nIn addition, the biofuel cell could be used to power devices intended for temporary use. Such devices might be implanted to provide timed release of a drug, but would biodegrade over time without requiring surgical removal. For these applications, no battery would be included, and the limited power required could be provided by the biofuel cell.\nFuture goals of the research include demonstrating operation of the biofuel cell with an energy storage device, and development of a functional implantable power source. \u201cWe want to develop other biological applications for this,\u201d said Lee. \u201cWe\u2019d like to go farther with other applications including batteries and high-performance storage.\u201d\nIn addition to those already named, the research team included Cheong Hoon Kwon, Dongyeeb Shin, Minseong Kwon and Jinhan Cho of Korea University, Jinho Park of Georgia Tech and Wan Ki Bae of SKKU Advanced Institute of Nano Technology at Sungkyunkwan University.\nThis work was supported by a National Research Foundation (NRF) grant funded by the Korean Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning (MSIP) (2018R1A2A1A05019452; 2016M3A7B4910619) and the Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Education (NRF2017R1A6A3A04003192).\nCITATION : Cheong Hoon Kwon, et al., \u201cHigh-power hybrid biofuel cells using layer-by-layer assembled glucose oxidase-coated metallic cotton,\u201d (Nature Communications 9, 2018) http://dx.doi.org/ 10.1038/s41467-018-06994-5\nResearch News\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\n177 North Avenue\nAtlanta, Georgia\u00a0 30332-0181\u00a0 USA\nMedia Relations Assistance : John Toon (404-894-6986) (jtoon@gatech.edu).\nWriter : John Toon\nAdditional Images\nContact\nJohn Toon\nResearch News\n(404) 894-6986\nEmail\njtoon@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
