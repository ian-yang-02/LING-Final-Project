And she is eager to go.\n\u201cThat last semester really hit hard, and I can't wait to get out,\u201d said Huff, whose co-op work included two semesters with Gulfstream Aerospace Corporation and four semesters with the Georgia Tech Research Institute (GTRI).\nEven though it was hard, and she graduated \u201clate,\u201d Huff said she wouldn\u2019t do it any differently.\n\u201cI used to resent having to work through college because it meant taking more time to graduate and not spending as much time on classes or with friends,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the experience has led to some great friendships, funny memories, and my full-time job with GTRI.\u201d\nAfter graduating, Huff will work with GTRI as a research engineer, designing and testing systems for the military.\n\u201cThrough GTRI, I will continue my education with plans to come back for a master\u2019s degree and potentially a Ph.D.,\u201d she said.\nHuff grew up hearing stories about Georgia Tech from her father, Joseph, who graduated in 1994 with a degree in chemical engineering. \u201cMy father became the driving force for why I love Tech and decided to come here,\u201d she said. Huff\u2019s younger sister, Aria, a Tech student in electrical and computer engineering, will graduate in a year and a half.\nThe Huff family now lives in Covington, Georgia, but she attended high school at the Alabama School of Fine Arts in Birmingham, where she graduated with a specialty in math and science. She decided to put her love of math to good use in mechanical engineering.\n\u201cI was always known as the Jack-of-all-trades growing up, so I thought a mechanical engineering degree would be a starting point,\u201d she said.\nHuff has a variety of interests outside the classroom.\n\u201cI love working on old cars, like a typical mechanical engineer,\u201d she said. She also enjoys working on art projects as an outlet for her design interests which include photography, creating outlandish coolers, knitting, and upcycling or re-imagining old clothes.\nWhat will she miss most from her college experience? The people. \u201cThe pandemic took away my last few years of college, which means I didn\u2019t get to meet \u2014 in person \u2014 the professors of my favorite classes that made the largest impact on me, say goodbye to the friends who graduated before me and helped me survive Tech, or truly get to know and hang out with the friends I developed the strongest bonds with,\u201d she said.\nWith college behind her for now, Huff is ready for her next chapter. It begins by walking across the Commencement stage, as she has seen countless times while supporting her friends. \u201cWalking across that stage is the culmination of years of working long nights and stressing over everything to reach the end of an era and the beginning of my future,\u201d she said.\nHuff\u2019s parents, sister, one set of grandparents, and several friends will attend Commencement.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nVictor Rogers\nInstitute Communications\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
