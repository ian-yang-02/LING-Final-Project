It\u2019s important to think about your own grieving process and the grieving processes of others.\u201d\nJun 20, 2016\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nThe recent mass shooting at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando left many with feelings of grief, anger, and confusion. On June 15, the\nLGBTQIA Resource Center ,\nCounseling Center , and\nOffice of Student Diversity Programs\nhosted the \u201cStronger Together: Reflecting on Orlando\u201d discussion for the Georgia Tech community to come together for reflection and healing. Drew Adelman, diversity and inclusion coordinator in the Counseling Center, facilitated the discussion and opened by stating, \u201cWe hope that in this space, we don\u2019t place blame, rush to action, or try to fix things. Instead, we hope this space is a place to reflect, process, and heal as a community. We are all affected disproportionately by this tragedy. It\u2019s important to think about your own grieving process and the grieving processes of others.\u201d \u00a0 More than 100 faculty, staff, and students shared their insights and heartfelt reactions to the tragedy during the reflection event. \u00a0 \u201cIt is significant that this attack occurred during Pride month,\u201d said Aby Parsons, director of the LGBTQIA Resource Center. \u201cOrlando was one of the biggest tragedies to the LGBTQIA community, but it is certainly not the only tragedy. Students are still being cut off from their parents and loved ones, for instance. I would like to see Atlanta\u2019s Pride Festival be a celebration\nand\nprotest this year. Our fight is not over after the recent ruling on same-sex marriage.\u201d Denise Ocasio, assistant director of retention initiatives in OMED: Educational Services, commented on another aspect of the tragedy. \u201cAs a Puerto Rican-American and Floridian, there is a tremendous sense of sadness because this attack happened before the National Puerto Rican Day Parade, which honors the 5 million Puerto Rican-Americans living in the mainland United States. How many times have you gone to a bar or club to have fun\u00a0with your closest friends?\u201d asked Ocasio. \u201cThen, to think of this safe space being ripped from you in a place that is designed to\u00a0allow you to let your guard down; the mass shooting in Orlando affected me greatly.\u201d According to the FBI, sexual orientation triggers 20.8 percent of hate crimes; race is the only factor that accounts for more hate crimes. Women\u2019s Resource Center Assistant Director Melanie DeMaeyer reflected: \u201cI hope that as we go through this grieving process, our anger doesn\u2019t divide us; that we don\u2019t lose the spirit of belonging to each other. We also need to honor and celebrate the sacred spaces that we create for ourselves.\u201d Stephanie Ray, assistant dean of students and director of the Office of Student Diversity Programs, spoke about the event\u2019s success in that regard. \u201cIt is so heartwarming to see a packed room of community members from all walks of campus life,\u201d said Ray. \u201cWe have an opportunity to share and process our feelings, and it is freeing to release them.\u201d Brandon Bray, federal work study coordinator in the Office of Scholarships and Financial Aid, agreed with Ray\u2019s sentiments. \u201cFive years ago, an event like this would not have happened. Now, it is amazing to see a large crowd of people from all walks of life.\u201d Reverend Steve Fazenbaker, director of the Wesley Foundation, offered hope to a healing community: \u201cOur history is moving from oppression to liberation. Liberation is here as tragedies like Orlando bring change. I hope that this thought offers solace because liberation will come as a result of this attack.\u201d\u00a0 To conclude the reflection, Adelman and Parsons provided suggestions on how the LGBTQIA community \u2014 and allies to this community \u2014 can help in the midst of this tragedy. The LGBTQIA community can help by cultivating a \u201cMovement Perspective,\u201d doing something, paying attention to allies, watching out for negative messages, making use of LGBTQIA and allied communities, and taking care of themselves. Allies to the LGBTQIA community can help by supporting LGBTQIA friends and family, speaking out regarding privilege and oppression, giving voice to the LGBTQIA community, educating themselves, and taking care of themselves as well. Since the shooting, the LGBTQIA Resource Center has received a surge in registrations for Safe Space, Georgia Tech\u2019s LGBTQIA ally training program. \u201cIt seems that this tragedy has moved people to educate themselves and take action to support the LGBTQIA community,\u201d added Parsons.
