When interviewed about his efforts with\nGeorgia Tech\u2019s Covid-19 surveillance testing program\nhe repeatedly said how proud he is to be part of the campuswide team working on it.\n\u201cI\u2019ve never had the opportunity in my career to work on a problem where I could help so many people in my own community and see those results in real time,\u201d Merrill said. \u201cThroughout my Ph.D. work and career at the Georgia Tech Research Institute (GTRI), we\u2019re frequently thinking about either far out future technologies or rare or difficult problems that might occur in the distant future. Now one of those problems is real, and it\u2019s here now. It is really gratifying to feel like we\u2019re able to have an impact today and you see it immediately.\u201d\nIn his \u2018regular\u2019 job as a senior research scientist at GTRI, Merrill\u2019s group works primarily on defense problems related to Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) defense.\n\u201cWe think about worst case scenarios of how to protect soldiers or civilians from chemical or biological attacks,\u201d Merrill said. \u201cWe\u2019re a bit of a unicorn because there aren\u2019t many other teams in Georgia who have that kind of thinking experience. That\u2019s part of the reason why when the pandemic occurred we were mobilized to start work on testing.\"\nMerrill is a senior scientist on the team that developed and implemented Georgia Tech's Covid-19 surveillance testing program. His research group has been tracking the coronavirus since January.\n\u201cThere were points in January and February where we could have told you how many cases were in each Chinese province. We were following it very closely, and so it wasn't a surprise when it was here in March,\u201d he said.\nIn April the State of Georgia asked GTRI to come up with ways to use the University System of Georgia\u2019s (USG) resources to expand coronavirus testing to support the Georgia Department of Public Health. Early in the pandemic the supply chain for testing supplies was stressed, with critical reagents sometimes backordered for months. To lower costs and reduce supply risk, the GTRI team developed a saliva-based PCR test which uses local and Georgia-based suppliers. GTRI clinically validated the saliva test at specimen point of collection sites operated by the Georgia Department of Public Health.\n\u201cOur Covid-19 test is actually a story about how the state government, the University System of Georgia, and Georgia's biotech industry were mobilized in order to protect us,\u201d Merrill said, \u201cand how Georgia Tech is also setting an example for other institutions within the USG on how to build a surveillance testing program. Young adults appear to be the primary drivers of the pandemic today, so it\u2019s really essential to control the spread on campuses in order to control it in Georgia. Young people are more mobile and they tend to be more asymptomatic, so they get more people sick without appearing to be sick themselves. To control the degree of spread, testing young people is really important.\u201d\nSince August Georgia Tech has conducted almost\n130,000 cumulative surveillance tests .\nMerrill said the most rewarding parts of his job are being able to see its immediate impact and working to solve new problems.\n\u201cI\u2019m never bored. I have the advantage of working with some of the best colleagues within GTRI and also on campus. There\u2019s really very little that we can\u2019t go tackle, and that is really attractive because it gives you the flexibility to adapt to the really pressing problems,\u201d he said.\n\u201cOne of the big advantages of working at GTRI is that I can completely change my technical domain and not leave my seat, and I do that all the time. In my current role I work as a chemist and as an optical engineer \u2014 and as a biologist, as I am right now in Covid-19 testing,\u201d he said.\nMerrill earned a Ph.D. in physical chemistry from Georgia Tech in 2013.\n\u201cA long time ago I was more interested in biology than chemistry. But gradually I fell in love with the mathematics behind physical chemistry and as I gained experience I was just really motivated and interested in systems that I could explain with math. So even in physical chemistry I migrated naturally towards physics.\u201d\nAway From the Office\nTrue Merrill has been a runner for about 10 years. He ran his first marathon in 2015 and he would like to run another one when he has time to train properly. In the meantime, he runs occasionally through the Druid Hills, Emory University, and Decatur neighborhoods.\n\u201cIt\u2019s awesome just to be able to see where I can go on my own feet and look at all of things you miss when you\u2019re driving a car,\u201d he said. He also likes to grow cacti and he has a succulent collection.\n\u201cThey are fascinating plants, so well adapted for the environment they live in, and they come in all kinds of varieties,\u201d he said.\nOne more thing \u2014 True is a family name. Long ago in New Hampshire there was a True Family and a Merrill Family. Through the union of the two families they combined their name to True Merrill.\n\u201cI have distant ancestors named Nathaniel True Merrill and James True Merrill,\u201d said Merrill, who is named for his grandfather. \u201cMy name is James True Merrill, and I have always been called True.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nCoronavirus Testinng\nMore Staff Stories\nFaces of Testing\nContact\nVictor Rogers\nInstitute Communications\nEmail\nvictor.rogers@comm.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
