The co-first author of the paper is Gaurav Byagathvalli, a senior at Lambert High School in Georgia. His colleagues are\nM. Saad Bhamla , an assistant professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology; Soham Sinha, a Georgia Tech undergraduate; Janet Standeven, Byagathvalli\u2019s biology teacher at Lambert; and Aaron F. Pomerantz, a graduate student at the University of California, Berkeley.\n\u201cI am exceptionally proud of this paper and will remember it 10, 20, 30 years from now because of the uniquely diverse team we put together,\u201d said Bhamla, who is an assistant professor in Georgia Tech\u2019s\nSchool of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering .\nFrom a Rainforest to a High School\nTogether the team demonstrated the device, dubbed the 3D-Fuge because it is created through 3D printing, in two separate applications. In a rainforest in Peru the 3D-Fuge was an integral part of a \u201clab in a backpack\u201d used to identify four previously-unknown plants and insects by sequencing their DNA. Back in the United States, a slightly different design enabled a new approach to creating living bacterial sensors for the potential detection of disease. That work was conducted at Lambert High School for a synthetic biology competition.\nThanks to social media and a preprint of the\nPLOS Biology\npaper on BioRxiv, the 3D-Fuge has already generated interest from around the world, including emails from high-school teachers in Zambia and Kenya. \u201cIt\u2019s awesome to see research not just remain isolated to one location but see it spread,\u201d said Byagathvalli. \u201cThrough this, we\u2019ve realized how much of an impact simple yet effective tools can have, and hope this technology motivates others to continue along the same path and innovate new solutions to global issues.\u201d\nTo better share the work, the team has posted the 3D-Fuge designs, videos, and photos online available to anyone.\nFrugal Science\nOne focus of Bhamla\u2019s lab at Georgia Tech is the development of tools for frugal science, or real research that just about anyone can afford. The tools behind state-of-the-art science often cost thousands of dollars that make them inaccessible to those without serious resources.\nCentrifuges are a good example.\u00a0 A small benchtop unit costs between $3,000 and $5,000; larger units cost many times that. Yet the devices are necessary to produce concentrated amounts of, say, genomic materials like DNA. By rapidly spinning samples, they separate materials of interest from biological debris.\nThe Bhamla team found that the 3D-Fuge works as well as its more expensive cousins, but costs less than $1.\nAn Ancient Toy\nThe 3D-Fuge is based on earlier work by Bhamla and colleagues at Stanford University on a simple centrifuge made of paper. The \u201cpaperfuge,\u201d in turn, was inspired by a toy composed of string and a button that Bhamla played with as a child. He later discovered that these toys, known as whirligigs, have existed for some 5,000 years.\nThey consist of a disk \u2013 like a button \u2013 with two holes, through which is threaded a length of flexible cord whose ends are knotted to create a single loop with the disk in the middle. That simple contraption is then swung with two hands until the button is spinning and whirring at very fast speeds.\nThe earlier paperfuge uses a disk of paper. To that disk Bhamla glued small plastic tubes filled with a sample. He and colleagues reported that the device did indeed create high-quality samples.\nIn late 2017 Bhamla was separately approached by the Lambert High team and Pomerantz to see if the paperfuge could be adapted for the larger samples they needed (the paperfuge is limited to small samples of ~1 microliter\u2014or one drop of blood).\nTogether they came up with the 3D-Fuge, which includes cavities for tubes that can hold some 100 times more of a sample than the paperfuge. The team developed two equally effective designs: one for field biology (led by Pomerantz) and the other for the high-school\u2019s synthetic biology project (led by Byagathvalli).\nBhamla notes that the 3D-Fuge has some limitations. For example, it can only process a few samples at a time (some applications require thousands of samples). Further, because it\u2019s 10 times heavier than the paperfuge, it can\u2019t reach the same speeds or produce the same forces of that device. That said, it still weighs only 20 grams, slightly less than a AA battery.\n\u201cBut it works,\u201d said Bhamla. \u201cAll you need is an [appropriate] application and some creativity.\u201d\nThis work was funded by the National Science Foundation (award no.181733), the Mindlin Foundation, and the Jacobs Institute Innovation Catalyst Award.\nCITATION : Gaurav Byagathvalli, Aaron F.
