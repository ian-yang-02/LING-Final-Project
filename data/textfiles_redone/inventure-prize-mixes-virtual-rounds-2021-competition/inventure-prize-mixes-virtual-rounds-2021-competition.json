The preliminary and semifinal rounds are on track, too. And in the end, one student invention will win $20,000, a patent filing, and a spot in the\nCREATE-X Startup Launch program .\nThe road to the\n2021 InVenture Prize\nwill be different, but the pandemic won\u2019t stop the 13 th\nedition of Georgia Tech\u2019s signature invention competition from recognizing the best new ideas from students across campus.\n\u201cIn the most challenging and turbulent of times, when societal problems become magnified, is often when we see human ingenuity become hyper-focused and some of the most impactful innovations are realized,\u201d said Chris Reaves, executive director in the Office of Undergraduate Education. \u201cWe look forward to offering this year\u2019s InVenture Prize as it will provide a platform to showcase our students\u2019 work to the world and celebrate their determination and creativity, even in the most taxing of environments.\u201d\nAmong the key changes this year: virtual presentations and judging in the preliminary and semifinal rounds, which presented the opportunity to capitalize on Georgia Tech students\u2019 creativity in a new way. The virtual rounds will use two platforms created by Tech students \u2014 Gatherly and RocketJudge \u2014 for meeting with competitors and for judges to submit their assessments of the teams.\n\u201cIn a world of constant disruptions and innovation challenges, the InVenture Prize has been able to pivot and embrace these disruptions,\u201d said Nakia Melecio, entrepreneur-in-residence at the Advanced Technology Development Center, \u201cand what\u2019s helped make that possible are the virtual tools\nGatherly\nand\nRocketJudge , platforms created by some fantastic Georgia Tech students.\u201d\nApplications for the 2021 competition are open now on the InVenture Prize website, and the competition will move briskly toward the finals:\nJan. 18 \u2013 Registration Deadline\nJan. 27 \u2013 Preliminary Round\nFeb. 11 \u2013 Semifinal Round\nMarch 17 \u2013 2021 InVenture Prize Finals\nStudents who compete get help with prototyping, implementing their business, formulating their pitch, and understanding the patenting process. Teams can sign up to be paired with an innovation coach through\nIdeaBuzz , where they\u2019ll learn about practical steps they can use to develop their idea. Students also can join a preexisting team or recruit members for their team through\nCofounder Buzz . Teams also can\napply for grants up to $500\nto help cover the costs of building prototypes.\n\u201cWithin our dynamic workforce and economy, innovation and entrepreneurship are skillsets that allow students to create their own opportunities,\u201d said Joy Harris, associate director of the CREATE-X LEARN program. \u201cThe InVenture Prize is one of the most influential experiences for students because of how this competition fosters and facilitates these two skillsets.\u201d\nTodd Sulchek, an InVenture Prize faculty advisor, said the competition has helped spark a thriving ecosystem of student innovation and invention, and it \u201cremains the preeminent competition at Tech, reaching an audience of tens of thousands, connecting with investors and customers alike, and inspiring future inventors from elementary to high school.\u201d\nAll told, the InVenture Prize competition awards $35,000 in prize money, including an audience-voted People\u2019s Choice Award. Last year,\nQueues won first place for an app\nthat gives students live wait times at campus dining spots and helps restaurants plan for the ebbs and flows of demand. During the pandemic, Queues has pivoted to also offer live wait times at Covid-19 testing sites on the Georgia Tech campus. Aerodyme Technology won second place and has gone on to win the\nTiE University Global Pitch Competition .\n\u201cOver the past 12 years, the InVenture Prize has inspired inventors and audiences alike to dream about changing the world with their inventions,\u201d said InVenture Prize co-founder Craig Forest, who leads the CREATE-X MAKE program. \u201cWe are more committed than ever to host this competition in 2021, not in spite of, but because of the global challenges that society faces.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nInVenture Prize\nApply for Prototype Awards\nIdeaBuzz\nCoFounder Buzz\nContact\nJoshua Stewart\n404.894.6016\nEmail\njstewart@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
