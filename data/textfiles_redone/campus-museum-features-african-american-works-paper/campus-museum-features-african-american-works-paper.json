Williams Museum of Papermaking\nis presenting\nA Community of Artists: African American Works on Paper From the Cochran Collection , from Aug. 5 to Dec. 2. The exhibit showcases 51 Black artists whose works are a testament to the social conversations and artistic movements of 20th-century American art.\nIt is different from the museum\u2019s usual exhibit content, but it has relevance and connection to the state. Jerushia Graham, museum coordinator and curator of many of the museum\u2019s shows, selected the pieces. \u201cThe exhibit has three central themes \u2014 Georgia artists and how they fit into the broader story, women artists, and Black master print makers,\u201d Graham said. \u201cFeatured artists include Jacob Lawrence, Emma Amos, Hale Woodruff, Dox Thrash, and Benny Andrews.\u201d\nThe pieces are on loan from the Cochran Collection, courtesy of Wes and Missy Cochran from LaGrange, Georgia. The Cochrans have been collecting for almost 50 years. Their focus on African American artists began in 1988 when they attended an Atlanta exhibition of works by five Black women artists, including Howardena Pindell. In less than a week, the Cochrans visited Pindell at her New York studio, and she introduced them to other Black artists.\n\u201cMissy and I went around with these lists of artists and phone numbers in New York, and that\u2019s\u00a0how we began collecting,\u201d said Wes Cochran in an interview for\nColliding With History , a catalog produced by Georgia State University in 2021.\n\u201cIt\u00a0was unusual at the time for a young white couple from a small town in Georgia to be in New York buying Black art,\u201d he said. \u201cThis was so different from the big name artists we had collected. We were spending the same hard-earned money, but it was not on artists\u00a0we were seeing in museums. The Black artists had the same education,\u00a0and they\u2019d\u00a0been making art for as many years. They had collided with history, but it was just a silent history.\u201d\nThe\nPaper Museum\nwill host an in-person reception and artist talk on Oct. 3 from 6:30 to 8:30 p.m. Artists Jim Alexander, Radcliffe Bailey, Kevin Cole, and Tina Dunkley, who are also featured in the exhibit, will discuss their work.
