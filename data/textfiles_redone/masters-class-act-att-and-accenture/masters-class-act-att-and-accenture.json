The contributions will support growth of the program, which began in August with nearly 300 students and is expected to scale over time.\nOMS Analytics features the same rigorous curriculum as the Institute\u2019s top 10-ranked residential program at a quarter of the cost. The online degree is available for less than $10,000. It follows the same model as Georgia Tech\u2019s nationally acclaimed\nOnline Master of Science in Computer Science (OMS CS) , which currently enrolls more than 6,000 students around the world.\n\u201cThe field of data analytics is growing very fast,\u201d says Rafael L. Bras, provost and executive vice president of Academic Affairs and K. Harrison Brown Family Chair. \u201cWe have many more qualified applicants than our residential program can admit, so this online program will allow Georgia Tech to serve more students and help business and industry meet their need for qualified analytics professionals.\u201d\nThis is Accenture\u2019s first gift to support Georgia Tech\u2019s online master\u2019s degree programs, and AT&T\u2019s third, following a $2 million contribution in 2013 and another $1.9 million in 2014 for the inaugural OMS CS venture.\n\u201cA culture of continuous learning is a key component to student success and the success of companies like AT&T,\u201d says Bill Blase, senior executive vice president - Human Resources, AT&T Inc. \u201cOnline courses like this one enable students to learn anywhere, at any time, to gain skills in one of the fastest growing fields in tech today.\u201d\nAccenture is new to the online master\u2019s table, but is no less committed to its success.\n\u201cAccenture is pleased to sponsor Georgia Tech in delivering this innovative new online master\u2019s degree program,\u201d says Mike Sutcliff (EE 1985, MS MGMT 1987), group chief executive officer, Accenture Digital. \u201cWe look forward to working with the students and faculty to create interesting learning experiences based on our advanced analytics work with clients across industries.\u201d\nOMS Analytics courses are designed and produced for online delivery by Georgia Tech Professional Education (GTPE) via edX.org. This involves a substantial amount of work by not just faculty, but also instructional designers, videographers, writers, editors, and simulation experts, says Nelson Baker, dean of GTPE.\n\u201cThe AT&T and Accenture philanthropic contributions help fund development during the start\u00adup phase and ensure the program maintains viability until tuition can cover operational costs.\u201d\nWithout this support, he adds, the program would lose one of its key advantages \u2014 affordability. \u201cThe ability to offer Georgia Tech-quality education at such an affordable price is exciting, and to also provide access for individuals who can\u2019t come to campus and help them advance their careers is most gratifying.\u201d\nTo learn more about OMS Analytics, visit\nomsanalytics.gatech.edu .\nAdditional Images\nContact\nJason Maderer\nNational Media Relations\nmaderer@gatech.edu\n404-660-2926\nEmail\nmaderer@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
