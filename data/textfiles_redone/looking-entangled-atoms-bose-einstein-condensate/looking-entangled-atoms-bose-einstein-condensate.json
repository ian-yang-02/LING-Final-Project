The work moves scientists closer to an elusive entangled state that would have potential sensing and computing applications beyond its basic science interests.\nThe use of entangled atoms from a condensate could improve the sensitivity and reduce the noise in sensing very small changes in physical properties such as magnetic fields or rotation. And it could also provide a foundation for quantum computers able to perform certain calculations much faster than conventional digital computers.\nSponsored by the National Science Foundation, the research was reported January 23 as a rapid communication in the journal\nPhysical Review A .\n\u201cWe have defined a window where we expect to be able to observe entanglement,\u201d said\nChandra Raman , an associate professor in the Georgia Tech\nSchool of Physics . \u201cWe now know where to look for it, and we know how to look for it.\u201d\nRaman and former graduate student Anshuman Vinit have been studying Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) as a source of entanglement, seeking to take advantage of the system\u2019s quantum purity to create conditions where correlation between atoms might occur. BECs don\u2019t normally contain entangled atoms.\n\u201cWe found ways to engineer the system to create entanglement,\u201d Raman explained. \u201cWe looked at the behavior of the system as we tuned the magnetic field very close to the phase boundary and showed that the boundary had a very sharply defined point. We were able to resolve that boundary with a level of uncertainty we didn\u2019t think we could get until we did the experiment.\u201d\nTheoretical predictions have suggested that at the boundary between different magnetic phases of a spinor Bose-Einstein condensate, scientists would find an entangled quantum state of all the atoms. In spinor Bose-Einstein condensates, the individual magnetic moments do not need to have a well-defined orientation in space, but rather, can exist in a superposition of different orientations.\nIn their experiment, the researchers identified two phases: antiferromagnetic and polar. In the polar phase, the atoms all align their moments vertically, while in the antiferromagnetic phase, they are horizontally aligned. \u00a0In a BEC exactly at the boundary between these phases, theorists had predicted the existence of a quantum mechanical superposition of all possible alignments, an entangled state.\nThe researchers haven\u2019t yet observed that entangled state yet, but their work so far has defined an experimental window within which to look for new physical effects governing different magnetic phases, or to generate entangled states that are relevant for quantum-based systems.\nEarlier research in Raman\u2019s lab had produced the two phases, but the boundary between them was \u201csmeared out\u201d by magnetic field inhomogeneities. By smoothing out the magnetic field so that it was more uniform, the researchers were able to eliminate the variations to produce a sharp boundary between the phases.\nIn the narrowly-defined transition area identified in the research, atoms are torn between the two phases, causing entangled pairs to form, Raman said. The state may be stable enough to find practical applications, though scientists won\u2019t know for sure until they actually can observe and measure the properties.\nThe researchers measured the boundary in their system by \u201cjumping\u201d the magnetic field from one part of the BEC to another. The move created a dynamical instability in the atomic system; the larger the instability, the less time the system required to return to equilibrium, as predicted by quantum theory.\nThe researchers now believe they\u2019ve set the stage for observing entanglement in a smaller groups of atoms, perhaps no more than a thousand.\n\u201cAt our current sensitivity, we think we could observe these spin-correlated states with a reasonable number of particles,\u201d Raman said. \u201cWe think that is experimentally feasible, and since we can measure the boundary with precision, we can begin to test the theories governing behavior in this regime.\u201d\nOnce that\u2019s shown, the large ensemble of atoms could be broken down into many smaller groups operating independently, each with phase boundaries containing entangled atoms.\nThough Raman finds the basic science and quantum computing interesting, he is equally excited about potential sensing applications.\n\u201cIf you could reduce the noise level through the clever use of quantum mechanical superpositions, you could realize sensors that are more precise and could detect smaller effects,\u201d he said. \u201cIn quantum sensing you could use entanglement to increase the precision of measurements to levels that, in classical sensor systems, would have a higher noise level.\u201d\nIn classical oscillating systems such as coin tosses, each flip is an independent system and has a certain level of noise. But because of the correlation, the atomic pairs would no longer be independent systems.\n\u201cIn an ordinary classical system, there\u2019s a certain amount of noise that has to do with the fact that you are making measurements on independent systems,\u201d he said. \u201cIn quantum systems, it is possible to suppress that noise if the atoms are correlated. It\u2019s as if the coins were talking to one another.\u201d\nQuantum sensors might therefore be able to detect changes in rotation or magnetic variation that are too small for today\u2019s sensors. Other applications could be found in spectroscopic measurement, Raman said.\nThis material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. 1100179.
