(Photo by Allison Carter)\nJun 29, 2023\nSecretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm visited Georgia Tech Wednesday for an event, co-sponsored by the\nAtlanta Journal-Constitution , at\nThe Kendeda Building for Innovative Sustainable Design . The stop in Atlanta is part of the administration\u2019s effort to promote the value and promise of a national investment in clean energy.\n\u201cOne key reason why we should focus on clean energy is to be able to focus on affordability,\u201d she said. \u201cA second reason is because of security. Whether it\u2019s in supply chains or in actual fuel, we want to be able to generate the means to our own energy security, homegrown energy, and that\u2019s why we should be going clean.\n\u201cA study from the International Finance Corporation estimates the clean energy sector is going to be worth $23 trillion globally by 2030,\u201d she continued. \u201cThat\u2019s a massive amount of money. That is the reason why we want to see economic opportunity here and jobs created because of clean energy.\u201d\nTim Lieuwen, executive director of Georgia Tech\u2019s\nStrategic Energy Institute , welcomed Secretary Granholm, as well as Assistant to the President and National Climate Advisor Ali Zaidi, Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens, and guests.\n\u201cIt is a privilege for us to welcome this great group of energy leaders onto our campus,\u201d Lieuwen said. \u201cWe are deeply appreciative of the partnerships that we have with our city, state government, and federal government. We are at the center of a very exciting developing ecosystem in the region. Having our secretary of energy here is a great opportunity to just quickly highlight Georgia Tech\u2019s multidecade partnership with the Department of Energy (DOE) across all the DOE mission spaces. Whether that\u2019s batteries, electric vehicles, hydrogen, nuclear, or carbon capture, or policy, we have over 1,000 people on this campus working across this whole value chain engaging with our community and policymakers.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nDriving Change: Georgia Tech Experts Lead in Electrification of America\u2019s Roads\n$2.3B Qcells Solar Power Investment Holds Major Potential for Georgia\nSustainability Next\nStrategic Energy Institute\nClimate and Energy Policy Laboratory\nInterdisciplinary Research Institutes\nContact\nVictor Rogers\nInstitute Communications\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
