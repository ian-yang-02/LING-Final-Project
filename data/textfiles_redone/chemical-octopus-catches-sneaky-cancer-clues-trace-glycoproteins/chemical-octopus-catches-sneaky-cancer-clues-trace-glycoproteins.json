Glycoproteins come in myriad varieties and sizes and make up important cell structures like cell receptors. They also wander around our bodies in secretions like\nmucus\nor\u00a0 hormones .\nBut some glycoproteins are very, very rare\u00a0and\u00a0can serve as an early signal, or\nbiomarker , indicating there\u2019s something wrong in the body \u2013 like cancer. Existing methods to reel in glycoproteins for laboratory examination are relatively new and have had big holes in their nets, so many of these molecules, especially those very rare ones\u00a0produced by cancer, have tended to slip by.\nCancerous traces\n\u201cThese tiny traces are critically important for early disease detection,\u201d said principal investigator Ronghu Wu,\na professor in Georgia Tech\u2019s School of Chemistry and Biochemistry . \u201cWhen cancer is just getting started, aberrant glycoproteins are produced and secreted into body fluids such as blood and urine. Often their abundances are extremely low, but catching them is urgent.\u201d\nThis new chemical trap, which took Georgia Tech\nchemists several years to develop\nand is based on a\nboronic acid , has proven extremely effective in lab tests including on cultured human cells and mouse tissue samples.\n\u201cThis method is very universal,\u201d said first author Haopeng Xiao, a graduate research assistant. \u201cWe get over 1,000 glycoproteins in a really small lab sample.\u201d\nIn comparison tests with existing methods, the chemical trap, a complex molecular construction reminiscent of an octopus, captured exponentially more glycoproteins, especially more of those trace glycoproteins.\nWu, Xiao and Weixuan Chen, a former Georgia Tech postdoctoral researcher, who was also first author of the study alongside Xiao,\npublished their results in the journal\nNature Communications .\nThe research was funded by the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health.\nBoronic bungles\nFor chemistry whizzes, here\u2019s a short summary of\nhow the researchers made the octopus . They took a good thing and doubled then tripled down on it.\nThose who recall high school chemistry class may still know what boric acid is, as do people who use it to kill roaches. Its chemical structure is an atom of boron bonded with three hydroxyl groups (H 3 BO 3 ).\nBoronic acids are a family of organic compounds that build on boric acid. There are many members of the\nboronic acid\nfamily, and they tend to bond well with glycoproteins, but their bonds can be less reliable than needed.\n\u201cMost boronic acids let too many low-abundance glycoproteins get away,\u201d Wu said. \u201cThey can catch glycoproteins that are in high abundance but not those in low abundance, the ones that tell us more valuable things about cell development or about human disease.\u201d\nBenzoboroxole octopus\nBut the Georgia Tech chemists were able to leverage the strengths of\u00a0boronic acids to develop a glycoprotein capturing method that works exceptionally well.\nFirst, they tested several boronic acid derivatives and found that one called\nbenzoboroxole\nstrongly bound with each sugar component on the glycopeptide. (\u201c Peptide \u201d refers to the basic chemical composition of a protein.)\nThen they stitched many benzoboroxole molecules together with other components to form a \" dendrimer,\" which refers to the resulting\u00a0branch- or tentacle-like structure . The finished large molecule resembled an octopus ready to go after those sugar components.\nIn its middle, similarly positioned to an octopus's head, was a magnetic bead, which acted as a kind of handle. Once the dendrimer caught a glycoprotein, the researchers used a magnet to grab the bead and pull out their chemical octopus along with its ensnared glycopeptides (e.g. glycoproteins).\n\u201cThen we washed the dendrimer off with a low pH solution, and we had the glycoproteins analyzed with things like mass spectrometry,\u201d Wu said.\nCancer treatments?\nThe researchers have some ideas about how medical laboratory researchers could make practical use of the new Georgia Tech method to detect odd biomolecules emitted by cancer, such as\nantigens . For example, the chemical octopus could improve detection of\nprostate-specific antigens (PSA)\nin prostate cancer screenings.\n\u201cPSA is a glycoprotein. Right now, if the level is very high, we know that the patient may have cancer, and if it\u2019s very low, we know cancer is not likely,\u201d Wu said. \u201cBut there is a gray area in between, and this method could lead to much more detailed information in that gray area.\u201d\nThe researchers also believe that developers could leverage the chemical invention to produce targeted cancer treatments. Immune cells could be trained to recognize the aberrant glycoproteins, track down their source cancer cells in the body and kill them.\nThe research\u2019s potential for science goes far beyond its possible future medical applications.\nThe fields of\ngenomics\nand\nproteomics\nhave made great strides. Following in their footsteps, this new molecular trap could advance the study of the rising field of\nglycoscience .\n------\nLike this article?\u00a0 Get our email newsletter here.\nALSO read:\nCancer-killing T-cells switched on via remote control\nGeorgia Tech\u2019s Johanna Smeekens coauthored the research paper.
