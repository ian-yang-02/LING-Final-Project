Turner professor of management and research director of the Susan Bulkeley Butler Center for Leadership at Purdue University.\u00a0Kossek, an award-winning social scientist who researches work-family-life policy, and most recently the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on work-life boundaries on women, presented \u2018Work-Life Boundaries and Women in Academic STEM: Covid-19's Wake-Up Call for Career Equality.\u2019\nThe virtual event marked the 20 th\nyear of the WST lecture series. Kossek\u2019s keynote was followed by a panel discussion with Institute faculty members Drs. Terry Blum, Kim Cobb, Kaye Husbands Fealing, and Bonnie Ferri.\nDr. Mary Frank Fox, ADVANCE Professor with Ivan Allen College\u2019s School of Public Policy and WST co-director said, \u201cThe WST Distinguished Lecture brings to Georgia Tech eminent leaders who have supported women, science, and technology through research, policy, and initiatives. Dr. Kossek exemplifies this tradition.\u201d\nKossek recently led the writing of a committee report for the National Academies of Science on the effects of Covid-19 for women in academic science. The report, which was issued the same day as the lecture, emphasized Covid-19\u2019s trends, individual coping styles, organizational practices, and opportunities for policy innovation and research. \u201cI hope we can think about -- especially now with the pandemic -- how we can make cultures and work-place structures support healthy living on and off the job, and what we can learn from Covid,\u201d she said.\nThe\u00a0study surveyed over 200 national universities on work-life issues and found that the pandemic did not create inequity, but rather magnified it for women, especially reducing chances for faculty women to attain tenure. Some of the issues women faced, the survey reported, were difficulties balancing work and home-life duties -- such as assisting children with virtual learning -- while working from home.\n\u201cWhat we found in the STEM women we interviewed and through comments on the survey is that many women felt really challenged in managing not just workload, but professional and personal identity.\"\nView Kossek\u2019s presentation at:\nhttps://youtu.be/_r0XEpkdih0 .\nAdditional Images\nContact\nMary Frank Fox\nmary.fox@pubpolicy.gatech.edu\nEmail\nmary.fox@pubpolicy.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
