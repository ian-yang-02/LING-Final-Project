Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology and Emory University, was named today by the David and Lucile Packard Foundation one of 18 recipients of the prestigious\n2017 Packard Fellowships for Science and Engineering.\nFellows, who are considered among the most innovative\u00a0early-career scientists in the nation, will each receive $875,000 over five years to pursue their research.\n\u201cThe expectation with this fellowship is that you will tackle big problems,\u201d said Singer, also a researcher with the Petit Institute for Bioengineering and Bioscience at Georgia Tech. \u201cThis gives us the freedom to pursue some outside-the-box projects that could be really impactful. Unlike most grants, there are very few funding restrictions, meaning we can go wherever the science takes us.\u201d\nThe Packard Fellowships are among the nation\u2019s largest nongovernmental fellowships, designed to allow maximum flexibility in how the funding is used. Packard Fellows have gone on to achieve significant accomplishments, receiving additional awards and honors that include the Nobel Prize in Physics, the Fields Medal, the Alan T. Waterman Award, MacArthur Fellowships, and elections to the National Academies. Their work has led to impressive research outcomes, including the development of the CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing technique, sequencing the Ebola virus genome, the creation of Bose-Einstein condensates, and pioneering research on glaciology and abrupt climate change.\n\u201cThese scientists and engineers are tackling unanswered questions and pushing the boundaries of their fields,\u201d said Frances Arnold, Chair of the Packard Fellowships Advisory Panel and former Packard Fellow, of this year\u2019s class. \u201cTheir innovations could lead to breakthroughs in how we live our lives and our understanding of nature. Is there another planet in our solar system? Can we find a way to predict earthquakes? Can learning more about how we make memories help us preserve them? If past fellowships are any indication, the possibilities are boundless.\u201d\nSinger sees the fellowship as validation for her research, which employs novel techniques to identify and restore failures in brain activity that lead to memory impairment.\n\u201cUltimately our goal is to understand how neural activity both produces memories and protects brain health and then use this knowledge to engineer neural activity to repair brain function,\u201d she said. \u201cUsing non-invasive approaches, we\u2019re working to develop new ways to treat diseases that affect memory, like Alzheimer\u2019s, for which there are no effective therapies.\u201d\nSince 1988, the foundation has awarded $394 million to support\n577 scientists and engineers\nfrom 54 universities.\u00a0 The fellowships program was inspired by David Packard\u2019s commitment to strengthen university-based science and engineering programs in the United States, recognizing that the success of the Hewlett-Packard Company, which he cofounded, was derived in large measure from research and development in university laboratories.\nThis year, the foundation\nincreased its overall grant budget in response to new challenges\nto promote stronger national support for science and greater reliance on evidence-based decision-making. The Packard Foundation\u2019s work is grounded in science and research to ensure its investments have lasting impact.\n\u201cDavid Packard was passionate about investing in our country\u2019s scientists and engineers because he believed philanthropy could play a unique role in sparking discovery,\u201d said Lynn Orr, Packard Fellows Advisory Panel member and former Foundation Trustee. \u201cUnrestricted, flexible funding, coupled with support from universities, the public sector, industry, and nonprofit organizations provides scientists and engineers creative space to unearth new knowledge.\u201d\nEach year, the foundation invites 50 universities to nominate two faculty members for consideration. The\nPackard Fellowships Advisory Panel , a group of 12 internationally-recognized scientists and engineers, evaluates the nominations and recommends fellows for approval by the Packard Foundation Board of Trustees.\n\u201cIt\u2019s great to know that some really smart people think our research plans are worth supporting,\u201d said Singer. \u201cCurrent and former Packard Fellows are a very impressive group so it\u2019s an honor to be among them.\u201d\nFaculty members across the Georgia Tech campus read Singer\u2019s application and, she said, gave excellent feedback. Particularly helpful was the advice she received from Petit Institute researchers Greg Gibson (professor in the School of Biological Sciences) and Will Ratcliff (assistant professor in the School of Biological Sciences), both former Packard Fellows.\nSinger believes the fellowship is a reflection on the work being done at Emory and Georgia Tech.\n\u201cWe\u2019re in the midst of a big plan to expand neuroscience, and I hope this will help get the word out that it's a great place to do cutting edge neuroscience and neuroengineering,\u201d she said.\nPackard Fellows must be faculty members who are eligible to serve as principal investigators on research in the natural and physical sciences or engineering, and must be within the first three years of their faculty careers. Disciplines that are considered include physics, chemistry, mathematics, biology, astronomy, computer science, earth science, ocean science, and all branches of engineering.\nMeet the recipients of the\n2017 Packard Fellowships in Science and Engineering :\nJonathan C. Barnes\nDepartment of Chemistry, Washington University, St. Louis\nDiscipline: Chemistry\nThe human musculature consists of tightly bundled fibers that are capable of changing their size, shape, and mechanical properties. Barnes\u2019 lab explores the design and synthesis of functional polymer-based materials, for the development of non-toxic combination drug delivery systems, stimuli-responsive materials, new polymer architectures, and templates for biomacromolecules. They hope to find macromolecular solutions to major challenges in chemistry, medicine, and materials science.\nKonstantin Batygin\nDivision of Geological and Planetary Sciences, California Institute of Technology\nDiscipline: Astronomy, Astrophysics, Cosmology\nThe most distant bodies within an expansive field of icy debris beyond Neptune\u2019s orbit have a peculiar orbital alignment, and collectively point to the existence of an additional, Neptune-like planet in the solar system. Batygin plans to conduct an extensive suite of theoretical and numerical calculations that will identify the distant planet\u2019s location, and discover it observationally, seeking to unravel the dramatic narrative of the formation and evolution of planetary systems.\nMichael Birnbaum\nDepartment of Biological Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology\nDiscipline: Biological Sciences\nBirnbaum\u2019s research group combines mechanistic immunology, protein engineering, and computational methods to better understand and manipulate immune recognition and signaling.

Leauthaud-Harnett\u2019s group specializes in the design, analysis, and theoretical interpretation of maps of the sky containing millions of galaxies, in order to characterize dark energy and understand how galaxies and dark matter structures grow with time.\nNir\nM.\nNavon\nDepartment of Physics,\nYale University\nDiscipline: Physics\nTurbulence is among the most mysterious phenomena in nature, with extensive ramifications in biology, mathematics, and physics. Using a novel experimental approach, Navon\u2019s research group synthesizes highly-controllable quantum matter to explore complex many-body phenomena in extremely pure conditions: from the production of new quantum phases of matter, to the study of turbulence in dilute quantum fluids.\nHosea\nM.\nNelson\nDepartment of Chemistry and Biochemistry,\nUniversity of California, Los Angeles\nDiscipline: Chemistry\nNelson\u2019s lab is focused on discovering new chemical reactions that will enable the efficient and environmentally-benign syntheses of fuels, materials, and medicines.
