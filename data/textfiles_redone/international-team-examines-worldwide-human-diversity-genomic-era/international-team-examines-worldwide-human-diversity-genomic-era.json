The study is based on 379 high-resolution whole-genome sequences from across the world, generated by an international collaboration led by Mait Metspalu from the Estonian Biocentre, Estonia, and Toomas Kivisild from the University of Cambridge, U.K.\n\u201cThis endeavor was uniquely made possible by the anonymous sample donors and the collaboration effort of nearly 100 researchers from 74 different research groups from all over the World,\u201d Metspalu said.\nThe lab of\nJoseph Lachance\nin the\nSchool of Biological Sciences\nat Georgia Institute of Technology is one of these research groups. \u201cBy studying a global panel of individuals, we are able to identify genetic variants that are shared among different subsets of humanity and decipher our evolutionary past,\u201d Lachance said.\nThe high geographic coverage of the samples permitted the researchers to study many aspects of genetic and phenotypic differences between individuals and populations using a common spatial framework. Researchers found that the sharpest genetic gradient in Eurasia separates East and West Eurasians. This barrier runs roughly along the Ural Mountains in the north, opens in the Steppe belt connecting Central Asia to South Siberia, and becomes strong again on the Tibetan plateau, elongating south toward the Indian Ocean while separating South and Southeast Asia.\nIn addition to increasing our understanding of the challenges that humans faced when settling down in ever-changing environments, the deluge of freely available data will serve as future starting point to further studies on the genetic history of modern and ancient human populations.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nA.
