As GA Smart communities, the cohort will work with researchers from the Georgia Institute of Technology to expand and enhance connectivity and explore additional applications that will improve their services, efficiencies, and cost savings. The community connectivity focus for this cohort aims to link them with the resources they need to pilot relevant smart solutions within the two-year GA Smart program.\nThe City of Woodbury: \u00a0Woodbury\nhas employed an innovative\nWireless Internet Service Provider (WISP) network as a publicly owned utility, serving 50 community members. Georgia Tech researchers will assist in the enhancement and expansion of the WISP network by exploring measurement-driven dashboards for evaluating the end-user experience. They will also explore connectivity needs for the proposed Meriwether County\u00a0AgTech\u00a0Center for Innovation (MACI).\nThe City of Concord: \u00a0With a network similar to Woodbury\u2019s, city representatives and Georgia Tech researchers will work together\u00a0to\u00a0 advance connectivity in the\u00a0city \u00a0through further testing, evaluation, and community\u00a0engagement. They will look to address challenges to wireless networks such as geographic terrain, natural foliage, and adoption rates. Tech researchers will also help Concord explore connectivity applications such as having water sensors available in public facilities for operational efficiency and potential cost savings.\nPike County : As infrastructure investments are often driven by an intersection of cost and functionality, Tech will help Pike administrators\nanalyze technologies to improve connectivity countywide , including exploring different broadband options to identify solutions that are both cost effective and reliable for consumers.\nSpalding County : Believing that access to the internet is a driver of economic development, officials want to\nidentify methods to increase broadband access\nin the area.\u00a0\u00a0Many internet service providers are unable or unwilling to provide access to households or businesses that are separated from other connections by acres or miles. Tech researchers will provide Spalding leaders with perspective on technology hardware and software options that will meet the county\u2019s needs, as well as evaluate the current status of connectivity and how to improve it.\n\u201cCommunities experiencing gaps in connectivity across the state of Georgia have sought creative solutions to bridge them, and still more communities are seeking answers about how to get connected,\u201d said Debra Lam, executive director of PIN. \u201cThis cohort has taken steps toward being innovative in a collaborative way. By providing research services to these neighboring communities with established relationships and an interest in coordinating connectivity efforts across city and county borders, GA Smart can make a regional impact and follow the natural expansion of these services across the area. This placemaking opportunity allows communities to plan together, avoid redundancies, and accomplish more collectively.\u201d\nThe cohort will be working with researchers from Georgia Tech\u2019s College of Computing, including\u00a0 professor Ellen Zegura , the Stephen Fleming Chair in Telecommunications, and\u00a0 associate professor Ada Gavrilovska .\n\u201cThe pandemic has made it clear that dependable access to high-speed internet is no longer a luxury, but a necessity,\u201d said \u00c1ngel Cabrera, president of Georgia Tech. \u201cAt Georgia Tech, we believe in the power of technology to improve lives and communities, especially in our state, and we look forward to working with the winners of this year\u2019s Georgia Smart Communities Challenge to achieve just that.\u201d\nMeet the Communities\nAs the first city to be declared \u201cBroadband Ready\u201d by the Georgia Department of Community Affairs (DCA) in 2020, the City of Woodbury has pioneered a way forward for communities unserved by traditional broadband.\n\u201cMeeting the needs of our ever-changing world requires diversity in thought and a willingness to move boldly into the future,\u201d said City of Woodbury Mayor Steve Ledbetter. \u201cOur goal is to push beyond the possible and be a part of leading our community and our state into the future.\u201d\n\u201cThe pandemic underscores just how critical connectivity can be for a community\u2019s economic well-being,\u201d said City of Concord Mayor John Strickland. \u201cCovid-19 made it clear that the internet is necessary for education, healthcare, and business, as well as access to important real-time information. We are fortunate to be geographically close to Woodbury, which introduced us to their service provider. Working together, small cities and counties can provide solutions that will serve more people at a lower cost.\nBrandon Rogers, Pike County manager, echoed those sentiments. \u201cWe want to serve the citizens of the community by ensuring options for broadband access in all areas of the county, so that no communities are left behind in the digital divide. We\u2019re excited to be working with Georgia Tech as we seek out reliable sources for connectivity that can reach unserved areas of the county at an affordable price range for all of our residents and all of our municipalities.\u201d\nRegional cooperation is a key differentiator, said Jessica Simmons, deputy chief information officer at the Georgia Technology Authority (GTA).\n\u201cPooling strategies and resource capabilities for connectivity to benefit the broader region complements the state\u2019s initiative to promote broadband deployment in unserved parts of Georgia,\u201d she said. \u201cThis regional effort builds exactly the kind of momentum we want to see in rural areas that lack high-speed internet access.\u201d\nSince 2018, GA Smart has served 12 communities across the state of Georgia in a variety of projects, ranging from\u00a0 installing sea-level and traffic sensors \u00a0to planning for\u00a0 connected vehicle technology . Alumni from the GA Smart program have successfully implemented their projects and garnered additional funding and technical assistance to continue their projects beyond the program period, continuing to service their residents and meet their community\u2019s goals.\nThe GA Smart program has facilitated community engagement across the state by hosting more than 40 community meetings, provided in excess of 140 technologies deployed\u00a0in its funded projects, and provided research support that led to successful grant proposals, academic presentations, and publications.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nWriter: P\u00e9ralte Paul | 404.316.1210\u00a0|\u00a0 peralte.paul@comm.gatech.edu\nMedia Contact: Blair Meeks | 404-894-9793 |\nwmeeks7@gatech.edu\nEmail\nperalte.paul@comm.gatech.edu\nAdditional information\nAbout the Partnership for Inclusive Innovation\nThe Partnership for Inclusive Innovation (PIN) is a public-private partnership that launched in 2020 to lead coordinated, statewide efforts to position Georgia as the Technology Capital of the East Coast.
