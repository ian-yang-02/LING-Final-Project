Then he went under the lights at a sold-out Russ Chandler Stadium as the Yellow Jackets baseball team hosted the University of Georgia.\nThe day of events marked Kimbrough\u2019s first on campus since the Georgia Tech graduate\u2019s third mission to space \u2014 which included 199 days and 84 million miles aboard the International Space Station (ISS).\nKimbrough\u2019s first stop of the day was a morning tour of the\nSpace Systems Design Lab . Nearly two dozen students and research engineers showed Kimbrough the lab space of\nGlenn Lightsey , a professor in the\nDaniel Guggenheim School of Aerospace Engineering (AE School) .\nKimbrough watched as the group tested electronics and navigation systems for future CubeSats. Their\nGT-1\nspacecraft\nwas deployed into orbit in February , and the students are currently working on three 10 cm x 10 cm x 10 cm follow-up models for future missions.\nFrom there, Kimbrough visited Mission Operations Center, which is currently being used to track GT-1. He also checked in on\nLunar Flashlight , which is scheduled for launch this summer and will be the first CubeSat ever to orbit the moon. A Georgia Tech interdisciplinary team built the spacecraft\u2019s propulsion system. The AE School and the\nGeorgia Tech Research Institute (GTRI)\nhave been assembling and integrating Lunar Flashlight for NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Lab the last several months.\n\u201cI was really inspired by the students I met, and I\u2019ve been very impressed by the projects they\u2019re working on,\u201d said Kimbrough, who received his master\u2019s degree in operations research from the\u00a0 H. Milton Stewart School of Industrial and Systems Engineering (ISyE)\nin 1998. \u201cSo many people are interested in space, which is great to see.\u201d\n\u201cFriday was amazing! It was very cool to share the work we do here at the lab and hear about his various experiences, from the military to NASA to being on the ISS,\u201d said Ebenezer Arunkumar, GT-1\u2019s software team lead and a master\u2019s student in aerospace engineering. \u201cBeing an astronaut has always been a dream of mine, so meeting someone who has accomplished that goal was awe-inspiring.\u201d\nThe morning ended with a visit to the\nYang Aero Maker Space . The student-led facility in the Weber Space and Science Technology Building allows students to use 3D printers, laser cutters, and more to build prototypes that advance their research and curiosity.\n\u201cIt was a really great opportunity to talk to an astronaut, something I\u2019d only done on Zoom,\u201d said Rachel Thomas, a member of the\nRamblin\u2019 Rocket Club\nwho is scheduled to graduate this semester with her undergraduate degree in aerospace engineering. \u201cI talked to him about my team,\nGTXR (Georgia Tech Experimental Rocketry ), and he was really excited about that. It was a unique experience.\u201d\nThe day\u2019s main event, a Q&A in the Clough Undergraduate Learning Commons, filled an auditorium. In addition to the 250 or so Yellow Jackets in the room, nearly a thousand K-12 students from around the Atlanta area tuned into the livestream as invited guests, with some submitting questions for Kimbrough.\nTopics ranged from the astronaut application process, when he knew he wanted to travel to space (as a young child), and the relevancy of his ISyE degree to his success as an astronaut.\nThe session was moderated by AE School Ph.D. student Naia Butler-Craig, an aspiring astronaut.\n\u201cI\u2019m so grateful that Shane took his time to pour into the next generation of aerospace engineers,\u201d Butler-Craig said. \u201cIt was such an honor to hear from someone as accomplished and personable as him. I feel motivated to keep going on my own journey in following his footsteps!\u201d\nBefore taking a detour and riding in the Ramblin\u2019 Wreck for the first time, Kimbrough stood before another packed house that night. He threw out the first pitch before Georgia Tech beat Georgia 11-7. Kimbrough grew up attending Yellow Jacket sporting events and nearly enrolled as undergraduate. Instead, he attended the U.S. Military Academy and pitched for its baseball team.\n\u201cIt was an incredible, perfect day for me. \u201cGetting to come back and give back a little bit to the students and faculty was amazing.\u201d Kimbrough said. \u201cThe weather was great. The events were great. I just want to go back to school!\u201d\nAdditional Images\nContact\nJason Maderer\nCollege of Engineering\n404-276-1643\nEmail\nmaderer@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
