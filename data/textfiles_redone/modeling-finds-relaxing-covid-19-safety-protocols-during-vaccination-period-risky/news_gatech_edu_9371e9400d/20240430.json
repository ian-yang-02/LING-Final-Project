The study methods were based on a mathematical simulation originally developed at Georgia Tech.\nThe study evaluated how many Covid-19 cases could be avoided in the Tar Heel State if more people get vaccinated and continue to follow mask and physical distancing guidelines. As of June 3, North Carolina has had 1 million reported cases of Covid-19 and more than 13,000 recorded deaths.\n\u201cThe main takeaway from the paper is that while the increasing vaccine coverage in the U.S. has a positive impact, we are not really there yet. We still need to follow preventive measures such as mask wearing,\u201d said contributing author\nPinar Keskinocak , the William W. George Chair and Professor in the H. Milton Stewart School of Industrial and Systems Engineering at Georgia Tech and co-founder and director of the\nCenter for Health and Humanitarian Systems .\nThe caution is well founded when the researchers account for viral mutations, including the variant currently dominant in the United States that was initially identified in the UK and was associated with the surge in Michigan. There, as recently as May 2, the state averaged nearly 3,500 cases a day, according to a June 2 story in\nBridge Michigan .\nAccording to one scenario from the simulation, which was populated with data from the state of North Carolina, if 75% of the population gets fully vaccinated but continues to wear masks and socially distance,\u00a0 there is a sustained decline down to very few new Covid-19 cases over a six-month period.\u00a0 But, if only 25% of the population gets fully vaccinated and does not adhere to these non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), there could be a steady increase in daily Covid-19 cases, peaking around 8,000 before there is another decline.\nKeskinocak points to the\nGeorgia Covid-19 Vaccination Dashboard\nthat tracks county-level differences in vaccination rates based on race as further evidence of the need for caution.\n\u201cOur dashboard shows that there has been high variability in the level of vaccination in different geographic regions and communities,\u201d she said. \u201cSo even if we say over half of U.S. adults are vaccinated, it\u2019s not uniform across the entire country. This further raises concerns about quickly lifting the NPIs.\u201d\nJulie Swann, department head, North Carolina State University\u2019s Fitts Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, and long-time research collaborator with Keskinocak, concurs. \u201cCurrent variants are more infectious, and there are still locations with less than 30% of the population vaccinated.\u201d\nSwann adds that ongoing spread \u201cendangers people now. It also increases the chance of a future mutation that could increase the risk even to people who are vaccinated.\u201d\nSwann and Keskinocak are two of three researchers who co-founded Georgia Tech\u2019s Center for Health and Humanitarian Systems in 2007, the year they developed a comprehensive, agent-based simulation model for pandemic flu, which has since been at the core of their modeling efforts for Covid-19. Over the years the two industrial engineers have collaborated closely to advance the model and make results available to decision makers as new pandemics emerged.\n\u201cJulie and I have been working on infectious disease modeling for over a decade now. We had developed this agent-based model for pandemic flu and then when Covid-19 hit, Georgia Tech adapted that model to Covid-19 and shared it with Julie\u2019s team at NC State who then modified the model to test additional scenarios and calibrated it with North Carolina data,\u201d Keskinocak said.\n\u201cI am grateful that Pinar and I had spent such a long time trying to understand pandemics and improving the science behind them,\u201d Swann added. \u201cIf we had not invested that time, we would not be able to have such a fast turnaround and the high participation level that we have this year.\u201d\nAccording to Keskinocak, the simulation model is extremely detailed \u2013 in essence, it recreated demographics of the population down to the state\u2019s household size, and even individuals\u2019 workflow, to give a clear picture of how people move from one geographic area to another.\n\u201cThe model is flexible and can change based on the research question being asked, including the current research question, \u2018What is the impact of lifting NPIs in increasing vaccine coverage?\u2019\u201d\nSwann credited the close partnership with public health partners in Georgia and North Carolina, as well as their work under a grant funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Council for State and Territorial Epidemiologists, with the speed of developing models to test interventions during the pandemic.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really key because sometimes we get additional ideas or research questions from the stakeholders with whom we interact,\u201d Swann said.\nBoth researchers emphasized the critical role students played in advancing these models under tight deadlines while juggling coursework. Between them they estimate more than two dozen graduate students across the partnering institutions have been engaged in the Covid-19 modeling work since the pandemic began. The two also were integral in establishing a professional education HHSCM certificate program.\n# # #\nThe Georgia Institute of Technology, or Georgia Tech, is a top 10 public research university developing leaders who advance technology and improve the human condition.\nThe Institute offers business, computing, design, engineering, liberal arts, and sciences degrees.
