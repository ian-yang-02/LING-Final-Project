The new initiative was announced at the 2017 ATDC Startup Showcase.\nThe Georgia Tech Foundation, in turn, has earmarked the new funds for the formation of the ATDC Retail Program. Founded in 1980, ATDC is a program of the Enterprise Innovation Institute, the Georgia Institute of Technology\u2019s chief economic development arm. ATDC is one of the longest running university-affiliated incubators in the United States.\n\u201cWe chose Georgia Tech because of its commitment to economic development in Georgia and beyond, its focus on incorporating innovation in economic development, and its legacy of success,\u201d the Mookerji Foundation said in a statement. \u201cATDC is a world-class technology incubator and is at the forefront of helping entrepreneurs not only build companies, but gives them the tools for long term success.\u201d\nThe Atlanta-based Mookerji Foundation is dedicated to nurturing and enabling entrepreneurs in metro Atlanta.\nThe gift will fully fund the retail technology startup initiative for the next five years and support a retail technology expert who will serve as an entrepreneur-in-residence to mentor the startups and offer expertise relating to the field of entrepreneurship.\n\u201cThe retail landscape has undergone a tumultuous shift in the last few years and retailers \u2014 from the national chains and department stores to the mom and pop shops on Main Street \u2014 are all looking for innovative technologies that help them remain competitive, stay engaged with their customers, and improve the bottom line,\u201d said Jennifer Bonnett, ATDC\u2019s general manager. \u201cThis new focus on retail complements some of our other related focus areas, such as financial technology (FinTech).\u201d\nThe U.S. retail sector, which is comprised of more than 3.7 million establishments, supports some 42 million jobs with a $2.6 trillion impact on the economy, according to the National Retail Federation (NRF), the industry\u2019s chief trade group.\nIn Georgia, the retail industry supports 1.2 million jobs, includes more than 120,000 establishments, and adds $75.6 billion a year to the Peach State\u2019s economy, NRF data show.\n\u201cThis is a very important segment of the Georgia and national economies and an exciting opportunity for Georgia Tech to make an impact and keep to its economic development mission,\u201d said Maryam Alavi, dean and Stephen P. Zelnak Jr. Chair of Georgia Tech\u2019s Ernest Scheller Jr. College of Business.\nAlavi and other Scheller officials, as well as representatives of Tech\u2019s Office of Development, collaborated on the effort that led to the Mookerji Foundation\u2019s gift.\nThe initiative is the second of its kind for ATDC. In March 2015, Worldpay US, a global payments technology and services company, made a $1 million gift to Georgia Tech, which used the funds to launch a FinTech program at ATDC. Since its launch, that effort has reached more than 350 entrepreneurs across the state of Georgia, including 17 FinTech startups in the ATDC Signature and ATDC Accelerate portfolios. To date, those companies in both Signature and Accelerate have raised more than $34 million in outside funding.\nAbout Georgia Tech\nThe Georgia Institute of Technology is one of the world\u2019s premier research universities.
