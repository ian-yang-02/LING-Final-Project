Blank Sports and Entertainment (AMBSE), the parent company of the Atlanta Falcons, Atlanta United, and Mercedes-Benz Stadium. For the second year in a row, members of the Sports Business Club participated in a case competition based around the business side of the Atlanta Falcons. This year, students worked to solve the issue of creating new, young fans who will remain fans for life.\nThe Sports Business Club at Georgia Tech seeks to help students bridge the gap between the worlds of sports and business.\n\u201cWe bring in executives of sports teams as well as those who work in other facets surrounding the industry like retail,\u201d said Gavin Lambert, vice president of project management for the club. \u201cOne such speaker was Mark Cuban.\u201d\nOne of the club\u2019s biggest partners is AMBSE. This case competition benefits both sides as the club is provided with real-life data they use to offer new, innovative ideas to the company. The competition also helps students develop storytelling skills and understand their audience while creating a sense of competition that all sports fans love.\nMake no mistake, this is a serious competition. Planning began this January and was biweekly until the day of the final presentations on Nov. 7. Twenty-seven teams spanning 14 majors entered. In a short period of time, they had to create a pitch that was judged before six teams were chosen to move on to the final round.\nThese six teams gave 15-minute presentations to six executives at AMBSE.\nJudges awarded prizes to the top three teams, and one group received the people\u2019s choice award. The top winners proposed using RFID bands to engage younger fans through rewards while tracking their purchasing habits, and the people\u2019s choice winners proposed the creation of an area near the stadium that could be used for tailgating and other sports-related events. These prizes totaled $10,000.\nBut students gained something much more valuable from the experience.\n\u201cSports teams and companies usually leverage the passion of individuals to provide worse salaries and benefits,\u201d Lambert said. \u201cWith AMBSE, they do not have to make a tradeoff between enjoying their job and making money.\u201d Many students in the Sports Business Club find jobs with the company, and this competition is one of the best ways to create that connection.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nConnor White\nInstitute Communications\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
