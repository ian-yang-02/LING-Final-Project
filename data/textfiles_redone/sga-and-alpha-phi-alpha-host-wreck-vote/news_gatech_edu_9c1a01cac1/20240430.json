This year, Wreck the Vote will also include helping people request their absentee ballots, check their voter registration, and find their polling place.\nLast year, Wreck the Vote helped approximately 150 students register to vote. This year, with the presidential election taking place in November, SGA and Alpha Phi Alpha want to make sure all eligible members of the Georgia Tech community have everything they need to cast their ballots. SGA will be tabling on Tech Walkway from 9 a.m. until 2 p.m. on Wednesday, Sept. 16, to pass out information and answer questions. Meanwhile, Alpha Phi Alpha will be holding\nvirtual office hours\nfrom 1 to 2 p.m. Sept. 15-17 so that students, faculty, and staff can answer questions without any face-to-face interaction.\nWreck the Vote week will culminate in a debate on Thursday, Sept. 17, between Georgia Tech\u2019s four political student organizations: College Democrats, College Republicans, Young Democratic Socialists of America, and Young Americans for Liberty. The debate will be\nstreamed over BlueJeans\nstarting at 6 p.m.\nGet started with Wreck the Vote by filling out\nthis form .
