For years, she has studied how societies manage pandemics, and how outbreaks\u00a0overtax\u00a0the health care system\u00a0and wrack\u00a0supply chains to\u00a0worsen\u00a0pandemics. Here she shares her insights.\nEmpty classrooms and supermarket shelves marked the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. But Keskinocak expects more signs of the times to come \u2013 such as pop-up pandemic clinics and the shortage and rationing of medical supplies beyond masks and ventilators.\nKeskinocak is the\ndirector of the Center for Health and Humanitarian Systems at the Georgia Institute of Technology , which studies how government and private sectors can cooperate to handle\u00a0health and humanitarian crises. And she is William W. George Chair and Professor in Georgia Tech\u2019s H. Milton Stewart School of Industrial and Systems Engineering.\nIn previous research, Keskinocak\u2019s team created a model that accurately ran the course of the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic, and when COVID-19 struck, her team was already in the middle of modeling how special clinics could significantly slow a pandemic. In the meantime, temporary clinics in Wuhan, China, appear to have validated her model.\nHealthcare expansion now\nThe surge of COVID-19 patients pushed Italy\u2019s health care system into a very ugly\u00a0crisis, and the U.S. needs to take measures now to handle similar patient surges. Pandemics often strike in two waves or more, and the second is usually the worst, so measures need to be lasting, Keskinocak said.\nEven without COVID-19, the U.S. healthcare system has been under strain. Emergency rooms are often overcrowded; it takes a long time to schedule an appointment, and there is a chronic shortage of nursing staff.\n[ Read Keskinocak's guest op-ed in the New York Daily News: COVID clinics now ]\n\u201cWe need to expand capacity and unleash creative flexibility in our healthcare systems. We should use more telemedicine and create self-service stations for testing. I would particularly like to see specialized COVID-19 clinics established now,\u201d Keskinocak said.\n\u201cSpecial clinics could be separate spaces in existing facilities or standalone facilities. As COVID-19 spreads, we expect a lot more people with cold- and flu-like symptoms to seek testing and care. The healthcare capacities are just not there for a business as usual approach, and taking it could harm patients by delaying care and increasing risk of infection.\u201d\nGathering COVID-19 patients in tight spaces like waiting rooms with other patients would increase the coronavirus\u2019 spread, and patients with preexisting conditions could face mortal threat. Contagion could also spread into hospitals.\n\u201cDedicated pandemic clinics could implement targeted hygiene, air filtration, and specialized protective equipment beyond masks and gloves for healthcare workers. They can tailor workflows to test and care for patients quickly and effectively and keep them away from other patients and staff,\u201d Keskinocak said.\nPayment needs to be easy, too, including financing the uninsured. In the middle of a public health emergency, it is vital to not get bogged down by restrictions meant for normal times.\nPotentially dangerous shortages\nToilet paper will make a comeback in supermarkets, but in its place, life-saving medications could become perilously scarce. Countries need to act now to prevent this from compounding the COVID-19 crisis.\n\u201cDwindling availability of hospital beds, ventilators, and personal protective equipment like masks and gloves during a patient surge \u2013 those are the obvious things. But we could also see shortages of items like asthma medication or antidepressants. Worst case, even food supplies could run low,\u201d Keskinocak said.\n[ Read Keskinocak's guest op-ed in The Hill: medical supply chain dangers ]\nHere\u2019s how shortages work and can lead to price gouging and also rationing. The latter can have good effects.\n\u201cShortages are the result of supply-demand imbalance caused by either an unexpected increase in demand or unexpected decrease in supply or both. Shortages are common in crises such as natural disasters or health emergencies. But given the worldwide slowdown of economic activity in pandemics, disruptions could get much worse this time,\u201d Keskinocak said.\n\u201cSupply chains are actually intricate webs of multiple parts that span the globe. Pandemics damage many of those parts, and it can take time to recover. This creates a more serious and worrisome imbalance between supply and demand.\u201d\nToilet paper will return because people fear-hoard it in a panic but consume it at normal rates. When the panic runs its course, demand slows back down to the actual rate of consumption and its normal supply chain, which is relatively simple, catches up.\n\u201cWith medicine and healthcare services and supplies, the increase in demand is typically already in line with consumption, so a shortage in supply or increase in demand can create a supply-demand gap that continues for a long time,\u201d Keskinocak said. \u201cMedical supply chains are also very complex and fragile.\u201d\nFuture vaccine distribution\nIn normal times, most supply chains work\u00a0at a plodding pace, and when crisis strikes, it is tough to ramp them up due to expensive equipment, complex logistics, and strict regulations, particularly in health care.\u00a0Even temporary shortages of medicines and medical devices can have consequences for patients who need them.\n\u201cIf shortages become serious, rationing \u2013 with a priority allocation to those most in need \u2013 can help balance demand and supply for critical items like medications.\u201d\nOnce created and approved, the production of vaccines or antivirals for COVID-19 will\u00a0ramp up slowly and could be in short supply at first. Decision-makers need plan investments now in the supply chains necessary for their effective distribution.\nThis will include painful, necessary decisions like prioritizing first doses for healthcare workers, people with pre-existing conditions, and the elderly. The current system of restocking vaccines in the U.S. after initial distribution\nalso has serious gaps that need fixing\nto save many more lives.\nIn the meantime, social distancing is one of the best ways to protect everyone and reduce the patient surge into clinics. Do it if you or anyone in your household has any cold-like symptoms.\n[ Read Keskinocak's commentary on social distancing on\u00a0AJC.com ]\nAlso read:\u00a0 Vaccine Supply Gaps Can\u00a0Make Pandemics Deadlier\nMedia contacts:\nBen Brumfield (ben.brumfield@comm.gatech.edu) and John Toon (john.toon@comm.gatech.edu)\nAdditional Images\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
