She thought it would happen later in life, after she worked several jobs and maybe earned a master\u2019s degree. Instead, as an undergraduate at Georgia Tech, Burton launched a startup that could provide access to improved sanitation for billions of people around the world. On Saturday she represents Georgia Tech in Washington, D.C., by speaking at the\nNational Maker Faire , which kicks off today and features inventors and tech enthusiasts from across the country. The event is part of the White House\u2019s \u201c Week of Making ,\u201d running though Thursday, \u201cBeing an entrepreneur is tiring and it\u2019s been a lot of work, but everything at Georgia Tech is hard,\u201d she said. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t make it impossible. Here I\u2019ve learned how to make everything possible.\u201d This is just the latest honor for Burton, who graduated in December with a degree in industrial design. She was part of the team that won the 2014\nInVenture Prize , an annual Georgia Tech contest that rewards students with cash prizes and free patents for big ideas that solve the world\u2019s problems. The all-female team invented SafiChoo, an inexpensive mobile toilet, and conducted field tests on the device last summer in a refugee village in Kenya. \u201cInVenture was the turning point for me,\u201d she said. \u201cI realized then that my goal as a humanitarian-focused entrepreneur is possible and that the time to do it is now.\u201d While the original team members moved on to other endeavors, Burton continued working on the device this fall and in November launched a social organization called Wish for WASH, which stands for water, sanitation and hygiene. The group seeks to bring innovation to the world of sanitation with SafiChoo serving as the company\u2019s first product.\u00a0 About a dozen undergraduate students help Wish for WASH in different capacities, providing interdisciplinary expertise with backgrounds in business, policy, biomedical engineering and civil engineering. This past fall, the company sponsored a Capstone team of biomedical and mechanical engineers who made the SafiChoo bidet more efficient. As for Burton, she took a course on social entrepreneurship at the Scheller College of Business in the fall and this past spring pursued a post-baccalaureate independent study in social entrepreneurship through the college. She moves to Zambia July 1 to begin a one-year fellowship with Global Health Corps. Burton will continue to work with Wish for WASH and hopefully conduct another round of field tests on the latest iteration of SafiChoo. \u201cWhen I realized this is what I wanted to do, I asked for help and the Georgia Tech community opened all these doors for me,\u201d Burton said. \u201cThere is a growing spirit of entrepreneurship at Georgia Tech, and people are starting to realize there are a lot of incredible people in the Georgia Tech family.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nEngineering Entrepreneurs\nWish for WASH\nCreate at Tech\nEmpathic Design\nSolving a Global Crisis\nContact\nLaura Diamond\u00a0 Georgia Tech Media Relations 404-894-6016\nEmail\nlaura.diamond@comm.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
