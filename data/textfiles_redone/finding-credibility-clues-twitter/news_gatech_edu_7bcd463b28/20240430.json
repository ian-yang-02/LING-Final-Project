They asked people to judge the posts on their credibility (from \u201ccertainly accurate\u201d to \u201ccertainly inaccurate\u201d). Then the team fed the words into a model that split them into 15 different linguistic categories. The classifications included positive and negative emotions, hedges and boosters, and anxiety.\nThe Georgia Tech computer then examined the words to judge if the tweets were credible or not. It matched the humans\u2019 opinions about 68 percent of the time. That\u2019s significantly higher than the random baseline of 25 percent.\n\u201cTweets with booster words, such as \u2018undeniable,\u2019 and positive emotion terms, such as \u2018eager\u2019 and \u2018terrific,\u2019 were viewed as highly credible,\u201d Mitra said. \u201cWords indicating positive sentiment but mocking the impracticality of the event, such as \u2018ha,\u2019 \u2018grins\u2019 or \u2018joking,\u2019 were seen as less credible. So were hedge words, including \u2018certain level\u2019 and \u2018suspects.\u2019\u201d\nHigher numbers of retweets also correlated with lower credibility scores. Replies and retweets with longer message lengths were thought to be more credible.\n\u201cIt could be that longer message lengths provide more information or reasoning, so they\u2019re viewed as more trustworthy,\u201d she said. \u201cOn the other hand, a higher number of retweets, which was scored lower on credibility, might represent an attempt to elicit collective reasoning during times of crisis or uncertainty.\u201d\nThe system isn\u2019t deployable yet, but the Georgia Tech team says it could eventually become an app that displays the perceived trustworthiness of an event as it unfolds on social media.\n\u201cWhen combined with other signals, such as event topics or structural information, our linguistic result could be an important building block of an automated system,\u201d said Eric Gilbert, Mitra\u2019s advisor and an assistant professor in Georgia Tech\u2019s School of Interactive Computing. \u201cTwitter is part of the problem with spreading untruthful news online. But it can also be part of the solution.\u201d\nThe paper, \u201cA Parsimonious Language Model of Social Media Credibility Across Disparate Events,\u201d will be presented in February at the\n20th ACM Conference on Computer-Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing\nin Portland, Oregon.\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nEric Gilbert's comp.social Lab\nContact\nJason Maderer\nNational Media Relations\nmaderer@gatech.edu\n404-660-2926\nEmail\nmaderer@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
