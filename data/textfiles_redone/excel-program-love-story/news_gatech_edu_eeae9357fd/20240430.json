The two also found love.\nThe Expanding Career, Education, and Leadership Opportunities (EXCEL) Program is a four-year college certificate program for students with intellectual and developmental disabilities. Founded in 2014, EXCEL\nexpands opportunities for its graduates, awarding\ntwo separate certificates, one in \u2018Academic Enrichment\u2019 and the other in \u2018Social Growth.\u2019\nGoodman enrolled in EXCEL two years before Smith, but once the two met, they became inseparable. Smith fondly remembers their first date in 2019 at Moe\u2019s in Tech Square. \u201cI just loved how we seemed to never run out of things to talk about and how much we had in common,\u201d Smith explained.\nThey currently work as teacher\u2019s assistants \u2014 yet another area the two have in common. Smith works at the Phase Family Learning Center, while Goodman, a member of EXCEL\u2019s first graduating class in 2020, works with\nJoseph Sams School.\nGoodman and Smith both grew up just outside of metro Atlanta, in Fayetteville and Alpharetta, respectively. The proximity to home, combined with the obvious benefits of the EXCEL Program,\nled their parents to recommend EXCEL to them.\nNow, years later, both families are all happy with that decision.\nOf course, the Covid pandemic and accompanying lockdown presented certain challenges to the students\u2019 academic and personal lives. But with the help of EXCEL, the couple was able to successfully navigate life \u2014 and their romantic relationship. The two credit EXCEL for not only helping them acquire new job skills but also for helping them become more independent.\n\u201cI loved all of the teachers. They were all really great the way they taught me something new every semester and always presented new opportunities. I mean, there's really nothing not to love. \u201d Goodman said.\nIn November 2022, they got engaged when Smith proposed under the holiday lights at the Atlanta Botanical Gardens.\nThe couple plans to marry in 2024 at The Biltmore Hotel,\nnear Georgia Tech\u2019s campus.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nEvan Atkinson , Institute Social Media Officer\nEmail\neatkinson6@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
