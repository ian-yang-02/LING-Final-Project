McLaughlin\u2019s first day as Georgia Tech\u2019s new provost and executive vice president for Academic Affairs.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nEmail\nSteven W. McLaughlin\nOct 01, 2020\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nOctober 1 marks Steven W. McLaughlin\u2019s first day as Georgia Tech\u2019s new provost and executive vice president for Academic Affairs. In his initial days and weeks in this new role, McLaughlin will spend time with students, faculty, and staff across campus in listening sessions, small group meetings, and one-on-one consultations.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a dream come true to step into this role at a place I truly love. I have had the great pleasure of serving as a member of the faculty and as an administrator in a number of roles, and all of them have given me a chance to learn a different side of Tech,\u201d said McLaughlin. \u201cI look forward to hearing from my colleagues as we start the next chapter together.\u201d\nMcLaughlin has served Tech for 25 years, most recently as the dean and Southern Company Chair in the College of Engineering. Prior roles include the Steve Chaddick School Chair in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering (2012-17), and the vice provost for International Initiatives and Steven A. Denning Chair in Global Engagement (2007-12).\nMcLaughlin\u2019s service to Tech has included advocacy and leadership around issues of diversity, equity, and inclusion; student health and well-being; global engagement; and student entrepreneurship. Those passions were a natural fit as McLaughlin committed in early 2020 to serve as co-chair of the steering committee for the Institute\u2019s forthcoming strategic plan, together with Dean Maryam Alavi of the Scheller College of Business.\nHe emphasizes that the Institute\u2019s top priority is to deliver to students the highest quality educational and research experiences and that attracting, retaining, and supporting the very best and most diverse faculty and staff is essential to meeting that commitment to students. But McLaughlin recognizes that Georgia Tech is facing one of the most challenging periods in the university\u2019s history.\n\u201cWe must continue to lead, serve, and produce what our city, state, nation, and world need. \u00a0With our forthcoming strategic plan, I believe no university is better positioned to face the challenges posed by the rapidly and ever-changing world around us,\u201d said McLaughlin. \u201cWe must answer those challenges in a way that reflects our commitment not only to improve the human condition, but to address systemic and cultural changes in our Georgia Tech community.\u201d\nMcLaughlin assumes the role following Rafael L. Bras, who stepped down after serving as provost for 10 years.\n\u201cI am grateful for Dr. Bras\u2019 guidance over the years, and I intend to build on his work to develop creative and compassionate leaders and solution seekers,\u201d said McLaughlin. \u201cMy focus is, and will continue to be, on people and an equitable and inclusive environment that supports academic success and is a place where every student, faculty, and staff member can thrive,\u201d said McLaughlin.\nMcLaughlin was named to the position after an extensive national search launched by Georgia Tech President \u00c1ngel Cabrera in early 2020 and co-chaired by Charles Isbell, dean and John P. Imlay Jr. Chair in the College of Computing, and Susan Lozier, dean and Betsy Middleton and John Clark Sutherland Chair in the College of Sciences.\n\u201cI very much look forward to working with Steve to build on a solid foundation as we find new ways to deliver on our mission of Progress and Service,\u201d said Cabrera. \u201cI thank the members of the search committee led by Deans Lozier and Isbell for bringing us an outstanding and diverse pool of candidates. Steve\u2019s deep appreciation for Georgia Tech and his passion for innovation, inclusion, and excellence make him just the right person to lead us into the next decade.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nContact\nSusie Ivy\nDirector, Institute Research and Provost Communications\nEmail\nsusie.ivy@comm.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
