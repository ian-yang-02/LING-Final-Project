Pyle\nJun 28, 2018\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nA new study from the Georgia Institute of Technology provides new clues indicating that an exoplanet 500 light-years away is much like Earth.\nKepler-186f is the first identified Earth-sized planet outside the solar system orbiting a star in the habitable zone. This means it\u2019s the proper distance from its host star for liquid water to pool on the surface.\nThe Georgia Tech study used simulations to analyze and identify the exoplanet\u2019s spin axis dynamics. Those dynamics determine how much a planet tilts on its axis and how that tilt angle evolves over time. Axial tilt contributes to seasons and climate because it affects how sunlight strikes the planet\u2019s surface.\nThe researchers suggest that Kepler-186f\u2019s axial tilt is very stable, much like the Earth, making it likely that it has regular seasons and a stable climate. The Georgia Tech team thinks the same is true for Kepler-62f, a super-Earth-sized planet orbiting around a star about 1,200 light-years away from us.\nHow important is axial tilt for climate? Large variability in axial tilt could be a key reason why Mars transformed from a watery landscape billions of years ago to today\u2019s barren desert.\n\u201cMars is in the habitable zone in our solar system, but its axial tilt has been very unstable \u2014 varying from zero to 60 degrees,\u201d said Georgia Tech Assistant Professor\nGongjie Li , who led the study together with graduate student Yutong Shan from the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. \u201cThat instability probably contributed to the decay of the Martian atmosphere and the evaporation of surface water.\u201d\nAs a comparison, Earth\u2019s axial tilt oscillates more mildly \u2014 between 22.1 and 24.5 degrees, going from one extreme to the other every 10,000 or so years.\nThe orientation angle of a planet\u2019s orbit around its host star can be made to oscillate by gravitational interaction with other planets in the same system. If the orbit were to oscillate at the same speed as the precession of the planet\u2019s spin axis (akin to the circular motion exhibited by the rotation axis of a top or gyroscope), the spin axis would also wobble back and forth, sometimes dramatically.\nMars and Earth interact strongly with each other, as well as with Mercury and Venus. As a result, by themselves, their spin axes would precess with the same rate as the orbital oscillation, which may cause large variations in their axial tilt. Fortunately, the moon keeps Earth\u2019s variations in check. The moon increases our planet\u2019s spin axis precession rate and makes it differ from the orbital oscillation rate. Mars, on the other hand, doesn\u2019t have a large enough satellite to stabilize its axial tilt.\n\u201cIt appears that both exoplanets are very different from Mars and the Earth because they have a weaker connection with their sibling planets,\u201d said Li, a faculty member in the\nSchool of Physics . \u201cWe don\u2019t know whether they possess moons, but our calculations show that even without satellites, the spin axes of Kepler-186f and 62f would have remained constant over tens of millions of years.\u201d\nKepler-186f is less than 10 percent larger in radius than Earth, but its mass, composition and density remain a mystery. It orbits its host star every 130 days. According to NASA, the brightness of that star at high noon, while standing on 186f, would appear as bright as the sun just before sunset here on Earth. Kepler-186f is located in the constellation Cygnus as part of a five-planet star system.\nKepler-62f was the most Earth-like exoplanet until scientists noticed 186f in 2014. It\u2019s about 40 percent larger than our planet and is likely a terrestrial or ocean-covered world. It\u2019s in the constellation Lyra and is the outermost planet among five exoplanets orbiting a single star.\nThat\u2019s not to say either exoplanet has water, let alone life. But both are relatively good candidates.\n\u201cOur study is among the first to investigate climate stability of exoplanets and adds to the growing understanding of these potentially habitable nearby worlds,\u201d said Li.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we understand enough about the origin of life to rule out the possibility of their presence on planets with irregular seasons,\u201c added Shan. \u201cEven on Earth, life is remarkably diverse and has shown incredible resilience in extraordinarily hostile environments.\n\u201cBut a climatically stable planet might be a more comfortable place to start.\u201d\nThe paper, \u201c Obliquity Variations of Habitable Zone Planets Kepler 62-f and Kepler 186-f ,\u201d is published online in The Astronomical Journal.\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nCold Suns, Warm Exoplanets and Methane Blankets\nResearchers Use Kepler Star Data to Make Music\nContact\nJason Maderer\nNational Media Relations\nmaderer@gatech.edu\n404-660-2926\nEmail\nmaderer@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
