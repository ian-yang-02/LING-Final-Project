The process introduces a new assessment intake inform that satisfies requirements outlined within the University System of Georgia\u2019s (USG) Business Process Manual (BPM).\nHow the Process Works\nUpon the creation of a new contract, amendment of an existing contract, or renewal of an existing contract, all USG institutions and organizations must ensure that suppliers (or other third parties) with access to USG data are adequately protecting that data. This protection must be at least the same level of protection provided by Georgia Tech and/or the USG and as required by policy, law, or regulation.\nGeorgia Tech has created an USG approved process for review by both Cyber Security and Procurement as required by the BPM. When data is shared with or can be accessed by the supplier, the departmental end user must complete the BPM 3.4.4 Supplier Contracts Assessment Intake Form and the Contract Checklist in order to satisfy USG requirements.\nWhat does this mean for you?\nAfter August 1, 2022, requesters must complete a Supplier Contracts Assessment Intake Form and Contract Checklist when attempting to create or renew a supplier contract. This form will assess the supplier\u2019s access and utilization of any Georgia Tech or USG data and ensure that any access is adequately managed and protected. All requests will be reviewed by Georgia Tech Cyber Security prior to execution. This also includes zero ($0) dollar purchases.\nPlease note that this new process\ndoes not\nreplace the existing CTR (campus technology request) process. However, the Office of Information Technology is working with Cyber Security, Procurement, and other offices to review and identify ways to optimize how technology is requested across the Institute.\nThis Supplier Contracts Assessment Intake Form is located in ServiceNow: ( https://gatech.service-now.com/home/?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=cae57d8e1bdcc55829eba8e2b24bcb2b ).\nContact\nTeresa Holcomb\nPurchasing Manager \u2013 IT & Scientific\nProcurement and Business Services\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
