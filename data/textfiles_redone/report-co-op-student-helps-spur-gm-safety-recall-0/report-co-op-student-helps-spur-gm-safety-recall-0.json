GM recognized Sulimirski for reporting a safety problem he found in his father\u2019s 2004 Cadillac. That report led to the recall of more than 10,000 older Cadillacs.\nNov 24, 2014\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nNick Sulimirski fell in love with cars when he was 7 years old, repairing them with his dad in the family\u2019s garage. He bought his first car, a 1990 Jeep Wrangler, when he was just 13. To make the car more powerful, he removed the engine and replaced it with one from a Chevrolet S10 pickup truck. His relationship with General Motors continues today. The fourth-year engineering major has completed three co-op rotations with GM and will return to the company this summer. The company flew him to Detroit last month to have lunch with CEO Mary Barra and Jeff Boyer, GM's vice president of global vehicle safety. They recognized Sulimirski for reporting a safety problem he found in his father\u2019s 2004 Cadillac. That report led to the recall of more than 10,000 older Cadillacs in September. During lunch, the three swapped stories about co-op experiences, Sulimirski said. \u00a0\u201cI basically got my dream job as a 19-year-old,\u201d said Sulimirski, now 21. Nick noticed the problem with his dad\u2019s car in 2013. The car stalled at highway speeds, had poor fuel economy and smelled of gasoline. The two men traced the problem to an issue with the fuel pump and fixed it themselves. \u201cI thought this was a pretty serious and dangerous problem and felt GM should know about it,\u201d Sulimirski said. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t know who to report it to.\u201d By the time Sulimirski returned to GM this past summer, the company had launched Speak Up for Safety, a program that recognizes employees for ideas that make vehicles safer, and for speaking up when they notice issues that could affect customer safety. He completed a form through the company\u2019s internal site and received a response the next day. \u201cI\u2019ve been blown away by how quickly they responded,\u201d Sulimirski said. \u201cIt\u2019s incredible to see a large company respond this way.\u201d GM started Speak Up for Safety to provide people with an option to openly report issues of concern, spokeswoman Jennie Ecclestone said. \"Safety is everybody's responsibility, not just the people who have safety in their title,\u201d she said. \u201cNick really took that mindset to heart and helped raise an issue that we can now fix for our customers.\" The callback was the first initiated through Speak up for Safety, and Sulimirski\u2019s involvement has led to national media coverage. Friends joke he\u2019s filling up their Facebook feeds. People stop him on campus. For his part, Sulimirski doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s different from any other co-op student. He\u2019ll return to GM this summer for his fourth co-op rotation, working for GM Racing Powertrain. It\u2019s an ideal assignment for Sulimirski, who drives a 2002 Pontiac Trans Am. He will graduate in 2016 and hopes to return to Detroit. \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI\u2019d love to get a job at GM,\u201d Sulimirski said. \u201cThat would be my absolute dream. I\u2019ve wanted that since I was 7 years old and working in the garage at home with my dad.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nContact\nLaura Diamond\u00a0 Georgia Tech Media Relations 404-894-6016\nEmail\nlaura.diamond@gatech.edu\nAdditional information\nReal-world Experience The Georgia Tech Undergraduate Co-op Program complements classroom lessons with paid practical work experience directly related to a student's academic major.
