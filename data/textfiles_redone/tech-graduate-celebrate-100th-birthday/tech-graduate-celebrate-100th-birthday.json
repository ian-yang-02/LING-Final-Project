They called themselves the Technicians, and they had gigs every Friday and Saturday evening, as well as playing at Sunday afternoon tea dances. During his sophomore year, he was hired by Harry Hearn\u2019s Dance Band and became a card-carrying professional musician, earning the money to pay for his education.\nAfter graduating with an electrical engineering degree in May 1942, with four years of ROTC experience, he joined the U.S. Army. Blair was assigned to the USAAF and sent to Randolph Field in Texas, where he trained as a pilot. Only one out of 100 cadets made the cut to become a P-47 pilot, and Floyd Blair was among them.\nThe P-47 fighter plane was dangerous because it was used for strafing enemy targets, exposing the plane and pilot to the infamous German Flak guns. It carried a heavy payload of bombs and was instrumental in winning World War II.\nFast forward to D-Day, June 1944, and 1st Lt. Floyd Blair was part of the 404th Fighter Group and a participant in Operation Overlord, flying his P-47 over the landing on Normandy. Every pilot had a code name, and Blair\u2019s was \u201cRamblin\u2019 Wreck.\u201d The 404th supported the ground troops at the Battle of the Bulge as they pushed the front line forward.\nIn September 1944, the town of Sint-Truiden, Belgium, was liberated, and the Germans abandoned their air base. The 404th moved out of their tents and onto the base, enjoying decent quarters for the first time since the invasion began. By November, Blair organized a five-piece band after requesting instruments and permission to drive to Holland to purchase a sound system. The locals spoke Flemish and French, which the Americans did not understand, so they named the band Nix Compris, which translates to \u201cnothing understood.\u201d They were a hit with the locals as well as the troops.\nBlair was promoted to captain in January 1945 and continued to fly mission after mission. When he reached his 100th mission in April 1945, he completed his tour, turned in his parachute, and left the 404th. He was awarded a Distinguished Unit Citation; French Croix de Guerre with Palm; Belgian Fourragere with Palm; Campaign Medals for Normandy, Northern France, Rhineland, and Ardennes-Alsace; Distinguished Flying Cross; and an Air Medal with 15 bronze oak leaf clusters and three silver oak clusters.\nWhen Blair was discharged, he went to work for Westinghouse in Florida and became a licensed electrical engineer. The Army recalled him to serve for two years during the Korean conflict. He went on to have a career as an advisor and consultant, retiring at the age of 95.\nHe was awarded the French Legion of Honor Medal in 2016.\nToday, he lives in Ocala, Florida, with his wife, Sharon, and is hoping to return to Normandy to celebrate the 80th anniversary of D-Day in 2024.\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nLiving History Program\nContact\nMarilyn Somers\nLiving History Program\nAdditional information\nWish Floyd Blair a happy birthday at\u00a0 https://floyd100th.com/ .\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
