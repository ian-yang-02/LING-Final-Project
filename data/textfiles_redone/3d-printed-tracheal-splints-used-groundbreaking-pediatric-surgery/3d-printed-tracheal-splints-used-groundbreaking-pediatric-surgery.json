A cross-functional team of Children\u2019s surgeons used three custom-made splints, which biomedical engineers at the Georgia Institute of Technology helped create using an innovative and experimental 3D-printing technology, to assist the breathing of a 7-month-old patient battling life-threatening airway obstruction.\n\"We are so fortunate to work with a leading engineering school like Georgia Tech to find innovative, potentially life-saving treatment options for our patients,\u201d said Donna Hyland, president and CEO, Children\u2019s Healthcare of Atlanta. \u201cThis is a great example of how aligning Children\u2019s clinical expertise with the missions of our research collaborators can improve patient outcomes. Research that can be translated into more effective care at the bedside is why our collaboration with Georgia Tech is so important for the future of pediatric care in Georgia.\u201d\nThe patient who received the groundbreaking surgery is a 7-month-old boy battling both congenital heart disease and tracheo-bronchomalacia, a condition that causes severe life-threatening airway obstruction. During his six-month inpatient stay in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit at Children\u2019s, he experienced frequent episodes of airway collapse that could not be corrected by typical surgery protocols. The clinical team proposed surgically inserting an experimental 3D-printed tracheal splint, which is a novel device still in development, to open his airways and expand the trachea and bronchus.\nScott Hollister, Ph.D ., who holds the Patsy and Alan Dorris Endowed Chair in Pediatric Technology, a joint initiative supported by Georgia Tech and Children\u2019s Healthcare of Atlanta, developed the process for creating the tracheal splint using 3D printing technology at University of Michigan C.S. Mott Children\u2019s Hospital prior to joining Georgia Tech. The Children\u2019s procedure was the 15th time a 3D-printed tracheal splint was placed in a pediatric patient.\n\u201cThe possibility of using 3D printing technology to save the life of a child is our motivation in the lab every day,\u201d said Hollister, who is also the director of the Center for 3D Medical Fabrication at Georgia Tech and a professor in the\nWallace H. Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering at Georgia Tech and Emory University . \u201cWe\u2019re determined to develop innovative solutions that meet the needs of Georgia\u2019s most complex pediatric patients.\u201d\nThe splints were created using reconstructions of the patient\u2019s airways from CT scans. Hollister and his team of biomedical engineers collaborated with the\nGlobal Center for Medical Innovation\n(GCMI) so that GCMI could create multiple versions of the splint, of varying sizes, to ensure the perfect fit was available for the surgical team to select and place around the patient\u2019s airways during surgery. GCMI will also support the ongoing development and commercialization of the technology.\nIn a complex 10-hour surgery, Children\u2019s cross-functional team of surgeons successfully placed three 3D-printed splints around the patient\u2019s trachea on the morning of August 17, 2018. The splints will eventually be absorbed into the body, allowing for expansion of the trachea and bronchus.\nThe Children\u2019s tracheal splint team included Steve Goudy, M.D., and April Landry, M.D., (ENT), pediatric otolaryngologists; Subhadra Shashidharan, M.D., pediatric cardiothoracic surgeon; and Kevin Maher, M.D., pediatric cardiologist.\nAs the tracheal procedure concluded, the child was placed on a heart lung machine for surgical repair of his cardiac defect. Postoperative care took place in the Cardiac ICU and the Pediatric ICU at Children\u2019s.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the close relationships we have with our research collaborators that make this kind of groundbreaking procedure possible,\u201d said Dr. Goudy. \u201cA large number of additional physicians, support staff and outside collaborators worked together on this innovative procedure.\u201d\nThe 3D-printed tracheal splint is a new device still under development, as safety and effectiveness have not yet been determined and is therefore not available for clinical use. The Children\u2019s team sought emergency clearance from the FDA to move forward with the procedure under expanded access guidelines.\nIn 2015, Georgia Tech and Children\u2019s formed The Children's Healthcare of Atlanta Pediatric Technology Center on Georgia Tech's campus to further advance pediatric research.\nMedia Contacts:\u00a0Chrissie Gallentine, Children\u2019s Healthcare of Atlanta (404-785-7614) or\u00a0John Toon, Georgia Institute of Technology (404-894-6986)(jtoon@gatech.edu).\nChildren\u2019s Healthcare of Atlanta\nChildren\u2019s Healthcare of Atlanta has been 100 percent dedicated to kids for more than 100 years.
