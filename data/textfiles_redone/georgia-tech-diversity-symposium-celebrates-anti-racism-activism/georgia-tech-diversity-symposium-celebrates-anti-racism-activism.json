IDEI offered limited seating in room 236 and also provided the campus with a virtual viewing option.\nIn total, the hybrid event was seen by\u00a0more than 600.\n\u201cEach year,\u00a0the Georgia Tech Diversity Symposium presents an important opportunity for all of us as members of the Tech community to come together to engage in important conversations about challenges and solutions to advance our journey toward becoming a more inclusive and welcoming campus for its members,\u201d Archie Ervin, vice president of IDEI and co-chair of the event's planning committee said.\nTitled \u201cThe Globalization of Anti-Racism Activism,\u201d the event included campus members and issue-area experts who spoke to share experiences with race and the rise of anti-racism movements locally, nationally, and worldwide\u00a0\u2014 particularly after the 2020 deaths of Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, and George Floyd.\nThe tone was quickly set for the day,\nbeginning with remarks by Ervin, Georgia Tech President \u00c1ngel Cabrera, and Ivan Allen College Associate Professor Andr\u00e9 Brock , who warmed the virtual stage for the event\u2019s keynote virtual speaker, noted historian Ibram X. Kendi, bestselling and prizewinning author of\nStamped from the Beginning: The Definitive History of Racist Ideas in America , and\nHow to Be an Antiracist .\nKendi and Ervin engaged in a 45-minute fireside chat discussion.\n\u201cIn the unlikely event someone hasn\u2019t read\nHow to Be an Antiracist ,\u201d Ervin began, \u201cwhat does it mean to be antiracist?\u201d\n\u201cSo, I think, first and foremost, it is important to start my answer with racial inequities [examples],\u201d Kendi responded from his Boston office. \u201cBlack and brown people in this country are overrepresented in the incarcerated population. They\u2019re more likely to be killed by the police. They\u2019re more likely to be impoverished, and since this pandemic, they\u2019ve been the most killed by Covid.\n\u201cThere are largely two explanations for why racial disparities and inequities exist: One idea is racist policies and another idea is racist ideas,\" Kendi continued. \"Typically, people who reject that racial policies are causing racist disparities, turn around and then claim that the reason Black people are overrepresented in prison populations is because they are more violent and commit more crimes because they\u2019re more inclined to violence and criminality \u2014 which suggests that Black people are more criminal-like than other groups, which suggests that Black people are inferior... which suggests the racist idea.\n\u201cAnd so to be\nantiracist\nis to first and foremost recognize all racial groups as equals. It doesn\u2019t mean that all people are the same, but behaviorally and genetically that the races are equal. What this means [to be antiracist] is that we have a disparity; it means there are racist policies and racist practices and to be antiracist is to try to uncover these policies and eliminate them.\u201d\nKendi is a\u00a0contributing writer at The Atlantic and a CBS News correspondent. He is also the Andrew W. Mellon Professor in the Humanities at Boston University and founding director of the BU Center for Antiracist Research.\n\u201cLet me turn to the focus of our program, which is anti-racism activism across the globe,\u201d Ervin continued. \u201cWhy do you think the video recording of George Floyd's murder last May at the hands of police\u00a0launched a powderkeg of anti-racism movements worldwide?\u201d\n\u201cBefore we saw Floyd\u2019s murder and the circulation of his video, there was already a growing awareness,\u201d said Kendi. \u201cThose of us who work in racial and equity work had been reeling, for about two months, that Black people in particular had been dying at the highest rates from Covid-19. So there was already outrage about just how racism itself is a public health emergency. That, combined with the fact that people were quarantined and were widely able to see the gruesome murder all at once, launched the worldwide rage.\u201d\nThe Ervin-Kendi discussion was followed by a\u00a0question-and-answer session featuring Kendi versus the in-person and virtual audiences.\nThe event continued with a\npanel conversation, \u201cGlobal and Local Connections ,\u201d facilitated by Kirk Bowman, professor with the\u00a0Sam Nunn School of International Affairs and School of Economics. Panelists included: Jancy Ling Liu, School of Economics doctoral student; Dorian Brown Crosby, associate professor of political science at Spelman College; and Kevin Shanker Sinha, organizer and activist for Equity and Justice and founder of Civic Georgia. The group discussed how collective actions and community responses to local acts of racism inspire global movements, such as Asian American and Pacific Islander movements across the world earlier this year.\nA\nsecond panel, \u201cViews From Elsewhere: Race in the United States ,\u201d shared their experiences as international students in the U.S. and how their ideas of race and racism were shaped in their native countries, and reshaped once in the U.S. and from their experiences of traveling abroad.\nSabir Khan, associate professor in the School of Architecture and School of Industrial Design, facilitated the discussion between the group: Bangseh Akuchu, alumnus and graduate student in the Scheller College of Business; Jhordan Channer, alumnus and adjunct professor at the Caribbean School of Architecture; Mandani Tennakook, undergraduate student in the School of Civil and Environmental Engineering; and alumni Kyla Dowlen and Joel Jassu.\nDiversity Awards Presentations\nAfter a break for lunch, the afternoon kicked off with the Diversity Symposium\u2019s\nannual awards presentations of the Diversity Champion Awards and Faces of Inclusive Excellence .\nThe Diversity Champion Awards annually recognize a faculty member, staff member, student, and campus unit\u00a0whose scholarship or work advances a culture of diversity, equity, and inclusive excellence at Georgia Tech. 2021 recipients were chosen for their engagement to advance activities that address systemic racism at Georgia Tech and abroad.\nThis year\u2019s honorees were Lewis Wheaton, associate professor, School of Biological Sciences; Shaunitra Wisdom, academic advisor II, School of Architecture; Shelbe Johnson, undergraduate student, School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering; and the Equity Collective, a group of 17 Office of Undergraduate Education division leaders, faculty, staff, and students who \u201ccollaborate in ambitious working groups to significantly advance the collective\u2019s core priorities,\u201d such as advancing equity-based facilitation training.\nFaces of Inclusive Excellence\u00a0annually recognizes a diverse group of faculty, staff, and students who are committed to advancing a culture of inclusive excellence at Georgia Tech and who have distinguished themselves in their research, teaching, and/or service. This year, 64 diverse honorees\u00a0were featured in its printed publication.\n\u201cThese are the real faces of inclusive excellence at Georgia Tech,\u201d Ervin said, as he held up the booklet, addressing the crowd.\nThe event ended with closing words from Ervin, but not before a summation of the day, \u2018 Where do We Go from Here?\u2019 by Associate Dean of Students Stephanie Ray , who ended her remarks with a passionate rendition of James Patrick Kinney\u2019s \"The Cold Within.\u201d\nThe event was presented by the 2021 Georgia Tech Diversity Symposium Awards Planning Committee, chaired by Ervin and Co-Chair Carol Colatrella, professor in the School of Literature, Media and Communication and co-director of the Center for the Study of Women, Science and Technology.\nCommittee members included: Adjo Amekudzi-Kennedy, professor and associate chair, School of Civil and Environmental Engineering; Tamara Ballou, marketing and event coordinator II, Institute Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion; Melanie DeMaeyer, assistant dean of students and director, Women\u2019s Resource Center; Amy Bass Henry, executive director, Office of International Education; Courtney Hill, communications manager, Institute Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion; Tia Jewell, program and portfolio manager, Institute Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion; Shiraz Karaa, counselor, Georgia Tech Counseling Center; Sabir Khan, associate professor, School of Architecture and School of Industrial Design, and\u00a0director, International Education, School of Architecture; Keona Lewis, associate sirector of Institute Diversity Research, Institute Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion; Tegra Myanna, director, LGBTQIA Resource Center; Sebnem \u00d6zkan, associate director, Atlanta Global Studies Center; Shamecia Powers, assistant director, administrative operations, Office of International Education; Stephanie Ray, associate dean of students, and director, Student Diversity Programs; Julian Rimoli, associate professor, School of Aerospace Engineering; Catherine Ross, Regents Professor and Harry West Chair, School of City and Regional Planning; Anna Stenport, dean, College of Liberal Arts, Rochester Institute of Technology; John Stein, associate vice president for Student Engagement and Well-Being and Brandt-Fritz Dean of Students Chair; Carol Sullivan, senior academic professional, Center for Teaching and Learning; and Ashlee Toomey-Flinn, Education Abroad Scholarships advisor and marketing specialist, Office of International Education.\nTo learn more about the 2021 Diversity Symposium, visit\ndiversity.gatech.edu/13th-annual-georgia-tech-diversity-symposium .\nPhoto\u00a0and video credit: Georgia Tech Institute Communications\nContact\nCourtney Hill\nCommunications Manager\nInstitute Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion\ncourtney.hill@gatech.edu\nEmail\ncourtney.hill@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
