The primary purpose of this program is to give first- and second-year graduate students in diverse disciplines working on original and unfunded research in micro- and nano-scale projects the opportunity to access the most advanced academic cleanroom space in the Southeast. In addition to accessing the high-level fabrication, lithography, and characterization tools in the labs, the awardees will have the opportunity to gain proficiency in cleanroom and tool methodology and access the consultation services provided by research staff members in IEN. Seed Grant awardees are also provided travel support to present their research at a scientific conference.\nIn addition to student research skill development, this bi-annual grant program gives faculty with novel research topics the ability to develop preliminary data to pursue follow-up funding sources. The Core Facility Seed Grant program is supported by the Southeastern Nanotechnology Infrastructure Corridor (SENIC), a member of the National Science Foundation\u2019s National Nanotechnology Coordinated Infrastructure (NNCI).\nSince the start of the grant program in 2014, 78 projects from ten different schools in Georgia Tech\u2019s Colleges of Engineering and Science, as well as the Georgia Tech Research Institute and three other universities, have been seeded.\nThe six winning projects in this round were awarded IEN cleanroom and lab access time to be used over the next year. In keeping with the interdisciplinary mission of IEN, the projects that will be enabled by the grants include research in semiconductor technology, metamaterials, quantum devices, polymer films, and materials analysis.\nThe Spring 2022 IEN Core Facility Seed Grant Award winners are:\nCustomized Nonlinear Metamaterials for Photon Upconversion\nPI: Wenshan Cai | Student: Anjan Goswami\nSchool of Electrical and Computer Engineering/School of Materials Science and Engineering\nFabricating Semiconductor Moir\u00e9 Quantum Devices for Quantum Information Applications\nPI: Zhigang Jiang | Student: Wei-Chen Wang\nSchool of Physics\nEnhancing Ferroelectric Switching Through Sputter Process Control in AlScN\nPI: Lauren Garten | Student: John Wellington-Johnson\nSchool of Materials Science and Engineering\nSelf-Repairing Polymeric Films as Artificial Solid-Electrolyte Interface Enabling Rechargeable Zinc Metal Batteries\nPI: Seung Woo Lee | Student: Kun Ryu\nGeorge W.
