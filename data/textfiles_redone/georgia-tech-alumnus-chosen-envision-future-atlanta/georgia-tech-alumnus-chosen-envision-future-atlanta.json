Mayor Kasim Reed chose Gravel to head up the Atlanta City Design Project, an undertaking aimed at envisioning what the city will look like in decades to come, as well as guide future decisions on the growth and development of the city. \u201cPioneering a project that will shape all the future planning decisions and that promotes strategic development in Atlanta is my dream job,\u201d Gravel said\nin a release from the City of Atlanta. While a master\u2019s student at Georgia Tech, Gravel had an idea to take railroad corridors that were grown over with weeds and unused and turn them into 22 miles of revitalized parks, transit and trails connecting Atlanta neighborhoods. \u201cIt\u2019s a community revitalization project, it\u2019s an economic development project, it\u2019s a public health project,\u201d\nGravel said of the BeltLine in an interview with Georgia Tech\u2019s Alumni Magazine.\n\u201cIt does all of those things, so it brings in a lot of people wanting the same thing. It brings a lot of constituencies together.\u201d Gravel and the Atlanta City Design Project will begin meeting and planning this summer.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nSteven Norris Social Media Manager Georgia Tech\nEmail\nsnorris@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
