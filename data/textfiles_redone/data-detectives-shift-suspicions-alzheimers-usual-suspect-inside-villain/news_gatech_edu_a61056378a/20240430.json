In particular, center structures of the brain usually diminish early on. One such region susceptible to early and severe damage is the hippocampus, which can lead to memory loss and disorientation. Illustration credit: National Institute on Aging, National Institutes of Health\nFeb 19, 2018\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nThe mass pursuit of a conspicuous suspect in Alzheimer\u2019s disease may have held back research success for decades. Now, a\nnew data analysis\nthat has untangled evidence amassed in years of Alzheimer\u2019s studies encourages researchers to refocus their investigations.\nHeaps of plaque formed from amyloid-beta that accumulate in afflicted brains are what stick out under the microscope in tissue samples from\nAlzheimer\u2019s\nsufferers, and that eye-catching junk has long seemed an obvious culprit in the disease. But\u00a0data analysis of the cumulative evidence doesn\u2019t support giving so much attention to that usual suspect, according to a\nnew study from the Georgia Institute of Technology .\nThough the bad amyloid-beta protein does appear to be an accomplice in the disease, the study has pointed to a seemingly more likely red-handed offender, another protein-gone-bad called phosphorylated\ntau\n(p-tau). What\u2019s more, the Georgia Tech data analysis of multiple studies done on mice also turned up signs that multiple biochemical actors work together in Alzheimer\u2019s to tear down neurons, the cells that the brain uses to do its work.\nSuspect line-up: P-tau implicated, plaque not so much\nAnd the corrupted amyloid-beta that appeared more directly in cahoots with p-tau in the sabotage of brain function was not tied up in that plaque. In the line-up of the biochemical suspects examined, principal investigator\nCassie Mitchell, an assistant professor in the Wallace H. Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering\nat Georgia Tech and Emory University, said the data pointed to a pecking order of culpability.\n\u201cThe most important one would be the level of phosphorylated tau present. It had the strongest connection with cognitive decline,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cThe correlation with\namyloid\nplaque\nwas there but very weak; not nearly as strong as the correlation between p-tau and cognitive decline.\u201d\nMitchell, a biomedical informaticist, and first author Colin Huber statistically analyzed data gleaned from 51 existing lab studies in mice genetically augmented with a human form of Alzheimer\u2019s. They published their analysis\nin the current edition of the\nJournal of Alzheimer\u2019s Disease . The research was funded by the National Institutes of Health.\nThe crime: Eviscerating the brain\nOne look at an image of an Alzheimer\u2019s afflicted brain is unflinching testimony to the disease\u2019s cruelty: It\ndestroys of up to 30 percent of a brain\u2019s mass , carving out ravines and depositing piles of molecular junk, most visibly amyloid plaque.\nThe plaque builds up outside of neurons, while inside neurons, p-tau forms similar junk known as\nneurofibrillary tangles\nthat many researchers believe push the cells to their demise. But many biochemical machinations behind Alzheimer\u2019s are still unknown, and the fight to uncover them has vexed researchers for decades.\nSince the\nfirst patient was diagnosed by Dr. Aloysius Alzheimer between 1901 and 1906 , little medical progress has been made. Though some available medications may mitigate symptoms somewhat, none significantly slow disease progression, let alone stop it.\nAlzheimer\u2019s mostly strikes late in life. Longer lifespans in industrialized countries have ballooned the caseload, advancing the disease to a major cause of death.\nMeet the syndicate: Assassin, accomplices, stooges\nEven though p-tau showed the strongest correlation with cognitive decline, and amyloid-beta only a slight correlation, that doesn\u2019t mean that p-tau is committing the crime inside cells all by itself while amyloid loiters in spaces outside of cells in large gangs, creating a distraction. Mitchell\u2019s data analysis has pointed to dynamics more enmeshed than that.\n\u201cThough the study had clear trends, it also had a good bit of variance that would indicate multiple factors influencing outcomes,\u201d Mitchell said. And a particular manifestation of amyloid-beta has piqued the researchers\u2019 ire.\nLittle pieces are water soluble, that is, not tied up in clumps of plaque. The data has shown that these tiny amyloids may be up to no good. After p-tau levels, the study revealed that those of soluble amyloid-beta had the second-strongest correlation with cognitive decline.\n\u201cLumpy amyloid-beta, the stuff we see, ironically doesn\u2019t correlate as well\u00a0with cognitive decline as the soluble amyloid,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cThe amyloid you don\u2019t see is like the sugar in your tea that dissolves and hits your taste buds versus the insoluble amyloid, which is more like the sugar that doesn\u2019t dissolve and stays at the bottom of the cup.\u201d\nSome Alzheimer\u2019s researchers have cited evidence indicating that free-floating amyloid helps produce the corrupted p-tau via a chain of reactions that centers around\nGSK3\n(Glycogen synthase kinase 3), an enzyme that arms tau with phosphorous, turning it into a potential biochemical assassin.\nIncidentally, Mitchell\u2019s study also looked at un-phosphorylated tau and found its levels do not correlate with cognitive decline. \u201cThat makes sense,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cRegular tau is the backbone of our neurons, so it has to be there.\u201d\nAlso, p-tau is a normal part of healthy cells, but in Alzheimer\u2019s it is wildly overproduced.\nMassive dataset: 528 mice rat out p-tau\nOne advantage of\ndata mining\n51 existing studies versus doing one new lab experiment, is that the cumulative analysis adds the sample sizes of so many studies together for a whopping grand total. Mitchell\u2019s analysis encompassed results from past experiments carried out on, all totaled, 528 Alzheimer\u2019s mice.\nA previous study Mitchell led had already indicated that amyloid-beta plaque levels may not be the most productive target for drug development. Separate reports by other researchers on failed human trials of drugs that fought plaque would seem to corroborate this.\nMitchell\u2019s prior analysis examined lab studies that used an Alzheimer\u2019s lab mouse model that did not allow for the study of p-tau. Mitchell\u2019s current analysis covered studies involving a different mouse model that did allow for the observation of p-tau.\nMitchell\u2019s latest findings have corroborated the prior study\u2019s findings on amyloid, and also added p-tau as a key suspect in cognitive decline.\nPrincipal investigator: My take on possible treatments\nTo arrive at the 51 studies with data suitable for inclusion in their analysis, Mitchell\u2019s research team sifted through hundreds of Alzheimer\u2019s research papers, and over time, Mitchell has examined a few thousand herself. She has gained some impressions of how biomedical research may need to tackle the disease\u2019s slippery biochemical labyrinth.\n\u201cWhen we see multifactorial diseases, we tend to think we\u2019ll need multifactorial treatments,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cThat seems to be working well with cancer, where they combine chemotherapy with things like immunotherapy.\u201d\nAlso, Alzheimer\u2019s diagnosticians might be wise to their adopt cancer colleagues\u2019 early detection stance, she said, as Alzheimer\u2019s disease appears to start long before amyloid-beta plaque appears and cognitive decline sets in.\nAbove all, basic research should cast a broader net.\n\u201cI think p-tau is going to have to be a big part,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd it may be time to not latch onto amyloid-beta plaque so much like the field has for a few decades.\u201d\nDid you know?
