Whether it\u2019s for an internship, co-op, or full-time position, students everywhere are looking to find that perfect position. Unfortunately, the pandemic has added another layer of uncertainty to what can already be a stressful process. Be it fear of a limited job market or lack of knowledge about how to navigate a virtual hiring world, job seekers are having to adapt to the current circumstances.\nFortunately, there are several resources that can help students land a job. Georgia Tech\u2019s Career Center has a\nCovid-19 Student Resources\npage, complete with news about Covid-19\u2019s impact on the job market, lists of who\u2019s hiring, and more.\n\u201cWhile we have seen a slight decrease in opportunities, there are still many jobs out there, and Georgia Tech students are much sought after due to their excellence,\u201d said Andrea Comsa, director of Co-op and Experiential Education for the Career Center. \u201cOur company partners have been very engaged and supportive of Tech students, and many co-ops and internships continued in a remote setting this past summer.\u201d She added that 249 companies attended the Fall All-Majors Virtual Career Fair held last month, bringing with them plenty of job opportunities. Additional opportunities are posted daily on\nCareerBuzz .\nOver the summer, the Career Center launched\u00a0two new biweekly webinar series to help students learn how to engage with companies virtually: Career Chat Hours and Employer Insights. With Career Chat Hours, students can get job hunting tips and ask any questions they have. With Employer Insights, students can hear employer tips specifically pertaining to the virtual career search. The two webinars are hosted on alternating Thursdays from noon to 1 p.m. View the Career Center\u2019s full list of Fall 2020 programming\nhere .\n\u201cI think students should continue to be diligent in pursuing what they are interested in and engage with the companies they want to work for,\u201d Comsa said. \u201cNetworking is even more important now, and the virtual environment provides easier access and many platforms for engagement.\u201d Some valuable networking resources include\nLinkedIn ,\nStartup Exchange\nand\nCREATE-X\nfor entrepreneurial students, and Georgia Tech\u2019s vast\nalumni network .\nFor even more resources for different steps in the job search \u2014 including resume building, interviewing, and ultimately choosing between job offers \u2014 click\nhere .\nCareer Advisors\nare also available to assist students of all majors and degree levels.\n\u201cWe are here to help, and this is the time for students to connect with us,\u201d Comsa said.\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nCareer Center\nContact\nGrace Wyner\nInstitute Communications\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
