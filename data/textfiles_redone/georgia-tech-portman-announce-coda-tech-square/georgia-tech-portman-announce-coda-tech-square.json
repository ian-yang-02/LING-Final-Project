John Portman &amp; Associates is designing the facility. Georgia Tech will occupy about half the office space and the building will house Tech's high performance computing center. The retail space includes the adaptive reuse of the historic Crum &amp; Forster building.\nApr 20, 2016\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nThe Georgia Institute of Technology and Portman gathered Atlanta\u2019s civic and business leaders Wednesday to announce Coda, an unprecedented collaborative building including Georgia Tech\u2019s high performance computing center located in Tech Square. The approximately 750,000-square-foot mixed-use project represents a $375 million investment into the budding innovation district. Within the development, 620,000 square feet will be office space designed to enable unparalleled collaboration between research and industry. Georgia Tech will occupy about half the office space. Nearly 40,000 square feet of retail space, including the adaptive reuse of the historic Crum & Forster building, will be accessed by a plaza, which will become a local gathering place and outdoor living room for Tech Square and Midtown Atlanta. The development also includes an approximately 80,000-square-foot data center, which Next Tier HD has been selected to operate. \u201cWith Georgia Tech as the anchor tenant, the high performance computing center\u2019s interdisciplinary, collaborative environment will enhance Tech Square\u2019s positive impact in Midtown Atlanta, bringing together people in a mixed-use community of innovation, education and intelligent exchange,\u201d said Georgia Tech President G.P. \u201cBud\u201d Peterson. \u201cIn 12 short years, Tech Square has become the Southeast\u2019s premier innovation neighborhood.\u201d \u201cThe Portman team is honored to bring to life the vision for this mixed-use property at Tech Square, unlike anything else in the southeastern United States,\u201d said Ambrish Baisiwala, CEO of Portman Holdings. \u201cWe\u2019re excited to develop Coda \u2013 encompassing collaborative office space, co-working and research facilities, a high performance computing center and interactive community space, collectively enhancing the innovation ecosystem created by Georgia Tech and Midtown.\u201d Coda represents the next phase of Georgia Tech\u2019s Technology Square \u2013 Atlanta's most sought after neighborhood for technology- and science-based companies. The new complex will be programmed around high performance computing modeling, simulation and a sustainable innovation ecosystem that integrates the existing assets of Tech Square with new opportunities in interdisciplinary research, commercialization and sustainability. John Portman & Associates\nis designing the facility in order to achieve the primary goal of bringing research and commercialization together.\u00a0 The design includes the creation of an outdoor urban plaza bordered by retail and a giant interactive media wall, a high performance data center, and two office towers connected by a central collaborative core. This collaborative core will be a gathering nexus uniquely connecting every floor from top to bottom. The design truly represents the next generation of office space and will be a unique landmark for the city of Atlanta. \u201cWe believe innovation is generated by looking at things in a different way,\u201d explains Pierluca Maffey, vice president of design for John Portman & Associates. \u201cSo we are creating spaces that allow brilliant thinkers, creative minds and smart business people to come together, share their points of view and start a process that leads to the next big idea.\u201d Tech Square connects the intellectual capital of Georgia Tech with the thriving business community in Midtown Atlanta. \u00a0It is a magnet for tech startups and university spinoffs. The area has attracted industry innovation centers that include AT&T Mobility, Panasonic Automotive, Southern Company, Delta Air Lines, The Home Depot, Coca-Cola Enterprises, NCR and ThyssenKrupp Elevator Americas. Along with the new NCR world headquarters under development and Tech Square Labs, the eight-block Tech Square campus will soon total 3 million square feet of commercial space and more than $1 billion invested. The mixed-use development will serve as an urban \u201cmain street\u201d for the campus and community.\u00a0Leasable office and retail space will be represented by Portman Holdings\u2019 Travis Garland, assisted by JLL. Invest Atlanta has been very supportive of the project, which is anticipated to have an economic impact of $813.8 million as well as significant economic benefits \u2013 not only through the creation of 2,100 construction jobs and 2,400 jobs onsite after completion, but also through its impact on innovation in the region.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nLaura Diamond\u00a0 Media Relations\u00a0 404-894-6016 @LauraRDiamond\nEmail\nlaura.diamond@gatech.edua\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
