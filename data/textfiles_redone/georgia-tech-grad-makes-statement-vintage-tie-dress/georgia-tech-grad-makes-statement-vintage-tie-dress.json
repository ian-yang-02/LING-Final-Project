Watkins, who studied economics and industrial design at Tech, created a dress entirely out of vintage Georgia Tech ties. The ties were sourced from various places, including family and friends, as well as thrift stores and online marketplaces like eBay.\nOne particularly special tie featured iconic graphics of Georgia Tech's Tech Tower, the official seal, and the Ramblin' Wreck. Watkins says she received help from her grandmother in creating the dress and is especially proud that her family has shared in the special moment.\nWatkins took her graduation photos in her homemade design, but it may have also brought her some extra luck. She recently accepted a full-time offer from Delta Airlines, but her connection to Georgia Tech won't end there. Watkins plans to pursue a master's degree in analytics while starting her career.\nWatkins' tie dress is a testament to the creativity and innovation that many Georgia Tech graduates will carry with them along with their degrees. She says it's a unique and memorable way to celebrate her time at Tech and the connections she's made here.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nSteven Norris\nInstitute Communications\nEmail\nsnorris@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
