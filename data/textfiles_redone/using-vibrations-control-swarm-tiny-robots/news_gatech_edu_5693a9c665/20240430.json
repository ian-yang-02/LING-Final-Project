The work offers a new system to control swarms of 300 3-millimeter microbristle robots\u2019 (microbots) ability to aggregate and disperse controllably without onboard sensing.\nThe breakthrough is unique to Georgia Tech\u2019s expertise in electric and computer engineering and robotics and its push for interdisciplinary collaborations.\n\u201cBy collaborating with roboticists we were able to \u2018close the gap\u2019 between single robot design and swarm control,\u201d said\nAzadeh Ansari , an assistant professor in the\nSchool of Electrical and Computer Engineering\n(ECE). \u201cSo I guess the different elements were there, and we just made the connection.\u201d\nThe researchers presented the work, \u201c Controlling Collision-Induced Aggregations in a Swarm of Micro Bristle Robots ,\u201d in\nIEEE Transactions on Robotics .\nThe Challenges of Microbots\nWhile larger robots can control movement through sensing the environment and wirelessly sending this data to each other, microbots do not have the capacity to carry the same sensors, communications, or power units. In this study, the researchers instead utilized inter-robot physical interactions to encourage robots to swarm.\n\u201cMicrobots are too small to interpret and make decisions, but by using the collision between them and how they respond to frequency and the amplitude of global vibration actuation, we could influence how individual robots move and the collective behaviors of hundreds and thousands of these tiny robots,\u201d said Zhijian Hao, an ECE Ph.D. student.\nThese behaviors, or motility characteristics, determine how microbots move linearly and the randomness in their rotation. By using vibration, the researchers could control these motility characteristics and perform motility-induced phase separation (MIPS). The researchers borrowed the concept from thermodynamics, when an agitated material can change phases from solid to gas to liquid. The researchers manipulated the level of vibration to influence the microbots to form clusters or disperse to create good spatial coverage.\nTo better understand these phase separations, they developed computational models and a live tracking system for the 300-robot swarm using computer vision. These enabled the researchers to analyze microrobots\u2019 behavior and motion data that give rise to the swarm\u2019s characteristics.\n\u201cThis project is the first complete pipeline using this MIPS that can be generalized to different microbot swarms,\u201d Hao said. \u201cWe hope people will find that using physical interactions is another new way to control the microbots, which initially was very difficult to do.\u201d\nCollaborating for Innovation\nA Georgia Tech\nseed grant\nfrom the\nInstitute for Robotics and Intelligent Machines \u00a0(IRIM)\u00a0 and the\nInstitute for Electronics and Nanotechnology\nenabled this high-risk research.\nThe success of the project can be attributed to the interdisciplinary nature of the research. While the ECE researchers had expertise in building microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) to fabricate technology such as computer chips or microbots, the robotics researchers brought modeling experience. Ansari first created\nmicrobristle bots\nin 2019 from 3D-printed polymers, which seeded the collaboration with IRIM Director and Professor\nSeth Hutchinson\nand Professor\nMagnus Egerstedt , now at University of California, Irvine, and their Ph.D. students Sid Mayya and Gennaro Notomista.\n\u201cWe knew more about how to build micro devices and actuate them, and they knew more about the algorithms, modelings, and the closed-loop and open-loop control,\u201d Ansari said. \u201cSo, it was very good interdisciplinary work because each group benefited from the new perspectives that the others brought to this.\u201d\nCITATION: Z.
