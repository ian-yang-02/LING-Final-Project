It\u2019s a constant worry, because these skin ulcers can greatly limit patients\u2019 mobility.\n\u201cPressure injuries directly impact the veteran\u2019s quality of life, because the medical provider will order the veteran to bed rest for weeks and potentially months,\u201d said Kim House, a physician and medical director of the Spinal Cord Injury Clinic at the Atlanta Veterans Administration Healthcare System. \u201cAt every clinic visit, I provide education for pressure injury prevention.\u201d\nHouse could one day have a new tool to offer her patients, thanks to researchers in the Georgia Tech College of Engineering, and wheelchair-bound veterans are just the beginning.\nMaterials engineers are developing new fabric sensors and a customized wheelchair system that assesses and automatically eases pressure at contact points to prevent injuries from developing in the first place.\n\u201cWe have three key issues happening: First, continuous pressure. Second, moisture, because when you're sitting in the same spot, you tend to sweat and generate moisture. And third is shear. When you try to move somebody, the skin shears. That perfect combination is what causes pressure injuries,\u201d said\nSundaresan Jayaraman , professor in the\nSchool of Materials Science and Engineering\n(MSE). \u201cWe believe we have a solution to the perfect storm of pressure, moisture and shear, which means the user\u2019s quality of life is going to get better.\u201d\nGet the full story on the College of Engineering website.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nJoshua Stewart\nCollege of Engineering\nEmail\njstewart@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
