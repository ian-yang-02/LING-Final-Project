Nominations to faculty committees for the Spring 2024 elections are being solicited until Sunday, March 31.\nGeorgia Tech faculty members are invited to participate in faculty governance by seeking election to the Faculty Standing Committees or the Faculty Executive Board. Nominations (including self-nominations) are now open and can be submitted through\nthis online form .\nAll nominees will be contacted to confirm their intent to run for election prior to review of the nomination by the Nominating Committee and posting of the election ballot. The committee will attempt to honor requests for specific committees, but some elections are constrained by requirements associated with particular seats (e.g. tenure versus non-tenure track) and the maintenance of a balance of campus representation on all committees. For a description of each standing committee and its duties and charge, visit the\nGeorgia Tech Policy Library . Elected members are expected to serve a three-year term, from August 2024 through July 2027.\nFor any additional information or questions, contact\nRhett Mayor , secretary of the Faculty, or\nElena Garcia\nor\nMindy Millard-Stafford , co-chairs of the Nominating Committee.\nRelated links\nFaculty Governance\nSpring 2024 Nomination Form\nContact\nElena Garcia\nFaculty Governance\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
