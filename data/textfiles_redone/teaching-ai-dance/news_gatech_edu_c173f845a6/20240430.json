The work will culminate in a live AI dance performance with the Kennesaw State University School of Dance faculty and students.\nThe goal is to \u201cdevelop a co-creative AI that approaches expert-level participatory sensemaking in contemporary dance and train this agent to create a curated improvisational partner,\u201d according to the NSF award.\nOne inspiration for the project is\nLuminAI , a dance installation created by\nMagerko\nand his team that allows people to dance with an AI dancer via their shadows.\nLuminAI uses Microsoft Kinect videogame devices to capture the movements of a human dance partner and projects them as a silhouette onto a screen. The computer then uses artificial intelligence based on a theory of dance and movement called Viewpoints to determine how to match the human partner\u2019s moves.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be using different technologies and in a performance setting, so that will open up some new possibilities, like dancers performing with AI both on stage and in a virtual space via motion capture suits,\u201d Magerko said. \u201cThe show is a long way off, and there is a lot of science and technology development that needs to happen first.\u201d\nThe project, scheduled to run three years, is expected to lay the groundwork for the development of other applications that could benefit from such improvisational abilities, including physical therapy, design brainstorming, or future experiences with robots in the home.\nMagerko is also co-founder of\nEarSketch , an innovative educational platform created by\u00a0Magerko and Jason Freeman, the chair of the School of Music. With it, students learn to code in Python or JavaScript through music and creative discovery.\nIn 2018, the NSF\nawarded\nMagerko and Freeman $2.1 million to explore adding an AI co-creative to that program. That work is currently in the testing phase in high school computer science classrooms in Georgia and Florida, Magerko said.\nLMC\nis a unit of the Ivan Allen College of Liberal Arts.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nMichael Pearson\nmichael.pearson@iac.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
