Team Sola hopes their model for a data-driven supplemental insurance plan with quick payouts will change that, benefiting homeowners as soon as they need it \u2014 while also benefiting home insurance providers.\nWith their $20,000 check for winning the InVenture competition, Team Sola hopes to start partnering with some of America\u2019s major insurance companies. Drury and Pergament say it will also allow for them to pull in developers to continue to enhance their modeling software.\nThe judges noted Team Sola\u2019s evident passion.\n\u201cHow does one get passion for insurance?\u201d asked InVenture Prize judge Kolby Hanley, 2017 InVenture Prize winner and CEO of UltraView Archery.\n\u201cThese industries are so fascinating to look at, but they can be riddled with problems,\u201d responded Pergament. \u201cWe\u2019re just passionate about solving a big problem that hasn\u2019t been solved yet.\u201d\nIn addition to the cash prize, Team Sola will receive a free U.S. patent filing from Georgia Tech\u2019s Office of Technology Licensing and a spot in\nCREATE-X , Georgia Tech\u2019s startup incubator.\nSecond place and $10,000 went to Team Foambuster,\u00a0a team of mechanical engineers that has developed a handheld tool to minimize the snow-like debris created by installing external insulation finishing systems.\nAnd for the People\u2019s Choice Award, the viewing audience used text and web platforms to submit their votes. That $5,000 prize went to Team Reflex, which is currently testing an emergency medical drone response system to deliver lifesaving medical equipment.\n\u201cThere were so many amazing pitches, and these students are so amazing,\u201d said InVenture Prize judge Duriya Farooqui, board director of Intercontinental Hotels Group and Intercontinental Exchange.\nHanley also expressed how impressed he was by all the finalists, noting, \u201cAll of these teams are going to be successful.\u201d\nCheck out all of this year's finalist teams here.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nSteven Norris\nInstitute Communications\nEmail\nsnorris@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
