Taking advantage of tutoring, teaching assistants,\ncareer services programs , and\nentrepreneurial opportunities , she says one day everything finally \u201cclicked.\u201d\n\u201cThe College of Computing gives its students a strong technical background and comprehensive education that set me up for success,\u201d said Seibel (BS CS 21).\nOther new alumni echoed this sentiment. \u201cBeing a student in the College of Computing allowed me to learn not only the foundations of computer science but also how to apply them,\u201d said\nJoshua Suber . Having just earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in computational media, Suber is heading to Carnegie Mellon University to work on a master\u2019s degree in human-computer interaction (HCI).\nLike Suber, several new alumni from the class of 2021 are moving on to graduate programs at Georgia Tech, Cornell University, Stanford University, and other institutions.\nMost, however, including Seibel, have accepted jobs with Fortune 500 firms and other leading tech companies. According to a recent survey, the median starting salary for Georgia Tech students graduating with an undergraduate CS degree is just shy of $101,000.\nAt $100,981 \u2013 up from $93,000 in Spring 2016 \u2013 CS currently has the highest median starting salary of all majors at Georgia Tech.\nThe findings are from the\nGeorgia Tech Career and Salary Survey for 2019-2020 , which is the latest information available. The survey indicates that more than 89 percent of responding Georgia Tech graduating CS majors had job offers, while 87 percent had accepted positions. The median starting bonus for new Georgia Tech CS grads is $15,750.\nSeibel has accepted a job offer from Google. Google is one of the top companies hiring Georgia Tech CS graduates. This year, Amazon, Amazon Web Services, Microsoft, NCR, and Salesforce all hired more than one new CS alumni, mostly as software designers or software engineers.\nSeibel is joining Google\u2019s Experiments Infrastructure team in New York City as a software engineer. Part of her job on the team \u2013 which is in charge of the rollout and analytics for new features being added to products like Gmail and Google Drive \u2013 will be to identify and fix issues before they make it to the company\u2019s customers.\nAlthough a job search can be intimidating, Seibel says that the college started helping her to prepare as far back as her first year at Tech. With an active\ncorporate affiliates program\nboasting dozens of top high-tech companies and organizations, and two College career fairs each year, Seibel had lots of opportunities to meet directly with recruiters.\n\u201cGiven these experiences, I quickly became accustomed to what would\u2019ve been high-pressure situations and became comfortable in interviews and eventually, in industry,\u201d said Seibel.\nAnna Bonatz\n(BS CS 21) also attributes her success on the job market to the College\u2019s career services programs.\n\u201cI decided to schedule some mock interviews and sessions to talk about perfecting my interviewing and networking skills. This ultimately helped me land my job at Deloitte as it prepped me early for the multiple interviews and case studies that I had to complete,\u201d said Bonatz, who is starting at Deloitte as a consultant.\nShe added, \u201cMy time in the College of Computing has been challenging but immensely rewarding. Every person I have met has pushed me to be my best and learn as much as I can while finding the joy and creativity within computing.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nContact\nAlbert Snedeker, Communications Mgr.
