One type of cell, made of low-cost organic materials, has not been extensively tested in space before.\nTextured carbon nanotube-based photovoltaic cells designed to capture light from any angle will be evaluated for their ability to efficiently produce power regardless of their orientation toward the sun. Other cells made from perovskite materials and a low-cost copper-zinc-tin-sulfide (CZTS) material \u2013 along with a control group of traditional silicon-based cells \u2013 will be among the 20 photovoltaic (PV) devices placed on the Materials International Space Station Experiment Flight Facility on the exterior of the ISS for a six-month evaluation. For two of the cells, the launch marked their second trip into space.\n\u201cThe research questions are the same for all the photovoltaic cells: Can these photo-absorbers be used effectively in space?\u201d said\nJud Ready , principal research engineer in the\nGeorgia Tech Research Institute\n(GTRI), associate director of Georgia Tech\u2019s Center for Space Technology and Research, and deputy director of Georgia Tech\u2019s Institute for Materials. \u201cWith this test, we will gain insights into the degradation mechanisms of these materials and be able to compare their power production under varying conditions.\u201d\nOrganic solar cells developed in the laboratory of Professor\nBernard Kippelen\nat Georgia Tech are processed at low temperatures using solution-based processes over large areas to produce cells with an absorber that can be about 200 times thinner than the width of a human hair.\n\u201cWith a very low weight and power conversion efficiency values of up to 16%, organic solar cells could yield power values in the hundreds of thousands of watts per kilogram of active material, which is very attractive for space applications,\u201d said Kippelen, the Joseph M. Pettit Professor in the\nSchool of Electrical and Computer Engineering . \u201cHowever, the effects of continuous exposure of these devices in a space environment have not been thoroughly explored. Our interest is in investigating the robustness of the interfaces formed in these devices in a space environment, as well as to improve our understanding of the mechanisms of degradation for organic solar cells in space.\u201d\nTraditional flat solar cells are most efficient when the sunlight is directly overhead. Because the direction of the solar flux varies with the orbit, large space vehicles like the ISS use mechanical pointing mechanisms to keep the cells properly aimed. Those complex mechanisms create maintenance issues, however, and are too heavy for use on very small spacecraft such as CubeSats.\nTo overcome the pointing problem, Ready\u2019s team developed 3D textured solar cells that can efficiently capture sunlight arriving at different angles. The cells use \u201ctowers\u201d made from carbon nanotubes and covered with PV material to trap light that would bounce off standard cells when they are not angled toward the sun.\n\u201cWith our light-trapping structure, we are agnostic to the sun angle,\u201d said Ready. \u201cOur cells actually work better at glancing angles. On CubeSats, that will allow efficient capture regardless of the orientation of the sun.\u201d\nPerovskite cells produced in the laboratory of\nZhiqun Lin , professor in the\nSchool of Materials Science and Engineering , will also be tested. These materials have known failure mechanisms caused by moisture and oxygen absorption. \u201cThese two failure mechanisms won\u2019t be present on the outside of the International Space Station, so this test will allow us to see the performance of these materials without those issues. We should be able to determine whether these known issues might be masking other degradation causes,\u201d Ready said.\nCZTS materials are potentially next-generation solar cells made up of low-cost, Earth-abundant materials: copper, zinc, tin and sulfur. The materials have a high absorption coefficient and may be resistant to radiation \u2013 useful for space applications \u2013 and offer an attractive tradeoff between cost and performance, Ready said.\nSilicon-based solar cells produced by the\nUniversity Center of Excellence in Photovoltaic Research and Education\nat Georgia Tech will provide a way to compare the performance of the other cells. The laboratory, headed by Regents Professor\nAjeet Rohatgi\nfrom the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, provided boron-doped p-type cells with a phosphorus-doped n+ emitter and aluminum-doped p+ back surface field.\n\u201cThese silicon photo-absorber cells will serve as controls to compare the performance of other photo-absorber materials in space,\u201d said Rohatgi.\nThe 20 PV cells will briefly join three other cells fabricated by Georgia Tech researchers that are already on the ISS. Those three, and two on the newest mission, were part of a 2016 experiment that was unable to record data, though it did provide information about the effects of the space environment on the solar cells.\nThe Georgia Tech photovoltaic cells were launched to the ISS on Nov. 2 aboard the S.S. Alan Bean, a Northrop Grumman Cygnus spacecraft from NASA\u2019s Wallops Island Facility, as part of a routine resupply mission. For their testing, the cells were integrated into a test package by Alpha Space Test & Research Alliance of Houston.\nIn addition to those already mentioned, the project also included Canek Fuentes-Hernandez, Matthew Rager, Hunter Chan, Christopher Tran, Christopher Blancher, Zhitao Kang and Conner Awald and Brian Rounsaville, all from Georgia Tech.\nResearch News\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\n177 North Avenue\nAtlanta, Georgia\u00a0 30332-0181\u00a0 USA\nMedia Relations Contact : John Toon (404-894-6986) (jtoon@gatech.edu).\nWriter : John Toon\nAdditional Images\nContact\nJohn Toon\nResearch News\n(404) 894-6986\nEmail\njtoon@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
