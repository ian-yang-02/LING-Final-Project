Anderson Foundation to rename the Center for Business Strategies for Sustainability. To honor this commitment and Ray Anderson\u2019s legacy, the Center will now be known as the Ray C. Anderson Center for Sustainable Business.\nA 1956 Industrial Engineering graduate of Georgia Tech, Anderson was a loyal and devoted supporter of his alma mater for more than five decades. He was awarded an honorary doctorate from the Institute in 2011.\nThe Foundation has committed to distributing $5 million in expendable funding over the next decade, providing a term-of-years naming for the Center. In early 2013, the Foundation committed the initial three-year, $750,000 seed funding that established the Center for Business Strategies for Sustainability.\n\u201cRay Anderson championed the business case for sustainability. His life\u2019s work to pioneer sustainability in global manufacturing is an inspiration for generations to come,\u201d said Georgia Tech President G.P. \u201cBud\u201d Peterson. \u201cGeorgia Tech shares his commitment to sustainability, and we are honored to continue his legacy through this Center that bears his name.\u201d\n\u201cRay\u2019s name on the Center for Sustainable Business represents not just a memory of a man, but institutionalizes his lifelong passion for all things Georgia Tech, most especially the notion that from this day forward, sustainability education and business education will be forever entwined,\u201d said John A. Lanier, executive director of the Foundation. \u201cRay stood for the principle that businesses must learn to live in harmony with society and the environment. For this dream to happen, the business leaders of tomorrow need to learn about this principle today.\u201d\nSince its founding two years ago, the Georgia Tech Center has been active in catalyzing new research and developing course work in business sustainability for students at all levels \u2014 undergraduates, MBAs, doctoral students and executives. To support its mission to use the power of business, technology and innovation to create a sustainable future, it continues to grow relationships with an extensive network of businesses, other academic institutions, non-governmental organizations, industry groups and sustainability experts.\nUnder the leadership of Scheller College of Business Dean Maryam Alavi, and that of Beril Toktay, Center faculty director, and Howard Connell, Center managing director, the new commitment will ensure and expand the Center\u2019s ability to serve as a catalyst and connector, bringing together students, research faculty, entrepreneurs and executives to create an environment where business-driven solutions to sustainability challenges can take shape and thrive.\nThe Center\u2019s progress to date has also been supported by a three-year, $300,000 commitment from the Kendeda Fund received in 2013.\nThe Ray C. Anderson Foundation was created in honor of the late Ray C. Anderson (1934-2011), an honors graduate of Georgia Tech and the founder of Interface, the world\u2019s largest manufacturer of modular carpet, marketed as Interface and FLOR.
