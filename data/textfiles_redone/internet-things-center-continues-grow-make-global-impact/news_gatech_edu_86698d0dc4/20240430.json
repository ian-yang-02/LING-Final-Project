Reviewing the nature of IoT, the study \u00a0quoted Louchez as saying, \u201cOf all the many facets of the Internet of Things as it is understood today, the one single groundbreaking element is not the connectivity\u2026 [but] the smartness of things.\u201d\nAlso announced in January, CDAIT was named one of the best IoT blogs/websites by the\nInternet of More Things . CDAIT was commended for providing \u201cinformative analysis.\u201d\nIn addition to corporate members, CDAIT has reached out to non-for-profit IoT-focused organizations and signed two memoranda of understanding; the first one with the International Telecommunication Union, a specialized agency of the United Nations and its Study Group 20 - Internet of Things (IoT) and its applications including smart cities and communities; and the second with the Centre of Excellence for Internet of Things of India\u2019s National Association of Software and Services Companies.\nFurthermore, CDAIT\u2019s managing director was recently selected by Instituto Tecnol\u00f3gico y de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey (Guadalajara) as an international advisor to \u201cCentro de Innovaci\u00f3n, Desarrollo Tecnol\u00f3gico y Aplicaciones de Internet de las Cosas\u201d (a.k.a. \u201cCenter of Innovation in Internet of Things or CIIoT\u201d) after bid approval by the government of Mexico in June 2016.\nAs CDAIT\u2019s influence grows globally, Louchez has been invited to join the distinguished international panel of judges for the\nIoT Global Network\nAwards 2017.\n\u201cThese are small steps, but they are important steps,\u201d Louchez said. \u201cThese recognitions show that we are having an impact and the world is beginning to take notice. Georgia Tech is a resource for all seeking to innovate in the Internet of Things space, and thanks to the forward-looking and forward-thinking companies and individuals who have joined us, we are having influence on how the Internet of Things will take shape.\u201d\nSo far the CDAIT board members have met four times, with the next meeting scheduled for April. At that meeting, members will receive updates on various IoT-related activities, which are mostly conducted at CDAIT through five working groups that address critical IoT concerns such as education, startup ecosystem, thought leadership, research, and (latest addition) security and privacy.\n\u201cWe\u2019re very pleased with the way we have evolved over time,\u201d Louchez said. \u201cOur members are not only providing financial resources, but they also get directly involved, giving along the way a very much needed connection with industry needs and perspectives. Also central to our work is the effective and remarkable support we are receiving from the many institutes and centers across Georgia Tech that are engaged in IoT-related domains.\u201d\nHoused at the Georgia Institute of Technology in the Georgia Tech Research Institute, CDAIT (pronounced \u201csedate\u201d) is a global, non-profit, partner-funded center located in Atlanta, Georgia, United States, that fosters interdisciplinary research and education while driving general awareness about the Internet of Things.
