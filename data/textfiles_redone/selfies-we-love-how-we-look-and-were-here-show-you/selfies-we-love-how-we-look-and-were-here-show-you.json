After appearances, social selfies with friends, loved ones and pets were the most common (14 percent). Then came ethnicity pics (13 percent), travel (7 percent), and health and fitness (5 percent).\n\u25ba\u00a0 Explore the Top Selfie Trends\nThe researchers noted that the prevalence of ethnicity selfies (selfies about a person\u2019s ethnicity, nationality or country of origin) is an indication that people are proud of their backgrounds. They also found that most selfies are solo pictures, rather than taken with a group.\nThe data was gathered in the summer of 2015. The Georgia Tech team believes the study is the first large-scale empirical research on selfies.\nOverall, an overwhelming 57 percent of selfies on Instagram were posted by the 18-35-year-old crowd, something the researchers say isn\u2019t too surprising considering the demographics of the social media platform. The under-18 age group posted about 30 percent of selfies. The older crowd (35+) shared them far less frequently (13 percent). Appearance was most popular among all age groups.\nLead author Julia Deeb-Swihart says selfies are an identity performance \u2013 meaning that users carefully craft the way they appear online and that selfies are an extension of that. This is similar to William Shakespeare\u2019s famous line: \u201cAll the world\u2019s a stage, and all the men and women merely players.\u201d\n\u201cJust like on other social media channels, people project an identity that promotes their wealth, health and physical attractiveness,\u201d Deeb-Swihart said. \u201cWith selfies, we decide how to present ourselves to the audience, and the audience decides how it perceives you.\u201d\nThis work is grounded in the theory presented by Erving Goffman in\nThe Presentation of Self in Everyday Life.\nThe clothes we choose to wear and the social roles we play are all designed to control the version of ourselves we want our peers to see.\n\u201cSelfies, in a sense, are the blending of our online and offline selves,\u201d Deeb-Swihart said. \u201cIt\u2019s a way to prove what is true in your life, or at least what you want people to believe is true.\u201d\nThe researchers gathered the data by searching for \u201c#selfie,\u201d then used computer vision to confirm that the pictures actually included faces. Nearly half of them didn\u2019t. They found plenty of spam with blank images or text. The accounts were using the hashtag to show up in more searches to gain more followers.\nThe study, \u201cSelfie-Presentation in Everyday Life: A Large-scale Characterization of Selfie Contexts on Instagram,\u201d was presented in May at the\nInternational AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media\nin Montreal.\nFunding and sponsorship was provided by the U.S. Army Research Office (ARO) and Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) under Contract No. W911NF- 12-1-0043.
