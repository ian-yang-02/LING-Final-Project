The electronics are mounted on a stretchable substrate and connected to gold, skin-like electrodes through printed connectors that can stretch with the medical film in which they are embedded.\n\u201cThis health monitor has a key advantage for young children who are always moving, since the soft conformal device can accommodate that activity with a gentle integration onto the skin,\u201d said\nWoon-Hong Yeo , an assistant professor in the\nGeorge W. Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering\nand\nWallace H. Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology . \u201cThis is designed to meet the electronic health monitoring needs of people whose sensitive skin may be harmed by conventional monitors.\u201d\nDetails of the monitor were reported July 24 in the journal\nAdvanced Science . The research was supported by the Imlay Innovation Fund at Children\u2019s Healthcare of Atlanta, NextFlex (Flexible Hybrid Electronics Manufacturing Institute), and by a seed grant from the Institute for Electronics and Nanotechnology at Georgia Tech. The monitor has been studied on both animal models and humans.\nBecause the device conforms to the skin, it avoids signal issues that can be created by the motion of the typical metal-gel electrodes across the skin. The device can even obtain accurate signals from a person who is walking, running or climbing stairs.\n\u201cWhen you put a conventional electrode on the chest, movement from sitting up or walking creates motion artifacts that are challenging to separate from the signals you want to measure,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause our device is soft and conformal, it moves with the skin and provides information that cannot be seen with the motion artifacts of conventional sensors.\u201d\nContinuous evaluation with a wireless health monitor could improve the assessment of children and help clinicians identify trends earlier, potentially facilitating intervention before a condition progresses, said Dr. Kevin Maher, a pediatric cardiologist at\nChildren\u2019s Healthcare of Atlanta .\n\u201cThe generation of continuous data from the respiratory and cardiovascular systems could allow for the application of advanced diagnostics to detect changes in clinical status, response to therapies and implementation of early intervention,\u201d Maher said. \u201cA device to literally follow every breath a child takes could allow for early recognition and intervention prior to a more severe presentation of a disease.\u201d\nUsed in the home, a wearable monitor might detect changes that might not otherwise be apparent, he said. In clinical settings, the wireless device could allow children to feel less \u201ctethered\u201d to equipment. \u201cI see this device as a significant change in pediatric health care and am excited to partner with Georgia Tech on the project,\u201d Maher added.\nThe monitor uses three gold electrodes embedded in the film that also contains the electronic processing equipment. The entire health monitor is just three inches in diameter, and a more advanced version under development will be half that size. The wireless monitor is now powered by a small rechargeable battery, but future versions may replace the battery with an external radio-frequency charging system.\nYeo and his collaborators, including first author and postdoctoral fellow Yun-Soung Kim, are focusing on pediatric applications because of the need for ambulatory monitoring in children. However, they envision that the health monitor could also be used for other patient groups, including older adults who may also have sensitive skin. For adults, there would be additional advantages.\n\u201cThe monitor could be worn for multiple days, perhaps for as long as two weeks,\u201d Yeo said. \u201cThe membrane is waterproof, so an adult could take a shower while wearing it. After use, the electronic components can be recycled.\u201d\nTwo versions of the monitor have been developed. One is based on medical tape and designed for short-term use in a hospital or other care facility, while the other uses a soft elastomer medical film approved for use in wound care. The latter can remain on the skin longer.\n\u201cThe devices are completely dry and do not require a gel to pick up signals from the skin,\u201d Yeo explained. \u201cThere is nothing between the skin and the ultrathin sensor, so it is comfortable to wear.\u201d\nBecause the monitor can be worn for long periods of time, it can provide a long-term record of ECG data helpful to understanding potential heart problems. \u201cWe use deep learning to monitor the signals while comparing them to data from a larger group of patients,\u201d Yeo said. \u201cIf an abnormality is detected, it can be reported wirelessly through a smartphone or other connected device.\u201d\nFabrication of the monitor\u2019s circuitry uses thin-film, mesh-like patterns of copper that can flex with the soft substrate. The chips are the only part not flexible, but they are mounted on the strain-isolated soft substrate instead of a traditional plastic circuit board.\nAs next steps, Yeo plans to reduce the size of the device and add features to measure other health-related parameters such as temperature, blood oxygen and blood pressure. A major milestone would be a clinical trial to evaluate performance against conventional health monitors.\nFor Yeo, who specializes in nano- and micro-engineering, the prospect of seeing the device in clinical trials \u2013 and ultimately used in children\u2019s hospitals \u2013 is a powerful incentive.\n\u201cIt will be a dream come true for me to see something we have developed be helpful to someone who is suffering,\u201d he said. \u201cWe all want to see developments in science and engineering translated into improved patient care.\u201d\nIn addition to those already mentioned, paper coauthors included Robert Herbert, Shinjae Kwon, and Musa Mahmood from Georgia Tech; Yongkuk Lee from Wichita State University; Nam Kyun Kim and Hee Cheol Cho from Emory University; and Donghyun Kim from Yonsei University Wonju College of Medicine in South Korea.\nThis research was supported by a grant from the Imlay Innovation Fund at Children\u2019s Healthcare of Atlanta, NextFlex (Flexible Hybrid Electronics Manufacturing Institute), and the Georgia Tech Institute for Electronics and Nanotechnology, a member of the National Nanotechnology Coordinated Infrastructure, which is supported by the National Science Foundation through award ECCS-1542174.\nCITATION : Yun-Soung Kim, et al., \u201cAll-in-One, Wireless, Stretchable Hybrid Electronics for Smart, Connected, and Ambulatory Physiological Monitoring\u201d (Advanced Science, 2019)\nhttps://doi.org/10.1002/advs.201900939\nResearch News\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\n177 North Avenue\nAtlanta, Georgia 30332-0181\u00a0 USA\nMedia Relations Contact : John Toon (404-894-6986) (jtoon@gatech.edu).\nWriter : John Toon\nAdditional Images\nContact\nJohn Toon\nResearch News\n(404) 894-6986\nEmail\njtoon@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
