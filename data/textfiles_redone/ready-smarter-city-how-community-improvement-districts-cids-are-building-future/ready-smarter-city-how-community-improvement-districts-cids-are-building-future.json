Debra Lam is managing director of Smart Cities and Inclusive Innovation at Georgia Tech. They are\u00a0co-authors of a\u00a0report on CIDs called\u00a0\"Ready for the Smart(er) City: How Community Improvement Districts (CIDs) are Building the Future.\"\nFeb 18, 2021\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nCommunity Improvement Districts, or CIDs, are best known for being mechanisms commercial property owners and local governments use to beautify streetscapes or support infrastructure projects.\nBut a new, comprehensive analysis of their use in Georgia finds CIDs have had significant impact in leveraging dollars and driving growth. The report was produced by the\u00a0 Georgia Institute of Technology\u2019s\u00a0Smart Cities and Inclusive Innovation \u00a0program and its\u00a0 Center for Quality Growth and Regional Development , in partnership with\u00a0 Lexicon Strategies .\u00a0 [Read the full report here:\u00a0 cidreport.com ]\nSince the 1980s CIDs have become a competitive necessity in the growth of commercial centers and submarkets, the report\u2019s authors said.\n\"CIDs are now driving major infrastructure projects and providing community enhancements that are traditionally the purview of local government,\" said Malaika Rivers, a partner at Lexicon Strategies, and a co-author of the report. \u201cBut because CIDs are so effective at attracting additional resources, the commercial real estate owners and investors get more effective ways to manage and deliver projects and services important to their businesses.\"\nThis report, which analyzed CID usage in metro Atlanta, marks the first time they have been evaluated for economic impact and ability to drive innovation. It also establishes\u00a0a framework for comparing CIDs, a previously difficult task due to significant differences across the metro region.\nAmong the report\u2019s key findings:\nBetween 2005 and 2020, the number of CIDs in Georgia doubled to 34, with the most common driver being to attract funding and investment.\nOn average, every $1 spent by a CID generated $5 in outside funding.\nCollectively, CIDs represented more than $16 billion in assessed value in 2019 and about $41 billion in fair market value.\nCIDs are growing; about 89 percent of Georgia\u2019s CIDs report plans to expand project and service offerings.\nThe public sector is playing a larger role in CID formation, accounting for nearly 60 percent of the ones created between 2010 and 2020.\n\u201cOur findings show that Community Improvement Districts are not only crucial for traditional infrastructure, but also to the advancement of smart cities applications on future infrastructure,\u201d said Debra Lam, co-author and director of the Smart Cities and Inclusive Innovation (SCI2) program at Georgia Tech. SCI2\u2019s mission is\u00a0to develop innovative approaches to help build resilient and sustainable communities. It is an offering of the Partnership for Inclusive Innovation, a public-private collaborative effort that launched in 2020 to lead coordinated, statewide efforts to position Georgia as the technology capital of the East Coast.\nWith nearly three dozen CIDs currently in operation in metro Atlanta, Lam said they lay the foundation for a thriving environment that supports a host of CID organizational models\u00a0in a wide variety of commercial product types, from Class-A office to dense industrial centers.\n\u201cCIDs are and will continue to be a driving force in innovation,\u201d Lam said.\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nSmart Cities and Inclusive Innovation (SCI2)\nCenter for Quality Growth and Regional Development\nLexicon Strategies\nCommunity Improvement District (CIDI) Report\nContact\nP\u00e9ralte C.
