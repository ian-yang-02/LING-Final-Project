Vivian to Lead Next Race at Georgia Tech Conversation\nAl Vivian, son of civil rights leader C.T. Vivian, will lead the next Race at Georgia Tech: A Call to Action conversation on Thursday, Jan. 21.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nEmail\nAl Vivian\nJan 19, 2021\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nAl Vivian, a national diversity and inclusion facilitator and son of civil rights leader C.T. Vivian, will lead the next Race at Georgia Tech: A Call to Action conversation on Thursday, Jan. 21. The virtual discussion will be the second in a series of campus discussions on race.\nThe first conversation, \u201c Race at Georgia Tech: A Call to Action ,\u201d took place last July and drew more than 1,000 unique viewers during 90 minutes of virtual, candid discussions with mostly Black students, faculty, and staff panelists who\u00a0discussed their personal experiences with race and ways in which Georgia Tech can expand on its commitment to eradicate overt and implicit racism and develop a more diverse and inclusive campus.\nThe second event will build upon the summer conversation, featuring a keynote from Vivian and a Q&A.\nConversations about race came about after President \u00c1ngel Cabrera and other senior leaders met with numerous Black students, staff, and faculty who shared their personal experiences with racial marginalization.\n\u201cThe Race at Georgia Tech discussion series represents the Institute\u2019s commitment to create a campus environment where issues of race in society can be robustly engaged \u2014 inclusive of diverse perspectives,\u201d said Archie Ervin, vice president for\nInstitute Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion . \u201cOur goal is to create opportunities for more conversations about race and Mr. Vivian is an expert in facilitating these conversations that some find difficult to engage.\u201d\nAl Vivian heads Basic Diversity Inc., a national full-service cultural diversity training and consulting firm best known for its Race Awareness Workshop. His father, a confidant of Martin Luther King Jr., founded the organization more than 45 years ago. The elder Vivian was a member of King\u2019s executive staff and provided civil rights counsel to five U.S. presidential administrations. He received the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2013. He died last year.\nVivian will also host a workshop on race for the Institute\u2019s executive leadership team on Wednesday, Jan. 27.\nTo register for the Jan. 21 Race at Georgia Tech: A Call to Action conversation, visit:\nbit.ly/RaceatGeorgiaTechJan21 .\nAdditional Images\nContact\nCourtney Hill\nCommunications Manager\nInstitute Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion\ncourtney.hill@gatech.edu\nEmail\ncourtney.hill@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
