It was better than Tuesday, when he felt a little wobbly getting around and didn\u2019t have much of an appetite. Blame it all on Monday, when Kimbrough felt gravity for the first time in nearly six months.\nKimbrough is finally back on Earth. The Georgia Tech graduate landed in Kazakhstan early Monday morning to wrap up a 173-day mission in space. As commander of the International Space Station (ISS), he circled the globe 2,768 times and traveled 73.2 million miles.\nOn Wednesday, already back at NASA\u2019s Johnson Space Center in Houston,\nhe spoke to Georgia Tech\nabout the mission that began on October 17.\n\u201cI feel pretty good today, much better than yesterday,\u201d said Kimbrough, who earned his master\u2019s degree in operations research in 1998 from the H. Milton Stewart School of Industrial and Systems Engineering.\u00a0\u201cMy balance is a little off because my inner ear doesn\u2019t know where it is. But I\u2019m much more stable than I was on Tuesday.\u201d\nDuring his stay on board the station, Kimbrough conducted four spacewalks totaling more than 26 hours. He and the crew also welcomed five visiting spacecrafts \u2014 Kimbrough grabbed a few of them with the ISS\u2019s robotic arm.\nAfter nearly six months, you would think he would get some days off work. But the next six weeks are important, as NASA conducts experiments on him to learn more about how his body changed in space and readjusts to Earth. He will also huddle with researchers around the world to discuss the countless experiments he did on the orbiting laboratory. Only then will he get some much-deserved time away from the office with his wife and three children.\n\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to eating things we didn\u2019t have on the station, like fresh fruit and vegetables. And pizza,\u201d Kimbrough said. \u201cI also can\u2019t wait to take a run with my dog.\u201d This was Kimbrough\u2019s second trip to space \u2014 he flew aboard the space shuttle in 2008. Georgia Tech has 14 astronaut graduates, tied for second among public universities.\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nAn interview on the Space Station\nPre-Launch Interview and Story\nInternational Space Station Website\nContact\nJason Maderer\nNational Media Relations\nmaderer@gatech.edu\n404-660-2926\nEmail\nmaderer@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
