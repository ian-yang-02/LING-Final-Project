The analytically minded student with a 4.0 GPA was searching for digraphs and consonant blends that might help him determine the correct answer.\n\u201cP-L is a common combination at the beginning of words,\u201d he explained. That kind of thoughtful gameplay helped Howard sweep every puzzle round, winning nearly $20,000 in cash and two trips \u2014 to Hawaii and South Africa.\n\u201cI knew every time I would spin I had a 15% chance of landing on \u2018lose a turn\u2019 or \u2018bankrupt,\u2019\u201d he said. So if he felt confident in his ability to solve the puzzle, he\u2019d go for it.\nHe auditioned virtually back in January after seeing an advertisement on the game show. It was August when the show\u2019s producers called to let him know he\u2019d be appearing. \u201cMy 13-year-old sister helped quiz me to get ready,\u201d Howard laughed. She found a website with hundreds of old final round puzzles, and she\u2019d write them on a dry erase board to help him hone his skills.\nThat preparation paid off, as Howard was one of just two College Week contestants \u00a0to solve the final puzzle. After the correct guess, Pat Sajak revealed that he had won the grand prize, a new car. The Mini Cooper happened to be painted red and black, to the dismay of many Georgia Tech fans and faithful who tuned in to cheer on the Yellow Jacket. But there\u2019s good news to report.\n\u201cI don\u2019t have to take that specific car,\u201d Howard said. \u201cI can pick whichever color I like.\u201d He confirms that it won\u2019t be red and black.\nAs for his plans for the car, \u201cIt\u2019s probably going to go to my little sister.\u201d He may hold on to it for a while since she\u2019s not old enough to drive, but when she passes her driver\u2019s test, he will hand the keys over to her.\nAnd as for the trips? \u201cMom will go with me on one and Dad on the other,\u201d he confirmed. \\\nHoward plans to use the cash as he finishes his undergraduate degree and looks forward to pursuing a master\u2019s at Tech as well. For now, he\u2019s enjoying the moment and appreciates all the support he\u2019s received online and on campus. The John Lewis Student Center recently hosted a watch party, and that was the first time he had seen the show.\n\u201cIt was tough keeping everything a secret,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we didn\u2019t want to spoil the big moment.\u201d\nHoward\u2019s advice to aspiring\nWheel of Fortune\ncontestants is to approach it like an exam. \u201cFigure out what you can learn about letters and phrases, watch old episodes to see how the game works, and play word games.\u201d\nA few bicep curls might be in order, too. He was caught off-guard by how difficult it was to spin the wheel. \u201cIt\u2019s about 2,400 pounds!\u201d\nAdditional Images\nContact\nSteven Norris\nDirector, Media Relations and Social Media\nGeorgia Tech\nEmail\nsnorris@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
