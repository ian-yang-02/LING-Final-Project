The goal is to develop an interactive system that can convert large amounts of anonymous patient data into real-time insights that health care providers can consult at the point-of-care to inform treatment decisions. Epilepsy, one of the most common diseases of the central nervous system, affects approximately 65 million people worldwide and more than 2 million people in the United States. UCB will contribute its expertise as a leader in epilepsy treatment and access to large sets of epilepsy data. I3L will supply access to an extensive collection of health IT resources as well as collaborators who are experts at connecting critical data to electronic heath records systems.\u00a0 \u201cThe innovative nature of this project reflects UCB and the I3L\u2019s shared goal of delivering more patient-centric health solutions in Georgia and beyond,\u201d said Mark Braunstein, one of the I3L\u2019s founders and associate director of Georgia Tech\u2019s Health Systems Institute. \u201cWe believe that by arming physicians with insights to help them identify the best possible treatment options for people living with epilepsy, we can help drive better patient outcomes and deliver a higher standard of epilepsy care.\u201d This project represents an important next step in UCB\u2019s efforts to harness predictive analytics to raise the standard of epilepsy care. \u201cUCB emphasizes the creation of innovative networks of expert partners, both here in Atlanta and around the world, because we understand that collaboration is a most efficient way to deliver transformative solutions for people living with severe diseases,\u201d said Jeff Wren, president of UCB North America. \u201cBy marrying big data and predictive analytics, we may be able to develop a system that physicians can consult in the clinic to help provide more personalized epilepsy treatment selections.\u201d UCB\u2019s North America Operations are headquartered in Atlanta. The UCB-Georgia Tech collaboration represents I3L\u2019s commitment to work closely with industry to reduce costs while improving patient experiences and the health of populations, said Margaret Wagner Dahl, associate vice president for Health IT at Georgia Tech.\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nInteroperability & Integration Innovation Lab\nContact\nLaura Diamond\u00a0 Georgia Tech Media Relations 404-894-6016\nEmail\nlaura.diamond@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
