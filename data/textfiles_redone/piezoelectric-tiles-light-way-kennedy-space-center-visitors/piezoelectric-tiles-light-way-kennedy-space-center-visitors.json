Ilan Stern, a senior research scientist with the\nGeorgia Tech Research Institute , and colleagues, are collaborating on a $2 million project supported by NASA contractor Delaware North Corporation to build a 40,000-square-foot lighted outdoor footpath demonstrating applications of piezoelectricity for renewable energy.\nA small electrical charge is generated when a piezoelectric material is compressed, flexed, or vibrated. Harnessing this technology at the visitor complex, the researchers are using a thin, ceramic disk of lead zirconate titanate, which has the strongest piezoelectric response of any known material. \u201cJust as a sponge squeezes out water,\u201d said Stern, \u201cthe piezo element under pressure squeezes out electricity that can be harvested and stored.\u201d\nFor this unique project, the researchers designed floor cavities of very thin, ultra-high- performance concrete. To fit into each cavity, the Georgia Tech engineers designed a novel system of custom electronics: circuit boards, six mini solar panels, a battery, LEDs, a Bluetooth transmitter, a Wi-Fi transmitter, micro controllers, and the piezoelectric element\u2014all of which are covered by a loadbearing glass tile top.\nThe tiles operate on three power sources: piezoelectricity, solar panels, and a small rechargeable lithium battery for energy storage and use at night. The self-powered system, when triggered by a human footstep, produces a wireless signal that informs visitors about NASA space missions, piezoelectric technology as well as the STEM cooperation between NASA and Georgia Tech.\n\u201cNo one has made anything like this\u2014an outdoor tile system using a piezoelectric element to trigger customized and off-the-shelf electronics and coupling them for human interactions,\u201d said Stern. \u201cWhen you step on the load-bearing glass tile, it compresses the piezoelectric element, creating an electrical charge that lights up the cavity\u2019s 125 LEDs.\u201d In the entire footpath, about one thousand glass tiles light up in various colors. Each glass tile is a pixel in the pathway\u2019s mosaic imagery of Earth, Mars, the moon, and the International Space Station.\n\u201cThe piezoelectric element also powers a Wi-Fi or Bluetooth signal to visitors\u2019 smartphones, which can play audio, providing information about their geolocation and for potential wayfinding,\u201d said Stern. \u201cThe audio provides information such as how much energy is being generated throughout the park during the day.\u201d\nAlthough a small amount of energy is produced per piezo element, per step, the aggregation of such systems in heavily trafficked areas can produce a significant amount of electricity to be stored for local onsite powering of street signs, lights, and other facilities. \u201cThe piezo element has a very long lifetime, but these are modular systems that could be easily updated over time,\u201d he said. The glass lid can be removed so the piezo element and electronics system can be updated with newer technologies.\u201d\nMany of the site\u2019s engineering applications are based on fundamental research by the lab of Alper Erturk, an associate professor in Georgia Tech\u2019s George W. Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering. Erturk, Stern, and their graduate students, for instance, have utilized a method of vibrating a piezo element\u2019s edge, called plucking, allowing for the coupling of the piezoelectric material\u2019s inherently high resonant frequency, to the low frequency of human scale motion. This has various applications intended for biomechanical energy harvesting.\nIn future smart cities applications, lattices of pressure-sensitive sensors underneath roadways could produce wireless, real-time signals distributing information about roadway conditions, temperature, or traffic. Roadway sensors and autonomous vehicles could share information, and vehicles could communicate with each other through the roadway\u2019s wireless system. Indoor flooring systems powered by piezoelectricity could provide safety monitoring and sensing capabilities without being plugged into to the grid.\n\u201cWe need a more flexible use of the electric grid,\u201d Stern said. \u201cOur goal is to develop more self-powered, self-generating systems with added storage that will give us more choices in energy usage and minimize waste. As much as possible, we should convert wasted mechanical energy\u2014human and vehicle movement\u2014into usable energy generation and storage.\u201d\nResearch News\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\n177 North Avenue\nAtlanta, Georgia\u00a0 30332-0181\u00a0 USA\nMedia Relations Assistance : John Toon (404-894-6986) (jtoon@gatech.edu).\nWriter : John Tibbetts\nAdditional Images\nContact\nJohn Toon\nResearch News\n(404) 894-6986\nEmail\njtoon@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
