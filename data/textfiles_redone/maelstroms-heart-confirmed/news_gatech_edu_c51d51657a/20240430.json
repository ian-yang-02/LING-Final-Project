Until now, it was impossible to visualize and characterize the dynamic processes in the fibrillating heart muscle. This week in\nNature ,\nan international team reports an imaging technique to observe the vortex-like, rotating contractions that underlie life-threatening ventricular fibrillation. The technique may enable early identification of heart rhythm disorders, better understanding of cardiac disease, and development of better treatments.\nLed by\nStefan Luther\nand\nJan Christoph\nof\nthe Max Planck Institute for Dynamics and Self-Organization\n(MPIDS), in Germany, the research team includes\nFlavio Fenton\nand\nIlija Uzelac\nfrom the School of Physics at Georgia Institute of Technology.\nDiagnostic breakthrough\nWhen the heart muscle no longer contracts in a coordinated manner, but simply flutters or twitches \u2013 the condition referred to as \u201cfibrillation\u201d \u2013 it is a highly life-threatening situation. Medical intervention usually involves administering a strong electrical shock within a few minutes. High-energy defibrillation is excruciating and can be damaging to heart tissues.\n\u201cThe key to a better understanding of fibrillation lies in\na new, high-resolution imaging technique\nthat allows processes inside the heart muscle to be observed,\u201d Luther says.\n\u201cUntil now, only surface recordings of complex fibrillation was possible,\u201d Fenton says.\nThe team\u2019s imaging method enables the fibrillating myocardium to be visually time-resolved in three dimensions. The imaging is much more accurate than previously possible and uses clinically available high-resolution ultrasound equipment.\nImproved understanding of fibrillation enabled by the procedure could lead to alternative defibrillation techniques, also an area of research of Fenton\u2019s and Luther\u2019s. For example, researchers could improve the use of low-energy pulses to restore normal heart rhythm.\nThe technique could enable cardiologists to pinpoint the pathological foci of excitation. It may help in diagnosis and treatment of heart failure caused by fibrillation. It may allow doctors to detect heart failure earlier and treat it more effectively.\nElectrical waves cause mechanical contractions of the heart\nEvery heartbeat is triggered by electrical waves of excitation that propagate through the myocardium at high speed, causing myocardial cells to contract. If these waves become turbulent, the result is cardiac arrhythmia.\nIn cardiac arrhythmias, rotational electrical waves of excitation swirl through the heart muscle. Investigations of cardiac arrhythmias have focused on such electrical vortices, but researchers have not been able to obtain a full picture of the dynamics.\nThe international team took a different approach. Instead of concentrating on electrical stimulation, they looked at the twitching contractions of the fibrillating myocardium. \u201cUntil now, little importance was attached to the analysis of muscle contractions and deformations during fibrillation,\u201d Christoph says. \u201cIn our measurements, however, we saw that electric vortices are always accompanied by corresponding vortex-shaped mechanical deformations.\u201d\nVentricular fibrillation in 3D\nUsing high-resolution measurements carried out with clinically available ultrasound equipment, the researchers visualized the trembling movements inside the heart muscle in three dimensions and correlated them with the electrical excitation of the heart.\nBy analyzing the image data of the muscle contractions, the researchers were able to observe exactly how areas of contracted and relaxed muscle cells move in a vortex through the myocardium during fibrillation.\nThey also observed filament-like structures that were previously known to physicists only in theory and from computer simulations. Such a filament-like structure resembles a thread and marks the eye of the whirlpool-like wave or cyclone moving through the myocardium. It is now possible for the first time to pinpoint these centers of the vortices inside the myocardium.\nThe researchers also used high-speed cameras and fluorescent markers to reveal the electrophysiological processes in the myocardium. The images confirmed that the mechanical vortices correspond very well with the electrical vortices. \u201cIn this study the correlation between electrical and mechanical vortex dynamics is assessed for the first time using a trimodal system that measures simultaneously and correlates the voltage and calcium waves with the contraction waves\u201d Uzelac says.\nFrom physics to medicine\nThe study is an example of successful interdisciplinary collaboration between physicists and doctors. \"This revolutionary development will open up new treatment options for patients with cardiac arrhythmias,\u201d says Gerd Hasenfuss, co-author of the study and chairman of the G\u00f6ttingen Heart Research Center\u00a0and the\nHeart Center at the University Medical Center G\u00f6ttingen . \u201cAs early as 2018, we will use the new technology on our patients to better diagnose and treat cardiac arrhythmias and myocardial diseases.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nContact\nA.
