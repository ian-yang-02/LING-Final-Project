Their approach dramatically reduces the cost and energy required for these direct air capture (DAC) systems, helping improve the economics of a process the researchers said will be critical to addressing climate change. The key is a new kind of catalyst and electrochemical reactor design that can be easily integrated into existing DAC systems to produce useful carbon monoxide (CO) gas. It\u2019s one of the most efficient such design ever described in scientific literature, according to lead researcher\nMarta Hatzell\nand her team.\nThey published details April 16 in\nEnergy and Environmental Science , a top journal for energy-related research.
