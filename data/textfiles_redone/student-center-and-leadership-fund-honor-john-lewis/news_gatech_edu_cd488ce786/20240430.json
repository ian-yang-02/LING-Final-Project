Gifts to the fund will be directed to a permanent endowment.\n\u201cThe John Lewis Student Center is the heart of student life on campus, a place where students grow as leaders who are ready to make a difference,\u201d said President \u00c1ngel Cabrera. \u201cI can\u2019t think of a better name to inspire future generations of Georgia Tech student leaders than the man who, as a student leader himself, led our nation in its journey toward justice and civil rights.\u201d\nAs a college student, Lewis chaired the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee from1963 to 1966 and was heavily involved in the civil rights movement. He lived his personal motto of engaging in \u201cgood trouble\u201d to ensure that current and future generations would have the freedom and opportunities that previous generations of Black Americans were denied.\n\u201cThe John Lewis Student Leadership Endowment Fund will allow us to offer a comprehensive array of meaningful learning and development opportunities for all Georgia Tech students \u2014 whether it\u2019s a first-time college student or a final-year doctoral student,\u201d said Luoluo Hong, vice president for Student Engagement and Well-Being. \u201cStudents will be able to choose from many options, each designed to build and enhance the capacity of our Yellow Jackets to be values-driven, courageous agents for change in the spirit of John Lewis\u2019 own legacy.\u201d\nGeorgia Tech will honor the legacy of U.S. Representative John Lewis by dedicating the newly completed John Lewis Student Center during a ceremony on Thursday, Sept. 29. The campus sits in Georgia\u2019s Fifth Congressional District and was represented by Lewis from 1986 until his death in 2020. The Board of Regents approved the renaming of the building in 2021.\nThe Center provides essential support services to students, in recognition of Lewis\u2019 unwavering support of the Institute and its students. It\nbrings together\nseveral student programs and resources into one physical space, including numerous dining venues, student organization community spaces,\nGraduate Student Lounge ,\nMulticultural Lounge ,\nReflection Space , the\nCenter for Student Engagement , Student Media, and the Student Center Programs Council. In addition, the offices of the Undergraduate and Graduate Student Government Associations are in the Center.\nThe dedication and celebration will be held in the third floor auditorium of the John Lewis Student Center (350 Ferst Drive NW), beginning at 10 a.m., Sept. 29. Following a formal ceremony, the campus community is invited to enjoy food and tours.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nVictor Rogers\nInstitute Communications\nEmail\nvictor.rogers@comm.gatech.edu\nAdditional information\nJohn Lewis Student Center Dedication\nThursday, Sept. 29\n10 a.m. \u2013 3 p.m.\nMore Information\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
