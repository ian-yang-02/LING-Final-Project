The changes also give managers and instructors the discretion to assess individual situations rather than using a one-size-fits-all approach, while minimizing interruptions to Institute operations.\nModified Campus Operations\nWhen modified campus operations are in effect, departments will continue offering essential services on site and virtually. Department leaders will identify the employees needed and communicate expectations accordingly.\nStaff who are not required to be on campus and cannot perform their work virtually will see no change under the proposed updates to the policy.\nDigital Learning Days\nWhen on-campus activities are suspended, digital learning days will provide a way for instruction to continue. Instructors will be given discretion on the scheduling of digital instruction and should communicate updates and expectations to their students.\nIf an exam falls on a digital learning day, it is best practice to administer the exam during the next in-person class meeting. If the planned exam and digital learning day happen to fall on the last day before a holiday or reading day, the exam should be administered digitally. If a long-term interruption of more than three days occurs, the Office of the Provost reserves the right to determine the need for makeup classes.\nNotification of Campus During Modified Campus Operations and Digital Learning Days\nIn the event of hazardous weather, students, faculty, and staff can find out about campus closures and Tech\u2019s response in several ways:\nAll announcements, including specific changes to campus services such as transportation or dining, will be shared on the\nGeorgia Tech homepage .\nIn the event of modified campus operations, an alert will be sent via the\nGeorgia Tech Emergency Notification System (GTENS) . Notifications will also be announced through Georgia Tech\u2019s primary social media accounts.\nStaff can expect to be notified directly by their supervisor of their role during modified campus operations and digital learning day implementation.\nStudents will receive communication from their instructors regarding digital instruction schedules and makeup classes or exams.\nRelated links\nCampus Procedures for Emergency Weather\nPolicy:\nModified Operations During Emergencies and Campus Interruptions\nPolicy: Digital Learning Days for Modified Campus Operations\nFAQ for Modified Campus Operations and Digital Learning Days Policies\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
