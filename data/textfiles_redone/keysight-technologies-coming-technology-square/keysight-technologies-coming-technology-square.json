We believe that the education, inquisitiveness and enthusiasm of this new team, under Keysight leadership, will incubate ideas and solutions that will fuel a wide range of next generation technology innovations.\u201d The company, a byproduct of Agilent Technologies, is headquartered in Santa Rosa, Calif., with major U.S. sites in California and Colorado, as well as other locations around the world. Keysight will be looking to hire software engineers and managers in Atlanta. \"I am excited that Keysight Technologies will be one of the first companies to call the high-performance computing center at Georgia Tech home. This is another victory for the City and Invest Atlanta in attracting more companies and establishing Atlanta as one of the fastest growing innovation centers in the United States,\u201d said Mayor Kasim Reed. \u201cOver the past several years, Midtown has been a growing epicenter of innovation for not only Atlanta, but for the entire Southeastern region, and we are confident that trend will only continue.\" Keysight has had a long-standing relationship with the Georgia Institute of Technology.
