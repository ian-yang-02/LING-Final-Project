Williams wanted to find a way to bring the training to more people.\nHe teamed up with two friends, and together the three Georgia Tech students invented a device that walks a person through all the steps to perform CPR.\n\u201cYou can pick up the device, turn it on and immediately begin the latest standard of care,\u201d said Williams, a computer engineering major.\nThe device, called CPR+, is a CPR mask with LED lights that offers user feedback throughout the resuscitation process. Turn it on and a voice tells you to call 911. Then it directs you to put the mask around someone\u2019s face. It instructs you how to attach its sensor that automatically measures heartrate. Then, if needed, it directs you to deliver rescue breaths. If you do it right, the lights turn green. Do it wrong and the lights turn red. Next, it will tell you to begin chest compressions and will count along at the correct pace.\nThe invention is one of six competing for Georgia Tech\u2019s 2017 InVenture Prize. The annual contest encourages and supports interest in innovation and entrepreneurship by rewarding students with cash prizes for inventions that have the potential to solve the world\u2019s problems. The finale takes place Wednesday night at the Ferst Center for the Arts.\nWhile there are apps that can walk someone through the CPR steps, they are unable to measure a victim\u2019s heart rate and breath rate, said Dave Ehrlich, a computer engineering major from Portland, Ore.\nCPR+ makes it possible for \u201canyone, anywhere at any time to perform life-saving techniques,\u201d Ehrlich said. \u201cThis device doesn\u2019t exist anywhere else.\u201d\nThe team built much of the device in the GVU Prototyping Lab. They are currently on the third iteration of CPR+ and may finish a fourth before the finale.\nThey\u2019re used to working together and with others on team projects through their classes at Georgia Tech, said Samuel Clarke, a mechanical engineering and computer science major from Indianapolis.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had to put the best of what we\u2019ve learned into play,\u201d Clarke said. \u201cThere are times when it was hard and I didn\u2019t think we\u2019d get it done, but we had to rise above the pressure and put it all together.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nGeorgia Tech's InVenture Prize\nContact\nLaura Diamond\nMedia Relations\n404-894-6016\n@LauraRDiamond\nEmail\nlaura.diamond@gatech.edu\nAdditional information\nThe winning InVenture Prize team will take home $20,000 and represent Georgia Tech in the annual ACC InVenture Prize, taking place on campus on March 31.\nThe second-place team earns $10,000.\nBoth first- and second-place finishers will receive free U.S. patent filings by Georgia Tech\u2019s Office of Technology Licensing.\nA $5,000 People\u2019s Choice Award will go to the fans\u2019 favorite invention.
