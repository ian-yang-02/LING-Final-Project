Owerkowicz)\nFeb 15, 2021\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nMammals and cold-blooded alligators share a common four-chamber heart structure \u2013 unique among reptiles \u2013 but that\u2019s where the similarities end. Unlike humans and other mammals, whose hearts can fibrillate under stress, alligators have built-in antiarrhythmic protection. The findings from new research were reported Jan. 27 in the journal Integrative\nOrganismal Biology .\n\u201cAlligator hearts don\u2019t fibrillate \u2013 no matter what we do. They\u2019re very resilient,\u201d said\nFlavio Fenton , a professor in the\nSchool of Physics\nat the Georgia Institute of Technology, researcher in the Petit Institute for Bioengineering and Bioscience, and the report\u2019s corresponding author. Fibrillation is one of the most dangerous arrhythmias, leading to blood clots and stroke when occurring in the atria and to death within minutes when it happens in the ventricles.\nThe study looked at the action potential wavelengths of rabbit and young alligator hearts. Both species have four-chambered hearts of similar size (about\u00a0 3 cm); however, while rabbits maintain a constant heart temperature of 38 degrees Celsius, the body temperature of active, wild alligators ranges from 10 to 37 degrees Celsius. Heart pumping is controlled by an electrical wave that tells the muscle cells to contract. An electrical signal drives this wave, which must occur in the same pattern to keep blood pumping normally. In a deadly arrhythmia, this electrical signal is no longer coherent.\n\u201cAn arrhythmia can happen for many reasons, including temperature dropping. For example, if someone falls into cold water and gets hypothermia, very often this person will develop an arrythmia and then drown,\u201d Fenton said.\nDuring the study, the researchers recorded changes in the heart wave patterns at 38 C and 23 C. \u201cThe excitation wave in the rabbit heart reduced by more than half during temperature extremes while the alligator heart showed changes of only about 10% at most,\u201d said Conner Herndon, a co-author and a graduate research assistant in the School of Physics. \u201cWe found that when the spatial wavelength reaches the size of the heart, the rabbit can undergo spontaneous fibrillation, but the alligator would always maintain this wavelength within a safe regime,\u201d he added.\nWhile alligators can function over a large temperature range without risk of heart trauma, their built-in safeguard has a drawback: it limits their maximum heart rate, making them unable to expend extra energy in an emergency. Rabbits and other warm-blooded mammals, on the other hand, can accommodate higher heart rates necessary to sustain an active, endothermic metabolism but they face increased risk of cardiac arrhythmia and critical vulnerability to temperature changes.\nThe physicists from Georgia Tech collaborated with two biologists on the study, including former Georgia Tech postdoctoral fellow Henry Astley, now assistant professor in the Biomimicry Research and Innovation Center at the University of Akron\u2019s Department of Biology.\n\u201cI was a little surprised by how massive the difference was \u2013 the sheer resilience of the crocodilian heart and the fragility of the rabbit heart. I had not expected the rabbit heart to come apart at the seams as easily as it did,\u201d noted Astley.\nLower temperatures are one cause of cardiac electrophysiological arrhythmias, where fast-rotating electrical waves can cause the heart to beat faster and faster, leading to compromised cardiac function and potentially sudden cardiac death. Lowering\u00a0 the temperature of the body \u2013 frequently done for patients before certain surgeries \u2013 also can induce an arrhythmia.\nThe researchers agree that this study could help better understand how the heart works and what can cause a deadly arrhythmia \u2013 which fundamentally happens when the heart doesn\u2019t pump blood correctly any longer.\nThe authors also consider the research a promising step toward better understanding of heart electrophysiology and how to help minimize fibrillation risk. Until December 2020, when Covid-19 took the top spot, heart disease was the leading cause of death in the United States and in most industrialized countries, with more people dying of heart disease than the next two causes of death combined.\nAstley said the research provides a deeper understanding of the natural world and insight into the different coping mechanisms of cold- and warm-blooded animals.\nCo-author Tomasz Owerkowicz, associate\u00a0 professor in the Department of Biology at California State University, San Bernardino, considers the findings \u201canother piece of the puzzle that helps us realize how really cool non-human animals are and how many different tricks they have up their sleeves.\u201d\nHe expressed hope that more researchers will follow their example and use a non-traditional animal model in future research.\n\u201cEveryone studies mammals, fruit flies, and zebrafish. There's such a huge wealth of resources among the wild animals that have not been brought to the laboratory setting that have such neat physiologies, that are waiting to be uncovered. All we have to do is look,\u201d he said.\nCITATION : C.
