Clinics will take place at McCamish Pavilion Aug. 16-20, Aug. 23-25, and Aug. 27, from 9 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. Clinics will also take place Tuesday, Aug. 31, at Stamps Health Services, as well as Sept. 7-10 and Sept. 13-17, from 9 a.m. to 3:30 p.m., at Stamps Health Services. Book a vaccination appointment at\nmytest.gatech.edu .\nVaccines are highly effective at preventing severe illness from Covid-19. If you are unvaccinated and are exposed to someone with Covid-19, you will be subject to quarantine per current Georgia Department of Public Health guidelines.\nTo date , Georgia Tech has administered more than 32,000 doses to more than 17,000 individuals.\nTesting\nAsymptomatic surveillance testing will also continue to be offered during the fall semester for all students, faculty, and staff. For those new to campus or who did not participate previously, this saliva-based testing program takes just a few minutes per test and is available at multiple sites on campus. Georgia Tech faculty who are top researchers in their field created this simple, effective testing program to reduce transmission of Covid-19 in the campus community. The program has been an essential tool in keeping cases down throughout the past year. Everyone on campus, regardless of vaccination status, is invited and encouraged to test weekly.\nLearn more about how it works\nand\nfind a testing site today .\nNo reservations are necessary \u2014 simply visit\nmytest.gatech.edu\non your smartphone when you arrive at the test site. Results are delivered via email. Make weekly testing part of your routine \u2014 pick a day and time, and even go with a friend. (If you experience Covid-19 symptoms,\nseek symptomatic testing instead .) Regular testing can help identify potential clusters before they become outbreaks.\nFacial Coverings\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently issued\nnew interim guidance\nrecommending the use of masks inside public buildings, even by fully vaccinated individual, as a precaution given the broad circulation of the highly contagious delta variant of the virus.\nAt Georgia Tech, everyone is encouraged to wear a mask or face covering while inside campus facilities. Vaccines and masks are highly effective at stopping the spread of Covid-19.\nPPE\nSimilar to recent semesters, Infrastructure and Sustainability has supplied Housing with personal protective equipment (PPE) kits to distribute to students living on campus this fall. Each student will get a box of tissues and a kit containing a cloth face covering, hand sanitizer, and stickers. Additional PPE requests for students, faculty, or staff can be made\nthrough this online form .\nVentilation\nTeams in Infrastructure and Sustainability have been hard at work since the beginning of the pandemic to help ensure a safe and healthy environment for the campus community. We know that\ngood ventilation and air circulation\ncan significantly reduce the risk of transmission in indoor settings. Facilities Management has upgraded air filters across campus to MERV-13 filters and is ensuring that all systems are operating optimally. As an added precaution, outside air ventilation rates have been increased where possible, and ultraviolet lights have been incorporated in air handling units across campus. An expert team of Georgia Tech faculty and students\ncontinue to monitor data\ncaptured from air quality sensors, which have been installed in various classrooms across campus.\nCleaning and Disinfecting\nHand sanitizer stands are stationed at every building entrance as well as in restrooms and classrooms. Disinfectant and wipes will continue to be made available in classrooms and for workspaces. Custodial Services also continues to clean and disinfect classrooms, common areas, and restrooms daily. However, heavily used restrooms located in buildings that operate 24 hours a day (such as Clough Undergraduate Learning Commons) will continue to be cleaned and disinfected four times a day.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nKristen Bailey\nInstitute Communications\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
