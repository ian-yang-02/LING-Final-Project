PSY 1993, Ph.D. PSY 1995).\u00a0Her research focuses on the power of positive psychology to achieve greater success and well-being. For the last few years, she has been sharing her expertise on positivity with Tech students as a guest presenter in a five-week course called \"Resilience Building Strategies: Growing Through What We Are Going Through.\"\u00a0It\u00a0was developed in 2019 by Sonia Alvarez-Robinson, executive director of Georgia Tech Strategic Consulting, and Joi Alexander, director of Health Initiatives.\n\u201cSocial support is the number one factor for well-being,\" Cabrera said. \"We need people. It\u2019s an evolutionary thing, because back in the caveman days, if you didn\u2019t have your tribe to help keep you safe, you died. You could not survive alone.\u201d\nToday, because of physical distancing in work and social environments brought about by the pandemic, many people are less connected to others.\n\u201cSome people feel like they\u2019re connected because they\u2019re using social media, but that\u2019s not the same kind of connection,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are less connected to our communities. We aren\u2019t as involved in our churches or different associations. During the pandemic it was important to have physical distance, but not social distance.\u201d\nCabrera said that having a positive outlook and experiencing happiness are also important to well-being. But she said that \u201cbeing happy\u201d should not be the goal.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a difference between doing things that allow you to experience positive emotions and having the goal of being happy,\u201d she said. \u201cBeing happy all the time is never going to happen, so if you set a goal to be happy, then you\u2019re always going to fall short.\u201d\nInstead, Cabrera suggests participating in activities that make you happy. That could be anything from reading to exercising to hanging out with friends. The result will be a feeling of happiness that can be repeated as needed.\nPositive psychology does not mean you deny your negative feelings.\u00a0\u201cPositive psychology first and foremost recognizes that we are human and that humans are going to experience a wide range of emotions,\" she said. \"It\u2019s very important to accept all of your emotions, the good and the bad.\u00a0We know that if you try to ignore or suppress any of those negative emotions, they just get stronger.\u201d\nCabrera is encouraged to see that society is more attuned to mental health issues than ever before.\n\u201cI started talking to companies in 2004 about employee well-being, telling them that it actually is linked to performance. Happy employees will be smarter, more creative, and they will work together better,\u201d she said. \u201cToday there is a heightened awareness of the importance of mental health and the need to help people address these issues.\u201d\nAlvarez-Robinson said, \u201cHaving Dr. Cabrera come and speak to our class has been a highlight of the students\u2019 experience since we started the class in 2019. We recognized that our students needed additional skills for navigating change, challenges, and uncertainty.\u00a0We proposed it as part of the mini-mester pilot program and the first cohort launched in Spring 2020.\u201d\nThe one-credit course will be offered again in the fall and is listed as\u00a0 Resilience Building Strategies 4801/8801 \u00a0(cross-listed for undergraduate and graduate students).\nA recording of Cabrera\u2019s most recent workshop, along with other related sessions, is available on the Georgia Tech\nResilience ERG website .\nAdditional Images\nContact\nVictor Rogers\nInstitute Communications\nEmail\nvictor.rogers@comm.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
