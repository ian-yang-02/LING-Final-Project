In celebration of Black History Month, we\u2019ve rounded up some of the speakers from recent campus events.\nNikole Hannah-Jones\nOn Jan. 14, the 10th Annual MLK Lecture was delivered by keynote speaker Nikole Hannah-Jones, acclaimed investigative journalist. Hannah-Jones spearheaded\nThe New York Times\n1619 Project , for which her introductory essay won her a 2020 Pulitzer Prize for Commentary. The 1619 Project shares work from Black creatives and acts as a portal to the past, present, and future with Black history at the forefront. During the lecture, Hannah-Jones highlighted the ways American history has erased Black history and the importance of reclaiming that past. She also highlighted how Black history has shaped the current American landscape, arguing that through writing and storytelling it will not be erased for future generations.\nRead a full recap of the event\nFrank Brown\nOn Jan. 16, the Engage Symposium showcased a variety of speakers whose work aims to\u00a0enhance the communities they live in.

This personal mantra has taken him on a journey of waking up at 4 a.m. and even starting a coffee shop during a pandemic. The key takeaway was why problems can feel more bearable with the mindset, in Onwuchekwa\u2019s words, that \u201cthe state of my soul is not going to be affected by the circumstances I find myself in.\u201d\nView the full lecture\nAl Vivian\nThe Georgia Tech: A Call to Action lecture series emerged from the Black Lives Matter protests last summer and hosts discussions with faculty members about the Black experience at Tech.
