That is more than twice the amount of carbon currently found in the atmosphere as carbon dioxide, but until now most of it has been locked up in the very cold soil. The new study, which relied on metagenomics to analyze changes in the microbial communities being experimentally warmed, could heighten concerns about how the release of this carbon may exacerbate climate change.\n\u201cWe saw that microbial communities respond quite rapidly \u2013 within four or five years \u2013 to even modest levels of warming,\u201d said\nKostas T. Konstantinidis , the paper\u2019s corresponding author and a professor in the\nSchool of Civil and Environmental Engineering\nand the\nSchool of Biological Sciences\nat the Georgia Institute of Technology, where he also is a researcher in the Petit Institute for Bioengineering and Bioscience. \u201cMicrobial species and their genes involved in carbon dioxide and methane release increased their abundance in response to the warming treatment. We were surprised to see such a response to even mild warming.\u201d\nThe new study was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy and the National Science Foundation, and reported July 8 in the early edition of the journal\nProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\nResearchers from the University of Oklahoma, Michigan State University and Northern Arizona University collaborated with Georgia Tech on the study.\nThe study provides quantitative information about how rapidly microbial communities responded to the warming at critical depths, and highlights the dominant microbial metabolisms and groups of organisms that are responding to warming in the tundra. The work underscores the importance of accurately representing the role of soil microbes in climate models.\nThe research began in September 2008 at a moist, acidic tundra area in the interior of Alaska near Denali National Park. Six experimental blocks were created, and in each block, two snow fences were constructed about five meters apart in the winter to control snow cover. Thicker snow cover in the winter served as an insulator, creating slightly elevated temperatures \u2013 about 1.1 degrees Celsius (2 degrees Fahrenheit) in the experimental plots.\nOther than the temperature difference, the soil conditions were similar in the experimental and control plots. Soil cores were taken from the experimental and control plots at two different depths at two different times: 1.5 years after the experiment began, and 4.5 years after the start. Microbial DNA was extracted from the cores and sequenced using the Genomics Core at Georgia Tech.\n\u201cOur analysis of the resulting data showed which species were there, in what abundances, which species responded to warming and by how much \u2013 and what functions they possessed related to carbon use and release,\u201d said Eric R. Johnston, now a postdoctoral researcher at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, who conducted the study\u2019s analysis as a Georgia Tech Ph.D. student.\nCores from the experimental and control plots were compared to assess the effects of the warming. Cumulative ecosystem respiration was also sampled during the month following removal of the cores.\n\u201cThe response we observed differed markedly between the two soil depths (15 to 25 centimeters and 45 to 55 centimeters) that were sampled for this study,\u201d said Johnston. \u201cSpecifically, at the upper boundary of the initial permafrost boundary layer \u2013 45 to 55 centimeters below the surface \u2013 the relative abundance of genes involved in methane production (methanogenesis) increased with warming, while genes involved in organic carbon respiration \u2014 the release of carbon dioxide \u2014 became more abundant at shallower depths.\u201d\nMeasurement of the community respiration showed increases in the rate of carbon dioxide and methane release in the plots that were warmed. \u201cSimilar measurements have also shown that these gases are being released at a greater rate throughout the entire region in recent years as a result of climate warming,\u201d Johnston added.\nThe two soil depths correspond to an active layer near the surface that freezes during the winter but thaws during warmer months, exposing the carbon. The deeper measurements examined soil just above the permafrost that thaws for only a brief time each year. These variations create fundamental differences in the biology and chemistry at the two depths.\n\u201cWe expected to observe warming responses that differed between the two sampling depths,\u201d Johnston said. \u201cOngoing thaw of permafrost soil is being observed on the global scale, so we were particularly interested in evaluating microbiological responses to thawing permafrost.\u201d\nThe research highlights the importance of microbial communities in contributing atmospheric methane and carbon dioxide to climate change, Konstantinidis said.\n\u201cBecause of the very large amount of carbon in these systems, as well as the rapid and clear response to warming found in this experiment and other studies, it is becoming increasingly clear that soil microbes \u2013 particularly those in the northern latitudes \u2013 and their activities need to be represented in climate models,\u201d he said. \u201cOur work provides markers \u2013 species and genes \u2013 that can be used in this direction.\u201d\nIn addition to those already mentioned, the paper\u2019s authors included Janet K.
