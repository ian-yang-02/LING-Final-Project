And although Tech is not known as being home to numerous ghouls or goblins, a few speculative spirits have been encountered over time.\nDramatic Disturbances\nDramaTech Theater originally occupied an old church on Hemphill Avenue in the 1940s. The theater company leased the space from the Hemphill Avenue Church of God, which had relocated to a new facility following a fire. During the fire, some children were trapped on the second floor and died, causing the church to want to relocate, but the building was able to be repaired and reoccupied. It has been recounted by students who were part of DramaTech at that time that, late at night, when alone, you could hear laughter, talking, and the sounds of moving chairs coming from the second floor. The building has since been torn down.\nPresidential Poltergeists\nSome students have claimed run-ins with the ghost of Lyman Hall in and around his namesake building. Tech\u2019s second president became ill during his tenure, took a leave of absence, and died in 1905. He is said to maintain a presence to ensure students are behaving and studying appropriately.\nAnimal Spirits\nThough they have not generated any post-death sightings, two animal spirits buried on campus are very much a part of Tech lore.\u00a0Sideways, Tech\u2019s most famous mutt, is buried on the west side of Tech Tower. His grave is known as a place where students throw spare change for good luck. Tech has a second canine friend, Socrates, who is buried on the lawn of the Van Leer Building. Socrates belonged to Daniel Fielder, a two-time Tech alumnus and professor in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, and was buried in 1981.\nOne to Rule Them All\nPerhaps Tech\u2019s most pervasive spirit is George P. Burdell, who first enrolled at Georgia Tech in 1927 and has since made his presence felt in classrooms, at sporting events, and anywhere he encounters Tech students and alumni around the world. If you\u2019re ever in public and unsure if Burdell is around, simply ask to have him paged.\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nGeorgia Tech Living History Program\nGeorgia Tech Library Archives\nContact\nKristen Bailey\nInstitute Communications\nAdditional information\nLearn more about Tech's vivid history from the Living History program.\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
