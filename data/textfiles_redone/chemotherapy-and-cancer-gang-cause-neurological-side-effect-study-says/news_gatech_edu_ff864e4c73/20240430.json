Cancer itself contributes heavily, too, and the stresses on neurons appear far worse than the sum of the two causes.\n\u201cThere was some distress caused by cancer alone and some distress from chemo alone, but when you put the two things together, it was off the charts, seven times the trauma to neurons of the two things added together,\u201d said Nick Housley, first author of the study performed in rats at the Georgia Institute of Technology. \u201cIt turned out to be the first-ever evidence that there is this exacerbation going on.\u201d\nEvery year in the U.S., there are 1.8 million new cancer diagnoses, and about half of patients receive platinum-based drugs, which are very effective. About 40 percent of patients receiving platinum chemotherapy come down with neuropathy, suffering strange sensations, pain, fatigue, or loss of muscle coordination that impedes day-to-day life. Neuropathy can persist for years after chemotherapy ends.\nHope for treatment\nThe new study also challenges established medical explanations that neuropathy is caused by structural damage to nerves alone and that it is untreatable.\n\u201cThe idea of damage has been the standard explanation \u2013 that these neurons are dying back and that they are retracting. And we have found time and time again zero evidence of this in the neurons we studied here,\u201d Housley said.\n\u201cThe evidence does not support physical damage as the basis for the disabilities we observe. We find functional problems that might be fixable,\u201d said Tim Cope, one of two principal investigators of the study. Functional problems usually refer to neurons not firing properly versus actual tears or shrinkage in neurons.\nCope is\u00a0 a professor in Georgia Tech\u2019s School of Biological Sciences \u00a0and in the Wallace H. Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering at Georgia Tech and Emory University. Housley is a postdoctoral researcher in his lab.\nThe researchers published their results\u00a0 in the journal\u00a0 Cancer Research \u00a0on April 28, 2020 . The research was funded by the National Institutes of Health\u2019s National Cancer Institute. John McDonald, the other principal investigator, is a professor in Georgia Tech\u2019s School of Biological Sciences and the\u00a0 director of Georgia Tech\u2019s Integrative Cancer Research Center .\nGene expression surprises\nTo explore neuropathy\u2019s causes, the researchers cast a broad net. They examined gene expression in neurons,\u00a0 protein expression , and neuron signaling, and they measured body movements, which became\u00a0markedly uncoordinated.\nGene dysregulation went into overdrive in reaction to chemo and cancer, including boosting inflammatory responses while suppressing some of neurons\u2019 protective mechanisms. But despite the plethora of\u00a0 gene regulation \u00a0red flags, there were also surprising signs of intact neuron health.\n\u201cMany things the neuron relies on to live and function were unscathed on the gene expression level. That\u2019s potentially good news for patients and for fixing neuropathy because it means there may be just one thing or a few things to fix to restore normal functioning,\u201d Cope said. \u201cThe downregulation of just a few genes may be responsible for the problems we\u2019ve seen.\u201d\nIon channel mystery\nClues from one downregulated gene took a twist that led to a new scientific discovery in neuronal biology before arriving at what appeared to be a pathology.\nThe downregulated gene is responsible for creating protein structures called ion channels that appear in a neuron\u2019s cell wall and\u00a0 enable the neuron to fire electrical impulses , i.e. action potentials. Ion channels abruptly shuttle potassium ions (K+) and sodium ions (Na+) in and out of cells, flipping the net negative and net positive charges on either side of cell walls, which creates the action potentials.\nThis particular downregulated gene was for a potassium ion channel called\u00a0 Kv3.3 , which was not previously known to exist in\u00a0muscle spindles \u2013 neural receptors embedded in muscles to sense when they are contracting or stretching. The researchers found the channel to be prolific there.\n\u201cThat was a discovery in its own right in basic neuroscience. Finding its involvement in this sensory-motor problem was also profound,\u201d Housley said.\nMost Kv3.3 expression disappeared under the combination of chemo and cancer. More research is needed to establish whether the lack of Kv3.3 is indeed an important contributor to neuropathy, but in this study, it strongly correlated with observed neural pathology.\n\u201cDespite the neurons still having the ability to fire action potentials, the process of neurons encoding information was really corrupted,\u201d Housley said.\nAlso read:\u00a0 App Detects Harsh Side Effect of Breast Cancer Treatment\nThe following researchers from Georgia Tech coauthored the study: Paul Nardelli, Dario Carrasco, Travis Rotterman, Emily Pfahl, and Lilya Matyunina.
