The T cell secretes the enzyme granzyme B, here in gray, which attacks the organ cell. But granzyme B also severs fluorescent signal molecules, in green, from the rejection detecting nanoparticle, in light pink. The signal molecules make their way into the urine, where they give off a fluorescent cue.

A new screening method using sensor particles and a urine test could catch rejection much earlier, more comprehensively, and without a biopsy needle.\nWhen the body\u2019s immune system has just begun attacking cells of a transplanted organ, the new method\u2019s particles send a fluorescent signal into the urine. In a\u00a0 new study , researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology and Emory University validated the method in a mouse model, and they have engineered the sensor with highly biocompatible components, which could make the path to potential future trials easier.\nA patient may feel fine, and a biopsy may look deceptively clean when T cells have already begun attacking a transplanted organ. The sensor particle, a\u00a0 nanoparticle , detects a T cell weapon, an enzyme called granzyme B, that pushes a transplanted organ\u2019s cells into the self-destruction process called\u00a0 apoptosis .\nEarliest detection\n\u201cBefore any organ damage can happen, T cells have to produce\u00a0 granzyme B , which is why this is an early detection method,\u201d said Gabe Kwong, a co-principal investigator in the study and an\u00a0 assistant professor in the Wallace H. Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering at Georgia Tech and Emory University .\n\u201cThis is sensitive enough to possibly detect budding rejection before you see significant injury to the transplanted organ and that could help clinicians treat early to prevent damage,\u201d said Dr. Andrew Adams, co-principal investigator and\u00a0 an associate professor of surgery at Emory University School \u00a0of Medicine. \u201cRight now, most tests are aimed at organ dysfunction, and sometimes they don\u2019t signal there is a problem until organ function is below 50 percent.\u201d\nKwong and Adams published the study\u2019s results\u00a0 in the journal\u00a0 Nature Biomedical Engineering \u00a0on February 18, 2019 . The research was funded by the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation and the Burroughs Wellcome Fund.\nBristly nanoball\nThe nanoparticles are put together with iron oxide in the middle like a ball. It is double-coated with\u00a0 dextran , a sugar, and\u00a0 polyethylene glycol , a common ingredient in laxatives, to keep the body from disposing of it too quickly.\nBristles made of amino acids stick out from the iron ball with fluorescent \u201creporter\u201d molecules attached to their tips.\nThe particles are injected intravenously. They are too big to accumulate in native tissue or to pass through the kidneys and out of the body but small enough to accumulate in the tissue of struggling transplanted organs, where they keep a lookout for rejection.\nExploiting rejection\nOnce T cells start secreting granzyme B, it severs amino acid strands in the transplanted organ\u2019s cells, triggering the cells to unravel and die.\n\u201cThe nanoparticles\u2019 bristles mimic granzyme\u2019s\u00a0 amino acid targets \u00a0in the cells, so the enzyme cuts the bristles on the nanoparticle at the same time,\u201d said Kwong who directs the Laboratory for Synthetic Immunity in the Coulter Department. \u201cThat releases the reporter molecules, which are so small that they easily make it through the kidney\u2019s filtration and go into the urine.\u201d\nIn the experiment, the animals\u2019 urine glowed and could be seen in their bladders in near-infrared images.\n[Ready for graduate school?\nHere's how to apply to Georgia Tech. ]\nComprehensive method\nThe researchers plan to augment their new sensor to detect the other major cause of transplant rejection,\u00a0 attacks by antibodies , which are not living cells but proteins the body creates to neutralize foreign entities.\n\u201cAntibodies kill their target cells through similar types of enzymes. In the future, we envision a single sensor to detect both types of rejection,\u201d Kwong said. But there is even more potential.\n\u201cThis method could be adapted to tease out multiple problems like rejection, infection or injury to the transplanted organ,\u201d Adams said. \u201cThe treatments for all of those are different, so we could select the proper treatment or combination of treatments and also use the test to measure how effective treatment is.\u201d\nOutdoing biopsies\nBiopsies are currently the gold standard in detection but they can go wrong, and the wide, long\u00a0 needle \u00a0can damage tissue.\n\u201cThe biggest risk of a biopsy is bleeding and injury to the transplanted organ,\u201d Adams said. \u201cThen there\u2019s the possibility of infection. You\u2019re also just taking a tiny fraction of the transplanted organ to determine what\u2019s going on with the whole organ, and you may miss rejection or misdiagnose it because the needle didn\u2019t hit the right spot. \u201d\nThe urine test gets a more global reading on the whole organ, and it has other advantages over biopsies.\n\u201cThe biopsy is not predictive. It\u2019s a static snapshot. It\u2019s like looking at a photo of people in mid-jump. You don\u2019t know if they\u2019re on their way up or on their way down. With a biopsy, you don\u2019t know whether rejection is progressing or regressing,\u201d Kwong said.\n\u201cOur method measures biological activity rates, and that tells us where things are going.\u201d\nImmunosuppressant medications\nThat could also allow clinicians to carefully dose powerful\u00a0 immunosuppressant medications \u00a0that the vast majority of transplant patients receive.\n\u201cAdjusting the dose is very difficult but very important because heavy immunosuppression increases occurrence of infections and patients who receive it also get cancer more often,\u201d Kwong said.\nFor this experiment, the researchers used small skin grafts on mice and got a very clear, timely signal from the nanoparticle sensor. Since organ transplants represent a lot more tissue, the researchers believe that any occurrence of organ rejection would trigger a much larger signal from the sensor.\n[Also read: ' Demolition Handshakes' Kill Precursor T Cells That Pose an Autoimmune Threat ]\nThese authors contributed to this research: Co-first authors Quoc Mac of the Coulter Department and Dave Mathews of the Emory Transplant Center; Justin Kahla, Claire Stoffers, Olivia Delmas, and Brandon Alexander Holt of the Coulter Department.
