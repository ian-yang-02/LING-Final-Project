Some of these problems that are so computationally difficult to perform, it could take a computer several weeks to solve.\u201d\nA graph coloring problem starts with a graph \u2013 a visual representation of a set of objects connected in some way. To solve the problem, each object must be assigned a color, but two objects directly connected cannot share the same color. Typically, the goal is to color all objects in the graph using the smallest number of different colors.\nIn designing a system different from traditional transistor-based computing, the researchers took their cues from the human brain, where processing is handled collectively, such as a neural oscillatory network, rather than with a central processor.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the notion that there is tremendous power in collective computing,\u201d said Suman Datta, Chang Family professor in Notre Dame\u2019s College of Engineering and one of the study\u2019s co-authors. \u201cIn natural forms of computing, dynamical systems with complex interdependencies evolve rapidly and solve complex sets of equations in a massively parallel fashion.\u201d\nThe electronic oscillators, fabricated from vanadium dioxide, were found to have a natural ability that could be harnessed for graph coloring problems. When a group of oscillators were electrically connected via capacitive links, they automatically synchronized to the same frequency \u2013 oscillating at the same rate. Meanwhile, oscillators directly connected to one another would operate at different phases within the same frequency, and oscillators in the same group but not directly connected would sync in both frequency and phase.\n\u201cIf you suppose that each phase represents a different color, this system was essentially mimicking naturally the solution to a graph coloring problem,\u201d said Raychowdhury, who is also the ON Semiconductor Junior Professor at Georgia Tech.\nThe researchers were able to create a small network of oscillators to solve graph coloring problems with the same number of objects, which are also referred to as nodes or vertices. But even more significant, the new system theoretically proved that a connection existed between graph coloring and the natural dynamics of coupled oscillatory systems.\n\u201cThis is a critical step because we can prove why this is happening and that it covers all possible instances of graphs,\u201d Raychowdhury said. \u201cThis opens up a new way of performative computation and constructing novel computational models. This is novel in that it\u2019s a physics-based computing approach, but it also presents tantalizing opportunities for building other customized analog systems for solving hard problems efficiently.\u201d\nThat could be valuable to a range of companies looking for computers to help optimize their resources, such as a power utility wanting to maximize efficiency and usage of a vast electrical grid under certain constraints.\n\"This work provides one of the first constructive ways to build continuous time dynamical system solvers for a combinatorial optimization problem with a working demonstration using compact scalable post-CMOS devices,\" said Abhinav Parihar, a Georgia Tech student who worked on the project.\nThe next step would be building a larger network of oscillators that could handle graph coloring problems with more objects at play.\n\u201cOur goal is to reach a system with hundreds of oscillators, which would put us in striking distance of developing a computing substrate that could solve graph coloring problems whose optimal solutions are not yet known to mankind,\u201d Datta said.\nThis material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. 1640081, the Semiconductor Research Corporation\u00a0under research task Nos. 2698.001 and 2698.002, and the Office of Naval Research under award No. N00014-11-1-0665.
