And it\u2019s true for the critical systems the U.S. Department of Defense relies on to protect the nation.\nThink about all the highly sophisticated systems that power drones or fighter jets or even secure authentication programs. Many of those systems are custom software developed at great expense. Which means updating them isn\u2019t as easy as downloading the latest software patch and clicking \u201cInstall.\u201d\nIt often requires a time-consuming rewrite or reverse engineering process that costs even more time and money. But not if a team of Georgia Tech engineers and cybersecurity researchers are successful. They\u2019re among the teams working to speed up the process with a\n$10 million Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)-funded effort\nto unpack these legacy systems, incorporate updates, and redeploy them in weeks or months rather than years.\n\u201cThe U.S. government has this tremendous problem where they put tons of research and development into cutting edge software, and then two years down the line, it needs to be updated or applied to a new platform or it needs patches. We can\u2019t just go back to the drawing board and rewrite all of our software every few years,\u201d said\nBrendan Saltaformaggio , an associate professor in the\nSchool of Cybersecurity and Privacy\n(SCP) and the\nSchool of Electrical and Computer Engineering\n(ECE).\nRead about the team's work on the College of Engineering website.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nJoshua Stewart\nCollege of Engineering\nEmail\njstewart@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
