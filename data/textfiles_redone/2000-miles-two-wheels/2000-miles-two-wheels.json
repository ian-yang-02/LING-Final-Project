After finishing finals in December, Amirfazli hopped on his bike and rode 2,228.4 miles from Marietta, Georgia, to Los Angeles, California.\n\u201cI bought a bike during quarantine and the idea of riding across the country somehow seemed like a good one. A lot of people laughed at me, didn\u2019t believe that I could do it, or just looked at me like I was crazy,\u201d Amirfazli recalled.\nAfter training on the Silver Comet Trail while taking classes online, Ali was as prepared as he could be for the grueling challenge. Skipping Commencement, the Fall 2020 industrial engineering graduate set out with his bicycle and Google Maps for the cross-country trip. With a rough goal of 100 miles a day, he hoped to make the trip in about four weeks.\nIt wasn\u2019t, of course, all smooth sailing. Facing everything from broken bicycle parts and multiple flat tires to snowy conditions and temperatures in the single digits, Amirfazli was motivated by the support of his friends and family.\n\u201cI just had to remember that between weather, road conditions, and everything else around me, a lot of things are out of my control during this trip. All I can do is put myself on the bike from sunup to sundown and if I don\u2019t make it to LA on time, then it wasn\u2019t for lack of effort.\u201d\nFinally, though, feeling both incredulous and grateful, he cycled into Los Angeles after 24 intense days.\nAmirfazli says his favorite part of the country was the area between Flagstaff, Arizona, and the start of his final approach into LA, citing the descent along epic mountains, riding through the Mojave Desert, and seeing \u201cLos Angeles\u201d on the highway signs as he drew closer to his final destination.\nBack in Georgia, he is now studying computational science and engineering at Georgia Tech, on track to earn his master\u2019s degree, and he\u2019s still biking \u2014 about 200 miles a week. He\u2019s also currently considering what challenge he wants to take on next, whether it\u2019s an Ironman or traveling across a foreign country.\nIn the meantime, you can find him on the Silver Comet Trail.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nEvan Atkinson , Institute Communications\nEmail\neatkinson6@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
