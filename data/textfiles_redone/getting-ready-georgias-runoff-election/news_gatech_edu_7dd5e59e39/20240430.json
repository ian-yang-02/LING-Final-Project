The results will determine which party will control the Senate for at least the next two years.\nIncumbent Sen. David Perdue (R) is seeking another six-year term against Jon Ossoff (D). For the other seat, incumbent Sen. Kelly Loeffler (R) is running to win the last two years of retired Sen. Johnny Isakson\u2019s term, a seat to which she was appointed by Governor Brian Kemp in 2019. She\u2019s facing off against Rev. Raphael Warnock (D).\nIf one or both Republicans win, the GOP will retain its Senate majority. If the two Democrats win\u00a0and create a 50-50 split, Vice President-elect Kamala Harris would be able to break any tie votes in the chamber.\nRegistration\nIf you plan to vote in the runoff election, first, check that your voter registration is up to date.
