Juneteenth National Independence Day, which falls on a Sunday this year, will be observed on Monday, June 20.\nDuring official holidays, classes do not meet and administrative offices are closed. Any events, exams, or meetings scheduled to occur on June 20 will be shifted in keeping with the observance.\nThe change was enabled earlier this month, when legislation signed by Governor Brian Kemp changed state law, expanding the number of annual paid holidays for state employees from 12 to 13. Last week, the University System of Georgia\u2019s (USG) Board of Regents voted to update its own policy to align with the state code. The state actions follow last year\u2019s establishment by the federal government of a national holiday commemorating the end of slavery in the United States.\nFor questions, employees are encouraged to visit\nGeorgia Tech\u2019s policy for Holiday Schedule for Employees \u00a0or connect with their HR Business Partner or Representative.\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nPayroll and Holiday Schedule\nThe Historical Legacy of Juneteenth\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
