Now researchers have used similar techniques to crack some of\u00a0the brain\u2019s mysterious code.\nBy statistically analyzing\u00a0clues intercepted through espionage, computer science pioneers in the 1940s were able to work out the rules of the Enigma code, turning a string of gibberish characters into\u00a0plain language to expose German war communications. And today, a team that included\ncomputational neuroscientist Eva Dyer , who recently joined the Georgia Institute of Technology, used cryptographic techniques inspired by Enigma\u2019s decrypting to predict, from brain data alone, which direction subjects will move their arms.\nThe work by researchers from the University of Pennsylvania, Georgia Tech, and Northwestern University could eventually\u00a0help decode the neural activity underpinning more complex muscle movements and become useful in prosthetics, or even speech, to aid patients with\u00a0paralysis.\nDuring the war, the\nteam that cracked Enigma, led by Alan Turing , considered the forebear of modern computer science, analyzed the statistical prevalence of certain letters of the alphabet to understand how they were distributed in messages like points on a map. That allowed the code breakers to eventually decipher whole words reliably.\nIn a similar manner, the neurological research team has now mapped the statistical distribution of more prevalent and less prevalent activities in populations of motor neurons to arrive at the specific hand movements driven by that neural activity.\nThe research team was led by University of Pennsylvania professor\nKonrad Kording , and\nEva Dyer , formerly a postdoctoral researcher in Kording\u2019s lab\u00a0and now an assistant professor at Georgia Tech. They collaborated with the group of Lee Miller, a professor at Northwestern University. They published their\nstudy on December 12, 2017, in the journal\nNature Biomedical Engineering .\nNeuron firing pattern\nIn an experiment conducted in animal models, the researchers took data from more than one hundred neurons associated with arm movement. As the animals reached for a target that appeared at different locations around a central starting point, sensors recorded spikes of neural activity that corresponded with the movement of the subject\u2019s arm.\n\u201cJust looking at the raw neural activity on a visual level tells you basically nothing about the movements it corresponds to, so you have to decode it to make the connection,\u201d Dyer said. \u201cWe did it by mapping neural patterns to actual arm movements using machine learning techniques inspired by\ncryptography .\u201d\nThe statistical prevalence of certain neurons\u2019 firings paired up reliably and repeatedly with actual movements the way that, in the Enigma project, the prevalence of certain code symbols paired up with the frequency of use of specific letters of the alphabet in written language. In the neurological experiment, an algorithm translated the statistical patterns into visual graphic patterns, and eventually, these aligned with the physical hand movements that they aimed to decode.\n\u201cThe algorithm tries every possible decoder until we get something where the output looks like typical movements,\u201d Kording said. \u201cThere are issues scaling this up \u2014\u00a0it\u2019s a hard computer science problem \u2014\u00a0but this is a proof-of-concept that\ncryptanalysis\ncan work in the context of neural activity.\n\u201cAt this point, the cryptanalysis approach is very new and needs refining, but fundamentally, it\u2019s a good match for this kind of brain decoding,\u201d Dyer said.\nBrain decoding does face\u00a0a fundamental challenge that code-breaking doesn't.\nIn cryptography, code-breakers have both the encrypted and unencrypted messages, so all they need to do is to figure out which rules turn\u00a0one into the other. \"What we wanted to do in this experiment was to be able to decode the brain from the encrypted message alone,\u201d Kording said.\nHear PODCAST: The Brain, Cosmos in the Cranium, Part II -- neurons' secrets and how they make the brain\ncompute\nBrain-computer interfaces\nA\ncryptanalysis\napproach to decoding neural activity is particularly attractive when it comes to brain-computer interfaces that control prosthetics.\nExisting brain-computer interfaces can already use such data to move a robotic prosthesis, but Kording and Dyer\u2019s experiment has achieved a significant innovation. Existing technology uses a process known as\nsupervised learning ,\u00a0in which the interface can be trained to recognize which neural firings\u00a0correspond\u00a0to which intended physical movements, and can thus \u201creplay\u201d those movements when the subject's motor neurons produce a\u00a0pattern the device has been trained to recognize.\nThe new research could do away with the training period required for existing\nbrain-computer interfaces \u00a0to function and allow robotic limbs to directly interpret their user\u2019s thoughts without even having to be calibrated. It would represent a significant quality-of-life improvement for patients wearing them.\n\u201cSupervised training may sound simple, but actually, it can be long and troublesome, and in the end, it can even fail,\u201d Dyer said. \u201cFor example, if the patient\u2019s arm is not paralyzed but instead is missing, it\u2019s really hard for the training to work.\u201d\nThe researchers\u2019 innovation could mean the difference between a patient straining to mentally picture how the arm should move with possibly cumbersome results, and willfully moving the arm in a virtually natural way.\nDoorway to mindreading\nThis cryptanalysis approach also offers promise for\u00a0brain-computer interfaces to achieve literal mind-reading, the way decoding Enigma allowed for reading encrypted texts.\nA patient repeatedly thinking\u00a0the same sentences would generate neural patterns. \u201cWe could build a decoder that transforms those patterns until they look\u00a0like language,\u201d Kording said. \u201cI think we should be able to do this within the next decade.\u201d\nA consistent improvement in\nbrain recording technology\ncould help put this goal within reach. This could become useful for patients unable to speak but could also possibly be abused in espionage, Kording warned. But there's still time to work out the direction future applications take on.\nAn evolutionary stroke of luck has made this cryptanalysis approach possible. \u201cThe brain ended up with this encryption system through natural selection,\u201d Kording said. \u201cSo, it\u2019s essentially making the same kind of \u2018mistakes\u2019 that allowed us to crack Enigma in the first place.\u201d\nModern encryption systems are so refined they\u2019re impossible to crack. Enigma, on the other hand, was new enough during World War II that it had small imperfections that gave decrypters a pathway into its secrets, making its cracking a fitting inspiration for brain decoding.\nPODCAST: The Brain, Cosmos in the Cranium, Part I - when the brain's fate hangs by a few molecules\nPODCAST: The Brain, Part III - how we get around, how we focus, and how we zone out\nResearchers Mohammad\u00a0Gheshlaghi Azar,\u00a0Hugo L Fernandes, Matthew\nPeich, Stephanie Naufel and Lee Miller of Northwestern University coauthored the study.
