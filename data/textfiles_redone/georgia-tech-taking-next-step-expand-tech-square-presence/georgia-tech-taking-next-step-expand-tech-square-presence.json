The Institute, advised by Cushman & Wakefield, issued a request for qualification (RFQ) for private developers interested in the expansion of Technology Square. Anchored by a high performance computing center, the development will be a transformative project providing a sustainable platform for expanding interdisciplinary research, collaboration and co-location with industry partners, while also supporting Georgia Tech\u2019s academic and research programs in advanced analytics and computing. The target site for the proposed complex is located in Technology Square, between Spring Street and West Peachtree Street, near Georgia Tech\u2019s Scheller College of Business and the Georgia Tech Hotel in Midtown Atlanta. As the anchor tenant, Georgia Tech intends to occupy about half the space in the building or a total of 300,000 rentable square feet (RSF). \u201cThe project is aligned with our vision of developing a high performance computing center in Midtown Atlanta,\u201d said Executive Vice President for Administration and Finance Steve Swant. \u201cWe are pleased to move forward with this exciting project that is programmed to provide a vibrant, interdisciplinary collaborative environment for Georgia Tech\u2019s faculty, students, researchers, entrepreneurs and strategic partners. With the significant interest and participation of Georgia Tech\u2019s academic units and an impressive list of prospective industry partners, the opportunities to expand this ecosystem and support economic development will continue to transform this area into a unique, highly desirable destination for all stakeholders.\u201d According to Georgia Tech\u2019s Executive Director for Real Estate Development John Majeroni, Georgia Tech will select a private developer to deliver the project through the RFQ process and subsequent Request for Proposal process. \u201cThe development approach is new for Georgia Tech\u201d, said Majeroni, \u201cThe Institute will leverage its role as the anchor tenant to encourage the developer to bring additional space and users to the project, magnifying it\u2019s positive impact on the Technology Square neighborhood.\u201d The next step will involve the process of identifying qualified developers to provide formal proposals for the development and securing additional economic commitments needed to enable this expansion to proceed.\nRelated links\nHigh Performance Computing RFQ\nContact\nLisa Grovenstein, 404-894-8835\nEmail\nlisa.grovenstein@comm.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
