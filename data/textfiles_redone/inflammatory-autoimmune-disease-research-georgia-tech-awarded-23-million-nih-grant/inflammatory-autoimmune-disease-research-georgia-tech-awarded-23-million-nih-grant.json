Georgia Tech has been awarded a $2.3 million NIH grant to employ computation in the study of genetic variants and their influence on susceptibility.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nEmail\nGreg Gibson, a professor at Georgia Tech\u2019s School of Biological Sciences, has received a generous NIH grant to study the subtle genetic underpinnings of autoimmune related diseases taking a computational approach.\nSep 22, 2016\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nThe\u00a0 lab of Greg Gibson \u00a0at the Georgia Institute of Technology has been awarded a grant of $2.3 million to study the subtle genetic underpinnings of autoimmune-related diseases by taking a computational approach.\nThe National Institutes of Health\u00a0 made the award as part of an $11.1 million total investment in research funds slated for five institutions , including Georgia Tech. The researchers\u2019 work could increase understanding of the causes of diabetes, Crohn\u2019s disease, rheumatoid arthritis, forms of heart disease, and more afflictions where inflammation is at issue, and where there may be a connection to autoimmunity.\n\"We know that hundreds of genes impact autoimmunity, but the challenge is to narrow down the actual DNA sequence changes that have an impact. This grant combines our statistical genetics expertise with evolutionary genetics and genome editing by collaborators,\u201d said Greg Gibson, a professor at Georgia Tech\u2019s\nSchool of Biological Sciences .\nIn its research, Georgia Tech will work together with Rice University in Houston and Temple University in Philadelphia. Gibson's researchers will handle statistical analysis and interpretation; Rice's scientists will carry out gene editing, and evolutionary geneticists at Temple will contribute insights on which gene sites should or should not be variable in the human genome.\nAttacking friends: Autoimmunity\nOur cells work together with masses of microbes that are an integral part of the human body, but the immune systems of people with related diseases can attack the microbes and healthy human cells, and lead to inflammation. \u201cLymphocytes, for example, could be attacking the body,\u201d Gibson said.\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking at genes that regulate the immune system,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve all got subtle effects. What counts is that they all work together. We\u2019re looking for sections of genetic code that work a little oddly.\u201d\nResearchers will put data through algorithms to better identify genetic variants in sections of the human genome that do not encode proteins, but have regulatory functions, the NIH said in a news release. These are sections of DNA that, for example, turn encoding genes on and off.\nSubtleties multiplied: Susceptibility\nThey have been lesser studied but are known to be critical and could provide new information on yet undiscovered pathways composed of multiple faint characteristics that add up to disease.\n\"Taken alone, some small characteristic may appear indistinct, and at the same time, it\u2019s really hard to read how a big group of them work in total,\u201d Gibson said. \u201cBut their cumulative effect is dramatic, and unfortunate.\u201d\nRecent genomic research methods have compared the complete genomes of patients with diseases to those without them, leading to thousands of statistical hints. Now new data and interpretive approaches are needed to effectively sift through these to see the foundations of diseases, or make predictions of who is most at risk, and what people can do to reduce the risk.\nThe NIH hopes statistical methods will allow prediction of possible effects some variants have on susceptibility to disease and on drug response. The funding comes from the NIH\u2019s\u00a0National Human Genome Research Institute ( NHGRI )'s Non-Coding Variants Program, and the National Cancer Institute ( NCI ).\nAdditional Images\nContact\nWriter and contact: Ben Brumfield\nResearch News\n(404) 660-1408\nEmail\nben.brumfield@comm.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
