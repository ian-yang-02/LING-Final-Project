Like most parents, he wanted to see how his son was adjusting to his first years in college. He didn't expect to end up enrolling in classes, though.\nFeb 02, 2023\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nIt all started one parents weekend in Midtown Atlanta.\nJuan Villarreal came to Georgia Tech in Fall 2021 to visit his son, Patrick. Like most parents, he wanted to see how his son was adjusting to his first years in college.\nPatrick, 20, had come to Georgia Tech to study\nmechanical engineering , following in the educational footsteps of his father, who studied engineering \u00a040 years before at Kansas State and Cal Berkeley where he earned bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees in nuclear and mechanical engineering, respectively.\nBecause of his exposure to his father\u2019s academic and professional journey, Patrick, who grew up in the Atlanta area and was captain of his high school robotics team, knew he wanted to come to Georgia Tech to study.\u2019\n\u201cHearing him talk about his college experience and his job inspired a lot of the things I\u2019m interested in,\u201d Patrick said.\nThen when Patrick\u2019s parents went to visit as their son was taking on his own Georgia Tech journey, it was almost inevitable that father would find inspiration from son.\n\u201cI saw not only the beautiful Georgia Tech campus but also was able to sense the incredible passion and support Georgia Tech has for its students and mission,\u201d said Juan.\nJuan found himself eager to continue learning.\nAfter four decades in the power industry helping to set up nuclear energy plants, Juan\u2019s work had begun shifting to include more involvement in how our nation\u2019s power grids are advancing digitally and how to protect them from cyberthreats.\n\u201cThe defense of our networks and the electric grid is really important,\u201d said Juan. \u201cI wanted to know more about the specific details.\u201d\nSo, after visiting Patrick on campus, Juan decided to apply to Georgia Tech\u2019s\nMaster of Science in Cybersecurity\nprogram. He could have applied for an\nonline model\nbut wanted to be on campus to experience the energy and interaction with professors and classmates in person.\u00a0That also meant he would be on campus right along with his son and many other students half, even a third his age or younger.\nYou might think most college students in their 20s would be worried about a parent cramping their style, but Patrick was all in on the idea.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s super cool, you know, meeting up and talking about classes,\u201d said Patrick.\nHe says it\u2019s a fun story to tell.\n\u201cSometimes my friends will come tell me, \u2018Oh, I saw your dad yesterday walking out of the Student Center.\u2019\u201d\nPatrick and Juan frequently meet up for lunch or coffee on campus, and quite often Patrick has a couple of friends in tow.\nWhile they haven\u2019t had any direct class overlap, they\u2019ve already been able to help each other out.\nPatrick helped his father navigate the online registration system and learn how to use the programming languages MATLAB and Python.\n\u201cThings have changed a lot since I was first in college,\u201d Juan said. \u201cSome of what he\u2019s doing in physics is similar to what I\u2019m doing in electrical engineering. It\u2019s been good to exchange information and help each other.\u201d\nPatrick says watching his father take on this new challenge not only makes him proud, but he\u2019s also inspired to press forward himself.\n\u201cOne of the fears of every college student is: \u2018What if I\u2019m doing the wrong thing?\u2019\u201d he said. But reflecting on his father\u2019s journey, he realizes that, in the future, \u201cif I need to pivot, I know that\u2019s possible.\u201d\nPatrick has been diving headfirst into\nRoboJackets , a student organization that builds and competes with robots of all kinds. He\u2019s currently working on a Mars Rover-type spacecraft with the team. And while gaining new skills on campus, Patrick is still learning life lessons from his father, too.\n\u201cIt\u2019s never too late, right? You can always learn new things,\u201d Patrick said. \u201cHe\u2019s always been the one teaching me things, but here I am helping him, too. Everyone can help everyone else.\u201d\nJuan, meanwhile, says he\u2019s having fun expanding his mind.\n\u201cIt\u2019s great to be around all these smart people and professors,\u201d he said. \u201cI would recommend this to anybody at any age who wants to go back to school. Don\u2019t let stereotypes say you can\u2019t do it.\u201d\nAnd there\u2019s a big bonus, Juan has found: spending time with his son. Two could soon become three as Juan\u2019s son and Patrick\u2019s younger brother, Christian, was just admitted during early action acceptance.\n\u201cI traveled a lot during my career, so now this has allowed us the opportunity to reconnect, and I never expected that. So, coming to Georgia Tech has had double the benefit.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nContact\nSteven Norris\nsnorris@gatech.edu\nInstitute Communications\nEmail\nsnorris@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
