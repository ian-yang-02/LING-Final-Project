When we\u2019re talking, I can still make some quick reply that doesn\u2019t interrupt our interaction.\u201d\nSince one of the\u00a0goals\u00a0was to enter digits using only one hand, the team decided to use\u00a0ASL, which already has well defined hand postures for each digit. In this manner, the user might select options from a numbered list, call a phone number, or do simple calculations.\nThe system is called\nFingerPing . Unlike other technology that requires the use of a glove or a more obtrusive wearable, this technique is limited to just a thumb ring and a watch. The ring produces acoustic chirps that travel through the hand and are picked up by receivers on the watch. There are specific patterns in which sound waves travel through structures, including the hand, that can be altered by the manner in which the hand is posed. Utilizing those poses, the wearer can achieve up to 22 pre-programmed commands.\nThe gestures are small and non-invasive, as simple as tapping the tip of a finger or posing your hand in classic \u201c1,\u201d \u201c2,\u201d and \u201c3\u201d gestures.\n\u201cThe receiver recognizes these tiny differences,\u201d Zhang said. \u201cThe injected sound from the thumb will travel at different paths inside the body with different hand postures. For instance, when your hand is open there is only one direct path from the thumb to the wrist. Any time you do a gesture where you close a loop, the sound will take a different path and that will form a unique signature.\u201d\nZhang said that the research is a proof of concept for a technique that could be expanded and improved upon in the future.\nThe research was presented last month at the 2018 ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI). The paper is titled FingerPing: Recognizing Fine-grained Hand Poses Using Active Acoustic On-body Sensing (Cheng Zhang,\nQiuyue Xue ,\nAnandghan Waghmare ,\nRuichen Meng ,\nSumeet Jain ,\nYizeng Han ,\nXinyu Li ,\nKenneth Cunefare ,\nThomas Ploetz ,\nThad Starner ,\nOmer Inan ,\nGregory Abowd ).\nResearchers on this team, including Zhang, have worked on similar unique gesture techniques in the past. Zhang graduated from Georgia Tech in May and will join the Information Science Department at Cornell University as a tenure-track assistant professor.\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nUsing a Ring to Draw and Write\nControlling Smartwatch with Breaths and Swipes\nContact\nDavid Mitchell\nCommunications Officer\ndavid.mitchell@cc.gatech.edu\nEmail\ndavid.mitchell@cc.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
