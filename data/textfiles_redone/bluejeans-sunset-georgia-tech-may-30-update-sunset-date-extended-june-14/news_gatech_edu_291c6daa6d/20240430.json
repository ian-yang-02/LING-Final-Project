Campus users are encouraged to migrate stored recordings before then.\nThe BlueJeans decommission is a culmination of a review by the\nVideo Collaboration Review \u202f(VCR) Committee. The group was established to evaluate new videoconferencing solutions for academic course delivery and collaboration against existing services. Driven by Georgia Tech Professional Education (GTPE) and the Office of Information Technology (OIT), the committee brought in student, faculty, and staff voices from across the Institute to identify video collaboration service offerings. Ultimately, plans to sunset BlueJeans and WebEx (except for the Georgia Tech Research Institute*) were formalized.\nThe VCR Committee also announced a soft launch of the\u00a0 Zoom \u202fvideo collaboration platform.\n\u201cNot only did Zoom, to a large extent, meet our committee\u2019s criteria, but it is also one of the most widely used video collaboration tools,\u201d Yakut Gazi, Ph.D., associate dean for Learning Systems at GTPE,\nsaid\nearlier this year. \u201cMany of our students, faculty, and staff have participated in Zoom meetings during and even before the pandemic, which we anticipate will facilitate adoption at Georgia Tech.\u201d Since the soft launch, the platform has facilitated over 2,700 meetings and webinars by Tech users.\nIn preparation for the transition from BlueJeans, students, faculty, and staff are encouraged to migrate stored lecture, meeting, and event recordings to\nKaltura MediaSpace\nvia the\nBlueJeans Video Exporter\ntool. The exporter will move a maximum of five videos simultaneously, with each video typically taking a few minutes to upload. Archived videos can take up to five hours, depending on the video\u2019s length.\nOIT has published an\n11-step illustrated knowledge article\nto guide campus users during the recording transfer process. Campus users who need further assistance can also submit a help request via the Services and Support site at\ngatech.service-now.com/home .\nIn addition to Zoom, Georgia Tech will continue to offer and support\nMicrosoft Teams , which offers videoconferencing, secure file storage, chat, meeting, calling, and file-sharing capabilities.\nOIT\u202fwill work with the Georgia Tech community throughout the rest of the spring semester to prepare for the transition from BlueJeans. Upcoming communications will share additional information.\nThe BlueJeans Video Exporter tool can be accessed at\nmover.bluejeans.gatech.edu.\n*The Georgia Tech Research Institute will continue to use its version of WebEx ( gtri.webex.com ).\nAdditional Images\nContact\nCourtney Hill\ncourtney.hill@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
