Yunker, an assistant professor in the School of Physics, arrived in January of the following year.\n\u201cI met with [Physics Professor] Dan Goldman and told him about my interests in biophysics,\u201d said Yunker. \u201cHe told me there\u2019s another young guy who just arrived. You should contact him.\u201d\nYunker reached out to Ratcliff, and the two began meeting weekly for coffee in the basement of the College of Computing.\n\u201cI think our conversations for a solid six months were just about friend stuff,\u201d Ratcliff said. \u201cWe talked about science, but we weren\u2019t actively pursuing projects. We were just hanging out and getting to know each other.\u201d\nYunker said they discussed ideas about the evolution of multicellularity.\n\u201cWill would talk a little about the biology of the evolution of multicellularity. And then we would pivot, and I would talk about the physics of multicellularity,\u201d Yunker said.\nThough coming from different disciplines \u2014 biology and physics \u2014 Ratcliff and Yunker quickly recognized some common ground.\n\u201cI would say, \u2018There\u2019s this thing in biology where this needs to happen,\u2019 and he would say \u2018there\u2019s this thing in physics where this needs to happen,\u2019\u201d Ratcliff said. \u201cIt would blow my mind because it was a totally different way of thinking about the things that I was already thinking about. It was incredibly exciting because there were these parallels coming from such different places, and they were describing the same overlapping material. I think we both could tell there was a lot of cool stuff to be done.\u201d\nThe harder part was figuring out where the overlap was concrete so they could actually conduct experiments or write models.\n\u201cA lot of our conversations are brainstorming style,\u201d Yunker said. \u201cThey\u2019re less about knocking down ideas and more about: \u2018Let\u2019s get a lot of information out there so we can find where that concrete idea emerges.\u2019\u201d\nThe collaboration also eased the pressure of being a new faculty member.\n\u201cIt\u2019s nice to work with other people who are at a similar level, to bounce ideas off each other, talk about critical review, and vent about frustrations,\u201d Yunker said. \u201cThe whole time I\u2019ve been here I have always heard Georgia Tech is very supportive of collaboration. I\u2019ve heard of other places where that support isn\u2019t there when you\u2019re still at the assistant professor level. I haven\u2019t worried at all about if there will be trouble down the line if we collaborate. Instead, I see it as we\u2019re doing the best science, and that\u2019s what Georgia Tech wants.\u201d\nRatcliff said, \u201cThat\u2019s one of Georgia Tech\u2019s real strengths. People really appreciate our collaboration. I hear from people in both communities \u2014 biology and physics. They appreciate not just the research, but also the strengthening of the bridge between the departments and the sense of community it builds.\u201d\nIn addition to their research collaborations, Ratcliff and Yunker co-advise a Ph.D. student and a postdoc.\nCollaboration Advice to New Faculty\nYunker and Ratcliff make collaboration look deceptively easy.\n\u201cCollaboration takes effort. It takes sustained interaction,\u201d Ratcliff said. \u201cThere\u2019s got to be a reason to do that because as new professors we\u2019re super busy trying to get everything off the ground: get your lab running, get grants, write papers, design classes, do service work. We\u2019re spread really thin. So, to have sustained interactions that are needed for a good collaboration, you have to prioritize it and want to do it.\u201d\nYunker added, \u201cOne of the best approaches when starting a new collaboration is to either let it grow or die on its own. If the idea isn\u2019t there or if you just don\u2019t mesh, then forcing it is going to be difficult for everyone.\u201d\nRatcliff has advice for new faculty who are interested in collaborating.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really exciting and valuable to have a close collaborator from a different discipline or with a\u00a0 different skillset,\u201d he said. \u201cTo get that, I suggest forming collaborations with other professors who are about your age. Key reasons are you\u2019re both at the same stage in your careers. You\u2019re equals. Also, a new professor is likely to have time to form new collaborations. Lastly, new professors have startup funds and a large degree of flexibility. This is great for trying things that are risky.\u201d\nHe also suggests attending receptions for new faculty.\n\u201cTalk to people outside of your discipline. Don\u2019t spend\nall\nof your time at the mixer talking to your departmental colleagues,\u201d Ratcliff said.\nDeveloping a good collaboration can be transformational.\n\u201cOur collaboration has fundamentally reshaped the way I think about key problems in my field,\u201d Ratcliff said. \u201cI know how to think about the things I was trained to think about, but I had no idea how to think about things I wasn\u2019t trained to think about.\u201d\nYunker said, \u201cTogether we\u2019re able to ask and answer more interesting questions. I was not versed at all on questions about evolutionary transitions and individuality. I wasn\u2019t aware of all the open questions and problems there, and they\u2019re fascinating. By coming together, we end up asking even more interesting questions and, hopefully, coming up with new approaches.\u201d\nRatcliff said what made the collaboration work is that he and Yunker became friends.\n\u201cWe enjoy hanging out. I look forward to having coffee,\u201d Ratcliff said. \u201cWe have these exciting scientific discussions where it was obvious that there\u2019s something there, but we had to make the ideas touch down to reality.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nCholera research\nEvolution of multicellularity\nContact\nVictor Rogers\nInstitute Communications\nEmail\nvictor.rogers@comm.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
