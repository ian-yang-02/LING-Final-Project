(Photo credit: Rob Felt, Georgia Tech)\nMar 08, 2021\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nThe Georgia Institute of Technology is one of 16 academic institutions selected for\nToyota Research Institute\u2019s (TRI)\ncollaborative research program.\nFounded in 2015 and now in its second wave of investment with top universities, TRI will invest more than $75 million over the next five years. The university partners will focus on breakthroughs around tough technological challenges in key research priority areas of automated driving, robotics, and machine-assisted cognition.\n\u201cGeorgia Tech is honored to work closely with TRI to advance robotics in key fields. It\u2019s an exciting start to what we hope will be a longer-term collaboration,\u201d said\nSeth Hutchinson , executive director of Georgia Tech\u2019s\nInstitute for Robotics and Intelligent Machines\nand professor and KUKA Chair for Robotics in the\nSchool of Interactive Computing .\n\"This new phase of university research is about pushing even further and doing so with a broader, more diverse set of stakeholders. To get to the best ideas, collaboration is critical. And we sought out universities like Georgia Tech that share our vision of using AI for human amplification and societal good. The funded projects will contribute to two TRI focus areas: automated driving and home robotics,\" said Eric Krotkov, TRI chief science officer.\nThe two Georgia Tech projects total $2.2M over the next three years. Under the agreement, each team will be paired with TRI researchers, who will serve as co-investigators.\nAn Outdoor MiniCity to Test Autonomous Driving\nThe first research project aims to make it easier for universities to test autonomous vehicles, building on Georgia Tech\u2019s\nAutoRally\nplatform. Georgia Tech researchers use this small-scale autonomous dirt track to test aggressive driving. The car can control turns and calculate for on-course obstacles at speeds approaching 20 miles per hour. The software and simulation environment could help make future self-driving cars safer under similar hazardous road conditions. Georgia Tech researchers will build on this platform to develop a scale-model MiniCity environment to develop and test autonomy algorithms.\nCurrent autonomous vehicle testing is done by industry using full-size vehicles on city streets \u2013 an expensive proposition not viable for the broader academic research community.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a barrier to entry for the science in the field,\u201d said principal investigator\nJames Rehg , a professor in the\nSchool of Interactive Computing . \u201cOur platform uses a one-fifth scale vehicle, freeing us to do research at lower cost and without taking any risks \u2013 we can crash our car and it\u2019s inexpensive to repair and nobody gets hurt.\u201d\nThe autonomous cars will navigate the MiniCity and avoid hazards while obeying speed and traffic rules. Sensors will enable the cars to sense obstacles and make decisions on how fast to drive or how to steer. \u201cWe are addressing the issue of reproducibility of autonomous driving in a test environment,\u201d Rehg said.\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), one of TRI\u2019s three original funded universities, is leading the research project. MIT operates an indoor autonomous driving track that simulates paved city streets. With Georgia Tech\u2019s outdoor track, researchers can then see how autonomous cars perform over gravel, dirt, and other more realistic driving conditions.\nAccording to Rehg, autonomy testing presents unique challenges. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason you get a driver\u2019s test \u2014 you have to understand the variety of situations that can arise in driving and the rules, and you must understand how the context can change and make all the right decisions for safety.\u201d\nWith the MiniCity, Rehg and fellow investigator Evangelos Theodorou, an associate professor in the Daniel Guggenheim School of Aerospace Engineering, hope to develop a standardized testbed and protocol for testing and then invite academic teams to compete and measure the driving performance of their vehicles.\nHuman-assist Robots to Help People Age in Place\nGeorgia Tech\u2019s other TRI research project involves robotics that can assist older adults. It reflects Toyota and TRI\u2019s priority to help older adults age in place.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really a powerful thing to have independence and be able to do things for yourself,\u201d said the project\u2019s principal investigator,\nCharlie Kemp , associate professor in the\nWallace H. Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering\nand adjunct associate professor in the\nSchool of Interactive Computing . Kemp also is a co-founder and the chief technology officer of Hello Robot Inc., a company that has commercialized robotic assistance technologies initially developed in his lab.\nLooking at the aging issue, Kemp and co-PI Hutchinson will examine how to take advantage of complementary characteristics that can lead to better physical collaboration between an individual and a robot.\n\u201cWe are asking, \u2018How can an individual and a particular robot best work together?\u2019 \u2018How do we individualize the robot to the person to give them a better quality of life?\u2019\u201d Kemp said.\nThey plan to take a modeling approach initially using physics simulations and, later, conducting studies with young able-bodied participants, healthy older adults, and older adults with impairments.\nThe researchers will use sensing technology \u2013 including pressure sensors on beds that pinpoint a person\u2019s body position and movement, as well as capacitive sensors that help the robot to better perceive a person\u2019s body position up close. Such information can help with activities like dressing.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very intimate interaction between the robot and the human,\u201d Hutchinson said.\nBoth investigators share TRI\u2019s view that robotics that can assist older adults with daily living could make a major impact in the well-being of an increasingly graying population. In fact, during the next three decades, the global population over the age of 65 is projected to more than double. Japan, headquarters for Toyota, has the highest proportion of older citizens of any country in the world, with one in four people over 65.\n\u201cWe have talked about robots helping older adults for decades and we\u2019re still not there,\u201d said Kemp. \u201cThere\u2019s a real opportunity to help people. As I get older, I\u2019d love for this technology to be there for me and for my loved ones. While we still have a long way to go, the research can get us closer,\u201d he added.\nHutchinson acknowledged that it will take time before people see robotic assistive technologies in hospitals or people\u2019s homes, but the potential is there.\n\u201cWhat is most exciting about the TRI project is it has the potential to show up in people\u2019s homes because TRI is invested in getting it there. And that means our research could really make an impact on a broad scale instead of only touching research journals or elite practitioners in the field,\u201d he said.\nRobotics Success Takes a Village\nThe investigators agree that Georgia Tech\u2019s multidisciplinary focus within robotics is a strength that will serve them well in their work with TRI, and especially in the future when autonomy goes mainstream.\n\u201cIf you think about what it\u2019s going to take for autonomous vehicles to really exist in the world on a large scale and deliver passengers in high volumes, it\u2019s going to require all those things \u2013 engineering, science policy, law, and ethics \u2013 all those disciplines coming together,\u201d said Rehg.\nKemp agreed, noting that since founding his\nHealthcare Robotics Lab\nin 2007, he\u2019s attracted students from across engineering disciplines \u2014 from mechanical and computing to electrical, aerospace, and biomedical.\n\u201cIt's definitely something that's distinctive about Georgia Tech \u2014 it's a real strength,\u201d he said.\nCharlie Kemp owns equity in Hello Robot and is an inventor of Georgia Tech intellectual property (IP) licensed by Hello Robot. Consequently, he benefits from increases in the value of Hello Robot and receives royalties via Georgia Tech for sales made by Hello Robot.
