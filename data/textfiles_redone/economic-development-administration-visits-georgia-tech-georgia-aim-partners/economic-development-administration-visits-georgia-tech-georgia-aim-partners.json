Alvord\u2019s Atlanta stop \u2014 the 19 th \u00a0project visited \u2014 is part of the agency\u2019s plan to visit and meet with leaders of all the funded projects across the country.\nEDA expects the 21 projects will create more than 220,000 jobs and collectively attract $20 billion in private investments.\nA 12-partner collaboration of industry, higher education, and government organizations, Georgia AIM seeks to close\u00a0technology gaps and support a technological opportunity ecosystem across the state that\u2019s inclusive of underrepresented communities and rural counties.\nThe Georgia AIM coalition\u2019s efforts are projected to draw $105 million in private investment and create or save 23,000 jobs over the next five years.\nSpread across eight different projects, the coalition\u2019s goals include nurturing K-12 students who are interested in science and math-related pursuits, building workforce development programs specific to artificial intelligence, and catalyzing outside investments to communities and startups. Finally, Georgia AIM looks to better secure the state\u2019s manufacturing infrastructure.\n\u201cI\u2019m incredibly impressed by the size of and diversity of the of the coalition that you brought together for this project,\u201d Alvord said, following discussions with several members, which, in addition to Georgia Tech, include the\u00a0 Technology Association of Georgia\u2019s TAG Bridge Builders , the\u00a0 Robins Air Force Base 21 st \u00a0Century Partnership , the\u00a0 Russell Innovation Center for Entrepreneurs , and the\u00a0 Technical College System of Georgia .\nCommunity engagement and creating a framework that allows the communities and people affected to actively shape their futures is important to EDA, Alvord said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s great to see the ingrained commitment to equity and making sure that diverse populations and underserved populations are really tied to this award and are going to benefit from it,\u201d Alvord said.\nDoing that successfully, he said, means ensuring those communities are exposed to artificial intelligence in comprehensive ways to see \u201cthe potential that it has to revolutionize existing industries and to create new entrepreneurial opportunities for new business starts in these underserved geographies and populations.\u201d\nHe noted some of the focus areas of Georgia AIM are doing that, such as the\u00a0AI InVenture K-12 Experience. That effort, a collaboration of\u00a0Georgia Tech\u2019s \u00a0K-12 InVenture Prize \u00a0and\u00a0 Center for Education Integrating Science, Mathematics and Computing , is piloting a rural regional event with a region-specific prize. They will also create supplemental lessons centered on AI and data science that will be part of a K-12 InVenture Prize curriculum website.\n\u201cI was very much struck by the efforts to reach out to the K-through-12 populations and expose them to AI and its potential in manufacturing very early to get people into the STEM [Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math] ecosystem very early,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about being interested in science or math. It\u2019s understanding how that could tie to a future career path so that individuals can see themselves following that trajectory.\u201d\nEqually impressive, he said, is a Georgia AIM the component of connecting those interested in innovating in AI manufacturing to the resources to make that possible. Several of the Georgia AIM partners, including Georgia Tech\u2019s\u00a0 Enterprise Innovation Institute , TAG Bridge Builders, and the Technical College System of Georgia are already doing that through\u00a0creative workforce development programs, implementation strategies, and serving as conduits to draw outside investment.\n\u201cWhat I love about this particular coalition is that it\u2019s connecting all the parts,\u201d said Loretta Daniels, director of the TAG Bridge Builders program, which is charged with ensuring the state\u2019s technology sector is more equitable and inclusive of Black tech talent.\n\u201cWe\u2019re connecting with so many different organizations trying to advance diversity and in the tech arena, but we\u2019ve all come together to try and figure out how we can all advance each other.\u201d\nBridging artificial intelligence and manufacturing is reflective of where Georgia leads and Georgia Tech innovates, said\u00a0 Aaron Stebner , associate professor in the\u00a0 George W. Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering \u00a0and the\u00a0 School of Materials Science and Engineering . Stebner co-leads Georgia AIM with\u00a0 Donna Ennis , director of Diversity Engagement and Program Development in the Enterprise Innovation Institute, and\u00a0 Thomas R. Kurfess , executive director of the Georgia Tech Manufacturing Institute.\nThe state\u2019s robust manufacturing economy employs more than 400,000 and generates in excess of $61 billion in economic activity year. Georgia is a leading manufacturing hub in 10 different sectors and Georgia Tech is at the forefront of\u00a0 AI research and innovations .\n\u201cIt seemed like the right place and the right time to bring this group of people together in this endeavor,\u201d Stebner said. \u201cWe had this really unique opportunity to ask ourselves what does the future look like and how can we do it better than we have been doing it before.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nContact\nPeralte C.
