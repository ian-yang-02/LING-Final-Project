Burdell.\nMay 02, 2022\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nCelia Kornegay has attended five Georgia Tech Commencement ceremonies. But her sixth ceremony will be different \u2014 because it\u2019s her own.\n\u201cI was 13 when I attended my first Georgia Tech ceremony, where I watched my oldest sister, Elizabeth, graduate with a B.S. in environmental engineering in 2013,\u201d she said.\nKornegay returned the following year to watch Elizabeth get her master\u2019s in environmental engineering. In 2015 she saw her cousin, Raine Hayes, receive a bachelor\u2019s in psychology. In 2019 her other sister, Emily Baig, graduated with a bachelor\u2019s in industrial engineering. And in 2020 her boyfriend, Joey Bishop, earned a B.S. in computational media.\n\u201cI am excited to finally be the one walking across the stage,\u201d said Kornegay, who will receive a bachelor\u2019s degree in civil engineering. In June she will begin her career as a staff engineer on site design and land development projects at Eberly and Associates, a civil engineering firm in Atlanta where she interned last summer.\nAs a student, Kornegay was very involved with the Society of Women Engineers (SWE), serving in various leadership roles including middle school outreach chair, vice president of finance, vice president of membership, and president. \u201cI am extremely passionate about encouraging young girls to pursue STEM fields. My involvement with SWE will continue as I enter my professional career,\u201d she said.\nKornegay is also passionate about animals, volunteering at the Atlanta Humane Society while in school. \u201cMy boyfriend and I adopted a dog from the DeKalb County Animal Shelter. His middle name is Burdell, after the well-known George P. Burdell,\u201d she said.\nWhat she will miss most about Georgia Tech is the feeling of pride and sense of community. \u201cI was in the Yellow Jacket Marching Band and the Georgia Tech Pep Band, where I was on the color guard and played piccolo for two years. Being a part of such a large organization that has such pride in Georgia Tech was definitely a huge part of my college experience.\u201d\nKornegay\u2019s entire family will join her in celebrating her graduation. \u201cEveryone is coming \u2014 my parents, grandparents, sisters, cousin, and boyfriend. My oldest sister is married, and they are bringing their baby. I told her that having to bring a baby to my Commencement is equal to me having to sit through two of hers.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nContact\nVictor Rogers\nInstitute Communications\nEmail\nvictor.rogers@comm.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
