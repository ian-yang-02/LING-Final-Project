The video will serve as an instructional tool for procurement technical assistance centers (PTACS) across the country. GTPAC is scheduling a series of briefings for its clients statewide and is sharing the complete training package with all PTACs nationwide.\nAccompanying the video is a 127-page template GTPAC developed for contractors to use to create a security assessment report, a system security plan, and a plan of action for those cybersecurity requirements.\nThe video and template were funded through a cooperative agreement with the Defense Logistics Agency, and created with the support of the Georgia Institute of Technology.\nGTPAC presented an idea for a multimedia training package to the DoD for its Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) clause 252.204-7012. This clause, revised in 2016 and which the DoD is including in many of its contracts, mandates that contractors implement adequate security on all applicable contractor information systems and investigate and report on any compromises to those systems.\nSpecifically, the DFARS clause requires that contractors:\nIsolate malicious software.\nPreserve and protect all media involved in a cyber incident.\nProvide DoD with access to information or equipment for purposes of forensic analysis.\nAssess damage as a result of a cyber incident.\n\u201cFlow down\u201d the clause in any subcontracts involving information covered by the requirements.\nTo meet the government\u2019s cybersecurity standards, contractors must assess their information systems, develop a security plan, and create an action plan.\u00a0GTPAC\u2019s template\u00a0\u2014 available for download as a Word document on the same webpage where the video appears (gtpac.org/cybersecurity-training-video) \u2014 provides a step-by-step process by which each of these tasks can be completed and documentation can be compiled.\n\u201cUnderstanding and incorporating these cybersecurity regulations are critical for DoD contractors. That\u2019s especially so for small businesses, both primary contractors and subcontractors,\u201d said Joe Beaulieu, GTPAC\u2019s program manager.\n\u201cWhile numerous briefings have been held in recent months about the requirements, there had not been a comprehensive briefing package to help contractors understand the new regulations,\u201d he noted. \u201cOur multimedia training package for GTPAC and procurement assistance center clients across the country comprehensively addresses the requirements and presents a practical, solutions-based approach to the challenge to small businesses that the requirements represent.\u201d\nGeorgia contractors seeking assistance in complying with DoD\u2019s cybersecurity requirements are encouraged to contact a GTPAC procurement counselor.\u00a0A list of counselors, their locations, and contact information can be found at\u00a0 gtpac.org/team-directory .\nCompanies located outside of Georgia may contact their nearest procurement technical assistance center for assistance.\u00a0PTACs are located in all 50 states, Washington, D.C., and the U.S. territories of Guam and Puerto Rico.\u00a0For a directory of PTACs, please visit\u00a0 aptac-us.org/find-a-ptac .\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nGeorgia Tech Procurement Assistance Center\nGTPAC Cybersecurity Training Video\nContact\nFor inquiries about the Georgia Tech Procurement Assistance Center, contact:\nP\u00e9ralte C.
