This\u00a0spring\u00a0Georgia Tech\u00a0Housing\u00a0and\u00a0Residence Life is\u00a0launching\u00a0a new program to\u00a0help\u00a0combat\u00a0needless\u00a0dumpstering\u00a0to\u00a0ensure that no reusable item\u00a0\u2014\u00a0or the\u00a0opportunity\u00a0to find new life for\u00a0it\u00a0\u2014\u00a0goes\u00a0to waste.\nThe Green Goodbyes program will make it easier for students to donate items like clothing and household goods rather than\u00a0throw\u00a0them\u00a0away. The impact of this\u00a0effort\u00a0will be measured not just in waste diverted from landfills, but\u00a0also\u00a0in\u00a0the number\u00a0of students who will\u00a0benefit\u00a0from\u00a0donated items in\u00a0the\u00a0future.\u00a0To\u00a0highlight\u00a0the potential value of this sustainability effort,\u00a0two of the program founders sat down\u00a0to discuss their views on how Green Goodbyes will amplify Georgia Tech\u2019s impact.\n---\nSteve Fazenbaker\u00a0is\u00a0the\u00a0director of the STAR\u00a0(Students\u2019 Temporary Assistance and Resources)\u00a0program, which\u00a0secures\u00a0resources for\u00a0students\u00a0who\u00a0are\u00a0in\u00a0need.\nThiago Esslinger\u00a0is\u00a0a\u00a0third-year\u00a0undergraduate\u00a0student (BioChem/EAS).\u00a0He\u00a0currently works\u00a0as the residential sustainability engagement assistant with Housing\u00a0and\u00a0Residence Life,\u00a0where\u00a0he\u00a0leads\u00a0the\u00a0EcoReps\u00a0sustainability\u00a0ambassadors\u00a0program.\nSteve\u00a0Fazenbaker: \u00a0What got you interested in the Green Goodbyes program?\nThiago\u00a0Esslinger: \u00a0I got involved through my job with Housing,\u00a0and it\u2019s\u00a0one of those things I am passionate about.\u00a0\u00a0I feel like we have this generic mindset that trash and waste need to be discarded in a linear fashion. That is the mindset I want to help change, and I think with our Green Goodbyes move-out program\u00a0we can\u00a0provide alternatives to on-campus residents\u2019 end-of-semester waste. For some, this will be a\u00a0new\u00a0opportunity to divert their dorm waste, and for all, this is an opportunity to increase their personal awareness of\u00a0the life cycle of purchased goods. Just because you\u2019ve thrown away your trash\u00a0doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s gone forever.\u00a0In fact, it usually\u00a0contributes to pollution elsewhere.\nSF:\u00a0\u00a0One of the biggest things\u00a0that motivated\u00a0this program was people throwing away things like microwaves and refrigerators because,\u00a0apparently,\u00a0it's\u00a0cheaper to throw your refrigerator in a dumpster in the\u00a0spring and buy another one in the\u00a0fall than it is to ship it home or store it somewhere. And that is true waste.\u00a0\u00a0So, if we\u00a0can\u00a0recover those things, they can still be used. That is far better than putting it in a landfill and then making another one.\nTE: And I think that is something\u00a0I have seen grow in terms of awareness: the sustainability-mindedness of students. Yet, I don't know if that's just because I've become more involved in this space or if there really is a general\u00a0attitude shift.\u00a0I'm\u00a0curious to hear how it was when you were a student\u00a0at Georgia Tech.\nSF: Yes,\u00a0back in the 1980s.\u00a0\u00a0It\u00a0was\u00a0a\u00a0very\u00a0different\u00a0time.\nTE:\u00a0Was there a move-out program then and,\u00a0if so, how was it different?\nSF:\u00a0There was nothing like this back then.\u00a0Everybody just packed\u00a0their\u00a0stuff up and took it home and\u00a0that was it.\nTE:\u00a0During your time at Tech, how did this program get started and how have you seen it grow? And how do you see\u00a0it continuing to\u00a0grow?\nSF:\u00a0I see this program as\u00a0another manifestation\u00a0of\u00a0this idea\u00a0that everything\u00a0you need to succeed at Georgia Tech is somewhere at Georgia Tech. I also work with\u00a0Klemis\u00a0Kitchen, the food pantry on campus, and many students will come to me and say, \u201cI've got enough food to get through\u00a011 out of 14 days.\u00a0I get paid every two weeks and I can make it about 11 days,\u00a0so I'm not really sure that I qualify for this program.\u201d But my response is always that it is better for the student to take food that's going to end up in the landfill\u00a0than\u00a0to let it go into the landfill. And a lot of the food that we have in\u00a0Klemis\u00a0Kitchen is food that's recovered from the dining halls.\nI think we need to build that mindset into our society and into the way we function because\u00a0there seems to be a belief that\u00a0if it's repurposed\u00a0it's not as good as something\u00a0new,\u00a0and that\u2019s just not true. I mean, this stuff is here,\u00a0and\u00a0it\u00a0is available,\u00a0and there's no reason for anybody to go without.\u00a0And\u00a0there's no reason to be filling the landfills\u00a0with it. I think the two things work together,\u00a0and that's\u00a0what\u00a0excites\u00a0me about this\u00a0program. It ties into that\u00a0mindset that there are more than enough resources available for everybody to get everything they need at Georgia Tech.\nTE:\u00a0I\u00a0admire\u00a0your vision\u00a0of\u00a0what Georgia Tech has to offer,\u00a0and this approach of providing for our students while diverting from the landfill. What excites me about this program\u00a0is the idea that\u00a0it\u00a0is going to be associated with the fall rummage sale and students today can give to students tomorrow. It circles back to the idea you were discussing of repurposing items.\nSF:\u00a0When we started working on this\u00a0in\u00a0Fall\u00a02019, my little quip was\u00a0it's not a flea market. It's a free market because we're not allowed to sell.\nTE:\u00a0\u00a0In addition, we need to make sure our work encompasses and fulfills all\u00a0three pillars of sustainability\u00a0(environmental, economic, and social). Even when you think about Georgia Tech's recent endorsement of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and what those are, one of them is\u00a0\u201czero hunger.\u201d\u00a0I think it\u2019s pretty encouraging to see that we are making those changes on\u00a0campus,\u00a0and I really do hope\u00a0more\u00a0students can see that sustainability includes environmental action, but it is also so much\u00a0more.\u00a0You\u00a0can still support the environment by supporting people, and I feel like that's the part that's not talked about a lot.\nSF:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We set a bar as to how much it costs to go to college, for example. And if your financial resources are under that bar then you fall into this \u201clow-income\u201d category. But\u00a0that\u00a0cost\u00a0assumes brand new clothes, brand new refrigerator, and\u00a0brand\u00a0new\u00a0microwave. If we start looking at stuff that we can re purpose and share, then the\u00a0bar\u00a0actually drops, so the definition of \u201clow income\u201d gets massaged a little bit.\nA\u00a0perfect example of that is the Campus Closet.\u00a0When the\u00a0project started, it was to help low-income students have professional attire to wear to interviews and career fairs.\u00a0As the closet became populated with professional attire, soon we had enough that every student at Georgia Tech is able to borrow out of there and return it. You don't have to be \u201clow income.\u201d\u00a0There are\u00a0more than enough resources in the Campus Closet to serve every single student on campus.\u00a0It has nothing to do with being classified in any kind of socioeconomic status. There are some students\u00a0who\u00a0showed up at Georgia Tech and never had to wear a suit before and so it\u00a0wasn't on\u00a0their\u00a0list of things to bring to school. Campus Closet is a perfect\u00a0micro example of this idea of resources being available to everybody in the\u00a0community.\nTE:\u00a0One thing\u00a0I have noticed\u00a0about\u00a0initiatives\u2014\u00a0like our\u00a0Green Goodbyes move-out program, for example\u00a0\u2014is that one of the hardest parts is getting the message out and getting people to listen to it.\u00a0How have you seen engagement evolve, especially during the pandemic?\nSF:\u00a0I have noticed\u00a0that the best approach to getting folks to buy in is offering\u00a0them\u00a0a chance to be helpful. When I first moved into this role, I would talk about resources for under-resourced students. That was the main message. Nine times out of\u00a010, students\u2019 eyes glaze over, and they\u2019d say,\u00a0\u201cI'm not under-resourced, I'm never going to be under-resourced,\u00a0so I don't need to know anything about this.\u201d\u00a0Then we shifted our marketing to, \u201cYou may not need it. You may never need it, but you're going to meet somebody who does,\u00a0and we need you to know this so that when you meet the person who needs it, you are able to point them in the right direction.\u201d And that led to\u00a0students\u00a0asking to volunteer,\u00a0which has\u00a0moved us into our current program.\u00a0I'm really looking forward to being back in person in the\u00a0fall\u00a0so\u00a0we can really develop that aspect of it.\nWe're not divided into the helpers and the helped, but we are all helping. We're all working together to take care of ourselves, and we're working to take care of the community.\u00a0\u00a0The resources are there to get us through those times when we need a little bit beyond what's in our personal wheelhouse, but the goal is to get back into our wheelhouse and to start helping the other folks when they need\u00a0a\u00a0hand.\u00a0That's\u00a0how we move forward together.\nTE:\u00a0I love the part\u00a0about helpers versus those being helped. Specifically, I think\u00a0that's something I can relate to in environmentalism. I often don't like calling people or being called an environmentalist because I think it puts us in a box and gives the impression that you either act for the environment or you can't do anything, and that\u2019s just not true. We need to let people know that they can still\u00a0take some actions here and there, and if everyone had imperfect environmentalism, so much change could happen.\u00a0That\u2019s something that is not often recognized or appreciated.\nWith the\u00a0Green Goodbyes program, I think about the residents who may donate\u00a0half\u00a0of their items and the residents who may donate everything, in addition to the residents who see this program and aren\u2019t sure if they can participate in it. Our outreach, however, not only helps\u00a0get the word out for the program and let people know that we want everyone\u2019s help, but hopefully also contributes to the growing environmental awareness of our residents.\u00a0Labels can sometimes be limiting, and these programs are meant for everyone! It is just so heartwarming to know that our donations not only divert waste, but also provide for others.\n-----------------\nItems donated through Green Goodbyes will be available to students during Fall Week of Welcome activities\u00a0\u2013\u00a0look for information about the\u00a0Green Good \u201cBuys\u201d No-Cost Market\u00a0later this summer.\nMore information and opportunities to volunteer for\u00a0the Green Goodbyes\u00a0move-out\u00a0program\u00a0are\u00a0available on the\u00a0 Housing Sustainability page .\u00a0Information about Georgia Tech\u2019s programs that support students in need is available at\u00a0on the\u00a0 STAR Services page .\nAdditional Images\nContact\nMalte Weiland malte.weiland@aux.gatech.edu\nEmail\nmalte.weiland@aux.gatech.edu\nAdditional information\nDrop locations will be available from May 3\u20139.
