Jani, a Ph.D. candidate in Georgia Tech\u2019s School of Physics, computes complex equations to determine the distance to which LIGO detectors are sensitive enough to observe black hole collisions. LIGO, or the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO), is a global network working to detect gravitational waves, and confirmed their first-ever detected wave earlier this year. A black hole collision is believed to have sparked that first-detected wave. Jani has also been actively working to expand the LIGO project to his home country of India, and that\u2019s why Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi asked to meet with him in Washington, D.C. \u201cHe mentioned in the meeting that he reads my tweets,\u201d Jani says with a smile. The future astrophysicist takes to Twitter often to talk about his research and the LIGO Project. Prior to the discovery, he\u2019d been calculating the possibilities of gravitational waves for nine years. He was contacted by the Indian Embassy after the Indian government fast-tracked a plan to build LIGO\u2019s third observatory in their nation, the first outside the U.S. \u201cThis will be exactly identical to what LIGO has in Washington state and Louisiana,\u201d Jani explains. Jani says Prime Minister Modi was visibly excited about the opportunity for expanding scientific collaboration between the U.S. and India. \u201cA leader of a nation with a billion things to think about, the fact that he made time to understand science as complicated as LIGO and gravitational waves is just so cool,\u201d Jani says. What\u2019s also cool? Snapping a selfie with the leader of the world\u2019s second most populous country. \u201cI didn\u2019t even think they\u2019d let me have my phone,\u201d Jani says. When he asked the prime minister to take a photographic memento of the meeting, he was more than surprised by the response. \u201cHe was so happy, he was like \u2018Oh yeah! Sure!\u2019\u201d Jani says the prime minister even suggested they step into good lighting so the picture would turn out better. Jani admits meeting his nation\u2019s prime minister prompted a flood of emotions. \u201cI never even saw a telescope until I was a second year in college,\u201d he admits. \u201cNow I\u2019ve been a part of one of the greatest scientific discoveries of our century, and now it\u2019s coming to my country. It\u2019s very humbling.\u201d Jani also laughs about how poignant Georgia Tech\u2019s new Einstein statue is in light of the discovery, and this week\u2019s news of LIGO expanding to India. Einstein originally proposed the idea of gravitational waves one hundred years ago. \u201cI think this is Einstein\u2019s legacy. The world\u2019s two largest democracies keeping science and technology at the forefront, and how important it is to fund fundamental science,\" Jani says. Albert Einstein would be happy, Jani says.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nSteven Norris Social Media Manager\nEmail\nsnorris@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
