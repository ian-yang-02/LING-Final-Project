But 20 percent of them, give or take, will find that they need different options because their tumors are resistant to radiation therapy. It\u2019s a bad place to be: They may still face the potential side effects without the therapeutic benefit, and they\u2019ve lost precious time.\nWhat if clinicians had a way to predict and possibly improve radiosensitivity for individual patients? A team of researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology and Emory University is working on something with that ultimate goal in mind.\n\u201cThere still isn\u2019t a great understanding of why some tumors don\u2019t respond well to radiation, and it\u2019s a significant hurdle to the long-term survival of many patients,\u201d noted\nJoshua Lewis , who sought answers to the radiation resistance question while a graduate student in the lab of\nMelissa Kemp\nin the Wallace H. Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering.\nTogether, they\u2019ve taken steps to begin to understand the underlying metabolism and build a tool to predict whether specific tumors will be one of the stubborn ones that doesn\u2019t respond. In back-to-back papers, with Lewis as lead author, Kemp said they created a new pipeline, \u201cin which you can automatically take data, plug it into our whole cell modeling of metabolism, and actually predict the way certain tumors of various cancer types, from various patients, are going to respond.\u201d\nShe added: \u201cThis is the first example of really asking, with respect to radiation resistance, why there are differences that manifest themselves in tumor metabolism.\u201d\nIn January, they published the first study with collaborators from Wake Forest and Indiana University in the journal\nCell Systems .\nThe newest research appears this month in\nNature Communications .\nLewis based the studies on his Ph.D. thesis, \u201cGenome-Scale Modeling of Redox Metabolism and Therapeutic Response in Radiation-Resistant Tumors,\u201d which he defended a year ago.\nShortly after Lewis began grad school, Wake Forest researcher Cristina Furdui approached the Kemp lab with the radiation resistance problem, \u201casking us to apply our expertise in systems biology,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a more holistic approach than working with individual molecules or proteins, taking into account many different factors and their interactions, seeing if that leads to a particular response to radiation therapy.\u201d\nLewis used a well-established type of cellular modeling called \u201cflux balance analysis,\u201d in which, \u201cyou try to model the entire metabolism of a cell \u2014 all the different chemical reactions. We model them using different biochemical equations.\u201d The researchers then plug those equations into a computer. Within seconds, they can accurately analyze about 13,000 different metabolic reactions.\n\u201cWe came up with our own approach for making more accurate flux balance analysis models by integrating multiple different types of omics data,\u201d said Lewis, now pursuing his medical degree in the Emory MD/PhDProgram. \u201cOmics\u201d measure characteristics of molecules like genes, proteins, or metabolites, which comprise the cells of an organism.\nBy integrating genomics, transcriptomics, and metabolomics data, the researchers could model redox metabolism \u2013 the process of oxidation and reduction reactions, or the loss and gain of electrons \u2013 in cancer cells, \u201cand use that to accurately predict how certain tumors react to radiation therapy,\u201d said Lewis, who mined data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).\n\u201cWe looked for metabolic enzymes or metabolic targets where, if you tweaked them, it could affect a tumor\u2019s radiosensitivity,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cSo, imagine if you\u2019re giving a patient radiation therapy, and you could also give them a chemotherapeutic at the same time that inhibits the action of a particular enzyme to make a tumor more sensitive to radiation.\u201d\nThat is, essentially, the first paper. In the second \u2014 written only by Lewis and Kemp \u2014 the researchers integrated machine learning with genome-scale metabolic modeling, \u201cto see if we can better predict what sort of biological features are associated with a patient\u2019s response to radiation.\u201d\nOne main challenge for the researchers in either paper, Lewis said, was in the datasets they used from TCGA. They had good genomics and transcriptomics data, but their metabolomics data was incomplete. The computational models they developed for the\nCell Systems\npaper helped fill in the blanks, making metabolomic predictions. They fed the data from those models into a machine learning model to better identify biomarkers of radiation resistance.\n\u201cWe can think clinically of a patient giving a blood sample, and from that blood you\u2019re able to measure the levels of different metabolites and determine if the patient would be a good candidate for radiation therapy, or whether we should go ahead and think of other therapies,\u201d Lewis said.\nThat speaks directly to what Lewis is training for now in his M.D. program. He wants to be a pathologist and better understand how patients respond to different therapies.\n\u201cI\u2019d like to help bridge the gap between research and the clinic,\u201d he said.\nHe\u2019s off to a good start, and it\u2019s exciting for Kemp.\n\u201cJosh\u2019s computational platform turns easy-to-acquire data into a model representation of hard-to-acquire attributes, like metabolic fluxes and metabolite changes, that are otherwise very challenging to measure with the scale it takes to cover many different patients,\u201d she said.\nThis research was supported by a National Institutes of Health/National Cancer Institute fellowship (F30 CA224968), an NIH/NCI U01 grant (CA215848), and the Wake Forest Baptist Comprehensive Cancer Center (NIH/NCI P30 CA12197).\nCITATIONS:\nJoshua Lewis, Tom E.
