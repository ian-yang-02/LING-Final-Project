James \u201cSandy\u201d Winnefeld, a Georgia Tech alumnus and distinguished professor of the practice in the\nSam Nunn School of International Affairs , to serve as chair of the President\u2019s Intelligence Advisory Board.\nThe board provides the president with \u201can independent source of advice on the effectiveness with which the Intelligence Community is meeting the nation\u2019s intelligence needs and the vigor and insight with which the community plans for the future,\u201d according to the White House.\n\u201cThe United States has the best intelligence capability in the world, as Georgia Tech students recently heard from CIA Director Bill Burns during his recent visit to campus,\u201d Winnefeld said. \u201cI\u2019m honored to have the opportunity to help make it even better as a member of the President\u2019s Intelligence Advisory Board. This opportunity also speaks to the subtle reach of Georgia Tech\u2019s Sam Nunn School of International Affairs.\u201d\nWinnefeld will retain his position as a distinguished professor of the practice while serving on the advisory board.\n\u201cI am thrilled to see a member of the Nunn School community recognized with such a prestigious appointment in the Executive Office of the President,\u201d said Adam Stulberg, Sam Nunn Professor and chair of the Nunn School. \u201cAdm. Winnefeld\u2019s work reflects our School\u2019s commitment to emphasizing the practical applications of international affairs, and I have no doubt that he will advise President Biden well.\u201d\nWinnefeld\nwill chair a group of other high-profile intelligence experts, including Janet Napolitano, former secretary of homeland security and governor of Arizona; Richard Verma, former U.S. ambassador to India; and Gilman Louie, founder of CIA venture capital firm In-Q-Tel.\nWinnefeld graduated from Georgia Tech with a degree in aerospace engineering in 1978 and served for 37 years in the United States Navy. He flew the F-14 Tomcat, instructed at the Navy Fighter Weapons School, also known as TOPGUN, and served as senior aide-de-camp to Gen. Colin L. Powell.\nHe later commanded a fighter squadron, the amphibious ship USS Cleveland, the aircraft carrier USS Enterprise, and the USS Theodore Roosevelt Carrier Strike Group. He then commanded NATO Joint Command Lisbon, Striking and Support Forces NATO, the United States Sixth Fleet, United States Northern Command, and the North American Aerospace Defense Command.\nHe retired in 2015 after four years as the ninth vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the nation\u2019s number two ranking military officer.\nWinnefeld joins past military and diplomatic luminaries such as Clark Clifford, Gen. Maxwell Taylor, Adm. Bobby R. Inman, Les Aspin, and Brent Scowcroft in chairing the panel, which was established by President Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1956.\nWinnefeld is the second Nunn School professor of the practice to take a significant role in the intelligence community under President Biden.\nIn 2021, Biden selected Elizabeth Sherwood-Randall to\nserve\nas the White House homeland security advisor. Sherwood-Randall previously was Biden\u2019s chief foreign affairs advisor during the president\u2019s time in the Senate, and held senior positions in the Clinton and Obama Administrations, including stints at the Pentagon, the National Security Council, the White House, and the Department of Energy.\nThe Sam Nunn School of International Affairs is a unit of the Ivan Allen College of Liberal Arts.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nMichael Pearson michael.pearson@iac.gatech.edu\nEmail\nmichael.pearson@iac.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
