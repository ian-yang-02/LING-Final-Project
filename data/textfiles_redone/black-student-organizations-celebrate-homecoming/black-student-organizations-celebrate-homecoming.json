Some of these focus on Homecoming week, such as the annual Step Show and the Black Alumni Organization (BAO) Tailgate. These events empower and build community while also celebrating Homecoming on Georgia Tech\u2019s campus.\n\u201cThe traditions create a safe space at Tech, because seeing others who look similar makes you feel comfortable,\u201d said Kemuel Russell, president of the African American Student Union. The many Black student organizations all contribute to Homecoming week events, bringing everyone together.\nOn Thursday, Oct. 6, the National Pan-Hellenic Council (NPHC) will host\nStep Show\nat the Ferst Center for the Arts. Step is a form of percussive dance in which rhythms are produced through steps, claps, and words. Step Show will take place from 7 to 10 p.m., and tickets are $10 for students, faculty, and staff and $15 for the general public.\nThe\nBlack Alumni Organization Tailgate\nbegins at 2 p.m. Saturday, Oct. 8. This is part of a weekend of events put on by BAO, including a reception Friday and a brunch Sunday celebrating women of color. The tailgate is a great way to meet other students, as well as alumni who will be on campus for the Homecoming game.\n\u201cThe tailgate gave me an opportunity to connect with Black student organizations and uplift the community,\u201d Russell said. The tailgate takes place in Harrison Square near the statues of the Three Pioneers, celebrating the history of Black students at Tech. This event is a way for many students to find a community they may not usually see in their classes or usual clubs.\n\u201cAfter the tailgate, I wanted to be an advocate for the Black community and spread it to all of campus,\u201d said Russell. Many more traditions follow throughout the year, but Homecoming serves as a beginning for many students. These traditions continue to write the history of Tech and reflect the vibrancy of the campus community.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nConnor White\nInstitute Communications\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
