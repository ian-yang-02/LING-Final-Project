The research, reported September 11 in the journal\nScientific Reports , may help improve the prediction of rogue waves to help shipping companies and others understand the risks posed by these unusual wave patterns.\nThe container ship\nEl Faro\nwas bound for Puerto Rico from Jacksonville, Florida ahead of Hurricane Joaquin when it sank east of the Bahamas, taking the lives of 33 crew members. The rogue wave study was done for the National Transportation Safety Board as part of its investigation into the disaster.\n\u201cHurricanes produce very extreme conditions with strong winds, so you have very energetic sea states that can increase the probability of these events,\u201d said\nFrancesco Fedele , an associate professor in the Georgia Tech\nSchool of Civil and Environmental Engineering . \u201cWe believe this first study of rogue waves occurring over space and time during hurricanes will help improve real-time forecasting for shipping companies and other organizations that need to understand the risk of extreme events in the oceans.\u201d\nRogue ocean waves can develop seemingly out of nowhere to sink ships and overwhelm oil platforms with walls of water as much as 25 meters high. The waves stem from a combination of constructive interference \u2013 a known wave phenomenon \u2013 and nonlinear effects specific to the complex dynamics of ocean waves. The waves have been observed in oceans around the world, typically lasting only 20 seconds or so before disappearing. They are different from tsunami waves that can travel great distances after being created by underwater earthquakes or landslides.\nFedele and his colleagues have studied rogue waves for several years, and in 2016 used advanced mathematical techniques to develop a new understanding of how the waves form. After the\nEl Faro\nsinking, Fedele was asked to evaluate the probability that a rogue wave could have occurred during the hurricane when the ship sank while drifting in violent seas after losing engine power.\nKey to the new prediction technique is accounting for space-time effects that can increase the likelihood of a ship encountering a rogue wave.\nFedele compared this space-time analysis to the efforts of surfers to find a large wave to ride. Surfers increase their probability of finding an unusually large wave by paddling around area of smaller waves near a beach. If they remain in one place, they would ultimately come across such a wave, but that could take much longer.\nThe theoretical model developed by Fedele takes into account the size of the vessel, which also boosts the chances of encountering such a wave. The\nEl Faro\nwas 240 meters long, comparable to the typical wavelength of a rogue wave. Earlier rogue wave models had not considered the size of the vessel in calculating the probability of encountering a potentially catastrophic wave.\n\u201cA ship moving along a navigation route covers more space-time area, increasing the probability that it would encounter a large wave,\u201d Fedele said. \u201cWe simulated the ocean state at the time of the sinking, and to that we added predictions of the ocean conditions. We did wave simulations based on those to understand the kind of conditions the ship encountered.\u201d\nData and simulations of weather and sea conditions were provided by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The researchers studied the chances of the ship encountering a wave 14 meters high \u2013 about 46 feet. That measurement included only the height above the average level of the sea and did not consider the depth of the wave trough.\nIn future work, the researchers would like to improve the accuracy of their predictions to enhance the rogue wave prediction algorithms used by NOAA.\n\u201cThe space-time model developed for this study could provide the basis for the next generation of wave forecast models to predict wave extremes and provide early warnings to shipping companies and others to help them avoid dangerous areas at risk of rogue waves,\u201d Fedele said.\nIn addition to Fedele, the paper\u2019s co-authors include Claudio Lugni from the CNR-INSEAN & Marine Technology Center of the Italian Research Council, and Arun Chawla of NOAA\u2019s National Center for Weather & Climate prediction, Marine Modeling & Analysis Branch.\nCITATION : Francesco Fedele, Claudio Lugni and Arun Chawla, \u201cThe sinking of the\nEl Faro : predicting real world rogue waves during Hurricane Joaquin,\u201d (Scientific Reports, 2017).\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-11505-5#Sec10\nResearch News\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\n177 North Avenue\nAtlanta, Georgia\u00a0 30332-0181\u00a0 USA\nMedia Relations Contacts : John Toon (404-894-6986) (jtoon@gatech.edu) or Ben Brumfield (404-660-1408) (ben.brumfield@comm.gatech.edu).\nWriter : John Toon\nAdditional Images\nContact\nJohn Toon\nResearch News\n(404) 894-6986\nEmail\njtoon@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
