Wayne Clough Georgia Tech Promise Program\nto include even more students with financial need.\nUnder the new program guidelines, Tech Promise will now assist qualified families whose annual estimated family income is $55,500 or less.\nThanks to this expansion, more Georgia students than ever before will be able to graduate debt-free from Georgia Tech.\n\u201cFor more than 15 years, Tech Promise has helped some of Georgia\u2019s brightest talent overcome financial constraints so they can pursue their dreams and create multigenerational change for their families and communities,\u201d said President \u00c1ngel Cabrera. \u201cWe\u2019re proud of this program and excited about its expansion, which will create untold opportunities for even more of our state\u2019s best students.\u201d\nTech Promise is the first program of its kind provided by a public university in Georgia. It offers the possibility of a debt-free degree to hundreds of talented and ambitious students who, without financial assistance, would likely not be able to achieve the dream of graduating from Georgia Tech.\n\u201cWe are very pleased that the expanded Tech Promise program will allow us to serve more of our state\u2019s outstanding students by removing financial barriers,\u201d said Steve McLaughlin, provost and executive vice president for Academic Affairs. \u201cWe also know there is more work to be done here. Our\nTransforming Tomorrow fundraising campaign\nwill give us incredible opportunities to continue expanding access to students from all backgrounds and walks of life.\u201d\nSince 2007, more than 1,000 students from 103 Georgia counties have benefited from Tech Promise. The program fills a gap in the financial aid support system by picking up where other scholarships and financial aid options leave off, covering a student\u2019s full cost of attendance.\n\u201cFrom its inception, the Promise program has demonstrated Georgia Tech's commitment to removing the financial barrier to earning a bachelor's degree. Today, with this expansion of the Promise program, limited-income families can see that Tech's commitment to these talented Georgia students is stronger than ever,\u201d said Paul Kohn, vice provost for Enrollment Management.\nRick Clark, associate vice provost of Enrollment Management, echoed Kohn\u2019s sentiments about the Institute\u2019s responsibility to Georgia:\n\u201cAs a public university, our goal is to serve our state by expanding access to Georgia's most talented students by providing an affordable world-class education, regardless of economic background. Increasing our investment in Tech Promise is a reflection of that commitment,\u201d Clark said.\nTech has a well-established tradition of providing access to financially disadvantaged students, beginning first with low tuition and fee charges, coupled with available scholarships, student loans, and the nation's largest voluntary co-op program. Because of these programs, Georgia Tech has opened the doors of opportunity for many students including first-generation college graduates.\nToday's students, tomorrow's leaders.\nYou can help even more students benefit from programs such as Tech Promise. Philanthropic support for scholarships and fellowships makes it possible for Georgia Tech to recruit the brightest, most talented students from around our state and around the world.\nSupport students today.\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nAbout Tech Promise\nMeet Tech Promise Scholars\n2022 Tech Promise Information (pdf)\nContact\nBecky Tankersley\nEnrollment Management\nAdditional information\nMeet the Scholars\nTech Promise touches the lives of hundreds of Georgia students each year, helping them achieve the dream of a Georgia Tech education without the burden of debt.
