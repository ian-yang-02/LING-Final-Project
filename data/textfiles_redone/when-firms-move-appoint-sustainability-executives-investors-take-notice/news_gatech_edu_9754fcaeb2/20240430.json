(Getty Images, not for republication)\nFeb 25, 2020\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nIn the past two decades, executives responsible for corporate sustainability (CSEs) have been showing up in a growing number of C-suites across the globe.\nThese executives are charged with implementing business practices that reduce a corporation\u2019s negative impact on the environment and society while promoting initiatives that have a positive effect.\nWhile efforts to rein in unsustainable practices may in some cases lead to cost savings or other efficiencies, it turns out that investors have mixed reactions to the appointments of CSEs.\nIn a study published in December in the\nJournal of Operations Management , researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology and University of Massachusetts Amherst found that in some situations, CSE appointments had a positive impact on stock prices. In other cases, it was less positive.\n\u201cOne of the biggest questions we had was whether the strategy of appointing CSEs is valued by investors,\u201d said\nRavi Subramanian , associate professor in Georgia Tech\u2019s\nScheller College of Business . \u201cWhat we have found is that, in certain scenarios, there\u2019s support for this strategy.\u201d\nTo explore the question, the researchers identified 315 announcements of appointments of senior sustainability executives at U.S. corporations between 2000 and 2018 and subsequently narrowed that sample to 115 announcements that were not confounded by other events that could have affected stock prices.\n\u201cOn average, the hiring of CSEs has no discernable effect on stock prices,\u201d said\nVinod Singhal , Charles W. Brady Chair and professor in the Scheller College. \u201cHowever, we were able to identify certain scenarios where the data showed that such appointments could have a positive impact on stock prices.\u201d\nThe first was for firms that in the prior year had experienced an adverse sustainability-related incident. The second scenario was when the announcement included specific and focused job responsibilities for the hire.\n\u201cWhen a firm has an adverse sustainability-related incident, such as a chemical spill or an accident that results in death or significant property damage, it raises a clear question in investors\u2019 minds about whether the company has a commitment to sustainable practices and, importantly, whether that company can be expected to have greater financial liability in the future,\u201d said\nManpreet Hora , associate professor in the Scheller College. \u201cHiring a CSE signals that the company is taking that responsibility more seriously.\u201d\nFor the second scenario, when a firm\u2019s announcement of a CSE appointment has more specific details about that role\u2019s responsibilities, the researchers said it could help alleviate concerns that the move is simply \u201cgreenwashing.\u201d\n\u201cWhen firms are more specific about the role of the CSE appointee, it shows that they\u2019ve identified a clearer path to becoming more sustainable and it also helps reduce uncertainty among investors about some of the technical and managerial complexities involved with integrating sustainability objectives within the firms\u2019 operations,\u201d Subramanian said.\nMeanwhile, the researchers also found that in one situation \u2013 for firms in heavily fined industries \u2013 appointments of CSEs had a less positive impact on stock prices.\n\u201cWe suspect that for such industries, it\u2019s harder to convince investors that this type of appointment is going to make a real difference, even if it\u2019s well intentioned,\u201d Hora said.\nCITATION : Priyank Arora, Manpreet Hora, Vinod Singhal, and Ravi Subramanian, \u201cWhen Do Appointments of Corporate Sustainability Executives Affect Shareholder Value?\u201d ( Journal of Operations Management , Dec. 8, 2019).\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/joom.1074\nResearch News\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\n177 North Avenue\nAtlanta, Georgia\u00a0 30332-0181\u00a0 USA\nMedia Relations Contact : John Toon (404-894-6986) (jtoon@gatech.edu).\nWriter : Josh Brown\nAdditional Images\nContact\nJohn Toon\nResearch News\n(404) 894-6986\nEmail\njtoon@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
