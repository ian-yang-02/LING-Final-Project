Yes.\nConversations about race emerge from the shadows.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nEmail\nHughes-Troutman is director of the Center for Assessment, Referral, and Education (CARE).\nJun 30, 2020\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nGenerations of Black and African American parents have had \u201cthe race talk\u201d with their children. It\u2019s an uncomfortable but necessary conversation about how to behave in public, how to act around white people, and especially how to interact with the police. Outside of minority households, the subject of race has largely been considered taboo \u2014 or not considered at all. But, since the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on May 25, conversations about race are emerging from the shadows and taking many different forms.\n\u201cA lot of people would like to talk about race, racial inequality, and the impact of racism, but don\u2019t know where to start,\u201d said Tiffiny Hughes-Troutman, licensed psychologist and director of the\nCenter for Assessment, Referral, and Education (CARE)\nat Georgia Tech. \u201cSome worry that others won\u2019t understand their points of view or fear that what they say might be offensive to others. Also, individuals may be confused about how to be an ally and supporter and how to make an impact in a positive, meaningful way.\u201d\nThat\u2019s the position Steve McLaughlin found himself in until a few years ago. McLaughlin, dean and Southern Company Chair of the\nCollege of Engineering , said that he is like many white people when it comes to talking about race: cautious because he doesn\u2019t want to say the wrong thing.\n\u201cThere are your intentions, and then there\u2019s how it\u2019s received,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fear of saying the wrong thing is so strong. It\u2019s such a block to making a difference and to being able to work on the things you feel strongly about.\u201d\nMcLaughlin said that throughout his adult life he has considered himself an ally of groups that sometimes feel marginalized or misunderstood. He thought it was enough to see himself as nonracist. His thinking changed when the son he and his wife adopted from Guatemala as a baby entered his teen years.\n\u201cI started to see how the world treated him and processed him and, quite honestly,\ndidn\u2019t\nprocess him because they didn\u2019t\nsee\nhim. Or didn\u2019t want to see him,\u201d McLaughlin said. \u201cHe was raised as we would have raised any other child. Then all of a sudden the world starts to just process him differently. I became more attuned to some of the things that African Americans and Latinos experience \u2014 everyday microaggressions and racism. I became more passionate. And, I decided I need to speak up.\u201d\nMcLaughlin said he is still trying to find his voice in terms of race. He posts on social media about his journey, and he shared his experiences with Transformative Narratives, a digital story library curated by the\nOffice of Institute Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (IDEI) .\n\u201cI did it rather quietly at first,\u201d he said. \u201cI was the chair of the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, then came into this role as dean and realized I have a platform. I can pick the things I think are important to talk about, and this is one of them.\u201d\nWhere to Begin?\nWhen trying to start a conversation about race, Hughes-Troutman suggests starting small.\n\u201cThere is great potential in intergroup dialogue that leverages diversity and creates opportunity for connection among large groups,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I would suggest starting on an individual level and creating a safe space with friends, colleagues, or co-workers you genuinely care about and whose lives and experiences you are sincerely interested in learning about.\u201d\nStephanie Ray agrees.\n\u201cI want you to call me because you really care about me. Don\u2019t call just because you think you should join the conversation about race,\u201d said Ray, associate dean of students and director of\nStudent Diversity Programs\nin the\nDivision of Student Life .\nRay added that people should not expect their Black colleagues to be the only ones talking about or even leading the conversation. \u201cEveryone has a responsibility to do some heavy lifting,\u201d she said.\nMcLaughlin is determined to do his part.\n\u201cI have African American colleagues with whom I have close enough relationships to initiate the race talk and feel uninhibited in both directions,\u201d he said. \u201cI haven\u2019t had many, but a few, that I could really have a direct conversation about race and not feel worried. I want to get more and more comfortable talking about it.\u201d\nCurrent Climate and What\u2019s Next\nOngoing political protests against police brutality and systemic racism, combined with the anxiety of dealing with the Covid-19 pandemic, are having a significant impact on students, according to Hughes-Troutman.\n\u201cStudents share feelings of anger, frustration, sadness, and grief as they process these complex emotions and focus on other milestones, experiences, and events,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Covid-19 pandemic is incredibly stressful, and many students are grieving many losses \u2014 losses of lives through death, and the loss of their former lifestyle.\u201d\nEven when looking at the intersection of racism and Covid-19, Hughes-Troutman is optimistic because of the nature of the conversations taking place.\n\u201cI certainly hope it\u2019s a turning point,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is a time for racial healing, and these conversations are more important than ever. Dialogue, affirmation and connectedness, and a sense of purpose and agency are ways to move us forward.\u201d\nMcLaughlin wants to keep the conversation going, and make the most of it. He said the College of Engineering has been talking with student groups and will be collaborating with IDEI to prioritize what can be done within the College to improve the climate in a short time.\n\u201cThese moments seem to come and go, and people move on to something else,\u201d McLaughlin said. \u201cI\u2019m determined to not let this moment pass.\u201d\nRay suggests that applying Georgia Tech\u2019s spirit of \u201cWe can do that\u201d is the approach to take when addressing race-related issues.\n\u201cLook at all of the research Georgia Tech does. If we are willing to put in the hard work for STEM, we should be willing to work hard to improve the human condition \u2014 which is part of our new mission statement,\u201d Ray said. \u201cLet\u2019s put these great minds together to do the work needed, not only for Georgia Tech, but for the world.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nContact\nVictor Rogers\nInstitute Communications\nEmail\nvictor.rogers@comm.gatech.edu\nAdditional information\nSuggestions for Beginning the Race Talk , from Tiffiny Hughes-Troutman, licensed psychologist and director of the Center for Assessment, Referral, and Education (CARE):\nStart small. Create a safe space with friends, colleagues, or co-workers whom you genuinely care about and whose lives and experiences you are sincerely interested in learning about.\nAcknowledge the difficulty of the conversation and validate the other person\u2019s feelings, whether it\u2019s shock, sadness, anger, confusion or shared discomfort.\nOwn your motivation for the conversation, and identify the goals acknowledging that people are in different places when it comes to their understanding of racial justice issues. A basic goal may be to gain some sense of understanding.\nEngage in your own work to understand the privilege that shapes one\u2019s worldview and educate yourself on the things you need to personally learn and unlearn in order to be a better advocate.\nUnderstand one\u2019s racial and cultural identity by making the invisible visible. Become aware of your own values, biases, assumptions, and worldviews.\nAcknowledge and be open to admitting racial biases. Addressing one\u2019s own personal biases is more than an intellectual exercise of attending workshops and reading books. It comes from lived reality and experiences that require frequent interaction with people who differ from you with respect to race, culture, and ethnicity.\nDon\u2019t allow a difficult dialogue to brew in silence. Sometimes you reach an impasse or a deadlock. Although teachable moments sometimes take time, there\u2019s power in calling out an impasse and sitting in that discomfort.\nUnderstand differences in communication styles.\nValidate and express appreciation to those who speak when it\u2019s unsafe to do so. \u201cAs a psychologist, I often espouse the value of creating a safe space for race-based conversations but recognize that what constitutes a safe space for one group is different from what another group defines as safe,\u201d said Hughes-Troutman.\nTalking About Race:\nDo:\nListen more than you speak.\nHave empathy.\nAcknowledge other people\u2019s truths, even when you feel uncomfortable.\nDon\u2019t:\nMake the conversation about you.\nAssume that because you\u2019ve never experienced something, it doesn\u2019t exist.\nSuggest the person you are talking to is exaggerating.\nSympathize by saying you feel the same way. For example, do not remark, \u201cA similar thing happened to me, and I\u2019m afraid of the police, too.\u201d Comparing an isolated incident to systematic racism is trivializing even when it comes from a good place.\nChange the subject.\nRESOURCES:\nInstitute Diversity, Equity and Inclusion events:\nJuly 1-2: Community Healing Through Storytelling: Breaking Through the Armor of Our Hearts (Brave & Heartfelt Stories About Race by African Heritage and White Campus Colleagues)\nJuly 16, 11 a.m. to 12:30 p.m.:\n\u201cRace at Georgia Tech: A Call to Action\u201d \u2013 Open to the campus community, this is a panel discussion on the lived experiences of Black and non-Black faculty, students, and staff.
