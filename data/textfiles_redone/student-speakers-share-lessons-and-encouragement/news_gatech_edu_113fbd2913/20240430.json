The Ph.D. speaker is Chidinma Imediegwu in\nmechanical engineering . The Friday afternoon speaker is Tess Greene, a master\u2019s candidate in\ncomputer science . The Saturday morning speaker is\nKojo Bekoe-Sakyi, a bachelor\u2019s candidate in\naerospace engineering .\nAnd the Saturday afternoon speaker is Tepolak Seth, a master\u2019s candidate in\ncivil engineering .\nStudents must apply to become a reflection speaker. A panel of faculty, staff, and students selects a group of finalists who present a full version of their speech to the committee. The reflection speakers are required to work with Tech\u2019s\nCommunication Center\nin preparation for the ceremony.\nChidinma Imediegwu\nAuditioning to be the Ph.D. reflection speaker was exciting and a little complex for Chidinma Imediegwu because she was already two months into her new job as a consultant with Boston Consulting Group (BCG).\nAs a student she served as president of Georgia Tech\u2019s chapter of the Surface Mount Technology Association and was awarded the Charles Hutchins Grant for outstanding research and community leadership. She also worked as a graduate peer coach in the Career Center.\n\u201cI became interested in consulting after my involvement with the Georgia Tech Ph.D. Consulting Club. In this role, I led a pro bono project to develop a growth strategy for a nonprofit that empowers and provides business and legal support to minority women entrepreneurs,\u201d Imediegwu said.\nFor her reflection speech, she will look back at how far she and her classmates have come and encourage her classmates to continue to pursue their goals.\nImediegwu is Igbo, and her family is from Abia State, Nigeria, and she grew up in Lagos. \u201cMy sister, who is an emergency room physician, has been one of my biggest\u00a0supporters since my Ph.D. program began. And my parents have stood beside me prayerfully throughout my journey. I have made it this far solely by grace.\u201d\nShe will celebrate Commencement with 80 to 100 guests, including her parents, who are coming from Nigeria, and her siblings, cousins, and friends from around the world. Her sister, who is helping to plan the celebration, has hired an event coordinator, a DJ, and entertainment.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re Nigerian and you\u2019re having a party, you need to go all the way!\u201d Imediegwu laughed.\nTess Greene\nWhen Tess Greene received her undergraduate degree in May 2020, her graduation was at home because of the pandemic, and she missed out on having a big moment. So, this time, she went all out and applied to be the reflection speaker.\n\u201cI hoped I would be selected so my second graduation \u2014 and my first time walking \u2014 would be extra memorable. I have also been pushing myself to do more public speaking, and I couldn\u2019t ask for a more meaningful opportunity,\u201d she said.\nGreene will be speaking to an audience of her fellow master\u2019s candidates in computer science, bachelor\u2019s candidates in the Ivan Allen College of Liberal Arts, and bachelor\u2019s candidates in the College of Design.\n\u201cWhen I saw it was such a mixed group, I wanted to talk about connecting to those whose backgrounds, academic or otherwise, are very different from your own,\u201d she said. \u201cWe each depend on each other for different facets of our lives, and we can accomplish more working with those whose talents are unlike our own.\u201d\nGreene is from Xenia, Ohio and works at General Motors in Detroit. She plans to use her computer science degree to pivot from vehicle safety to cybersecurity. Her parents and her boyfriend will attend the ceremony, and they don\u2019t know she is the reflection speaker.\n\u201cI want to give a shoutout to my fellow online students,\u201d she said. \u201cWe only connected on class Slack channels and the occasional group project call, but they were always incredibly supportive and understanding. They created a wonderful learning culture.\u201d\nKojo Bekoe-Sakyi\nWhen Kojo Bekoe-Sakyi opened the program at last spring\u2019s Commencement ceremony, he was surprised to learn that two of his friends were reflection speakers. Hearing his friends speak inspired him to apply.\n\u201cI have always enjoyed the student speakers,\u201d he said. \u201cI remember my first-year Convocation speaker and how it was an inspiring and relatable part of the ceremony.\u201d In his reflection speech, he will talk about one of Georgia Tech\u2019s famous traditions and what it means to him.\nBekoe-Sakyi, an aerospace engineering major with a minor in industrial design, began looking at aerospace programs when he was in middle school. \u201cGeorgia Tech was among the top schools, so I always had Tech in mind.\u201d\nNext year, the Turlock, California native plans to apply to the master\u2019s program in industrial design. His dream job is to be an aircraft concept designer.\nHe will celebrate Commencement with his parents, siblings, Georgia Tech friends, and one of his high school teachers who encouraged him to apply to Tech.\n\u201cI am excited to have this moment with my class and to be able to thank the entire Georgia Tech community for the impact they have had on my life by helping me to become the person that my 5-year-old self dreamed about. It\u2019s very humbling.\u201d\nTepolak Seth\nTepolak Seth applied to be a reflection speaker because she has a good story to tell. She is an international student from Phnom Penh, Cambodia who came to the U.S. in 2015 and attended high school in Atlanta.\n\u201cI faced many challenges\n\u2014\nthe culture, the people, and the academic environment. I had to not only relearn how to learn, but I also had to adapt to the American high school experience without losing myself along the way. After graduating from high school, I had to do that all over again when I entered Tech,\u201d she said.\nAt times she felt like an imposter because she didn\u2019t think she was as smart as other students. Along the way, she met friends and professors who encouraged her.\n\u201cAll of these people told me, \u2018You got this.\u2019 My parents also believed in and supported me,\u201d she said. \u201cSo, I wanted my speech to show people that although we may sometimes feel like an imposter, that doesn\u2019t mean we are one. I am forever grateful for the people who believed in me.\u201d\nFamily and friends will join Seth to celebrate her big day. \u201cUnfortunately, my dad could not make it,\u201d she said. \u201cHowever, my mom will be there, along with my younger sister, my two aunts and uncles, and my little cousins. I believe some of my friends will also be watching the livestream. No pressure on me at all! But to be fair, I did do this to myself.\u201d\nIn February, she will move to the Bay Area to begin her job as a civil engineer with Tesla.\nRelated links\nFall Commencement Changes Include Moving to McCamish\nContact\nVictor Rogers\nInstitute Communications\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
