The\u00a0agency\u00a0works to address the agricultural issues affecting people\u2019s daily lives and the nation\u2019s future by partnering with other federal agencies, universities, and nonprofits. NIFA funds research and educational initiatives in order ensure the long-term viability of agriculture in the United States.\nAgriculture and forestry are serious business here in the state of Georgia.\u00a0According to the\u00a0University of Georgia\u2019s Center for Agribusiness and Economic Development, Georgia\u2019s forest industry accounts for a total economic contribution to the state of $17.7 billion and supports more than 73,300 jobs in Georgia.\u00a0Agriculture contributes approximately $73.3 billion annually to Georgia's economy and ranks No. 1 in the U.S. for broilers, hatching eggs, and peanuts. One in seven Georgians works in agriculture, forestry, or related fields. While Georgia Tech is not a land-grant university, Georgia Tech researchers work alongside\u00a0university partners across the state, merging engineering and technology expertise with partners in traditional agricultural sciences.\nCastille and her staff met with researchers at Georgia Tech\u2019s\u00a0 Renewable Bioproducts Institute (RBI) \u00a0along with GTRI\u2019s\u00a0 Agricultural Technology Research Program (ATRP) . RBI creates a competitive edge and insight into the future of forest products. Their professional scientists and engineers work together to provide information and offer solutions required by a rapidly changing market. GTRI\u2019s\u00a0 ATRP \u00a0is a state-funded research program meant to help Georgia\u2019s agriculture economy and poultry industry. ATRP drives transformational innovation, developing new methods and systems specifically designed for poultry, agribusiness, and food manufacturing applications. These innovations are created to maximize productivity and efficiency, advance safety and health, and minimize environmental impacts. Their goal is to transition technologies from concept to commercialization, as quickly and economically as possible.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nBlair\u00a0Meeks\nwmeeks7@gatech.edu\nAssistant Vice President External Communications\nEmail\nwmeeks7@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
