That\u2019s why the next generation of exploration rovers will need to be good at climbing hills covered with loose material and avoiding entrapment on soft granular surfaces.\nBuilt with wheeled appendages that can be lifted and wheels able to wiggle,\u00a0a new robot known as the \u201cMini Rover\u201d has developed and tested complex locomotion techniques robust enough to help it climb hills covered with such granular material \u2013 and avoid the risk of getting ignominiously stuck on some remote planet or moon.\nUsing a complex move the researchers dubbed \u201crear rotator pedaling,\u201d the robot can climb a slope by using its unique design to combine paddling, walking, and wheel spinning motions. The rover\u2019s behaviors were modeled using a branch of physics known as terradynamics.\n\u201cWhen loose materials flow, that can create problems for robots moving across it,\u201d said\nDan Goldman , the Dunn Family Professor in the\nSchool of Physics\nat the Georgia Institute of Technology. \u201cThis rover has enough degrees of freedom that it can get out of jams pretty effectively. By avalanching materials from the front wheels, it creates a localized fluid hill for the back wheels that is not as steep as the real slope. The rover is always self-generating and self-organizing a good hill for itself.\u201d\nThe research was reported on May 13 as the cover article in the journal\nScience Robotics . The work was supported by the NASA National Robotics Initiative and the Army Research Office.\nA robot built by NASA\u2019s Johnson Space Center pioneered the ability to spin its wheels, sweep the surface with those wheels and lift each of its wheeled appendages where necessary, creating a broad range of potential motions. Using in-house 3D printers, the Georgia Tech researchers collaborated with the Johnson Space Center to re-create those capabilities in a scaled-down vehicle with four wheeled appendages driven by 12 different motors.\n\u201cThe rover was developed with a modular mechatronic architecture, commercially available components, and a minimal number of parts,\u201d said Siddharth Shrivastava, an undergraduate student in Georgia Tech\u2019s\nGeorge W. Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering . \u201cThis enabled our team to use our robot as a robust laboratory tool and focus our efforts on exploring creative and interesting experiments without worrying about damaging the rover, service downtime, or hitting performance limitations.\u201d\nThe rover\u2019s broad range of movements gave the research team an opportunity to test many variations that were studied using granular drag force measurements and modified Resistive Force Theory. Shrivastava and School of Physics Ph.D. candidate Andras Karsai began with the gaits explored by the NASA RP15 robot, and were able to experiment with locomotion schemes that could not have been tested on a full-size rover.\nThe researchers also tested their experimental gaits on slopes designed to simulate planetary and lunar hills using a fluidized bed system known as SCATTER (Systematic Creation of Arbitrary Terrain and Testing of Exploratory Robots) that could be tilted to evaluate the role of controlling the granular substrate. Karsai and Shrivastava collaborated with Yasemin Ozkan-Aydin, a postdoctoral research fellow in Goldman\u2019s lab, to study the rover motion in the SCATTER test facility.\n\u201cBy creating a small robot with capabilities similar to the RP15 rover, we could test the principles of locomoting with various gaits in a controlled laboratory environment,\u201d Karsai said. \u201cIn our tests, we primarily varied the gait, the locomotion medium, and the slope the robot had to climb. We quickly iterated over many gait strategies and terrain conditions to examine the phenomena that emerged.\u201d\nIn the paper, the authors describe a gait that allowed the rover to climb a steep slope with the front wheels stirring up the granular material \u2013 poppy seeds for the lab testing \u2013 and pushing them back toward the rear wheels. The rear wheels wiggled from side-to-side, lifting and spinning to create a motion that resembles paddling in water. The material pushed to the back wheels effectively changed the slope the rear wheels had to climb, allowing the rover to make steady progress up a hill that might have stopped a simple wheeled robot.\nThe experiments provided a variation on earlier robophysics work in Goldman\u2019s group that involved moving with legs or flippers, which had emphasized disturbing the granular surfaces as little as possible to avoid getting the robot stuck.\n\u201cIn our previous studies of pure legged robots, modeled on animals, we had kind of figured out that the secret was to not make a mess,\u201d said Goldman. \u201cIf you end up making too much of a mess with most robots, you end up just paddling and digging into the granular material. If you want fast locomotion, we found that you should try to keep the material as solid as possible by tweaking the parameters of motion.\u201d\nBut simple motions had proved problematic for Mars rovers, which got stuck in granular materials. Goldman says the gait discovered by Shrivastava, Karsai and Ozkan-Aydin might be able to help future rovers avoid that fate.\n\u201cThis combination of lifting and wheeling and paddling, if used properly, provides the ability to maintain some forward progress even if it is slow,\u201d Goldman said. \u201cThrough our laboratory experiments, we have shown principles that could lead to improved robustness in planetary exploration \u2013 and even in challenging surfaces on our own planet.\u201d\nThe researchers hope next to scale up the unusual gaits to larger robots, and to explore the idea of studying robots and their localized environments together. \u201cWe\u2019d like to think about the locomotor and its environment as a single entity,\u201d Goldman said. \u201cThere are certainly some interesting granular and soft matter physics issues to explore.\u201d\nThough the Mini Rover was designed to study lunar and planetary exploration, the lessons learned could also be applicable to terrestrial locomotion \u2013 an area of interest to the Army Research Laboratory, one of the project\u2019s sponsors.\n\"This basic research is revealing exciting new approaches for locomotion in complex terrain,\" said Dr. Samuel Stanton, program manager, Army Research Office, an element of the U.S. Army Combat Capabilities Development Command's Army Research Laboratory. \"This could lead to platforms capable of intelligently transitioning between wheeled and legged modes of movement to maintain high operational tempo.\"\nBeyond those already mentioned, the researchers worked with Robert Ambrose and William Bluethmann at NASA, and traveled to NASA JSC to study the full-size NASA RP15 rover.\nThis work was supported by the Army Research Office (W911NF-18-1-0120) and the NASA National Robotics Initiative (NNX15AR21G).
