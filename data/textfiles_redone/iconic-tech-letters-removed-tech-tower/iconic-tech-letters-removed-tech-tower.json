Due to an increase in light pollution measured by the Facility of Optical Luminescence and Skygazing (FOOLS), the letters have been unplugged and permanently removed from the building.\nThe light emitted from the letters pulled the sky quality rating in the area surrounding Tech Tower down to the lowest reading of 16.00 \u2014 which represents the highest amount of light pollution possible. Dr. Kant Taycajoek, a Georgia Tech professor in the field of optics and light emission, served as a university advisor to a team from FOOLS.\n\u201cWe tried every solution to prevent this from happening \u2014 we didn\u2019t take it lightly,\u201d lamented Taycajoek. \u201cAt first, we just turned off the \u201cT\u201d to see if that would decrease the pollution, but sadly, the \u201cTECH\u201d here is simply just too bright.\u201d\nTaycajoek suggested that the lights simply be turned off and that the letters should remain fixed atop the tower. However, the FOOLS team would not allow it.\n\u201cThey were worried that we would simply just flip the light switch back on,\u201d said Taycajoek. \u201cAnd we would have.\u201d\nThe only solution was to remove the illuminated letters from all four sides of the building. On April 1 at 12:01 a.m., a team of light removal specialists turned off the sign for the last time and dismantled the letters.\n\u201cIt\u2019s truly an SSD (sad, sad day),\u201d said L.V. Lux, Georgia Tech\u2019s vice president of abbreviations and acronyms. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine this campus without \u201cTECH.\u201d It just seems dark.\u201d\nThe letters have been taken in by the Institute \u2014 deceptively and harmlessly unlit and placed in storage.\nAdditional Media\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
