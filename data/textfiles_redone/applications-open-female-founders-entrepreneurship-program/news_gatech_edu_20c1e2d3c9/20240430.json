Credit: VentureLab\nFeb 25, 2021\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nLast fall, 17 teams of entrepreneurs, each one led or co-led by a woman, completed the first phase of the Georgia Tech VentureLab\u2019s inaugural Female Founders program. The teams were led by women from across the Georgia Tech community, including students, faculty, and staff. The program was started after VentureLab noticed a disproportionately low number of female entrepreneurs compared to overall campus enrollment and wanted to see if providing a space specifically for women would help.\nApplications for the next class of entrepreneurs are open through March 2. Phase 1 of the five-week program, called \u201cBeginning the Lean Startup Journey,\u201d will kick off on Thursday, March 4. This phase will introduce teams to the lean methodology and teach them to use customer delivery in building their first business model. Participants will also be connected to a network of their fellow entrepreneurs, coaches and instructors, and Atlanta-based female entrepreneurs.\nApplicants can sign up on their own or with a team. Men are also welcome to be part of a team, as long as it\u2019s led or co-led by a woman. Of the 17 teams that completed Phase 1, eight decided to continue on to Phase 2, called \u201cApplying Lean Startup.\u201d Happening now, Phase 2 involves teams interviewing approximately six customers per week in helping to better understand and grow their business model.\n\u201cThese women feel like they now have a plan toward commercialization,\u201d said Melissa Heffner, program manager for the VentureLab. \u201cThe program also evolved their understanding of their customer segments, the problems they\u2019re wanting to solve, and the value they can provide through their startups.\u201d\nLearn more about the program and apply\nhere .\nAdditional Images\nContact\nGrace Wyner\nInstitute Communications\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
