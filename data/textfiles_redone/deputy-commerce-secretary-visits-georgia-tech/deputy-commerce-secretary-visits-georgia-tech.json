Andrews visited Georgia Tech on June 8 to better understand how its innovation ecosystem fuels economic development.\nJun 09, 2015\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nU.S. Deputy Secretary of Commerce Bruce Andrews visited the Georgia Institute of Technology recently to get a first-hand look at its innovation ecosystem and how that helps drive economic development. Andrews spent his time on June 8 at the Enterprise Innovation Institute \u2014 Tech\u2019s chief economic development and business outreach arm. He received an overview of how research and the development of new technologies at the Institute help drive economic development through the creation of new companies, which leads to new jobs. \u201cThe big part is to understand the intersection between the public sector, the private sector, universities and educational institutions and seeing various ways in which Georgia Tech is playing various roles in catalyzing economic development,\u201d Andrews said. \u201cIt\u2019s really impressive.\u201d While on campus, he met with Stephen Cross, Tech\u2019s executive vice president for research, who explained how the Institute\u2019s focus on transformative research, public-private partnerships, and leveraging state resources drives innovation. Andrews also toured the Institute\u2019s Advanced Technology Development Center (ATDC), the internationally recognized technology startup incubator that\u2019s open to entrepreneurs statewide. He met with entrepreneurs of two ATDC companies \u2014 Clean Hands Safe Hands and Lumense. Clean Hands Safe Hands, founded by Chris Hermann, a 2012 bioengineering alumnus, is a wireless hand hygiene monitoring system for hospitals. Lumense, a supplier of real-time, on-site chemical and biological sensors across a number of industries and applications, is based on technology exclusively licensed from the Georgia Tech Research Institute (GTRI) and more than $20 million in funded research conducted at Tech. Andrews also received an update on the Global Center for Medical Innovation (GCMI). An affiliate of Georgia Tech, GCMI is charged with accelerating the development and commercialization of next-generation medical devices and technology. \u201cYou realize what a great entrepreneurial, innovative ecosystem that\u2019s being built here through Georgia Tech, but really benefiting not only the whole community of Atlanta, but frankly the whole state of Georgia,\u201d Andrews said. \u201cThese are the type of catalytic economic development activities that we seek to work with through a number of our programs at the Department of Commerce.\u201d Andrews visit follows announcements from the Commerce Department earlier this year that Tech was awarded two grants. In one, announced May 22, the Commerce Department\u2019s Economic Development Administration awarded Tech a $460,707 grant to study the feasibility of expanding Technology Enterprise Park on Atlanta\u2019s west side into a health and bioscience hub. The other, announced March 30, was a $500,000 i6 Challenge grant to support a sweeping innovation and entrepreneurship initiative in Athens, Augusta and downtown Atlanta. \u00a0 By P\u00e9ralte C.
