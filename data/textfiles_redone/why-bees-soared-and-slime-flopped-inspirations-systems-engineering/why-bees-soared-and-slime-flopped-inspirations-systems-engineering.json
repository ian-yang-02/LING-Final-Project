Great. Ants? Hit or miss. Slime mold amoebas? Fail. Though nature offers excellent design inspirations in some information technology systems, in other systems, it can bomb.\nKnown for his work on\u00a0 The Honey Bee Algorithm , which tamed web traffic instabilities on servers by mimicking the behavior of bee colonies, systems researcher Craig Tovey has seen plenty of nature-inspired technological feats, but also foibles. He\u00a0shared them in a talk on February 18\u00a0at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in Austin, Texas.\nIn 2016, the bee-inspired algorithm garnered Tovey and his collaborators \u00a0a Golden Goose Award , which commends curiosity-driven research as it blossoms to palpably benefit society. The Honey Bee Algorithm, for example, has saved significant web hosting costs.\n\u201cWe lucked out with the bees and web hosting,\u201d said Tovey, who hopes that along with practical takeaways on naturally inspired technology, his audience will also share in his own awe and affection for nature\u2019s solutions.\nWhen algorithms are eternal\n\u201cWhen you study swarming bees, you discover truths that are lasting. The algorithms that guide them evolved over millions of years, and will hopefully still be there for millions of years to come,\u201d said Tovey, a co-director of\u00a0 Georgia Tech\u2019s Center for Biologically Inspired Design . \u201cCompare that with when you design a new microcircuit. Three years later it\u2019s gone, forever lost; replaced by new designs.\u201d\nWhether mimicking nature is prudent in a particular engineering job depends a lot on the problem to be solved. Often, it\u2019s just better to use something off the shelf or adapt it.\n\u201cWhen the real-life problem is static and well-defined with predictable data, then the nature-inspired methods are usually much weaker, much worse than classical optimization methods,\u201d Tovey said.\nWhen boring is better\nThe \u201cTraveling Salesman Problem\u201d is a typical example. A researcher tries to compute the best pathways a proverbial salesperson should travel, and in which order, to visit hundreds, thousands, or tens of thousands of proverbial cities on a map.\nThe goal is to travel the shortest possible total distance.\n\u201cNature-inspired approaches will find good solutions for 100 or so cities, but not optimal ones,\u201d said Tovey, who is also\u00a0 a professor and Stewart Faculty Fellow in Georgia Tech\u2019s Stewart School of Industrial and Systems Engineering . \u201cBy contrast, the top researchers can solve 20,000 or 50,000 locations optimally with a classical algorithm, and do it really quickly.\u201d\nWhen ants miss and hit\n\u201cPeople have imitated ants to find the optimal pathways through a static system, and when you compare that method with classical optimization methods, then the classical methods are about 10 billion times better.\u201d\nBut life is fickle, which can make it a great teacher in science and engineering. \u201cEvery living creature is very good at solving a number of different problems, otherwise it would have gone extinct,\u201d Tovey said.\nToss unpredictability into an engineering problem, and natural algorithms that direct the movements of ants or bees can be better equipped to cope than classical solutions.\n\u201cIn the Traveling Salesman Problem, the cities don\u2019t move around. But when you\u2019re chasing a moving target, and your data isn\u2019t perfectly complete, then you can have great success by imitating insect swarms. You can get real-time control on data that\u2019s quite literally on the fly,\u201d Tovey said.\nWhen bees know best\nThat counts for a lot in a pinch. When a hurricane looms, people check their weather apps much more frequently as the tempest encroaches. When markets tank, people sell off stocks, and data surges in and out of financial servers.\n\u201cIf the patterns of user demand on the web never changed, and the requests to a server always stayed the same, all would be well without imitating honeybees,\u201d Tovey said. \u201cBut that notion is ridiculous, as we all know.\u201d\n\u201cBees have evolved to deal with flower patches that have changing characteristics. A patch that is great to visit at 10 o\u2019clock in the morning may have its flowers closed-up at one o\u2019clock in the afternoon, or it may be raining.\u201d\nAlgorithms steering bee behavior make the insect swarms adjust to supply and demand fluxes similar to those that confront a web server. The honeybees handed Tovey and his fellow researchers valuable insights for their web hosting algorithm.\nWhen slime flops but amazes\nThough classic algorithms beat nature in simple situations, watching natural algorithms in even the simplest organisms can be awe-inspiring. Take slime mold, a non-cellular organism related to amoebas.\n\u201cIf you put down lumps of food near it, the slime mold will extend to reach the lumps and connect them with each other.\u201d\nThe mold makes very efficient connections that adapt well to differing constellations of food dabs.\n\u201cSome researchers placed food sources in spots corresponding to the locations of cities in Japan that were connected by rail lines, and sure enough, the slime mold eventually settled on a configuration connecting the spots that nearly perfectly matched the rail network that actually connected the cities,\u201d Tovey said.\nAgain here, classic algorithms do the job better, but still, that slime is just amazing.\nFor all his awe of bees, Tovey has had to avoid making their acquaintance in person and leave the bee-handling to his collaborators. \u201cI and my whole family are all extremely allergic to bee stings,\u201d Tovey said. \u201cWe keep EpiPens around the house.\u201d\nThe Honey Bee Algorithm team that received the 2016 Golden Goose was comprised of: Tovey, John Hagood Vande Vate, John Bartholdi III, and Sunil Nakrani of Georgia Tech, and Thomas Seeley of Cornell University. The research was funded by the National Science Foundation and the Office of Naval Research.\u00a0Any opinions, findings, and conclusions or recommendations expressed in this material are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of the sponsors.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nWriter &\u00a0Media Representative : Ben Brumfield (404-660-1408)\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\n177 North Avenue\nAtlanta, Georgia \u00a030332-0181 \u00a0USA\nEmail\nben.brumfield@comm.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
