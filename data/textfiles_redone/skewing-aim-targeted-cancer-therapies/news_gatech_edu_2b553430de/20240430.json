A team exploring genetic mechanisms in cancer at the Georgia Institute of Technology has found evidence that a prevailing concept about how cells produce protein molecules, particularly when applied to cancer, could be erroneous as much as two-thirds of the time.\nPrior studies by other researchers have also critiqued this concept about the pathway leading from genetic code to proteins, but this new study,\u00a0 led by cancer researcher John McDonald , has employed rare analytical technology to explore it in unparalleled detail. The study also turned up novel evidence for regulating mechanisms that could account for the prevailing concept\u2019s apparent shortcomings.\nRNA concept incomplete\nThe concept stems from common knowledge about the assembly line inside cells that produces protein molecules. It starts with code in DNA, which is transcribed to messenger RNA, then translated into protein molecules, the cell\u2019s building blocks.\nThat model seems to have left the impression that cellular protein production works analogously to an old-style factory production line: That the amount of a messenger RNA encoded by DNA on the front end translates directly into the amount of a corresponding protein produced on the back end. That idea is at the core of how gene-based cancer drug developers choose their targets.\nTo put that assumed congruence between RNA production and protein production to the test, the researchers examined -- in ovarian cancer cells donated by a patient -- 4,436 genes, their subsequently transcribed messenger RNA, and the resulting proteins. The assumption, that proverbial factory orders passed down the DNA-RNA line determine in a straightforward manner the amount of a protein being produced, proved incorrect 62 percent of the time.\nRNA skews drug cues\n\u201cThe messenger RNA-protein connection is important because proteins are usually the targets of\u00a0 gene-based cancer therapies ,\u201d McDonald said. \u201cAnd drug developers typically measure messenger RNA levels thinking they will tell them what the protein\u00a0levels are.\u201d But the significant variations in ratios of messenger RNA to protein that the researchers found make the common method of targeting proteins via RNA seem much less than optimal.\nMcDonald,\u00a0 Mengnan Zhang \u00a0and Ronghu Wu published their results\u00a0 on August 15, 2017 in the journal\u00a0 Scientific Reports . The work was funded by the Ovarian Cancer Institute, The Deborah Nash Endowment, Atlanta\u2019s Northside Hospital and the National Science Foundation. The spectrophotometric technology needed to closely identify a high number of proteins is not widespread and is quite costly but is\u00a0 available in Wu\u2019s lab at Georgia Tech .\nWhereas many studies look at normal tissue versus cancerous tissue, this new study focused on cancer progression, or\u00a0 metastasis, which is what usually makes cancer deadly . The researchers looked at primary tumor tissue and also metastatic tissue.\nHiding drug targets\n\u201cThe idea that any change in RNA level in cancerous development flows all the way up to the protein level could be leading to drug targeting errors,\u201d said \u00a0McDonald, who heads Georgia Tech\u2019s Integrated Cancer Research Center . Drug developers often look for oddly high messenger RNA levels in a cancer then go after what they believe must be the resulting oddly high levels of a corresponding protein.\nTaking messenger RNA as a protein level indicator could actually work some of the time. In the McDonald team\u2019s latest experiment, in 38 percent of the cases, the rise of RNA levels in cancerous cells did indeed reflect a comparable rise of protein levels. But in the rest of cases, they did not.\n\u201cSo, there are going to be many instances where if you\u2019re predicting what to give therapeutically to a patient based on RNA, your prescription could easily be incorrect,\u201d McDonald said. \u201cDrug developers could be aiming at targets that aren\u2019t there and also not shooting for targets that are there.\u201d\nRNA muted or magnified\nThe analogy of a factory producing building materials can help illustrate what goes wrong in a cancerous cell, and also help describe the study\u2019s new insights into protein production. To complete the metaphor: The materials produced are used in the construction of the factory\u2019s own building, that is, the cell\u2019s own structures.\nIn cancer cells, a mutation makes protein production go awry usually not by deforming proteins but by overproducing them. \u201cA lot of mutations in cancer are mutations in production levels. The proteins are being overexpressed,\u201d said McDonald, who is also a\u00a0 professor in Georgia Tech\u2019s School of Biological Sciences .\nA bad factory order can lead to the production of too much of a good material and then force it into the structures of the cell, distorting it. The question is: Where in the production line do bad factory orders appear?\nAccording to the new study, the answer is less straightforward than previously thought.\nMicro RNA managing\nThe orders don\u2019t all appear on the front end of the assembly line with DNA over-transcribing messenger RNA. Additionally, some mutations that do over-transcribe messenger RNA on the front end are tamped down or canceled by regulating mechanisms further down the line, and may never end up boosting protein levels on the back end.\nRegulating mechanisms also appear to be making other messenger RNA, transcribed in normal amounts, unexpectedly crank out inordinate levels of proteins.\nAt the heart of those regulating systems, another RNA called micro RNA may be micromanaging how much, or little, of a protein is actually produced in the end.\n\u201cWe have evidence that micro RNAs may be responsible for the non-correlation between the proteins and the RNA, and that\u2019s completely novel,\u201d McDonald said. \u201cIt\u2019s an emerging area of research.\u201d\nMicro RNA, or\u00a0 miRNA , is an extremely short strand of RNA.\nNo one at fault\nMcDonald would like to see tissues from more cancer patients undergo similar testing. \u201cRight now, with just one patient, the data is limited, but I also really think it shows that the phenomenon is real,\u201d McDonald said.\n\u201cMany past studies have looked at one particular protein and a particular gene, or a particular handful. We looked at more than 4,000,\u201d McDonald said. \u201cWhat that brings up is that the phenomenon is probably not isolated but instead genome-wide.\u201d\nThe study\u2019s authors would also like to see currently less accessible, advanced protein detecting technology become more widely available to biomolecular researchers, especially in the field of cancer drug development. \u201cTargeted gene therapy is a good idea, but you need the full knowledge of whether it\u2019s affecting the protein level,\u201d McDonald said.\nHe pointed out that no one is at fault for the possible incompleteness of commonly held concepts about protein production.\nAs science progresses, it naturally illuminates new details, and formerly useful ideas need updating. With the existence of new technologies, it may be time to flesh out this particular concept for the sake of cancer research progress.\nAlso READ: Punching Cancer With RNA Knuckles \u2013 with John McDonald\nThe research was supported by grants from the Ovarian Cancer Institute, The Deborah Nash Endowment Fund, Northside Hospital (Atlanta), and the National Science Foundation (CHE-452 1454501).
