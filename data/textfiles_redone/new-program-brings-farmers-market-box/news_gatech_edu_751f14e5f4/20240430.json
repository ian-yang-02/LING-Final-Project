This semester, Campus Sustainability has teamed up with\nRise \u2019n\u2019 Shine , which works with local Georgia farms growing organic food, to offer a weekly fresh produce box to the campus community.\nThis is a restart of the previous campus farm share program, with new benefits and a new provider. While produce is always an option, Rise \u2019n\u2019 Shine also provides pasta, cheese, and milk through its partners. Boxes start at $30 a week, and people can choose the amount of food they buy. Every Thursday, customers will receive an email of the food they are set to receive along with other products at similar prices. You can also choose the frequency of box delivery \u2013 weekly, biweekly, or less often. Box delivery can be put on hold at any time to ensure you are not paying for food when you are off campus.\nThis program is intended to connect members of Tech to the greater Atlanta area and provide them with fresh, healthy food. All of the food is sustainably produced, and people can share boxes with friends while expanding their horizons by trying new types of produce. Every Tuesday, their box will be delivered to The Kendeda Building for Innovative Sustainable Design for easy pickup. Ordering is open now \u2014 learn more at\nrisenshinefarm.com/local-farm-box .\nAdditional Images\nContact\nConnor White\nInstitute Communications\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
