The pieces are generated using artificial intelligence and deep learning.\nResearchers fed the robot nearly 5,000 complete songs \u2014 from Beethoven to the Beatles to Lady Gaga to Miles Davis \u2014 and more than 2 million motifs, riffs and licks of music. Aside from giving the machine a seed, or the first four measures to use as a starting point, no humans are involved in either the composition or the performance of the music.\nThe first two compositions are roughly 30 seconds in length. The robot, named Shimon, can be seen and heard playing them\nhere\nand\nhere .\nPh.D. student Mason Bretan is the man behind the machine. He\u2019s worked with Shimon for seven years, enabling it to \u201clisten\u201d to music played by humans and improvise over pre-composed chord progressions. Now Shimon is a solo composer for the first time, generating the melody and harmonic structure on its own.\n\u201cOnce Shimon learns the four measures we provide, it creates its own sequence of concepts and composes its own piece,\u201d said Bretan, who will receive his doctorate in music technology this summer at Georgia Tech. \u201cShimon\u2019s compositions represent how music sounds and looks when a robot uses deep neural networks to learn everything it knows about music from millions of human-made segments.\u201d\nBretan says this is the first time a robot has used deep learning to create music. And unlike its days of improvising, when it played monophonically, Shimon is able to play harmonies and chords. It\u2019s also thinking much more like a human musician, focusing less on the next note, as it did before, and more on the overall structure of the composition.\n\u201cWhen we play or listen to music, we don\u2019t think about the next note and only that next note,\u201d said Bretan. \u201cAn artist has a bigger idea of what he or she is trying to achieve within the next few measures or later in the piece. Shimon is now coming up with higher-level musical semantics. Rather than thinking note by note, it has a larger idea of what it wants to play as a whole.\u201d\nShimon was created by Bretan\u2019s advisor, Gil Weinberg, director of Georgia Tech\u2019s Center for Music Technology.\n\u201cThis is a leap in Shimon\u2019s musical quality because it\u2019s using deep learning to create a more structured and coherent composition,\u201d said Weinberg, a professor in the School of Music. \u201cWe want to explore whether robots could become musically creative and generate new music that we humans could find beautiful, inspiring and strange.\u201d\nShimon will create more pieces in the future. As long as the researchers feed it a different seed, the robot will produce something different each time \u2014 music that the researchers can\u2019t predict. In the first piece, Bretan fed Shimon a melody comprised of eighth notes. It received a sixteenth note melody the second time, which influenced it to generate faster note sequences.\nBretan acknowledges that he can\u2019t pick out individual songs that Shimon is referencing. He is able to recognize classical chord progression and influences of artists, such as Mozart, for example.\n\u201cThey sound like a fusion of jazz and classical,\u201d said Bretan, who plays the keyboards and guitar in his free time. \u201cI definitely hear more classical, especially in the harmony. But then I hear chromatic moving steps in the first piece \u2014 that\u2019s definitely something you hear in jazz.\u201d\nShimon\u2019s debut as a solo composer was featured in a video clip in the Consumer Electronic Show (CES) keynote and will have its first live performance at the\nAspen Ideas Festival\nat the end of June. It\u2019s the latest project within Weinberg\u2019s lab. He and his students have also created a\nrobotic prosthesis for a drummer , a\nrobotic third arm for all drummers , and an\ninteractive robotic companion that plays music from a phone and dances to the beat .\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nCenter for Music Technology\nRobotic Prosthesis for Drummers\nRobotic Third Arm for All Drummers\nContact\nJason Maderer\nNational Media Relations\nmaderer@gatech.edu\n404-660-2926\nEmail\nmaderer@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
