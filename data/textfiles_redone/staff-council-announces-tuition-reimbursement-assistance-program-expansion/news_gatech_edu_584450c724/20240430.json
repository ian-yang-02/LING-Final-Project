This story has been updated to reflect this development.\nThe\nStaff Council\nEmployee Engagement Committee partnered with Georgia Tech Human Resources (GTHR) to expand the Institute\u2019s\nStaff Tuition Reimbursement Assistance Program\n(STRAP) to provide reimbursement for professional certifications related to an employee\u2019s job functions on campus.\nWhile STRAP provides partial tuition reimbursement for degrees, technical diplomas, and certificates that offer letter grades and credit hours to classified Tech employees at any accredited private institution, STRAP-Certifications, or STRAP-C, will reimburse\u00a0for professional certifications. The expansion will cover up to $750 toward a staff member\u2019s exam costs every other year.\n\u201cThe Staff Tuition Reimbursement Assistance Program\u00a0is important to Tech employees because it offers another layer of education assistance outside of TAP\u201d [the University System of Georgia\u2019s educational assistance\nTuition Assistance Program ], Candice Bovian, program manager for GTHR and 2022 Staff Council chair, said. \u201cOver time, it became clear that staff also wanted the choice of pursuing a professional certification.\"\n\"The Council worked very closely with the Office of General Counsel and GTHR,\" Bovian continued. \"We\u00a0heard what our colleagues wanted, advocated for them, and made this a reality.\u201d\nByron Fitch, senior consultant with Georgia Tech Strategic Consulting,\u00a0added, \"We are very grateful to Kelly Fox [executive vice president of Administration and Finance], Kim Harrington [chief human resources officer,\nsoon to be Administration and Finance chief of staff and associate vice president for Special Initiatives ], and Kelly Cross [Institute policy manager] for supporting Staff Council with\u00a0this effort. We are\u00a0excited to be able to contribute to staff\u00a0development with this expansion.\u201d\nFitch served as 2020 Staff Council chair and chair of the Employee Engagement Committee in 2019 when STRAP expansion discussions began.\nPrevious STRAP guidelines did not provide reimbursement for staff seeking professional certifications and designations that did not offer credit hours and letter grades. As a result, they were responsible for paying out of pocket for professional certifications \u2014 or forced to forfeit altogether.\nBased on research and benchmarking conducted by Staff Council, the average cost to pursue a professional certification is $750. This amount served as the proposed threshold that staffers could leverage for potential reimbursement. (The allotment will cover exam fees only.)\nSTRAP-C applications must be submitted by the STRAP deadline for reimbursement of a passed exam.\u00a0The application period will open 30 days prior to the deadline.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nJ.
