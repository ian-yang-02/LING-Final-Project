The heads-up-display system attaches to a firefighter\u2019s mask and measures heart rate, respiratory rate, blood oxygen level, the firefighter\u2019s body temperature, and the external temperature. This information will help firefighters determine if they are overexerting themselves and putting their health at risk.The invention won first place in Georgia Tech\u2019s InVenture Prize. The team represents the Institute in the ACC In\nApr 04, 2016\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nZack Braun was at a bonfire when he thought of a new way to protect firefighters. Braun, a computer engineering major, was chatting with a family friend who is a firefighter. He described the chaotic environments they face and explained the protective gear they wear. \u201cI was really surprised they didn\u2019t have sensors or technology to help them,\u201d Braun said. \u201cWhat they did have seemed really crude.\u201d Braun teamed up with Tyler Sisk, an electrical engineering major, and together they invented FireHUD. A heads-up-display attaches to a firefighter\u2019s mask and measures heart rate, respiratory rate, blood oxygen level, body temperature, external temperature and other vital signs. This information will help firefighters determine whether they are overexerting themselves and are at risk for cardiac arrest. The\ninvention won first place in last month\u2019s Georgia Tech InVenture Prize , which rewards students with cash prizes and free patent filings for inventions that aim to solve societal problems. Now FireHUD will represent the Institute in the inaugural\nACC InVenture Prize . This contest, which will be held on campus Tuesday and Wednesday, involves student startups and inventions from each of the 15 universities in the Atlantic Coast Conference. Friends since middle school, Braun and Sisk previously worked together on Science Olympiad projects and once built a robotic arm. For this invention, they were inspired by the health bar displays found in video games. \u201cI play, and it was the first thing that came to mind because you can keep track of all your vitals,\u201d Braun said. They also wanted a way to share this information with officials on the scene. The device transmits data to the incident commander, who can view it on a computer through an app. The device itself is about the size of a cell phone. It doesn\u2019t make the mask noticeably heavier or impede vision, said David Phillips, a member of the Fairburn Fire Department who has tried out the invention. One of the biggest risks firefighters face is overexerting themselves because most don\u2019t recognize when they are putting themselves in danger, Phillips said. FireHUD lets firefighters know when they are in harm\u2019s way so they can take steps to be safe, he said. \u201cThe idea is awesome and it really could save a firefighter\u2019s life,\u201d Phillips said. \u201cYou do wonder how we went this long without something like this.\u201d Braun and Sisk started working on the invention last summer. The original design had the heads-up-display outside the mask but it was too difficult to read, Sisk said. They moved it inside the mask and used a near-eye display, which is meant to be looked at up close. Braun and Sisk fine-tuned and improved the design through Tech\u2019s\nIdea to Prototype\nclass. The class provides students with undergraduate research credit and a grant to build functional prototypes based on their ideas. It is part of\nCREATE-X , an array of programs and initiatives designed to build entrepreneurial confidence among Georgia Tech students. Students in the program talk with potential customers to discover what they need and want. During the fall semester, Braun and Sisk spent nearly every weekend visiting fire departments to learn from firefighters how to improve the device. They are in the course again this semester and are still talking with firefighters. They\u2019ve learned firefighters don\u2019t like the flashlight currently on the device, so Sisk said they will likely remove it. A key point in the customer discovery process came when they visited the Georgia Public Safety Training Center in Forsyth. Several firefighters tried on the device, and one of trainers wore it in a burning building to see how it worked and make sure the electric components didn\u2019t melt. Visiting the center remains one of the highlights of the entire invention process, Braun said. \u201cSeeing their faces and excitement as they tried on the masks was amazing,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it was then that we realized this can really save lives.\u201d The device measures biometric data with a sensor that goes in a firefighter\u2019s ear, and the heads-up-display uses a microcontroller. While earlier iterations were 3D printed, the current design uses Teflon and fiberglass, which makes it able to withstand high temperatures. The team built much of the devices in Sisk\u2019s basement. They did some 3D printing in the Invention Studio \u2013 a student-run, design-build-play maker space on campus \u2013 where Sisk is one of the prototyping instructors. Braun and Sisk are still improving the device and will soon file for the patent, a prize that came with winning the Georgia Tech competition. Over the past couple of weeks, FireHUD was featured on FireRescue1, one of the nation\u2019s premier firefighting websites, and highlighted as an emerging technology in the internal newsletter of a leading manufacturer of firefighting equipment. \u201cOur goal is to keep working on FireHUD,\u201d Sisk said. \u201cWe want to manufacture this and make it a reality for firefighters.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nACC InVenture Prize\nContact\nLaura Diamond\u00a0 Media Relations\u00a0 404-894-6016 @LauraRDiamond\nEmail\nlaura.diamond@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
