Researchers at Georgia Tech built the \u201cHoneyBot\u201d to lure hackers into thinking they had taken control of a robot, but instead the robot gathers valuable information about the bad actors, helping businesses better protect themselves from future attacks.\nMar 29, 2018\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nIt\u2019s small enough to fit inside a shoebox, yet this robot on four wheels has a big mission: keeping factories and other large facilities safe from hackers.\nMeet the HoneyBot.\nDeveloped by a team of researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology, the diminutive device is designed to lure in digital troublemakers who have set their sights on industrial facilities. HoneyBot will then trick the bad actors into giving up valuable information to cybersecurity professionals.\nThe decoy robot arrives as more and more devices \u2013 never designed to operate on the Internet \u2013 are coming online in homes and factories alike, opening up a new range of possibilities for hackers looking to wreak havoc in both the digital and physical world.\n\u201cRobots do more now than they ever have, and some companies are moving forward with, not just the assembly line robots, but free-standing robots that can actually drive around factory floors,\u201d said Raheem Beyah, the Motorola Foundation Professor and interim Steve W. Chaddick School Chair in Georgia Tech\u2019s School of Electrical and Computer Engineering. \u201cIn that type of setting, you can imagine how dangerous this could be if a hacker gains access to those machines. At a minimum, they could cause harm to whatever products are being produced. If it\u2019s a large enough robot, it could destroy parts or the assembly line. In a worst-case scenario, it could injure or cause death to the humans in the vicinity.\u201d\nInternet security professionals long have employed decoy computer systems known as \u201choneypots\u201d as a way to throw cyberattackers off the trail. The research team applied the same concept to the HoneyBot, which is partially funded with a grant from the National Science Foundation. Once hackers gain access to the decoy, they leave behind valuable information that can help companies further secure their networks.\n\u201cA lot of cyberattacks go unanswered or unpunished because there\u2019s this level of anonymity afforded to malicious actors on the internet, and it\u2019s hard for companies to say who is responsible,\u201d said Celine Irvene, a Georgia Tech graduate student who worked with Beyah to devise the new robot. \u201cHoneypots give security professionals the ability to study the attackers, determine what methods they are using, and figure out where they are or potentially even who they are.\u201d\nThe gadget can be monitored and controlled through the internet. But unlike other remote-controlled robots, the HoneyBot\u2019s special ability is tricking its operators into thinking it is performing one task, when in reality it\u2019s doing something completely different.\n\u201cThe idea behind a honeypot is that you don\u2019t want the attackers to know they\u2019re in a honeypot,\u201d Beyah said. \u201cIf the attacker is smart and is looking out for the potential of a honeypot, maybe they\u2019d look at different sensors on the robot, like an accelerometer or speedometer, to verify the robot is doing what it had been instructed. That\u2019s where we would be spoofing that information as well. The hacker would see from looking at the sensors that acceleration occurred from point A to point B.\u201d\nIn a factory setting, such a HoneyBot robot could sit motionless in a corner, springing to life when a hacker gains access \u2013 a visual indicator that a malicious actor is targeting the facility.\nRather than allowing the hacker to then run amok in the physical world, the robot could be designed to follow certain commands deemed harmless \u2013 such as meandering slowly about or picking up objects \u2013 but stopping short of actually doing anything dangerous.\nSo far, their technique seems to be working.\nIn experiments designed to test how convincing the false sensor data would be to individuals remotely controlling the device, volunteers in December 2017 used a virtual interface to control the robot and could not to see what was happening in real life. To entice the volunteers to break the rules, at specific spots within the maze, they encountered forbidden \u201cshortcuts\u201d that would allow them to finish the maze faster.\nIn the real maze back in the lab, no shortcut existed, and if the participants opted to go through it, the robot instead remained still. Meanwhile, the volunteers \u2013 who have now unwittingly become hackers for the purposes of the experiment \u2013 were fed simulated sensor data indicating they passed through the shortcut and continued along.\n\u201cWe wanted to make sure they felt that this robot was doing this real thing,\u201d Beyah said.\nIn surveys after the experiment, participants who actually controlled the device the whole time and those who were being fed simulated data about the fake shortcut both indicated that the data was believable at similar rates.\n\u201cThis is a good sign because it indicates that we\u2019re on the right track,\u201d Irvene said.\nThis material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. 1544332.
