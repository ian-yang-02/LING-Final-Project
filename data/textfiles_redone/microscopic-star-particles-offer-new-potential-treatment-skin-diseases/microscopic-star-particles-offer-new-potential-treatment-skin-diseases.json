(Credit: Georgia Tech)\nMar 09, 2020\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nSkin diseases affect half of the world\u2019s population, but many treatments are not effective, require frequent injections, or cause significant side effects. But what if there was a treatment that eliminated injections, reduced side effects, and increased drug effectiveness? A skin therapy with these properties may be on the horizon from\nMark Prausnitz\u2019s\nDrug Delivery Lab\nat the Georgia Institute of Technology.\nIn a study published on March 9, 2020, in the journal\nNature Medicine , Prausnitz and his team of researchers report on research using a skin cream infused with microscopic particles, named STAR particles. To the naked eye, STAR particles look like a powder, but closer inspection reveals tiny microneedle projections sticking out from the particles like a microscopic star. A particle-containing cream could potentially facilitate better treatment of skin diseases including psoriasis, warts, and certain types of skin cancer.\nFollowing the successful study of his microneedle patches for vaccination, Prausnitz and postdoctoral scholar Andrew Tadros have advanced the technology with the objective of treating skin conditions by simply rubbing STAR particles on the skin. In a study in mice, skin cancer tumors were treated with 5-fluorouracil, a cancer therapy drug that works by limiting replication of abnormal cells. Tumor growth was inhibited only when the drug was rubbed on the skin above the tumor in combination with STAR particles, whereas the drug without STAR particles was much less effective.\n\u201cAndrew [Tadros] and I teamed up to adapt the microneedle technology and make it useful, especially in dermatology,\u201d said Prausnitz, Regents Professor and J. Erskine Love Jr. Chair in the Georgia Tech\nSchool of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering . \u201cMicroneedle patches are good at administering drugs or vaccines to a small area of skin, but many dermatological conditions are spread over larger areas. Rather than trying to make really big patches, which would be difficult to use, we ultimately arrived at STAR particles that can be rubbed on the skin \u2013 just like any skin lotion \u2013 and poke tiny holes in the skin to better deliver drugs.\u201d\nSTAR particles are mixed into a therapeutic cream or gel and applied to the skin, painlessly creating micropores in the skin\u2019s surface that dramatically \u2013 but temporarily \u2013 increase skin permeability to drugs.\nThe problem is that most drugs are not absorbed well into skin, so often a drug needs to be given to the whole body by pill or injection just to treat the skin. Exposing the whole body to dermatological drugs often leads to unwanted side effects such as nausea or organ damage. Fortunately, the barrier layer of skin \u2013 called the stratum corneum \u2013 is thinner than the width of a human hair. While STAR particles are tiny, they are large enough to poke through this barrier layer when rubbed on the skin and let drugs enter the body through the micropores without pain.\nMore effectively delivering medicine directly to where it\u2019s needed could improve treatments for patients dealing with many kinds of skin diseases. Oral methotrexate is a common course of treatment for psoriasis \u2013\u00a0 a dermatological condition in which skin cells build up and form scales and itchy, dry patches \u2013 but because the therapy is systemic, it exposes the whole body to a drug that can cause serious side effects like diarrhea, hair loss, and liver problems.\nPrausnitz said doctors must weigh the costs of exposing the whole body to a drug versus treating psoriasis topically, which may be less effective. That\u2019s where STAR particles could provide value.\n\u201cBased on our studies, you could feasibly combine methotrexate with STAR particles into a cream and localize the therapy where it is needed,\u201d Tadros said. \u201cThe STAR particles in the cream would enable drugs to get into skin and treat diseases locally, right where it needs to be treated, and without exposing the whole body to the drug.\u201d\nSkin creams that deliver drug therapies could widen the range of compounds administered topically, Prausnitz and Tadros suggested. Non-medicinal creams infused with STAR particles have been tested on humans, who generally reported experiencing a mild and comfortable tingling sensation, but no pain or skin irritation.\nEach STAR particle is no larger than a millimeter, with sharp and strong microneedle structures protruding from the surface that are 100 to 300 microns long. While the particles are barely perceptible to the human eye, the microneedles on them are not.\nMoreover, when mixed in with a cream, the STAR particles disappear from sight. The research team uses a laser to make the particles from ceramic materials like titanium dioxide, a common ingredient in sunscreens and other cosmetic products.\n\u201cTitanium dioxide is a common material that we have adapted to make STAR particles,\u201d said Prausnitz. \u201cThe material is well established, but it\u2019s the star-shaped geometry of the particle that\u2019s new.\u201d\nPrausnitz said he hopes to scale the STAR particles for commercial use not only in dermatology, but for cosmetic purposes as well, where they could potentially deliver anti-aging treatments without injections or other harsh procedures.\n\u201cOur research philosophy is to develop an understanding of biomedical science and engineering technology, and then bring them together to create something that is practical and can benefit patients,\u201d Prausnitz said.\nPrausnitz and Tadros have started a new company called Microstar Biotech that\u2019s working to commercialize the STAR particle technology.\n\u201cGeorgia Tech has been instrumental in enabling us to bring this research to the forefront of the medical field, but universities can only do so much,\u201d said Prausnitz. \u201cCommercialization by a company is the mechanism to bring this novel research to the public for their benefit, and I\u2019m hopeful for the future of STAR particles.\u201d\nResults of the study are published in the March issue of the medical journal Nature Medicine. This work was supported financially by the Georgia Research Alliance and as a joint project of the CDC Foundation and UNICEF.\nPrausnitz and Tadros are inventors of the STAR particle technology used in this study and have ownership interest in Microstar Biotech LLC, which is developing technology related to this study. They are entitled to royalties derived from Microstar Biotech\u2019s future sales of products related to the research.
