The strong contractions led to expulsion of native gut bacteria .\nThe discovery, detailed in the\nProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , \u201cwas remarkable and unexpected,\u201d the authors write.\nThe researchers \u2013 from the University of Oregon, Georgia Institute of Technology, and Memorial-Sloan Kettering Cancer Center \u2013 used genetic manipulation and cutting-edge three-dimensional microscopy to monitor what happens when the disease-causing microbe is initially introduced into the larvae of zebrafish, an organism commonly studied as a model for understanding health and disease in vertebrates, including humans.\nThe multidisciplinary team of physicists, molecular biologists, and microbiologists focused on the harpoon-like injection capabilities of the type VI secretion system. This appendage, found in many bacteria including\nVibrio cholerae,\ntransfers toxic proteins into competing healthy cells.\nThe scientists engineered\nVibrio cholerae\nmutants with variations in that secretion system and then observed the behavior of the microbes as they invaded zebrafish colonized with\nAeromonas veronii , a native species in that animal\u2019s gut.\nSWIFT ACTION\nInstead of simply killing native\nAeromonas\ngut bacteria upon contact, as expected, when\nVibrio cholerae\nentered the gut the native bacteria were swiftly flushed out.\n\u201cThe secretion system induced dramatic increases in the strength of the peristalsis process, the contractions that move gut contents down the gastrointestinal tract much like squeezing a tube of toothpaste from the end to the top,\u201d says coauthor\nBrian K. Hammer , a microbiologist and associate professor in the School of Biological Sciences at Georgia Tech.\nThe researchers hypothesized that the unexpected bacterial manipulation in the digestive system might be driven by a particular piece of the type VI machinery known to bind to actin, a cellular scaffolding protein. When the scientists deleted the actin-binding domain from the bacterial gene, they saw that\nVibrio cholerae\nlost its ability to enhance peristalsis and its ability to expel native\nAeromonas .\nThe findings shed new light on how the waterborne\nVibrio cholerae\nfunctions. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,\nVibrio cholerae\ntriggers more than 3 million cases of acute diarrheal illness and 100,000 deaths in people worldwide each year.\n\u201cKnowing the strategies by which the bacterium is able to invade the intestine can open doors to therapies that might disrupt these paths,\u201d says corresponding author\nRaghuveer Parthasarathy , a professor of physics at the University of Oregon, whose imaging and analysis techniques were used in the study.\nBecause the type VI secretion system is also found in native gut bacteria, including those in the human gut microbiome, it could be harnessed for therapies, including specially designed probiotics, to promote beneficial species or to defend against disease invasion, Hammer says.\n\u201cWe suspect that other gut microbes, both pathogenic and beneficial, might similarly make use of this secretion system to reshape their environment,\u201d Parthasarathy says.\nMost previous research on this secretion system has relied on studying bacteria outside of animals \u2013 on a Petri dish for example, or by examining fecal samples \u2013 to infer what is happening in the gut during infection.\nWhile the research team captured the impact of invasion by\nVibrio cholerae , understanding just how it takes root in the host, such as what specific cells in the animal are targeted, is an open question, Parthasarathy says.\n\u201cWe still have no idea how the action of his secretion system\u2019s harpoon is causing the changes in the muscle contractions,\u201d Hammer says. \u201cWe suspect that what we are observing may be an immune response to irritation in the gut lining. But what cells in the gut are being poked?\u201d\nHow the findings may reflect the colonization of\nVibrio cholerae\nin humans is not known, but the role of the secretion system makes a similar result plausible, the researchers wrote in their conclusion.\nBIRTH OF COLLABORATION\nThe findings emerged from a collaboration born in 2015 when Hammer, Parthasarathy, and coauthor\nJoao Xavier , a researcher at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, discussed joint research possibilities during a conference,\nScialog: Molecules Come to Life , in Tucson, Arizona.\nThe Scialog (Science and Dialog) was organized by the Research Corporation for Science Advancement and sponsored jointly with the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, with additional support from the Simons Foundation. The goal of Scialog is to rapidly catalyze new interdisciplinary collaborative teams, such as the one formed by Hammer, Parthasarathy, and Xavier, to work on high-risk, high-reward projects.\nAs a result, their\nthree labs received an award\nfrom the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation and the Simons Foundation to pursue their Scialog idea. The National Science Foundation, National Institutes of Health, M.J. Murdock Charitable Trust, and Kavli Microbiome Ideas Challenge also supported the research.\nPHOTO CAPTION\nTrajectories of\nVibrio cholerae\nbacteria (blue) swimming inside the gut of a larval zebrafish.
