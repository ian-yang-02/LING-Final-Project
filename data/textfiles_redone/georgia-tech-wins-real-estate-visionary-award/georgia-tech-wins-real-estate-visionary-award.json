The Institute received the Visionary Award in the Atlanta Business Chronicle\u2019s 2017 Best in Atlanta Real Estate Awards.\nTech Square officially opened in 2003, and today the area is a thriving\ninnovation ecosystem\nthanks to a vibrant network of students, faculty, researchers, startup entrepreneurs and global corporations.\nOne of the area\u2019s guiding principles was to foster a better connection between the Institute and the business community.\nPresident G.P. \u201cBud\u201d Peterson discussed this connection in the fall during a\nroundtable event\nwith a handful of corporate executives from companies that opened innovation centers in Tech Square. Currently, 14\ncorporate innovation centers\nare clustered in the area.\nThe area\u2019s growth will only continue between\nconstruction of Coda , which represents the next phase of Tech Square, and the recent\npurchase of the Biltmore .\n\u201cTech Square will continue to be a hub of innovation for the Southeast, and I think we\u2019ll see continued strong growth as the word gets out that it is the place to be,\u201d Peterson\ntold the Atlanta Business Chronicle . \u201cWe are grateful to those who first saw the potential of Tech Square before the first shovel full of dirt was moved, and to those who have worked to create one of the most vibrant and creative innovation regions in the southeastern United States.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nThe Innovation Ecosystem at Georgia Tech\nContact\nLaura Diamond\nMedia Relations\n404-894-6016\n@LauraRDiamond\nEmail\nlaura.diamond@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
