While the war forced the World Series between the Chicago Cubs and the Boston Red Sox, pictured,\u00a0to be moved from October to September, the event itself likely helped spread the\u00a0disease throughout the city of Boston, according to\u00a0Johnny Smith, associate professor in the School of History and Sociology. He has co-authored a new book on the era called \"War Fever\"\nMar 24, 2020\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nBy Michael Pearson\nIt\u2019s the last week of the 1918 baseball season. The Boston Red Sox are on the cusp of winning the World Series on the back of baseball legend-in-making Babe Ruth. World War I is still raging in Europe. And a killer virus is stalking the streets of Boston.\nThis is the backdrop for\nWar Fever:\u00a0Boston, Baseball, and America in the Shadow of the Great War,\u00a0 the latest work by Georgia Institute of Technology historian Johnny Smith \u2014a story that resonates today amid the spread of the coronavirus and its impact on our lives.\n\u201cWe are living in a moment where a global pandemic has disrupted everyday life in ways we have not seen since 1918,\u201d said\nSmith , the J.C. \u201cBud\u201d Shaw Professor of Sports History in the School of History and Sociology.\nSmith\u2019s book with his frequent collaborator, Purdue University historian Randy Roberts, is only partially about the flu pandemic. The book is the interwoven tale of three figures \u2014 Ruth, Boston Symphony Orchestra conductor Karl Muck, and an Army officer from the Boston area named Charles Whittlesey, who led the \u201cLost Battalion\u201d that held off German forces in the Argonne Forest. It examines the impact of anti-German xenophobia and the flu pandemic on Boston in the fall of 1918.\nThe book tells how many of the patriotic rituals we expect at sporting events today \u2014 the playing of the National Anthem and other patriotic tunes, honors for members of the military \u2014 stem from World War I. It also speaks to widespread anti-German sentiment, including sudden doubts about Muck, one of many people of German descent whose loyalties were questioned during the war.\nThe effects of the flu also are an integral part of the tale Smith and Roberts weave, from Ruth coming down with a case of the flu during the season and nearly dying from a treatments \u2014 presaging the coming epidemic \u2014 to the possible effects of the virus on attendance during the decisive sixth game of the series.\nThey also offer a new argument that the series helped further spread the flu throughout Boston, which ultimately saw some 4,500 deaths. An estimated 675,000 people in the United States and 50 million people worldwide died as a result of the flu that emerged that year.\nWith all of this going on, the Red Sox victory \u201cfailed to generate celebrations in the streets of Boston,\u201d Smith says, as news from overseas and the flu epidemic stole all the headlines.\nWar and illness led to the biggest disruption in sports until now, Smith notes, with hundreds of contests, football games, boxing matches, and other events canceled or postponed.\nSimilar cancellations swept through the sports industry a few weeks ago, with every major sports league suspending operations, leaving millions of suddenly homebound Americans with no sports to entertain them. Of course, the world is different now than it was a hundred years ago. Streaming video will help fill the gap left by sports in a way that the early 20 th\ncentury communications tools could not, Smith said.\nBut he predicts that once the virus\u2019 grip on society has eased, sports will return to its place as a unifying diversion, a role it has long filled.\n\u201cIt happened in the \u201820s because the culture shifted to looking for an escape from the war and the flu,\u201d Smith said. \u201cIt happened after 9/11. It\u2019s as if the stadium serves as a cathedral of normalcy. And there will come a time when we will fill the arenas again and celebrate this return to normalcy. And it will be a very moving moment.\u201d\nThe\nSchool of History and Sociology\nis a unit of the\nIvan Allen College of Liberal Arts .\nAdditional Images\nContact\nMichael Pearson\nmichael.pearson@iac.gatech.edu\nEmail\nmichael.pearson@iac.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
