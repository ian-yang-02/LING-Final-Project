The event is free and open to the campus community.\nBrown worked for more than a year alongside faculty members across Georgia Tech, as well as Emory University, the University of Georgia, and Georgia State University to research and develop 20 recommendations in five high-impact areas: electricity, buildings and materials, food and agriculture, transportation, and the land.\nTheir proposals include increasing solar and electric vehicle capacity, retrofitting buildings to be more energy-efficient, reducing food waste, and growing more forests to soak up carbon emissions.\nThe team also integrated considerations\u00a0such as\u00a0equity, economic growth, and public health.\n\u201cOne of the key co-benefits of these solutions is in air quality improvements that, for example, will help to reduce the chance that our kids will have allergies and asthma,\" said\u00a0 Beril Toktay ,\u00a0Brady Family Chair in Management and professor in the\u00a0Ray C. Anderson Center for Sustainable Business in\u00a0the Scheller College of Business.\nMichael Oxman , a co-lead of the beyond carbon working group, said the team designed solutions that will be good for all Georgians.\n\"We want to ensure that these solutions create benefits for all but perhaps especially for under-resourced populations that are most vulnerable to climate change impacts,\" said Oxman, who is managing director of the\u00a0Ray C. Anderson Center and professor of the practice in the Scheller College of Business.\nEach proposal had to meet four criteria. It had to be technologically and market ready for Georgia. The state had to have sufficient local experience and data to implement them. They had to remove at least one megaton of carbon dioxide equivalent from the atmosphere per year. Finally,\u00a0 they had to be cost-effective.\nMany of the proposals will pay for themselves, according to the team\u2019s research. Such recommendations include reducing food waste, boosting rooftop solar, and cogeneration \u2013 the simultaneous generation of electricity and thermal energy for heating or cooling.\nThe research team will further refine the 20 solutions to a list of five high-priority action items. Those will be featured in a statewide campaign by Drawdown Georgia to encourage businesses, private sector groups, and residents to work together to put the state on the path to a zero-emissions economy by 2040.\nMeanwhile, the Georgia Tech team\u2019s work is not done. Brown already has begun planning a dashboard that will help each of Georgia\u2019s 159 counties, and their residents, to track progress on key parameters. An early version of the dashboard could be available by next summer, Brown said.\nAlso, the Scheller College of Business will take the lead in corporate engagement\u00a0efforts to bring business on board to support the goals.\nThis week\u2019s rollout features a series of events, from an opening night celebration on Saturday to a series of civic dinners. The campaign plans to engage Georgia residents in citizen science and action on climate change.\nDrawdown Georgia is based on\nProject Drawdown , founded by environmentalist and author Paul Hawken. That project seeks to reach \u201cdrawdown,\u201d the point at which levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere start to decline, as quickly, safely, and equitably as possible.\nThe Georgia effort is the first in the country to adopt the Project Drawdown model. The\nRay C. Anderson Foundation\nis funding the project, including the research at Georgia Tech and other universities.\nIn addition to Brown, other Georgia Tech researchers involved in the work include\nDaniel Matisoff \u00a0from the School of Public Policy,\u00a0 Kim Cobb \u00a0of the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences,\u00a0 Mike Rodgers \u00a0from the School of Civil and Environmental Engineering,\u00a0 Rich Simmons \u00a0in Mechanical Engineering and the Strategic Energy Institute, and\u00a0 Laura Taylor , chair and professor in the School of Economics.\nTo view the full list of solutions, visit the Drawdown Georgia website at\u00a0 https://www.drawdownga.org/\nAdditional Images\nContact\nMichael Pearson\nmichael.pearson@iac.gatech.edu\nEmail\nmichael.pearson@iac.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
