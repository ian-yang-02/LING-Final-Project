The center will operate out of Georgia Tech\u2019s Strategic Energy Institute (SEI) and provide an unbiased and interdisciplinary framework for informing energy policy and systems analysis for the Southeast region.\nWhile located at Georgia Tech, the center will tap into regional expertise within academia, think tanks, businesses, non-governmental organizations (NGO), and research facilities. \u00a0Conferences, workshops and symposiums will also be held at the center, which will serve as a neutral facilitator of a range of interdisciplinary academic, business and nongovernmental stakeholders to discuss relevant, important energy issues.\n\u201cOur region depends on us to help address our unique energy challenges,\u201d said Georgia Tech President G. P. \u201cBud\u201d Peterson.\u00a0 \u201cI can think of no better way to explore solutions to these challenges than to bring together the best minds and resources in the region. We look forward to working with experts in regional utilities, academics, industry, national labs and the Department of Energy to deliver pragmatic solutions with maximum impact in the Southeast.\u201d\nAccording to \u201c Rising to the Challenge\u201d , a report produced by the National Research Council, federally-funded research and development has not been connected to state and regional industrial development. Bridging that gap can create the local talent and technology base needed to convert these U. S. investments into domestic companies, industries, and jobs. The report also documented that private businesses and local education institutions are among those organizations in the best positions to identify opportunities, gauge competitive strengths, and mobilize wide community support for regional cluster initiatives.\nThere is growing recognition that solutions to global energy challenges must be tackled at a regional level.\u00a0 U.S. Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz spoke in support of just such an approach during a recent meeting hosted by The Pew Charitable Trusts. \u201cDifferent parts of the country have different resources, challenges, and capabilities, and having a component managed at the regional level, we think, can best address those,\u201d Moniz said.\nThe Southeast region has a diverse energy mix, with natural gas power generation growing at about double the national rate, is home to the only new nuclear plants in the country, and is a leader in deploying utility scale solar.\u00a0 It is also a global leader in industrial big data, hosting the largest global concentration of corporate facilities that are aggregating, analyzing, and remotely controlling major energy infrastructure.\n\u201cThe center will focus around these distinctives and engage a variety of regional stakeholders, to produce rigorous, fact-based policy studies and analyses that will address southeastern perspectives on global, national and regional energy issues\u201d, said SEI executive director, Tim Lieuwen.\nThe goal is to broaden views and approaches for energy innovation, for example, by including policy, economic, even social considerations along with conventional technological factors. As such, this venture is the first known implementation of a regional partnership to focus on the interdependencies of energy policy and technology toward the pragmatic realization of clean, reliable, affordable energy solutions.\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nAbout the EPICenter\nContact\nJhai James, Communications Officer\nStrategic Energy Institute\njhai.james@energy.gatech.edu\n404.385.4198\nEmail\nbrent.verrill@research.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
