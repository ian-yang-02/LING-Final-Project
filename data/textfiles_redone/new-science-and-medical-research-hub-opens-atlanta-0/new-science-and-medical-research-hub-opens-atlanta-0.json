A ribbon-cutting ceremony is planned for April 25.\n\u201cThe opening of Science Square\u2019s first phase represents one of the most exciting developments to come to Atlanta in recent years,\u201d said \u00c1ngel Cabrera, president of Georgia Tech. \u201cThe greatest advances in innovation often emerge from dense technological ecosystems, and Science Square provides our city with its first biomedical research district, which will help innovators develop and scale their ideas into marketable solutions.\u201d\nScience Square\u2019s first phase includes Science Square Labs, a 13-story purpose-built tower with state-of-the-art infrastructure to accommodate wet and dry labs and clean room space. To promote overall energy efficiency as well as sustainability, the complex houses a massive 38,000-square-foot solar panel. The solar panel system is in addition to an energy recovery system that extracts energy from the building\u2019s exhaust air and returns it to the building\u2019s HVAC system, reducing carbon dioxide emissions. Electrochromic windows, which tint during the day to block ultraviolet rays and steady the temperature while also controlling the environment \u2014 key in research labs \u2014 are also featured throughout the building.\nEquipped with technologically advanced amenities and infrastructure, Science Square Labs serves as a nexus for groundbreaking research, enabling collaboration between academia, industry, and startup ventures. Portal Innovations, a company specializing in life sciences venture development, is among the first tenants to establish operations at Science Square, as Atlanta takes center stage as the country\u2019s top city for research and development employment growth.\nThe opening of the complex\u2019s first phase, just south of Georgia Tech\u2019s campus and totaling 18 acres, also features retail space and The Grace Residences developed by High Street Residential, TCC's residential subsidiary. The 280-unit multifamily tower, already welcoming tenants, is named in honor of renowned Atlanta leader and Georgia State Representative Grace Towns Hamilton who spent many years championing this community.\nBeyond its scientific endeavors, Science Square embodies Georgia Tech\u2019s commitment to uplifting the local community. By collaborating with organizations like Westside Works, Science Square aims to empower residents through targeted workforce development initiatives and economic opportunities.\n\u201cThis mixed-use development adds immense value to Atlanta\u2019s west side and will lead the development of pioneering medical advances with the power to improve and save lives,\u201d President Cabrera added.\nAdditional Media\nRelated links\nGeorgia Tech Breaks Ground on Science Square\nhttps://news.gatech.edu/news/2022/04/14/construction-begin-science-square-life-\u2026\nContact\nAngela Barajas Prendiville\nDirector, Media Relations\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nAyana Isles\nSenior Media Relations Representative\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
