Its\u00a0 100th anniversary \u00a0this flu season serves as a reminder to close flu vaccine supply gaps that may be costing hundred to thousands of lives now and could cost many more when\u00a0 the next \u201cbig one\u201d strikes , researchers say.\nU.S. flu vaccine distribution logistics could use an update, according to Pinar Keskinocak. The researcher at the Georgia Institute of Technology\nco-led a recent study\nthat compared the current approach with a proposed allocation method calculated to save many more lives in a pandemic or similarly intense influenza outbreak that taxes vaccine supplies.\nThe study's recommendations, which apply to resupplying vaccine stocks during a running outbreak, boil\u00a0down to this: To put a bigger dent in the spread of flu, replenish vaccine stocks in regions where they are being used up and don't replenish them in areas where vaccines are just sitting on shelves, because few people are getting flu shots there.\nA simple tweak\nThe tweak in the supply chain could also save thousands of lives\u00a0annually in regular flu seasons in the U.S., which can be plenty deadly. A flu season can take more lives than murders in the same time period.\n\u201cEven seasonal flu\nkills\u00a0tens of thousands\u00a0of people\neach year, so we would benefit immediately,\u201d said Keskinocak, who is\u00a0 William W. George Chair and Professor in Georgia Tech\u2019s H. Milton Stewart School of Industrial and Systems Engineering and Director for the Center of Health and Humanitarian Systems .\n\u201cIn a pandemic, nearly no one would have natural immunity, so the death toll could be significantly high if we don\u2019t improve vaccine coverage.\u201d\nWhat makes a pandemic a pandemic? The flu virus represents a mutation that human immune systems have not had a chance to build prior resistance to, thus the lack of natural immunity. When the next one strikes, in addition to the many lives saved, the researchers\u2019 recommendations could massively prevent\u00a0 flu infections, secondary infections like bronchitis, hospitalizations, and unnecessarily high medical costs .\nKeskinocak, co-principal investigator\nJulie Swann\nfrom North Carolina State University, and first author Zihao Li of Georgia Tech\u00a0 published their results in the journal\u00a0 Plos One \u00a0 in October 2018, around the start of the 2018-19 flu season. The research was supported by the Harold R. and Mary Anne Nash Junior Faculty Endowment Fund.\nA logic breakdown\nWhen a pandemic hits, or a flu season that taxes the vaccine stocks, vaccine supply may become limited but then catch up over time. When that happens, the vaccine distributors commonly take what\u2019s called the population-based approach.\n\u201cAreas with larger populations get more vaccine, proportional to the population. It\u2019s a straightforward approach that seems fair,\u201d Swann said.\nAs more vaccine becomes available over time, restocking follows the same principle, and that is where distribution logic breaks down. In some regions, few people get vaccinated, but under population-based allocation, resupply stocks go there anyway and may go to waste. Meanwhile, restocking may fall short of demand elsewhere, where people are lining up for inoculations.\nA mathematical fix\nAs a result, in a pandemic, people eager for a vaccination might not get one despite adequate vaccine production, and the resulting additional unvaccinated people are more likely to get the flu and also spread it to others. That intensifies the outbreak for the entire population.\nThe wasted vaccine stocks also drain medical finances, and the new model would releave some of that strain even in regular flu seasons.\n\u201cProduction, storage, and delivery of vaccine are costly, and unused inventory can\u2019t just be thrown away. It costs money to dispose of,\u201d Keskinocak said.\nRestocking doses where they are actually being used would benefit the entire population by boosting the total number of vaccinated individuals, who would then be less likely to get sick and to infect other people. That would tamp down the flu wave for everybody.\nA data dearth\nLeftover inventory could be slashed to about 20 percent of current levels, saving considerable costs, and the data about which areas were not resupplied could be used to identify areas where more\u00a0people need encouragement to get vaccinated.\n\u201cThe data would tell you where you need continued education about the importance of vaccination, and some of the money saved from unnecessary resupplying could be invested in public health campaigns,\u201d said Swann, who collaborated with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention during the\n2009-10 H1N1 Swine flu pandemic.\nBut the needed data is missing at present in the U.S. vaccine distribution system.\n\u201cSurprisingly few states have systems in place that tell them how much vaccine has been administered where and how much is still left in inventory at provider locations,\u201d Swann said.\nThe next \u201cbig one\u201d\nThe next \u201cbig one\u201d flu pandemic will sneak up on humanity someday.\nUltimately, the best way to cut its death toll by more than half and save possibly hundreds of thousands of lives will be for virtually everyone to get vaccinated against influenza annually. Currently,\u00a0 fewer than 50 percent \u00a0of Americans do.\nThe 1918-19 outbreak, which may have consisted of multiple concurrent influenzas, killed 678,000 people in the U.S. Other \u201c big ones :\u201d The 1957 \u201cAsian flu\u201d killed 116,000 in the U.S.; the 1968 \u201cHong Kong flu\u201d killed 100,000. The 2009 bird flu pandemic, which was a less contagious virus, killed 12,500 people in the U.S. and hospitalized some 275,000.\nAlso Read: Want to beat antibiotic-resistant superbugs?
