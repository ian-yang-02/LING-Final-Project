The Miura-ori looks like rows of folded zig-zags, while the eggbox pattern resembles a mountain range with repeating peaks and valleys.\nBoth are capable of being compressed into a very small space, but when expanded they behave differently from one another in how they respond to bending. The eggbox pattern resembles a dome when bent, and the Miura-ori takes the shape of a saddle.\n\u201cTraditionally, if you have an eggbox pattern, you are locked into the characteristics of that particular pattern,\u201d said Paulino, who is also the Raymond Allen Jones Chair of Engineering in the School of Civil and Environmental Engineering. \u201cWith this new pattern, which we are calling morph, that\u2019s no longer the case.\u201d\nThe new origami pattern achieves its morphing ability by a redesign of the geometry of two of the four planes that comprise one section of the origami. By shrinking those two planes on one side, it enables their creases to shift from a mountain to a valley, or in other words, to fold in the opposite direction.\nAnd importantly, the transition from peak to valley can occur whether the origami is formed from a flexible material such as paper or a rigid material such as metal.\nThat means, for example, that origami-based structures used for acoustic systems \u2013 which already are capable of expanding and contracting to increase or decrease the volume of the sound response \u2013 could go one step further, changing how they bend to potentially offer an even greater range of resonant responses. In the example of the drone crash protection system, the new origami pattern could potentially offer other customization options or alter aspects of its impact resistance, Paulino said.\n\u201cNSF\u2019s investments in fundamental research of architected materials has pushed the frontiers and created \u2018shape-shifting\u2019 structures for\u00a0applications in space exploration, robotics and medicine,\u201d said\u00a0Robert B. Stone,\u00a0NSF\u2019s\u00a0Civil, Mechanical\u00a0and Manufacturing Innovation division director.\nThe new origami pattern is also capable of taking on a hybrid structure, where certain rows are folded into one configuration and others were folded in the other. In such a configuration, the structure would exhibit characteristics of both types.\n\u201cThere are a large number of combinations in terms of how these could be configured, which offers a lot of customization possibilities for structures based on the morph pattern,\u201d said Ke Liu, a former graduate student at Georgia Tech and now a postdoctoral scholar at the California Institute of Technology.\nAnother unique characteristic of the morph pattern is what happens when a Miura-ori row is situated between two eggbox rows. Typically, when tension is applied to pull apart either of the patterns, they respond by giving in and flattening their shape. However, in this new instance, the Miura-ori pattern locks into place.\n\u201cThe locking is very strong, and there is no way to break that hold other than to tear the entire structure apart,\u201d said Phanisri Pratapa, a former postdoctoral fellow at Georgia Tech and now an assistant professor of civil engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology Madras.\nThe locking could enable structures to limit the amount of expansion possible and change that limit on the fly, Pratapa said.\nThis research was supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF) under grant CMMI-1538830 and the Raymond Allen Jones Chair at the Georgia Institute of Technology.
