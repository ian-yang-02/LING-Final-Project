And with the holidays around the corner comes the added stress of traveling to visit family and friends or maybe spending the holidays away from loved ones. For some, it can be hard to manage.\n\u201cStress is not automatically bad or unhealthy. It is part of being a human and growing and facing challenges,\u201d said Vidal Annan Jr., senior director of the Center for Mental Health Care and Resources in Student Engagement and Well-Being. \u201cWhen we step out of our comfort zone, chances are we will be experiencing something new. And when there's something new, there\u2019s a chance it may be stressful. That stress must be managed because when stress becomes too intense, too frequent, or lasts too long it starts to shift from stress to distress\n\u2014\nand we want to avoid distress as much as possible.\u201d\nRegardless of the source of stress, there are unhealthy as well as helpful ways to manage it. Annan identified some unhealthy behaviors to avoid.\nDistraction: focusing\non things that are not important or that are not meaningful. \u201cLooking at social media or playing a game on your phone takes you away from the stressful situation temporarily, but when you turn off the phone the stress is still there.\u201d\nAvoidance: staying\naway from things that are meaningful and important. \u201cSelf-isolation is an avoidance technique. You\u2019re not seeking out something else, but you\u2019re tuning out, shutting down, or withdrawing from everything.\nOverthinking: focusing on worrying or rumination. You are trying to predict the future, or you\u2019re wishing something different happened in the past. \u201cO verthinking fools the mind into thinking that it is problem solving. But it\u2019s just getting caught up in the problem, not looking at a solution.\u201d\nOther unhealthy ways for dealing with stress include taking the following actions to the extreme: sleeping; shopping or \u201cretail therapy;\u201d eating too much or too little; substance abuse; unhealthy sexual behavior; self-harm; or suicidal thinking.\n\u201cIf any of these actions become a pattern, they can become problematic,\u201d Annan said.\nSelf-Care Is Helpful\nPeople often associate the term \u201cself-care\u201d with pampering or self-indulgence, such as getting a massage or having a slice of cake after a tough day. But it doesn\u2019t have to be that narrowly defined.\n\u201cSelf-care doesn\u2019t have to be fun, but it does have to be deliberate,\u201d Annan said. \u201cSelf-care is living a life that rejuvenates you and makes you healthier, stronger, and mentally fit. That means taking care of yourself on a regular basis and preparing for the demands that are coming.\u201d\nHe said it\u2019s important to dedicate time to the following:\nSleep. Follow a consistent schedule and get enough sleep. Most people need between six and nine hours each night.\nNutrition and hydration. Eat consistently and drink enough water. \u201cThe mind and body are connected, and we get \u2018hangry\u2019 when we don\u2019t eat. If something stressful happens when we are hungry, we may feel very irritable, but we\u2019re not angry because of what happened. We\u2019re just hungry.\u201d\nMovement (not exercise). \u201cWe used to have natural movement from farming, doing manual labor, and walking because we didn\u2019t have cars. Today we exercise because we don\u2019t have enough natural movement in our lives.\u201d We don\u2019t have to rely on a gym or workout equipment, we can try to incorporate natural movement, such as gardening, dance, or taking the stairs.\nSocialization. \u201cWe are not meant to be solitary. Engaging with others helps us to manage stress better.\u201d Wanting to vent to a friend when you are stressed is a healthy response.\nLeisure time. Engage with your hobbies or creative interests. \u201cRemember when you were 5 years old and you did things just for fun\n\u2014\nlike drawing or building model planes? When was the last time you did that?\u201d Revisit the things that brought you pure joy.\nReflection. Take the time to attend to your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, and look at your life in relation to other things, whether that is your values, faith, or ideals. Counseling, meditating, or journaling can be a great way to reflect.\nReach out for help. Students experiencing a mental health crisis that requires immediate attention may speak with a counselor at any time 24 hours a day, seven days a week.\u00a0During regular business hours, students who are not actively in crisis but would like to schedule a counseling appointment may call\n404.894.2575\nor walk-in to the Center for Mental Health Care and Resources located on the second floor, Suite 238, Smithgall Student Services Building, 353 Ferst Drive NW Atlanta GA 30313.

Walking around the neighborhood gives me a chance to enjoy some exercise and quiet time to reflect. I tend to stay busy throughout the day in meetings and teaching classes, so this time in the evening is a good opportunity to decompress.\u201d\n\u2014Donald Webster, Karen and John Huff School Chair, School of Civil and Environmental Engineering\n\u201cI really enjoy listening to music, as it helps put me in a better headspace and concentrate on what I need to accomplish for the end of the day. I have combined this with exercise by trying to go to cycling classes at least twice a week, which provides dedicated time for me to just focus on moving my body and getting into a more positive headspace.\u201d\n\u2014Nicole McClelland, fourth-year, materials science and engineering major\n\u201cGenerally, I walk home slowly looking at trees, gardens, street life, and architecture. No headset, no podcast\n\u2014\njust visual pleasure. During the workday, when it gets stressful, I sit on my balcony in East Architecture and do the same with a little deep breathing.\u00a0Georgia Tech\u2019s campus has become so verdant and beautiful in the last decade and my birdfeeder is pretty popular.\u00a0At home, it is music.\u00a0I have speakers everywhere and I listen to a lot of Erik Satie. The best way to unwind in the evenings, however, is with live music\n\u2014\nlike Georgia Tech orchestra, jazz, and choral concerts at Ferst. And they are free!\u201d\n\u2014Ellen Bassett, dean and John Portman Chair, College of Design\n\u201cGetting outside to exercise is my primary outlet and stress reliever, and I try to integrate that into my day. Most mornings I run a mile before doing anything else, regardless of the temperature or weather. On days I take MARTA to work, I bring my bike and ride home, which is a great way to decompress and refresh for my family. If I drive in, I bring my running shoes, so I can either run around campus after work, or stop on the BeltLine or a trail. In the last year, I\u2019ve started taking a \u2018digital sabbath\u2019 on Sundays. Since I live on screens the rest of the week, that separation from text, email, and social media before the week starts has been incredibly renewing.\u201d\n\u2014Rick Clark, assistant vice provost and executive director, Undergraduate Admission\n\u201cI am a swimmer and a morning person.\u00a0As such, I start most every morning with a swim. I swim before coffee, before breakfast and even before email.\u00a0I swim outdoors year-round and so for a good part of the year, it is a challenge to jump in the pool in the dark and cold.\u00a0But after that plunge, I am pretty confident that the hardest part of my day is now behind me. At the end of the day, I relieve stress by quickly pivoting to my role as daughter, mother, wife, sister, and friend.\u00a0A call to discuss what is going on in their lives helps me put aside small worries of my own.\u00a0And in the middle of the day, there is always chocolate.\u201d\n\u2014Susan Lozier, dean and Betsy Middleton and John Clark Sutherland Chair, College of Sciences\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nCenter for Mental Health Care and Resources\nEmployee Assistance Program\nTips for Mindful Eating During the Holidays\nTips for Balanced Snacking\nContact\nVictor Rogers\nInstitute Communications\nAdditional information\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
