We asked several readers for recommendations. The books range from an anthology of poems with commentary by Edward Hirsch, a top poetry critic, to a climate fiction novel set in the near future.\nThe Sweetness at the Bottom of the Pie: A Flavia de Luce Mystery\nBy Alan Bradley, Bantam Books, 2010\n\u201cIf you are a fan of precocious, nerdy children and British murder mysteries, you\u2019ll love amateur chemist/detective Flavia de Luce.\u00a0 The Sweetness at the Bottom of the Pie\nis the first in a mystery series driven by Flavia\u2019s unrelenting curiosity and resourcefulness.\u00a0She is a 10-year-old MacGyver studying poisons in her crumbling English ancestral home in the 1950s, freely ranging around the countryside, stalking alleged murderers, and narrowly avoiding scrapes. If you like this one, you\u2019ll be pleased to know there are several more in the series and they just get better.\u201d\n\u2014Kelley Broome, corporate relations manager, Jones MBA Center, Scheller College of Business\nThe Ministry for the Future\nBy Kim Stanley Robinson, Orbit Books, 2020\n\u201cThe Ministry for the Future,\na\u00a0climate fiction\n\u2014\nor \u201ccli-fi\u201d\n\u2014\nnovel, \u00a0is relevant to today\u2019s landscape of record-breaking droughts and heat waves, record breaking precipitation and flooding, wildfires and powerful storms \u2014 clear reminders that climate challenges are real. Set in the near future, the story places you in the center of an organization created by the Paris Climate Agreement to work on behalf of future generations. A\u00a0thriller, social science commentary, and detailed scientific case study,\nThe Ministry for the Future \u00a0is an engaging and satisfying work of science fiction sure to broaden readers\u2019 understanding of the effects of climate change and the options available to us to today to alter its impact.\u201d\n\u2014Daren Hubbard, vice president of Information Technology and chief information officer\n100 Poems to Break Your Heart\nBy Edward Hirsch, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2021\n\u201cEdward Hirsch\u2019s\n100 Poems to Break Your Heart\nis an anthology of selected poems that span from the 19th century to the present and includes poems originally written in English, as well as translations of poems from many other languages, such as Greek, French, Spanish, Russian, Yiddish, and German. Each poem is accompanied by Hirsch\u2019s accessible commentary. He is among our top thinkers and critics of poetry, and his insights into the poems get right to the emotional core of each piece. Don\u2019t let the title of the book fool you \u2014 while many of the poems in this collection might deal with grief or sadness, this book is anything but a downer. These 100 essential poems, as Hirsch says, \u2018make us feel less alone and more connected.\u2019 That\u2019s what good poems do.\u201d\n\u2014Travis Denton, associate director, Poetry@Tech, and editor,\nTerminus Magazine\nThe Summer Place\nBy Jennifer Weiner, Simon and Schuster, 2022\n\u201cThere is a house with feelings and memories held by its family. There is a global pandemic, as well as uncomfortable family arrangements, an engagement, and lots of \u2018Wait, what?\u2019 Find a nice seat out in the sun or a comfy chair to read this joy by Jennifer Weiner.\u00a0She wrote this book after reading an article about houses having feelings and holding our memories. She took that article and brought it to life. One of the main characters in this novel is the house which wants to protect the family.\u00a0Grab a comfortable spot and a notebook, because you will definitely need it.\u00a0Enjoy one of my favorite novels of the last three years.\u201d\n\u2014Lauren Morton, academic program manager, Clark Scholars and Dean\u2019s Scholars Program, College of Engineering\nMad Honey: A Novel\nBy Jodi Picoult and Jennifer Finney Boylan, Ballantine Books, 2022\n\u201cThis novel follows Olivia McAfee and Lily Campanello on their life journey of starting over. Through a series of suspenseful events and stories, the two find themselves connected as Lily falls in love with Olivia\u2019s son, Asher. One day, Olivia\u2019s world is rocked when she receives a phone call that Lily is dead and Asher is being questioned. The story follows both of their lived experiences, uncovering secrets and stories untold, an unforgettable love story, and the power of family. I could not put this book down and loved the emotions that it led me through as I learned what their stories held.\u201d\n\u2014Tim Edmonds-King, learning consultant, Workplace Learning and Professional Development, Georgia Tech Professional Education\nAn Assassin in Utopia: The True Story of a Nineteenth-Century Sex Cult and a President\u2019s Murder\nBy Susan Wels, Pegasus Crime, 2023\n\u201cSusan Wels tells a gripping story about the assassination of President James A. Garfield in 1881, but the book is about so much more. It is a sweeping exploration of Victorian America, including major intellectual currents, the minutiae of political parties and schemes, and colorful, larger than life characters. Wels examines one of many 19th-century utopian settlements \u2014 Oneida, in upstate New York, which was organized around principles of free love and gender equality, but in practice would prove disturbing to both Victorian and modern eyes \u2014 and a delusional resident who sought to save the Republican Party by killing a president. It\u2019s every bit as engrossing as a novel.\u201d\n\u2014 Stacy Braukman, senior writer and editor, Institute Communications\nMonkey Hunting\nBy Cristina Garcia, Knopf, 2003\n\u201cThis novel follows a family through four generations, but it is not a wealthy family, not one of the privileged elites. It is an ordinary family\n\u2014\nor \u2018ordinary\u2019 for each time period, just people like millions of their contemporaries. The story spans from the mid-19th century to the late 20th century, and it begins\nwith a man being duped into enslavement.\nWhile a portion of the story takes place in the United States, most of it is set in Cuba and in China.\u00a0 The book is detailed, yet moves quickly, showing some of the ways humans hurt each other and some of the ways we help each other.\u00a0 It can be a bit depressing to notice the ties to human depravity, but the strands of common human goodness and the demonstrations of resilience are what I am left with at the end of this lyrical and slightly magical book.\u201d\n\u2014Amy Bass Henry, executive director, Office of International Education\nDarktown\nBy Thomas Mullen, 37INK/ATRIA, 2016\n\u201cThis is a murder mystery that tells the story of two of the first eight black police officers hired, due to political pressure, by the Atlanta Police Department in the sweltering heat of the summer of 1948. The two are investigating the murder of a woman, and they suspect a fellow officer may be the culprit. This work of historical fiction is a must-read for those living in the city. Mullen takes you back in time with his vivid imagery and attention to detail, to a world that was not so long ago.\u201d\n\u2014DeMarco Williams, digital project manager, Georgia Tech Professional Education\nThe New Map: Energy, Climate, and the Clash of Nations\nBy Daniel Yergin, Penguin Random House, 2020\n\u201cIf you\u2019re looking for the best roundup yet of the critical factors weighing on the international energy industry but don\u2019t want to feel like you\u2019re slogging through an oil company\u2019s earnings report, consider Daniel Yergin\u2019s\nThe New Map: Energy, Climate, and the Clash of Nations.\nThe book is a very accessible update to his 1991 best-seller\nThe Prize , which won its own prize, a Pulitzer.\nThe New Map\ngives economist-historian Yergin a chance to check in on the U.S., China, Russia, and the Middle East, and how the rise of shale oil production, a climate crisis, a pandemic, and volatile geopolitics have caused tectonic shifts within the industry, which Yergin has tracked since the mid-1970s. He uses the latest data, science, and technological advances to help readers navigate\nThe New Map\nfor oil and gas in the 21st century.\u201d\n\u2014 Renay San Miguel, communications officer, College of Sciences\nAdditional Images\nContact\nVictor Rogers\nInstitute Communications\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
