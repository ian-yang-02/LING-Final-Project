Her strength motivated many to follow in her footsteps and now her presence, through a new sculpture on Georgia Tech\u2019s campus, will inspire generations to come.\nThe unveiling of the Rosa Parks installation took place April 5, the day after the nation observed the 50 th\nanniversary of Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s assassination.\nParks refused to give up her seat on a segregated city bus in Montgomery, Ala. That bold act sparked the bus boycott, which catapulted King into the national spotlight and galvanized the civil rights movement.\nThe bronze and granite sculpture installation depicts Parks at 42 years old, the age when her actions inspired the boycott, and at 92 years old, the age she died. The two sit across from one another, with an empty seat between them. It\u2019s an invitation for others to join them in conversation and action.\nLeah Miller, president of Tech\u2019s African American Student Union, said she and other students have learned a lot of about the civil rights movement and its leaders from family and school.\n\u201cLike most of my peers, I am two generations removed from these change-makers,\u201d she said. \u201cAs we walk to class, other activities and events, we and generations after us will be able to pause, remember the past and continue the conversation as we prepare to shape the future.\u201d\nThe statue, titled\nContinuing the Conversation , sits in Harrison Square. The area is named for Georgia Tech\u2019s sixth president, Edwin D. Harrison, who presided over the integration of Tech in 1961. He did so without a court order, making the Institute the first major university in the Deep South to integrate without a court mandate.\nThe\nsculpture , designed by Atlanta artist Martin Dawe, adds to the growing collection of public art on campus.\nThe\nArts@Tech\ninitiative harnesses the power of the arts to teach, challenge and embolden community members, said Rafael L. Bras, provost and executive vice president for Academic Affairs and the K. Harrison Brown Family Chair. Interactions with the arts foster learning, stir and incite creativity and inspire courage, he said.\n\u201cVery few among us have, or will ever have, the courage of Rosa Parks,\u201d Bras said. \u201cBut it is important to remember that individuals can indeed change the world. She did. This sculpture will always remind us to do the same.\u201d\nUrana McCauley, Parks\u2019 great-niece, told the crowd how her aunt\u2019s stance on justice and racial equality never wavered, even when she endured death threats. While people often describe Parks as an icon, McCauley said \u201cshe was just an ordinary person who did an extraordinary thing.\u201d\n\u201cRemember that there is no such thing as a small act of kindness,\u201d McCauley said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be an icon like Rosa Parks to do extraordinary things. My hope and desire is that this sculpture will inspire and create conversations that turn into action, and people want to get involved.\u201d\nPhilanthropic support for Continuing the Conversation came from Tech alumni Rod and Michelle Adkins.\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nContinuing the Conversation\nA Single Act of Courage\nContact\nLaura Diamond\nMedia Relations\u00a0 laura.diamond@gatech.edu\n404-660-2927\nEmail\nlaura.diamond@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
