Since any employee can initiate a requisition, the Procurement Receipt Bot has the potential to reduce the administrative burden for anyone involved in making purchases.\n\u201cWe are excited about the potential of technology, like RPA, to automate manual and repetitive processes in our day-to-day business activities,\u201d said Ajay Patel, executive director of Procurement and Business Services. \u201cThe Procurement Receipt Bot will enable us to process and pay Georgia Tech\u2019s invoices in a timelier manner while reducing the administrative burden on employees \u2014 it creates a win-win outcome.\u201d\nIt is important to note that the Procurement Receipt Bot is not intended to replace the existing receipt process. It will only assist with creating receipts to pay invoices that have missing receipts, which accounts for approximately 300 to 400 invoices in the daily queue. As a reminder, it is best practice for users to create receipts as items are delivered to Georgia Tech as opposed to waiting for the invoice.\nOnce operational, the Procurement Receipt Bot will run daily and initiate receipts for purchase orders where an invoice has been submitted and a receipt has not been created. Requisition Requesters will receive Workday inbox notifications alerting them to approve the automated receipts. Once approved, the invoice will be routed for payment.\nResources:\nA\nguide for Requisition Requesters\nto use when reviewing and approving these receipts.\nIf you have additional questions on how to enter a receipt, please review the ServiceNow article\nCreating a Receipt in Workday .\nQuestions and comments can be submitted via\nServiceNow .\nAdditional Images\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
