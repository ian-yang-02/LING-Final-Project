For more than a century, scientists have been searching for materials able to accomplish the feat at room temperature and ambient pressure.\n\u201cThe main challenge of the [artificial intelligence/machine learning] method is that we need, but never have, the desired database of superconductors,\u201d said\nHuan Tran , senior research scientist in the Georgia Tech\nSchool of Materials Science and Engineering . \u201cAll previous works relied on databases that are sometimes large enough, but completely lacking in atomic-level information \u2014 which is absolutely crucial for accurate predictions.\u201d\nTran and Tuoc Vu from Hanoi University have been building a database with that atomic-level information, filling in a critical gap in available data so they can train machine learning models to accurately predict promising superconductive materials.\nMore details about their work from the San Diego Supercomputer Center.\nContact\nJoshua Stewart\nEmail\njstewart@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
