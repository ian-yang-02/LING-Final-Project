Overall, the system averaged an increase of 1.3% in spring 2021.\nThanks to strong enrollment numbers and healthier than expected state tax revenue collections, Georgia Tech is receiving $33 million in new state formula funding for fiscal year 2022. In total, state appropriations account for 16% of Georgia Tech\u2019s FY22 budget of $2.3 billion.\nIn looking at Georgia Tech\u2019s overall budget, it is important to understand the vulnerability of state appropriations, which has been increasing in dollars along with Tech's enrollment but declining as a percentage of the total budget for nearly a decade. This year, tuition revenue exceeds state appropriations for the 12th consecutive year.\nIn addition, the Board of Regents (BOR) also voted to keep\ntuition and mandatory fees\n\u2013\u00a0another source of revenue for USG institutions \u2013 steady across the system for the upcoming academic year.\n\u201cWhile we are very fortunate to end this year better than expected, there are sensitivities, and we need to be mindful of all the variables that contribute to the health of our budget,\u201d Fox said.\nThe rollout of the Institute\u2019s strategic plan earlier this year is helping to guide how Tech will invest this new funding to advance many of the Institute\u2019s goals and values. Here are a few highlights from the approved FY22 budget:\nRetention and support of our talented faculty and staff:\n$8.5 million initially budgeted for faculty and staff equity pool adjustments. While merit increases are not funded by the state in FY22, Georgia Tech is able to provide equity adjustments with the potential to reevaluate minimum wages and review current salary ranges with market comparisons. This reflects the minimum amount of investment pending fall semester tuition revenues. Adjustments are expected in the first and second quarters of FY22.\nMore than $3.5 million for faculty startup packages.\n$800,000 for faculty and staff retention pool, with $400,000 budgeted for each.\n$740,000 for faculty promotion and tenure.\nStudents are our top priority:\n$1.2 million for student advisory positions (financial, academic, and admission) across the Institute to help ensure student success.\n$750,000 to support graduate students primarily by covering the increased costs in student health insurance plans for graduate teaching and research assistants.\n$750,000 to help fund graduate teaching assistant stipends as well as increasing the number of teaching assistants.\n$300,000 to create career educator positions.\nSupport of the Institute\u2019s growth:\nNearly $2 million for building and associated infrastructure renovations.\n$1.3 million for capital campaign support.\n$890,000 to create positions to support OneUSG.\nAs Georgia Tech moves into fiscal year beginning July 1, more information related to the budget will be made available.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nJamie Fernandes\nExecutive Director\nInstitute Budget Planning and Administration\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
