Taylor wants to take the program.\nIn May, the Board of Regents approved the shift in the school\u2019s U.S. Department of Education Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP) Code from \u201cgeneral economics\u201d to \u201ceconometrics and quantitative economics.\u201d The change, which takes effect this semester, makes Georgia Tech's School of Economics program the only one in the University System of Georgia to have the STEM designation.\n\u201cThis designation reflects who we are and what we are building in the School of Economics,\u201d\nTaylor\nsaid. \u201cThe foundational tools of economics are mathematics and statistics. We couple theoretical models of behavior and decision-making with state of the art data analytics to understand and solve the most important questions facing society and business today.\u201d\nLeveraging a \u2018Gold-Standard Economics Education\u2019\nThe new designation will not result in changes to degree programs. It may, however, be a benefit to some foreign students who come to Georgia Tech to study economics. Under U.S. Department of Homeland Security regulations, foreign students who obtain STEM degrees may remain in the United States to work for up to three years after graduation under the Optional Practical Training (OPT) program. Students who earn non-STEM degrees are allowed to remain for only one year.\nCasey Hampton, recruitment and retention director, said the new designation will help \u201cincrease the visibility and reputation of the School and help us attract, recruit, and matriculate students.\u201d\n\u201cThis is a great opportunity to leverage what is already already a gold-standard economics education here at Georgia Tech,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is true for international students, who gain an extra year of OPT, but also for our domestic students, who now will be classified as STEM graduates.\u201d\nThe classification could potentially also open up new sponsored research opportunities for faculty, said Associate Professor\nShatakshee Dhondge .\n\u201cEconomics relies heavily on rigorous, quantitative analysis to solve real world problems,\u201d she said. \u201cSo the STEM designation is a perfect fit for the School of Economics at Georgia Tech.\u201d\nGrowing the STEM Connection\nThe School has already added new faculty positions in economic theory and econometrics, which is the application of statistics to the analysis of economic data. New assistant professors\u2014Dylan Brewer,\nMaxwell Rosenthal\nand\nKaren Yan \u2014work in the areas of market design, behavioral economics, energy and environmental economics, and big data analytics.\nAdditional classes in high demand across campus, such as those focused on the economics of strategy and information and behavioral economics, are also on the way, Taylor said.\n\u201cThe STEM nature of economics is reflected in the strong demand for our classes at Georgia Tech.\u201d Taylor said.\u00a0\u201cOur game theory course offered this fall reached capacity on the first day of registration.\u201d\nTaylor also expects the School to add more capacity in data analytics\u2014already a growing area of emphasis.\nFor instance, the Health Economics and Analytics Lab (HEAL), led by School of Economics Professor\nDanny R. Hughes , uses big data analytics and artificial intelligence to analyze large-scale medical claims databases and better understand how evolving health care delivery and payment models affect patients and providers.\nHEAL recently moved to Coda, Georgia Tech\u2019s new headquarters for data analytics, and shares space with other health analytics units from around campus.\n\u201cIt is an exciting time in the School,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cThese changes reflect the strengths of our students, of the Ivan Allen College of Liberal Arts, and of Georgia Tech as a whole,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cI\u2019m proud to be a part of what we\u2019re doing here.\u201d\nThe School of Economics, which is a unit of the\nIvan Allen College of Liberal Arts , offers the Bachelor of Science degrees in economics (ECON), economics and international affairs (EIA) (jointly with the Sam Nunn School of International Affairs) and global economics and modern languages (GEML) (jointly with the School of Modern Languages).\nThe School also offers the Master of Science and the Ph.D. in Economics.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nMichael Pearson\nmichael.pearson@iac.gatech.edu\n404.894.2290\nEmail\nmichael.pearson@iac.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
