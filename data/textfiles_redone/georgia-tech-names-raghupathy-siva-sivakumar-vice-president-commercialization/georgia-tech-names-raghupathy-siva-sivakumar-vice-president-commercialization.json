Abdallah, executive vice president for Research for Georgia Tech. \u201cOur aim is to attract and nurture the best entrepreneurial minds, enabling Tech to become both a thought leader in redefining commercialization in academia and a leading university in impactful technology transfer. I have full confidence that Siva can get us there.\u201d\nFor Sivakumar, taking on the leadership of Georgia Tech\u2019s commercialization enterprise is a way of paying his entrepreneurial expertise forward. His own commercial mindset took root when he was a graduate student at the University of Illinois (Urbana-Champaign), and watched his advisor start a successful company.\nHe learned the mechanics of raising money, building product, and going to market after arriving at Georgia Tech and helping to launch a video technology startup, EG Technology, which was eventually acquired. Two more tech startups, Asankya and StarMobile followed, and both were acquired by larger firms.\n\u201cAs someone who's taken advantage of the Georgia Tech commercialization ecosystem in the past as a faculty entrepreneur, it still surprises me how rich it is, and that gives me great optimism for the road ahead,\u201d said Sivakumar, who holds the Wayne J. Holman Chair in the\u00a0 School of Electrical and Computer Engineering\nand will officially begin his new role as CCO on September 1.\nFor the past 10 months, Sivakumar has been evaluating Georgia Tech\u2019s strengths and weaknesses, laying the groundwork for a more nimble and effective commercialization ecosystem. The goal is to clarify the path to commercialization for Georgia Tech faculty, staff, and students, connecting them with the potential consumers of technology produced by the Institute\u2019s billion-dollar research program.\n\u201cThere\u2019s plenty of work to do and we have some challenges \u2013 we are working on a cultural shift, and that\u2019s not an easy thing to do,\u201d said Sivakumar. \u201cBut I\u2019ve learned so much in this role so far, and I\u2019m confident in what we\u2019ve accomplished already, particularly in effecting the student perspective on entrepreneurship.\u201d\nWith CREATE-X, Sivakumar helped start a program that empowers students with entrepreneurial knowledge and skills: In six years, more than 5,000 students have started 300-plus ventures with a total valuation of more than $750 million.\nFor the past six months, Sivakumar has been convening the commercialization visioning process, meeting with a commercialization strategy working group comprised of representatives from ATDC, Biolocity, CREATE-X, the Global Center for Medical Innovation, Georgia Research Alliance, and Venture Lab, among others.\nThe group has drafted a mission statement, a commercialization vision, and identified a set of goals around the broad idea of instilling enough entrepreneurial confidence in faculty, staff, and students, streamlining the process in turning innovative technologies into marketable products that improve the human condition.\n\u201cThese aren\u2019t my goals, this is coming from the major commercialization entities on campus,\u201d said Sivakumar. \u201cWatching these people interact, watching their willingness to collaborate across departments, gives me great confidence that we\u2019ll reach our goals.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nContact\nWriter:\nJerry Grillo\nEmail\nJerry.grillo@ibb.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
