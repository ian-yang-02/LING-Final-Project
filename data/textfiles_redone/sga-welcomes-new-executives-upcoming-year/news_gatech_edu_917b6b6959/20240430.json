Samuel Ellis and Ajanta Choudhury were recently sworn in as the undergraduate SGA president and executive vice president, respectively. And Stephen Eick and PJ Jarquin will be taking over as graduate SGA president and executive vice president.\nEick, a Ph.D. student in computer science, comes from GSGA\u2019s legislative branch, the Graduate Student Senate (GSS). Jarquin, a Ph.D. student in biomedical engineering, has spent his time in GSGA on the executive side, serving as vice president of campus services this year. He and Eick believe that, together, their experiences in different parts of student government will allow them to approach problems in a balanced way.\nEllis and Choudhury met in the Undergraduate House of Representatives (UHR) during the 2019-20 school year. After that, Ellis, an international affairs major, became vice president of external affairs, while Choudhury, a biology major, took a year away from SGA. They hope that being able to see SGA from different perspectives will help them provide solutions and address issues.\nAs their terms get underway, both teams are ready to jump into advocating for students. For the undergraduate executives, this largely focuses on academic policies, changing how students interact with the Office of Student Integrity, and helping with the shift to in-house dining in the fall. The graduate executives, meanwhile, are starting off by trying to help increase and consolidate mental health resources across campus, as well as advocate for new ways to support graduate researchers. Both groups agree that as Tech transitions toward a more familiar semester in the fall, they want to be involved in making sure that transparent, robust policies are in place to keep students safe.\nBoth sets of executives also share the desire to strengthen their particular side of SGA, which they feel will allow them to better advocate for students\u2019 needs. For example, Eick has a goal of filling every seat in GSS by the end of the year.\n\u201cWe hold ourselves back when we don\u2019t have people engaged,\u201d he said. As a member of GSS, Eick was the only representative for the College of Computing, which usually can have as many as nine representatives. He sees this as an excellent opportunity to increase both participation and diversity within GSGA.\n\u201cWe want to make sure that we\u2019re reaching different parts of campus whose voices aren\u2019t usually heard,\u201d Ellis said. For him, this means bringing new people into USGA by creating a recruitment chair position, as well as connecting people outside of the organization with Institute-wide committees where their input would be useful.\nEach new executive also has a policy that they\u2019re particularly excited to work on. For Ellis, it\u2019s finding a way to address the problem of students experiencing homelessness; Choudhury wants to improve infrastructure for students with disabilities. Eick is passionate about building a participant recruiting board for research studies across campus to strengthen graduate student research, while Jarquin plans on advocating for more LGBTQ+-friendly health resources.\nThe new SGA leadership is ultimately humbled by the opportunity to serve their fellow students.\n\u201cTo be in this role is to empower and uplift those in the same way that I felt empowered and uplifted by former executives in student government,\u201d said Choudhury. \u201cBeing in this role isn\u2019t just about improving the student experience, but really empowering the next generation of student leaders.\u201d\n\u201cComing from an immigrant father, being raised in the South, and being gay, it\u2019s important for me to be in a role as visible as this,\u201d Jarquin said. \u201cIt really is an honor to be in the position to fight for all graduate students.\u201d\nApplications\nare currently open to be an executive committee chair for undergraduate SGA; applications are rolling, but those interested should apply by Friday, May 7, to be considered.
