This dramatic growth brings challenges on a variety of fronts, transforming \u201csmart cities\u201d from a catchy phrase into a critical endeavor.\nGeorgia Tech has been intensifying its smart cities initiative, including membership in the national MetroLab Network and the launch of a new faculty council with members from more than a dozen university units.\n\u201cSmart cities is a highly complex area, encompassing everything from resiliency and environmental sustainability to wellness and quality of life,\u201d said Elizabeth Mynatt, executive director of Georgia Tech\u2019s Institute for People and Technology (IPaT) and distinguished professor in the College of Computing, who is co-chairing the new council. \u201cAlthough Georgia Tech has been working in this area for some time, we\u2019re organizing research so we can be more holistic and have combined impact.\u201d\n\u201cInstead of discrete projects, we\u2019re moving into a programmatic approach,\u201d agreed Jennifer Clark, associate professor of public policy and director of Georgia Tech\u2019s Center for Urban Innovation. \u201cSmart cities research touches on everything from computing and engineering to the social sciences. It\u2019s a different way of thinking about technology \u2014 not just in the private sector but also the public sector \u2014 so we make cities more efficient and economically competitive places.\u201d\nAuthor of an upcoming book on smart cities, Clark notes that metro areas generated nearly 91 percent of the U.S. gross national product in 2015. \u201cTechnology and economic growth are interlinked,\u201d she said. \u201cJust like a world-class airport, you need a world-class IT infrastructure, and it has to be deployed in such a way that people can access it for their own economic activities, whether it\u2019s large or small companies. We need a technological infrastructure that will work for the 21st-century economy and the centuries beyond.\u201d\nComplete article in\nResearch Horizons magazine\nAdditional Images\nContact\nJohn Toon\nResearch News\n(404) 894-6986\nEmail\njtoon@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
