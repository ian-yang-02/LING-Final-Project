A new study co-authored by School of Public Policy Chair Cassidy R. Sugimoto tests that premise at the intersection of race and gender and finds cracks in that fa\u00e7ade.\nAccording to the study\u2019s bibliometric analysis of more than 5 million articles published between 2008 and 2019 \u2014 primarily by U.S.-based researchers \u2014 white and Asian male authors exert an outsized influence on the selection of research topics, publish on the broadest range of issues, and are more often listed as first authors. On the other hand, Black, Latino, and women authors are underrepresented in many STEM fields and often appear as authors only in less-cited fields.\n\u201cThe compound effect of different citation rates of topics and unequal distribution in topics by race and gender leads to negative effects for marginalized groups and for science itself, as some topics become systematically less studied,\u201d the researchers wrote in their\npaper , which was published Jan. 2, 2022, in the\nProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS).\nIn fact, the researchers assert that, had the distribution of authors matched the U.S. population over the last four decades, researchers would have produced 29% more articles on public health, 26% more on gender-based violence, 25% more on gynecology and gerontology, 20% more on immigrants and minorities, and 18% more on mental health.\n\u201cThis study highlights the importance of not only expanding gender and racial diversity among researchers in high-impact areas of study, but also promoting research in historically underrepresented areas through increased funding,\u201d said\nSugimoto , the Tom and Marie Patton Chair in the\nSchool of Public Policy .\nThe research is the start of a line of work examining how the scientific enterprise affects \u2014 and is affected by \u2014 researchers of color, said Thema Monroe-White, an assistant professor at Berry College, a School of Public Policy alumna, and the study\u2019s corresponding author.\n\u201cOur research suggests that for minoritized scholars, what we study is framed by our racialized and gendered identities\u201d said Monroe-White. \u201cThis finding pushes against idealized notions of meritocracy in science. Institutions and individual disciplines should take action by amplifying research produced by minoritized scholars, particularly on topics for which they have greater representation yet whose impact remains marginalized.\u201d\nThe authors drew the study\u2019s data from articles indexed in the Web of Science database. Papers with more than 1.6 million first authors were part of the analysis.\nThe researchers used data on the prevalence of last names in various racial and ethnic groups to determine the racial makeup of authors. Instead of assigning author names to the most probable racial or ethnic group, the researchers assigned the names to such groups fractionally. This was done to prevent issues with underestimating the number of Black authors that have cropped up in previous research.\nThey found that while papers with white first authors had the broadest range of topics, those authored by Black, Latino, and women authors were frequently more specialized. For instance, leading topics for black women researchers were \u201cblack women violation,\u201d \u201cequality promotion,\u201d and \u201csocial identity.\u201d Latino authors were more likely to publish on \u201cracial disparities\u201d and \u201cEnglish-Spanish.\u201d\n\u201cThe ubiquity of white men in science and across topics implies that this demographic group has a wider range of possible strategies to follow and an advantage in the way their scientific capital can be invested, reinforcing inequalities in scholarly outcomes,\u201d the authors wrote in the paper.\nThe article, \u201cIntersectional Inequalities in Science,\u201d is available at\nhttps://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2113067119 .\nThe School of Public Policy is a unit of the Ivan Allen College of Liberal Arts.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nMichael Pearson\nmichael.pearson@iac.gatech.edu\nEmail\nmichael.pearson@iac.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
