Severson, a program specialist at the Army\u2019s Installation Management Command.\nA big part of the effort, which began in 2015, is building systems that can track and process data being gathered by ACS staff members across the Army.\n\u201cThese systems support the Army\u2019s mission to help make soldiers and their families more ready to respond to life\u2019s challenges,\u201d said Sheila Isbell, a senior research scientist who is leading GTRI\u2019s support for the project. \u201cThe Army\u2019s needs outgrew its current information systems, and as a result we\u2019re helping to build platforms using cloud-based open architectures that will make the software much more capable and easier to maintain and upgrade over time.\u201d\nThe project involves the transformation of eight separate information systems and unifying them through a new web interface \u2013 called the Army Family Web Portal (AFWP). ACS staff members will be able to gain access to all of the systems through a single sign-on.\nA key design approach throughout the rebuilding process is presenting data-entry forms that make it easier to capture the right information and reduce the likelihood of missing or incomplete data.\n\u201cThey needed a system that supported the uploading of that data in a more comprehensive way,\u201d said Margarita Gonzalez, a senior research associate at GTRI, who is helping lead the project. \u201cSometimes something as simple as using a drop-down menu rather than an open field makes all the difference in whether a form is completed properly. That then allows for the information in the system to be more complete, more precise and searchable.\u201d\nFor example, one of the early systems the project team got up and running helped Army leaders keep track of data that required regular review and assessment. That process, which previously had involved collecting information from several different divisions within ACS across the country, typically lasted for weeks. The new system enabled Army leads to cull that data in a matter of days.\n\u201cWe\u2019re designing software that allows them to respond quicker to trends they\u2019re noticing among their families,\u201d Isbell said. \u201cRather than looking at data retrospectively, this new portal will allow them to look at live data so that in some cases they can take action immediately.\u201d\nAnother key aspect of the project includes building a secure system that allows all of the different information databases that support each service program to share information or send reports to other databases.\nThat feature will come into play for the modernized Volunteer Management Information System (VMIS), which is one of the information systems that is used directly by Army families. VMIS helps track volunteer hours, among other information, for the Army Volunteer Corps., a program that places civilian volunteers into needed roles at an Army installation \u2013 providing a valuable service for the Army while potentially helping volunteers gain work experience that could be useful for career advancement. The transformed cloud-based VMIS will make keeping track of those hours and sharing that information much easier.\n\u201cThrough the enhanced reporting feature, data will become more readily available to program managers who analyze the program trends,\u201d Severson said. \u201cThis will ultimately assist in making data driven decisions in ACS program improvements.\u201d\nFor Army social workers, a big part of their job is generating reports that can be used by Army leaders to gain insight into the trends happening at individual installations or throughout the Army. GTRI\u2019s task is to create a software suite that makes reporting easier as well.\n\u201cIf you have a system that better handles the data and generates reports and feedback, as well as one that on the front end that makes it easier for staff members to input, it frees up a lot of time both at the leadership level and at the service-delivery level,\u201d Isbell said. \u201cIt allows leaders to analyze the data faster and really dig into what that information is telling them, and staff members to be better able to provide services to Army families.\u201d\nIn building the new cloud-based software suite, the GTRI team is also laying the foundation for software that will stand the test of time with an open-source platform as opposed to a closed, proprietary system.\n\u201cThe idea was to build something that is sustainable for years and years, and make it so that the Army does not have a hard time finding contractors who can make changes and updates,\u201d Isbell said. \u201cAn open source platform is essential to that longevity.\u201d\nThe open platform can also help the Army keep down costs over time.\n\u201cThrough the years, the legacy system was limited to only a few support vendors because of its proprietary state,\u201d Severson said. \u201cThe new system focuses on an open source foundation to allow greater flexibility in vendor contract support.\u201d\nResearch News\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\n177 North Avenue\nAtlanta, Georgia 30332-0181\u00a0 USA\nMedia Relations Assistance : Josh Brown (404-385-0500) (josh.brown@comm.gatech.edu) or John Toon (404-894-6986) (jtoon@gatech.edu)\nWriter : Josh Brown\nAdditional Images\nContact\nJosh Brown\nResearch News\n404-853-0500\nEmail\njosh.brown@comm.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
