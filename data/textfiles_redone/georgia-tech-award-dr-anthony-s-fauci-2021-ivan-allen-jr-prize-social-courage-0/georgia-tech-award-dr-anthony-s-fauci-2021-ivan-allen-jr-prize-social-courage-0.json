Fauci the 2021 Ivan Allen Jr. Prize for Social Courage\nAn annual award from the Georgia Institute of Technology, the Ivan Allen Jr. prize honors individuals who have stood up for moral principles at the risk of their careers and livelihoods.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nEmail\nDr. Anthony Fauci\nJan 25, 2021\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nDr. Anthony S. Fauci, one of the nation\u2019s leading infectious disease experts and a steadfast voice of science, facts, and medical best practice during one of the most significant public health challenges in U.S. history, is this year\u2019s recipient of the Ivan Allen Jr. Prize for Social Courage.\nAn annual award from the Georgia Institute of Technology, the Ivan Allen Jr. prize honors individuals who have stood up for moral principles at the risk of their careers and livelihoods. As a trusted face in the fight against COVID-19, Fauci embodies these attributes. He faced public criticism and was subjected to enormous pressure in response to his public messages. Despite these challenges, Fauci has continued to deliver his clear and unwavering assessment of the facts and science and provide critical advice to guide the nation and world.\n\u201cDr. Fauci\u2019s resolve in the face of extraordinary threats to our public health here at home and abroad make him the clear choice for Georgia Tech\u2019s Ivan Allen Jr. Prize for Social Courage,\u201d said Georgia Tech\u2019s President \u00c1ngel Cabrera. \u201cAs an institution of higher learning committed to bettering the human condition through our motto of Progress and Service, there could be no better person suited to receive this honor than a man who has unflinchingly relied on science and facts in the face of tremendous public and political pressure.\u201d\nBecause the prize is awarded by Georgia Tech to honor those who show courage in seeking social change at risk to their careers, livelihoods, and even their lives, it is named for former Atlanta Mayor Ivan Allen Jr., a graduate of Georgia Tech, who at great personal and political risk was the only southern white elected official to testify before Congress in support of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Previous honorees include the late Congressman John Lewis; Dr. William Foege, who led the strategy to eliminate smallpox; African civil rights advocate Beatrice Mtetwa; United Nations Ambassador Andrew Young; activist Nancy Parrish; former U.S. President Jimmy Carter and first lady Rosalynn Carter; Dr. Hamilton E. Holmes and Charlayne Hunter-Gault, the first African American students enrolled at the University of Georgia; and former Georgia Senator Sam Nunn.\nThe prize will be presented to Fauci on March 15, 2021.\nA noted expert in scientific circles the world over, Fauci became a household name as he sought to deliver to millions of people information about how best to protect each other from the highly transmissible virus that causes COVID-19. Along with other top public health leaders, Fauci pressed Americans to wear masks, avoid crowds, maintain physical distance from people who don\u2019t live with them, and wash their hands often. Fauci also bluntly warned the nation that the pandemic would result in catastrophic loss of life.\n\u201cAmid the crisis, Dr. Fauci\u2019s conscientious leadership continues to provide sound guidance, clarity, and hope to our citizens, our communities, and our institutions as we battle Covid-19,\u201d said Kaye Husbands Fealing, dean of the Ivan Allen College for Liberal Arts, which was also named after the former Atlanta mayor and Tech alumnus. \u201cFor his truth, for his exemplary dedication, and his courage, Dr. Fauci is most deserving of this prize.\u201d\nAs a physician-scientist with the National Institutes of Health, Fauci has served the American public for more than 50 years. He has been a trusted advisor to seven U.S. presidents and is recognized as one of the world\u2019s leading experts on infectious disease.

Since 1984, Fauci has served as director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. In 2008, President George W. Bush awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom for his work on the U.S. government\u2019s emergency relief plan established to address the global HIV/AIDS epidemic. He still devotes time to his research of HIV infection and the body\u2019s immune responses to the virus.\nFor most of 2020, he was a member of the White House Coronavirus Task Force established to address the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. Fauci is now serving as President Joe Biden\u2019s chief medical advisor and is part of the incoming administration\u2019s COVID-19 team.\nFauci is a member of the National Academy of Sciences; the American Academy of Arts and Sciences; the National Academy of Medicine; the American Philosophical Society; and the Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters, as well as numerous other professional societies.
