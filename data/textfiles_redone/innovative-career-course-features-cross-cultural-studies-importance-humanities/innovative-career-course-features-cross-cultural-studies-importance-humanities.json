Values, goals, and cultures differ from field to field.\nThis is why\nStrakovsky\nand the\nSchool of Modern Languages \u00a0at the Georgia Institute of Technology are pioneering the use of \u201cculture-driven career design.\u201d Using the study-abroad model as a metaphor for career exploration, Strakovsky and\nAnna Westerstahl Stenport , chair and professor in the school, teach a class called Career Design for Global Citizenship.\nThe class seeks to inspire both undergraduate and graduate students to consider how humanities-based skills can be central to their careers and give them tools to design \u201cmeaningful, fulfilling, and impactful careers.\u201d\n\u2018Real-World Scenarios for How to Collaborate\u2019\n\u201cThis innovative course brings together undergraduate and graduate students from fields as diverse as computer science and international affairs, math and city and regional planning, and public policy and applied languages and intercultural studies,\u201d Stenport said.\u00a0 \u201cIt provides real-world scenarios for how to collaborate in multi-disciplinary and cross-cultural professional environments, while applying project management and communication strategies.\u201d\nThe class is attracting attention nationally. Strakovsky has presented the work to the Modern Language Association (MLA), among others. The Association of Departments of Foreign Languages and English also has invited Strakovsky and Stenport to present the work at the annual ADFL/ADE Summer Seminar for department chairs this summer.\nThe career education programs at the School of Modern Languages are part of an effort to change the direction of liberal arts education in the United States.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an approach to teaching humanities at the intersection of cultural studies and career education, which are two different fields,\u201d Strakovsky said of the class.\n\u201cIt\u2019s unique and at the cutting edge of what is happening in both fields,\" said Stenport.\nThe Value of Humanities in the Workplace\nRyan Gemilere, a second-year physics major from Saint Louis Park, Minnesota, took the class in 2018. He is now a research assistant in the career design studio at the School of Modern Languages, working with Strakovsky and Stenport on the intersection of humanities and STEM.\n\u201cA strong understanding of many subjects that fall under the umbrella of the humanities, especially philosophy and management, is fundamental for a successful career based in physics,\u201d he said.\nThe course includes lecture and project components. Students learn about the changing world of work and the role of liberal arts skills in professional life. They also learn how to hone in on their own career goals and create long-term plans for their lives.\nThe students are then sent out to create case studies examining how humanities skills, such as well-developed communications abilities and a focus on human-centered problem solving, are crucial in helping solve intractable social and policy challenges.\nStudents have examined issues such as\nenergy consumption and conservation , the impact of\nspace policy\non humanity, how to keep equity issues\nin the forefront\nof the sustainability debate, and water security.\nDifferent Perspectives Are Crucial\nThis exploration also helps students learn the value of applying humanities-based skills, especially intercultural studies, to the field of work they want to pursue.\n\u201cIn the process of doing science, or designing a product, you need to have the ability to design questions and think about other people\u2019s perspectives,\u201d Strakovsky said. \u201cHaving the ability to think from the perspective of a different culture allows you to tap into new markets and discover new questions that you might not even realize are questions if you\u2019re only looking at it from your own cultural perspective.\u201d\nCareer exploration as a form of cultural studies also helps students overcome a pervasive unease with the process that will get them their first job.\n\u201cIn career education, we talk about networking and the importance of tailoring resumes and writing cover letters a certain way,\u201d Strakovsky said. \u201cThere\u2019s a place for that, but students will often talk about how they hate it because it feels artificial and manipulative.\"\n\u201cBut when you bring the cultural studies framework to it, and you explain that this is a community and you are learning about it, that you\u2019re on a study abroad in this community, it changes their perspective. If you were living in another country and trying to learn the language and the culture, of course you would connect with as many people as possible to ask questions and do justice to understanding that community,\u201d Strakovsky said.\nFor Gemilere, who wants to work in the space sector after he graduates in 2021, the class proved invaluable.\n\u201cTo do something other than university research with a physics degree, I believe an understanding of many humanities topics is essential,\u201d he said, \u201cI would even say that the humanities enriches the research process in which many physicists take part.\"\nA Leader in Empowering Liberal Arts Graduates\nThe School of Modern Languages, a unit of the Ivan Allen College of Liberal Arts, is quickly enlarging its reputation as a national leader in empowering liberal arts graduates to pursue successful careers in many sectors.\nThe School\u2019s new\nMaster of Science in Applied Languages and Intercultural Studies\nand the\nMaster of Science in Global Media and Cultures , which is offered in conjunction with the\nSchool of Literature, Media, and Communication , were recently mentioned in the\nNew York Times\nas an example of innovative curriculum for the future of language study.\nStrakovsky and Stenport are next teaching the class in Spring 2019. That semester, Strakovsky also will expand offerings of the class with a master\u2019s level version, part of the new Global Media and Cultures program.\n\u201cThe humanities, particularly cultural studies, teach us how to create meaning out of facts, mobilize stories to shape our future, and connect with people who are very different from us,\u201d Strakovsky said. \u201cThese skills are crucial for the kinds of leadership and innovation-oriented roles that Georgia Tech alumni pursue.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nGeorgia Tech Launches Two First-of-Their-Kind Master\u00b4s Degrees with Professiona\u2026\nGeorgia Tech Leads Innovation of Humanities After Winning GT Fire Grant\nSpotlight on Georgia Tech at the Modern Language Association\nContact\nMichael Pearson\nmichael.pearson@iac.gatech.edu\n404.894.2290\nEmail\nmichael.pearson@iac.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
