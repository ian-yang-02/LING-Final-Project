Instead, the Georgia Tech\nelectrical and computer engineering\nstudent ended up creating the first ZipString prototype in his dorm room.\nZipString is a toy that floats a seemingly standard loop of string in the air, carefully balancing\u00a0the forces of gravity, lift, tension, and drag.\u00a0With any movement the user makes, the string follows.\nFazio first met Austin Hillam at a metro Atlanta\u00a0church, and this now-dynamic duo was off and running \u2013\u2013 creating a new prototype together after just 12 days of knowing each other. They posted a video of the new prototype to TikTok and received more than 20 million views in one night.\nHillam, from Johns Creek, Georgia, is\u00a0an engineering student at Brigham Young University with a passion for creating and fixing things. He attributes it to growing up in a household with a father who loves working with tools.\n\"My father and I never called anybody to fix anything at our house. We would just look things up and figure it out ourselves,\u201d Hillam says. His father enjoys mentoring the pair, bringing his expertise and the same figure-it-out mentality to the ZipString team.\nFazio grew up with a love for all things electronic. When he arrived on Georgia Tech\u2019s campus, he was focused on learning as much as he could in this area, joining RoboJackets and participating in multiple hackathons. The skills he developed at Tech have now culminated in ZipString.\nCurrently, working from the Hillam family basement, the ZipString team aims to improve ZipString, fulfill orders, and, of course, drum up more business.\nZipString will be featured on Friday, Dec. 9, on ABC\u2019s\nShark Tank .\nAdditional Images\nContact\nEvan Atkinson , Institute Social Media Officer\nEmail\neatkinson6@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
