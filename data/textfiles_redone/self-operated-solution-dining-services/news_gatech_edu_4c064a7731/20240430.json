The new dining operation, called Tech Dining, will begin July 1, 2021. The decision to move from outsourced dining to an in-house operation directly aligns with Georgia Tech\u2019s new Strategic Plan, prioritizing the student experience while striving for dining excellence. Current dining operations will transition over the summer, with new meal plans and operational improvements in place at the beginning of the Fall 2021 semester. The new Tech Dining operation plans to focus on enhanced residential and retail dining offerings, relying on student feedback to continually improve the program.\nThis strategic decision allows Georgia Tech to refocus its priorities and further define its vision for on-campus dining where our dining environments offer cuisine, atmosphere and service that enhances and supports our commitment to student engagement and well-being. To align the program with campus stakeholder demand, students, faculty, and staff are being asked to participate in a\u00a0 short survey \u00a0that will be used to plan the future of Tech Dining and name many of its new dining locations. Please take ten minutes to complete\u00a0 this survey \u00a0before Sunday, Jan. 24.\nOver the next year, Tech Dining will prioritize healthier foods, more diversified offerings, sustainability initiatives, and high-quality ingredients to increase campus satisfaction and meal plan demand. Beginning in Fall 2021, meal plans will move to all-you-care-to-eat in all three traditional dining halls, including West Village, while avoiding a price increase for the first time in decades. Dining will also look to partner with local restaurants to bring popular cuisines to the heart of the Georgia Tech campus.\nCurrent dining employees will have an opportunity to continue working at Georgia Tech, and additional information will be available soon. More information about Tech Dining and its proposed improvements will be communicated over the coming months.
