The second paper describes a stable catalyst able to convert waste fertilizer back into nonpolluting nitrogen that could one day be used to make new fertilizer.\nSignificant work remains on both processes, but the senior author on the papers,\nMarta Hatzell , said they\u2019re a step toward a more sustainable cycle that still meets the needs of a growing worldwide population.\n\u201cWe often think it would be nice not to have to use synthetic fertilizers for agriculture, but that\u2019s not realistic in the near term considering how much plant growth is dependent on synthetic fertilizers and how much food the world\u2019s population needs,\u201d said Hatzell, associate professor in the\nGeorge W. Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering . \u201cThe idea is that maybe one day you could manufacture, capture, and recycle fertilizer on site.\"\nGet the full story on the College of Engineering website.\nContact\nJoshua Stewart\nCollege of Engineering\nEmail\njstewart@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
