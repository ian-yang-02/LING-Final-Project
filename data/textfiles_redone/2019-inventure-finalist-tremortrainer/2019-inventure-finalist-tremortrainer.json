He began to struggle with\u00a0simple tasks like signing his name and buttoning his shirt,\u201d explains Nicolette Prevost, a biomedical engineering student. \u201cIt turns out there\u2019s no known cause or cure for what he\u2019s experiencing.\nEssential tremor is one of the most common movement disorders in the world. It is often difficult to diagnose, difficult to treat, and difficult to live with.\nTremorTrainer is a weighted glove that helps patients regain some of the their fine motor skills, which can be impeded by\u00a0tremors \u2013 especially in carrying out everyday\u00a0tasks that require the use of their hands. As they developed their product, they found it could likely help many more people than they first intended.\n\u201cMy uncle has MS, and Parkinson\u2019s disease is the most well-known disease where your hands are shaking. We knew that tremors were a pretty diverse symptom of other diseases,\u201d says biomedical engineering major Nisha Goddard. \u201cWe kept finding groups of people who could possibly benefit from this.\u201d\nThey have already had users test the gloves.Team TremorTrainer says those wearing their prototypes reported being able to type on keyboards, sign their names, even draw circles \u2013\nthings that had been severely limited by their tremors.\n\u201cThese are things we take for granted. A lot of these people are very healthy otherwise, \u201d Prevost says. \u201cBy giving them the power to continue doing those everyday tasks they are able to continue living in their own homes and working without embarrassment.\u201d\nTremorTrainer continues testing, and finding tasks that their device has the potential to improve. The ran trials with users simply using keys to open doors.\n\u201cImagine standing outside. It\u2019s cold, it\u2019s rainy, and you can\u2019t get your key in the lock,\u201d says materials science and engineering student Colten Spivey. \u201cIt was amazing how different the results were.\u201d\nMany of the current devices designed to help tremor patients are expensive and may only serve one purpose \u2013 weighted silverware for example.\n\u201cWe wanted to make something that users could pick up off the shelves in stores or pharmacies at a reasonable cost,\u201d Prevost says.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nSteven Norris\nInstitute Communications\nEmail\nsnorris@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
