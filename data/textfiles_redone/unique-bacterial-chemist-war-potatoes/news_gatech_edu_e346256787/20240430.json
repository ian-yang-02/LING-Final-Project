This enzyme is \"wacko\" in many ways in its breakdown of a poison related to TNT. On top of that, 5NAA-A is known so far only to exist in a single living organism on Earth. Could it be the lone master of a rare bacterial enzymatic kung fu, in the war on potatoes? Or does a genomic clue point to its existence in one other solitary case?\nOct 03, 2016\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nIn fertile farm soils where potatoes grow,\nStreptomyces scabies\nbacteria wage war using chemicals related to explosives and pesticides.\nBut a microbial spoiler defuses one of\nS. scabies \u2019 poisons. Researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology have gained new insights into a one-of-a-kind mechanism it employs, which could someday contribute to the development of new agents to degrade tough pollutants and help rescue crops.\nWhen\nS. scabies\ninfects potatoes, it spews poisons called thaxtomins, which riddle potatoes with familiar dark scabs. Perhaps a trifle to the potato connoisseur excising them with a paring knife, on a global scale, the blemishes add up to a slash in agricultural production.\nUnprecedented moves\nScientists investigating potato soil found that bacteria of the species\nBradyrhizobium sp. JS329\nrun interference. Though their tough enzymes don\u2019t break down thaxtomins, they do render innocuous another\nS. scabies\ntoxic secretion called\n5-nitroanthranilic acid\n(5-NAA).\nStill, understanding how it is broken down could prove useful to agriculture. \u201cThe 5NAA molecule is similar enough to thaxtomin that studying its degradation might inspire future work to engineer an enzyme or bacterium, or even the plant itself, to detoxify thaxtomin,\u201d Lieberman said.\nOne enzyme in particular uses seemingly unprecedented and spectacular chemical tricks to tear apart 5-NAA\u2019s otherwise ironclad chemical structure.\nResearchers uncovered them and published the results in the\njournal Nature Chemical Biology on Monday, October 3, 2016 . The research was funded by the National Science Foundation, Pew Charitable Trusts, Georgia Internship for Teachers, and the U.S. Department of Energy.\nChemical warfare\nS. scabies\nbacteria are masters of chemical warfare, and not just against potatoes.\n\u201cThis family of bacteria is known for the ability to synthesize lots of different molecules, including ones that humans use as antibiotics,\u201d said senior researcher\nRaquel Lieberman, an associate professor\nat Georgia Tech\u2019s\nSchool of Chemistry and Biochemistry .\n\u201cThey\u2019re good at killing other organisms,\u201d she said. Though the thaxtomins they secrete are well-known for marring potatoes, little is known about toxin 5NAA.\nEnzymatic kung fu\n5NAA has met its match in bacterium Bradyrhizobium sp. JS329, which we\u2019ll call \u201cBrady\u201d for short.\n\u201cBrady\u201d produces enzymes that can combat 5NAA, the first of which is called 5NAA-A. The added \u201cA\u201d after the dash stands for \u201caminohydrolase,\u201d a term that means it uses water to alter part of toxin 5NAA.\nThe \u201csubstitution reaction\u201d that enzyme 5NAA-A carries out is common in organic synthesis, but extremely rare in living things. \u201cThere\u2019s only one other known enzyme confirmed to utilize this particular chemical mechanism,\u201d Lieberman said.\nLieberman\u2019s team, which specializes in making protein crystals of enzymes like 5NAA-A, observed the moment of the ensuing reaction.\u00a0 \u201cWe were able to capture the critical step (hydrolysis) in the crystal for this paper,\u201d she said.\n\u201cIt does this wacko chemical reaction,\u201d Lieberman said. 5NAA-A helps destroy toxin 5NAA in two ways that are like outlandish kung fu moves.\nBreaking the wrong arm\nToxin 5NAA enters the \u201cBrady\u201d bacterium with a deadly weapon. A nitro group, or NO2, is part of its structure, which makes 5NAA a nitroaromatic compound.\n\u201cBasically, all these nitroaromatics are either explosive or toxic,\u201d Lieberman said. \u201c TNT\nis not that different from this compound.\u201d\nPlenty of bacteria have evolved enzymes to tackle synthetic nitroaromatics -- pollutants like dyes, pesticides or explosives that have been dumped in our environment. The enzymes tend to use the same strategy. \u201cThe nitro groups are typically the first target of any degrading enzyme, because they are so toxic,\u201d Lieberman said.\nNot so for enzyme 5NAA-A.\nIt goes after another group on the toxic molecule, the amine, which is innocuous. It\u2019s like a kung fu master breaking the arm opposite of the one with the weapon. But it works.\nBy hydrolyzing the amine, enzyme 5NAA-A sets up toxin 5NAA for destruction by other enzymes.\u00a0 \u201cThe fact that it does it without removing the nitro is the weird part. It\u2019s an unexpected move,\u201d Lieberman said.\nKryptonite suicide\nThen there\u2019s the weirdness around metal.\n5NAA-A is a metalloprotease, an enzyme that needs a metal ion to do its work.\u00a0 But unlike other metalloproteases, it doesn\u2019t have one embedded in it.\u00a0 It can operate with one of four different metals, but 5NAA-A can\u2019t seem to find the metal on its own.\n\u201cIt relies on 5NAA to bring it to the party,\u201d Lieberman said.\nIn other words, poison 5NAA seems to tow a metal ion up to enzyme 5NAA-A, which then takes it away and uses it to destroy the poison. It\u2019s like Superman handing off kryptonite to an arch enemy.\n\u201cAt least that\u2019s very much what we think is happening,\u201d Lieberman said.\u00a0 \u201cWe\u2019re going to investigate the details further.\u201d\nSolitary master\nThe sum of 5NAA-A\u2019s weird ways led Lieberman\u2019s team to check an enormous genome database for matches of the gene sequence that can produce an enzyme like 5NAA-A.\u00a0 They found only one single known other example on Earth.\n\u201cThat enzyme gene sequence comes from sediment in Yellowstone National Park,\u201d Lieberman said. It is not yet confirmed that bacteria housing it actually detoxify 5NAA, though it\u2019s likely.\nEven if it does, enzyme 5NAA-A remains uncommonly rare, given the myriad microbes on Earth producing an even higher number of enzymes. \u201cThe fact that there may just be one other is mind-boggling,\u201d Lieberman said.\nHigh school researchers\nIn another rarity, a high school science teacher is one of the authors on the research paper.\nCasey Bethel , who was named\nGeorgia Teacher of the Year for 2017 , helped the other researchers break through a barrier that was holding up progress.\n\u201cWe use so-called tags to identify the enzyme we\u2019re interested in when we go to harvest it. We suspected the tags were interfering in the crystallization process,\u201d Bethel said. So, he cloned the proteins with removable tags, which significantly helped the project move forward.\nBethel participates in Georgia Tech\u2019s\nmain K-12 outreach, CEISMC , which, among other things, boosts STEM education among underserved populations in Georgia public schools. And for three years, CEISMC has helped him improve his teaching skills.\nBethel has also\nbrought high school students to work in Lieberman\u2019s lab with him . He\u2019s thrilled that he -- and they -- could be a part of the study. \u201cFantastical! Unimaginable! Who\u2019d think that a high school teacher would be published in a Nature journal?\u201d Bethel said.\nSince starting with Georgia Tech\u2019s outreach, Bethel has seen at least 60 of his former students choose STEM studies and careers. \u201cWhereas before, the number was close to zero,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s indescribable. It\u2019s momentous, magnificent and impactful. I\u2019ll never be able to measure the impact.\u201d\nREAD: Georgia Tech's major outreach to K12 students\nREAD: Hairy nanorods and the fight against cancer\nFormer Georgia Tech researchers Sibel Kalyoncu and David P.
