Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering. \u201cThis is something we\u2019ve been working on for the past four years, and we\u2019re still sort of scratching our heads.\u201d\nKu and his collaborators explain their \u201chappy accident\u201d in the open-access journal\nPLOS One\nwith their recently published paper,\n\u201cLysis of arterial thrombi by perfusion of N,N\u2019-Diacetyl-L-cystine (DiNAC).\u201d\nTheir research is driven by the need for a better thrombolytic agent \u2013 a safer, more efficient treatment for breaking down clots in the immediate wake of a catastrophic event. When a clot develops in an artery \u2013 arterial thrombosis \u2013 it can stop the flow of blood to major organs, often leading to a stroke or heart attack. Depending on how it is formed, the clot can be composed of either primarily platelets and von Willebrand Factor (VWF, a glycoprotein that helps with platelet adhesion), or polymerized fibrin.\nThe current clinical standard drug for treating a stroke is an intravenously delivered tissue plasminogen activator, or tPA, still the only FDA-approved thrombolytic agent in the United States. It does a fine job breaking down, or lysing, fibrin-rich coagulation clots, but is not the most efficacious treatment for ischemic strokes caused by VWF-platelet rich clots.\u00a0 tPA also is known to cause bleeding complications, which can deter clinical use.\n\u201cThese two types of clots are composed of different things \u2013 coagulation clots, and platelet clots,\u201d noted Ku, the corresponding author of the paper. Dongjune Kim, a PhD student in Ku\u2019s lab, is the lead author. Susan Shea, a former PhD student in Ku\u2019s lab, is a co-author.\n\u201cPlatelet clots are about 10 times stronger than coagulation clots,\u201d Ku added. \u201cThey hold together under arterial high blood pressure conditions. If you have a coagulation clot, tPA dissolves it under the right conditions. But the clots that cause strokes and heart attacks are not coagulation clots. They\u2019re made out of platelets.\u201d\nHe explained that VWF is strikingly similar to mucins \u2013 the stuff you cough up when you have too much junk in your lungs. Furthermore, researchers reasoned, they might be able to bust up a VWF clot using N-acetylcysteine, or NAC, a medication used to thin mucus in conditions such as asthma or cystic fibrosis. Would NAC, a supplement form of the naturally occurring amino acid cysteine, do the same thing to a VWF-platelet clot?\nCoincidentally, Ku\u2019s team and a group in France were onto the same idea at the same time. While the Georgia Tech researchers conducted their experiments in a lab using glass tubes instead of arteries, the other team used mice. The results were dramatic. In both cases, the compound dissolved the clot quickly. But when a third group of researchers from Belgium tried to reproduce the results, they had no luck.\n\u201cAt that point, we were all wondering, \u2018what gives?\u2019 So, we tried again,\u201d said Ku, who was disappointed to find that the compound didn\u2019t work. \u201cWe were dumfounded. No one could get it to work again.\u201d\nShea, who presented her work at a conference, graduated from Tech and moved on. She is now junior faculty at the University of Washington in St. Louis.\nKim said he tried to reproduce Shea\u2019s work, \u201cbecause it was interesting and important. But I couldn\u2019t make NAC work.\u201d He was using fresh NAC samples from the lab\u2019s freezer. But then he found the old NAC sample that Shea had used the first time, when the clot dissolved. Curious, Kim tried that sample of the compound and it worked. So, they took the two different batches \u2013 the fresh NAC solutions and the old sample \u2013 to a chemistry lab for testing.\n\u201cWe gave them samples without telling them which is which \u2013 a blind test,\u201d Kim said.\nTurns out, it wasn\u2019t NAC that initially dissolved the clots. It was DiNAC, a disulfide dimer of NAC, a compound that has been studied for its anti-atherosclerotic effects. NAC, Ku explained, can spontaneously convert to DiNAC over time, under the right temperature conditions. So, his team acquired more DiNAC and tested it, and it worked repeatedly.\n\u201cWe think the French research group probably used some old NAC that was actually DiNAC, which is why their experiment worked, too,\u201d said Ku. \u201cNo one could reproduce the results initially because we were all using fresh NAC when we did the study again. But the DiNAC works really well.\u201d\nVideo footage of the Ku lab\u2019s experiment shows the introduction of DiNAC in a glass tube clearing up clotted pig\u2019s blood (which is very similar to human blood) in 10 minutes or less. And they\u2019re still not sure why.\n\u201cDiNAC hasn\u2019t been studied much as a thrombolytic agent, so we don\u2019t know the mechanism behind it yet,\u201d Kim said. \u201cI was focusing on the efficacy of DiNAC. But the mechanism will definitely be an interesting future study.\u201d\nCurrently, the lab is testing the compound which, unlike tPA does not cause bleeding complications, in studies with mice. Their next paper will cover this, and Ku is hopeful.\n\u201cRight now, we\u2019re just putting this out there and saying DiNAC works,\u201d Ku said. \u201cThis was serendipitous. I wish we had the whole answer, so we\u2019re hoping the research community will help us find out. Although, I do think we\u2019re getting close to a working hypothesis.\u201d\nCitation:\nThis research was funded through the Larry P. Huang Chair in the George W.
