The study,\npublished in the journal\nNature , uncovered novel looping currents flowing along the edges of octahedral cells in a crystal of\nMn 3 Si 2 Te 6 ,\nwhich allowed for a billion percent increase in the material\u2019s electric conductivity. The findings could lead to a new paradigm for quantum devices and superconductors.\nThe team consisted of Georgia Tech theoretical physicists Sami Hakani and Itamar Kimchi, along with experimental physicists Feng Ye (Oak Ridge National Lab), Lance DeLong (University of Kentucky), and, from the University of Colorado at Boulder: Gang Cao, Yifei Ni, Yu Zhang, and Hengdi Zhao. The group was drawn to the research after their\nprevious study investigated the same material.\n\u201cBecause this material did not fit any preexisting models, we had to develop new ideas to understand it,\u201d said Georgia Tech graduate student Hakani, who played a key role in developing the theory. \u201cThese new ideas will help us study related materials that could be used for next-generation magnetic field devices.\u201d\nAn Exception to the Rule\nThe physicists first became interested in the\nMn 3 Si 2 Te 6\nmaterial due to its unique electrical properties \u2014 in particular, a property called\ncolossal magnetoresistance ,\nan extreme enhancement in a material\u2019s electrical conductivity when a magnetic field is applied.\nIn most materials, applying a magnetic field does not change that material\u2019s conductivity. However, in another class of materials, applying a magnetic field does change conductivity; this is called\nmagnetoresistance ,\nand it can scale to \u201cgiant\u201d and \u201ccolossal\u201d changes in conductivity. In instances of\ncolossal magnetoresistance ,\na material can change from behaving like an insulator (like Styrofoam) to being as conductive as a metal wire.\nThis change is not altogether unusual. Materials displaying\ngiant magnetoresistance\nare not uncommon and are often used in computers; however, in all of these known materials, the material does not change its behavior in a way that significantly depends on the direction of the applied magnetic field. This new trimer-honeycomb material does.\n\u201cThe phenomenon defies all existing theoretical models and experimental precedents,\u201d said Kimchi, theoretical physicist and assistant professor in the School of Physics at Georgia Tech. And that\u2019s where he and Hakani come in.\nUncovering Looping Currents\n\u201cAs theoretical physicists, we develop new kinds of mathematical models,\u201d said Kimchi. \u201cWhen it\u2019s qualitatively difficult to understand how anything can make sense in experimental data \u2014 when there\u2019s something qualitatively shocking \u2014 we try to come up with that basic picture.\u201d\nUsing the information uncovered by the experimental physicists, Hakani and Kimchi set out to understand why the extreme change in conductivity only happens when the magnetic field is applied perpendicularly to the honeycomb-like surface of the material.\n\u201cOur idea smelled promising, but, unfortunately, we quickly realized that currents between the magnetic manganese ions would be forbidden by symmetry, which was discouraging,\u201d said Kimchi. \u201cHowever, Sami then did the symmetry analysis for the octahedrally arranged tellurium ions, and, for them, currents were symmetry-allowed and could work out!\u201d\nViewed from above, the material looks like a series of two-dimensional honeycombs. From the side, however, the material is composed of \u201csheets,\u201d like a layer cake. Within each \u201csheet\u201d of honeycomb, electrons can move in circular paths around each octahedral cell. These looping, circular-moving currents within the material are responsible for the material\u2019s unique behavior.\nOn its own, without a magnetic field present, electrons move both counterclockwise and clockwise around the honeycomb \u201ccells,\u201d like cars going in both directions around a roundabout. Just like in uncontrolled traffic, \u201ctraffic jams\u201d make it difficult for electrons to move quickly throughout the material. Without a way to streamline traffic, the material acts more like an insulator.\nHowever, if a magnetic field is applied perpendicular to the honeycomb-like surface, a \u201cflow of traffic\u201d is established, and electrons navigate the loops more quickly. The material then acts as a conductor, showing a seven-magnitude increase in conductivity \u2014 equivalent to an increase of a billion percent.\nA New Paradigm\nThe transformation from insulator to conductor can also be driven by applying electrical currents in the material, but in that case, it doesn\u2019t happen instantaneously. It can take seconds or even minutes for the material to switch from insulator to conductor.\nThe team believes that this tunability and slower type of switching, coupled with the material\u2019s sensitivity to currents, could lead to new applications and discoveries in current-controlled quantum devices, a field of devices that range from sensors to computers to secure communication.\nThe next step? Working to better understand the newly discovered quantum state, and finding other materials where the quantum state might exist.\n\u201cLooking forward, we hope to understand not only what makes this material special, but also which microscopic ingredients are needed for related materials to become useful quantum technologies in our future,\u201d said Hakani.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nBy: Selena Langner\nWriter, College of Sciences at Georgia Tech\nMedia Contact:\nJess Hunt-Ralston\nDirector of Communications, College of Sciences at Georgia Tech\nEmail\njess@cos.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
