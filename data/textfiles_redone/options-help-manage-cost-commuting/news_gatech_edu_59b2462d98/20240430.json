And as we all face the uncertainty of the future, we want to assure you that we are here for you.\nGeorgia Tech is taking a proactive stance now with the resources we have available and is committed to continuing to monitor the situation and adjust our approach as needed. So, multiple units campuswide are collaborating to identify and implement measures that will ease the cost of driving to work.\nWe recognize this situation is rapidly evolving. While we continue to re-evaluate business operations at Tech and will continue to offer a residential experience for our students, including in-person course delivery, we strongly encourage all employees to explore more immediate alternatives to their daily commutes.\nCost-Effective Commuting Options\nHere are a few options with potential cost-savings:\nCarpool\u00a0and Rideshare Programs\nDid you know a Georgia Tech carpool permit costs $100 less than annual individual permits and can be split among carpool members? Visit\npts.gatech.edu\nto explore carpooling incentives through Georgia Commute Options, Waze Carpool, and even Zipcar.\nPublic Transportation Discounts\nStudents and employees can purchase discounted monthly transit passes. Employees can purchase their transit passes via payroll deduction for MARTA, GRTA Xpress, CobbLinc, and Gwinnett County Transit.\nScooters and Bike Sharing Options\nWhether commuting to campus or navigating when you get here, Georgia Tech is a\nGold Level Bike Friendly University\nand has worked hard to encourage bicycling (or scooting) as a healthy, convenient, and low-cost form of transportation.\nFlexible Work Arrangements\nIn addition to telecommuting, consider flextime or working a compressed workweek to help reduce travel time and costs. Discuss your flexible work options with your supervisor. Click\nhere\nfor tips that will prepare you for the discussion.\u00a0 Please Note:\nTelework approvals are based on management discretion and should be granted based on what best serves students, lessons learned from the past year, and the overall institutional mission. Please work with your manager to determine your most practical teleworking options.\nShare Your Suggestions\nWe know uncertainty of any kind is not easy. We will continue to monitor the situation and provide solutions where we can.
