Traffic will be directed further down North Avenue and access to Tech Parkway will be available at State Street. See the detour plan\nhere .\nIn this section of campus, Ferst Drive is currently a low- traffic interior road that parallels Tech Parkway, creating a redundant route. Future campus plans anticipate the removal of this redundancy, allowing for development or additional green space depending upon campus programmatic needs.\nThis phase of construction work will necessitate the removal of approximately 25 trees. In accordance with the Campus Landscape Master Plan and the Tree Care Replacement policy, trees will be planted elsewhere on campus, or funds equivalent will be added to the campus tree bank. Locations for replacement trees will be identified and the trees planted in the appropriate season.\nThis is the first of several phases of the Campus Connectivity Plan, and it is expected to last until March 2024, as the campus begins to increase connectivity south and west of campus as outlined in the recently released\nComprehensive Campus Plan . Developments such as Science Square and Arts Square will require multimodal and pedestrian connectivity to the core of campus, and these connections will be implemented incrementally.\nSubsequent phases of construction will move west along Ferst Drive with updates provided as they become available.\nContact\nJerry Young\nLandscape Project Manager\nPlanning, Design, and Construction\nInfrastructure and Sustainability\n404-585-3449\nEmail\njerry.young@facilities.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
