Hutchinson holds a bachelor of science, master of science and Ph.D. in electrical engineering from Purdue University.\n\u201cSeth is internationally known for his work in robotics as evidenced by his more than 200 publications, his editor-in-chief role of the\nIEEE Transactions on Robotics\nand his recent selection as president-elect of the IEEE Robotics and Automation Society,\u201d said Chaouki Abdallah, Georgia Tech\u2019s executive vice president for research. \u201cI am pleased that he will be the new executive director of Georgia Tech\u2019s Institute for Robotics and Intelligent Machines, and I look forward to working with him toward the goal of making Georgia Tech the leader in robotics, autonomy and manufacturing.\u201d\nHutchinson\u2019s research interests lie in vision-based control, motion planning, planning under uncertainty, pursuit-evasion, localization and mapping, locomotion and bio-inspired robotics. Hutchinson is the coauthor of two books, \u201c Principles of Robot Motion - Theory, Algorithms, and Implementations ,\u201d and \u201c Robot Modeling and Control .\u201d\n\u201cThe robotics research happening here at Georgia Tech is among the best in the world, from actuators to high-level reasoning,\u201d he said. \u201cI honestly cannot think of a place I\u2019d rather be right now than here, working with this group of people.\u201d\nAt Georgia Tech, IRIM serves as an umbrella under which robotics researchers, educators and students from across campus can come together to advance the many high-powered and diverse robotics activities.\nIRIM\u2019s mission is to create new and exciting opportunities for faculty collaboration; educate the next generation of robotics experts, entrepreneurs, and academic leaders; and partner with industry and government to pursue truly transformative robotics research. IRIM serves more than 90 faculty members, 180 graduate students and 40 robotics labs. The robotics program at Georgia Tech attracts more than $60 million in research annually.\nResearch News\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\n177 North Avenue\nAtlanta, Georgia\u00a0 30332-0181\u00a0 USA\nMedia Relations Contact : John Toon (404-894-6986) (jtoon@gatech.edu).\nWriter : John Toon\nAdditional Images\nContact\nJohn Toon\nResearch News\n(404) 894-6986\nEmail\njtoon@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
