If you\u2019re new to campus,\nlearn more about testing\nand plan to participate weekly. Register at\nmytest.gatech.edu .\nWhat\u2019s the same\nAll students, faculty, and staff on campus are encouraged to test weekly.\nTesting will be available at multiple sites across campus.\nView testing sites and hours .\nTreats and swag items will be offered at testing sites.\nWhat\u2019s different\nYou will no longer need to scan your BuzzCard when you test. The process has been streamlined to eliminate the need for this step.\nAdditional testing locations will be available.\nSites at the Price Gilbert Library, 760 Spring Street, GT Connector, and Couch Building will be open five days a week. Additional sites will be operated by mobile teams and set up one to two days a week.\nHours will continue to be updated here each week .\nThose who are experiencing symptoms consistent with Covid-19 should seek diagnostic testing, not surveillance testing. Students can be tested at Stamps Health Services; employees should seek testing from their primary care doctor or a public health\ntesting location .\nGeorgia Tech is also in the process of planning for vaccinations on campus, and staff at Stamps Health Services and other first responders will be the first to receive vaccinations.
