Sales reps from two different heart valve manufactures told his surgical team they couldn\u2019t help.\nThe surgeons reached out to a startup \u2014 co-founded by a Georgia Tech researcher \u2014 to see if its technology could help them save his life.\nThe company,\u00a0 DASI Simulations ,\u00a0uses artificial intelligence (AI) and computer vision in its technology for personalized and more accurate heart valve replacement modeling. The result, the company says, a reduction in errors and better patient outcomes as in the case of the Texas patient.\nThe company\u2019s modeling gave the Texas medical team four safe device options, as well as ways to solve the original problem and the patient was discharged 24 hours later.\n\u201cThe physicians sent this case to our headquarters. And basically, we were able to send them these 3D images, where the physicians can exactly see what will happen. Not only that, but they were also able to go in boldly and dilate the previous valve and perform the procedure of implanting a second trans-catheter heart valve within the first,\u201d said\u00a0 Lakshmi Prasad Dasi , co-founder, chief technology officer, and renowned scholar in heart valve engineering and cardiovascular biomechanics.\nDoctors saved the man\u2019s life, but in 2023, cardiovascular disease \u2014 the world\u2019s leading cause of death \u2014\u00a0will claim the lives of more than 22,000 Georgians, some 700,000 people across the U.S., and 19 million around the globe. Even more daunting, that global death toll is expected to surpass 23 million by 2030.\nThe company is looking to improve those outcomes by utilizing AI\u00a0to focus on the leading cause of cardiovascular afflictions: valvular heart disease, which occurs when any of the heart\u2019s four valves are damaged, compromising the blood flow.\n\u201cWhen the surgeons run these patients through our system, the physician team can clear many of the complications that they\u2019re worried about. And they\u2019ll be able to go in and treat with a personalized plan,\u201d said Dasi, who is associate chair for undergraduate studies and Rozelle Vanda Wesley Professor in the\u00a0 Wallace H. Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering \u00a0at Emory University and Georgia Tech.\nLaunched in 2019, the company, which is currently in a bridge round and anticipates a Series A capital raise in the fall of 2023, has already secured investment funding of about $4 million, including a non-dilutive $600,000 grant. DASI Simulations has 40 client hospitals in the U.S. and is working with Georgia Tech\u2019s\u00a0 VentureLab , which works with faculty and students on their research commercialization, to secure capital investments.\nThe hospitals leveraging Dasi Simulations\u2019 technology are using it exclusively on a group of high-risk patients. Surgeons don\u2019t want to operate on these patients due to the complexities that come with an advanced state of disease. Without surgical intervention, these patients will die within six months to two years. Dasi Simulations technology can help surgeons navigate these high-risk surgeries with advanced AI based simulations.\n\u201cThe problem is that currently, when doctors are planning the treatment of patients, such as valve replacement, their process is extremely limited in its flexibility and adaptability to specific patient anatomical features.\u201d\nAll patients undergo CT scans of their hearts followed by time consuming measurements, said Dasi, who is also a faculty member of Georgia Tech\u2019s\u00a0 Parker H. Petit Institute for Bioengineering and Bioscience . The physician imager today uses a computer mouse and takes measurements of a patient\u2019s heart from those 2D scans to determine what size replacement valve would be needed.\nIt's a time-consuming and inexact process made even more complicated now because heart valve sales representatives \u2014\u00a0not the surgeons \u2014\u00a0do the bulk of those scan measurements at the majority of the 800 hospitals in the U.S. that perform structural heart procedures, Dasi said.\n\u201cSo, sales reps are doing the measurements, as part of their sales service to the hospitals,\u201d he said. \u201cOverall, there's increased human error of between 15% to 20% variability, and a lot of time is lost when multiple people make discordant measurements.\u201d\nBecause of that scenario, the resulting decisions made about what to do with any given patient\u2019s case can be compromised.\n\u201cThe decisions that the heart team makes are compromised not only because measurements may be inaccurate but also because they're unable to predict risks that the patient may have with a particular device selection. Consequently, there is hardly any personalization of the procedure to the patient,\u201d Dasi said. \u201cOftentimes, when these surgeons perform a surgical procedure, five years down the line, they realize that \u2018we shouldn't have done the surgery the way we did.\u2019 Now, you're stuck in this difficult scenario because a different device choice back then could have made today\u2019s surgery less risky.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a scenario that translates into complications that occur at high rates and increased costs to hospitals that aren\u2019t reimbursable if they occur within 30 days of the patient\u2019s discharge.\nReducing risk through bias elimination\nDASI Simulations technology, which is based on research conducted at Georgia Tech, Ohio State University, Emory University, and Piedmont Hospital, uses AI to create 3D models for accurate measurements based on the CT scans. It\u2019s a process that takes a computer seconds, compared with the 30 minutes it might take a doctor or sales rep.\nThe company says because the 3D modeling and AI measurements are accurate, it removes the possibility of manual errors. Also, because sales reps are not performing the modeling as is current practice to drive sales, there is no potential for bias toward using any one heart valve replacement device.\nThe company\u2019s technology also includes 3D predictive modeling, which gives medical teams a better understanding of potential outcomes and the likelihood of complications. Under the current approach, doctors make the decisions about what kind of stents or valves based on the 2D scans, but they can\u2019t necessarily predict the complications that may arise.\nWith DASI Simulations\u2019 predictive technology, surgical teams don\u2019t have to guess what the likely complications might be with a given valve and can make better decisions for the patient, Dasi said.\n\u201cThe real benefit here is that now they have science in their hands, and they can make data driven scientific decisions as opposed to clinical intuition-based guesswork.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nContact\nP\u00e9ralte C.
