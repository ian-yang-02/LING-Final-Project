The plant\u2019s steam keeps many buildings heated and cooled, and it provides hot water for some showers and dining halls. The facility also provides processed steam for some research labs. A stationary engineer is technically trained to operate, troubleshoot, and oversee the plant\u2019s industrial equipment. After two years on the job, Edward works each day to increase her knowledge.\n\u201cA variety of components and accessories make up the plant,\u201d she said. \u201cOperators must make sure they\u2019re knowledgeable on every aspect by tracing out the different lines \u2014\u00a0water supply, steam, and chill water\u00a0systems. Tracing the lines is tedious but necessary if I\u2019m going to be the best.\u201d\nEdward really enjoys seeing everything work in harmony.\n\u201cThe most rewarding part of my job is when the textbook information matches the practical application. You can read about boilers and combustion and all of those things, but it\u2019s exciting when all of it comes together here and you get to see the fuel-air ratio working the way it should,\u201d she said. \u201cThe other rewarding part is knowing that we\u2019re providing a service to the campus \u2014 cooling in the summer and heating in the winter.\u201d\nThe\nHolland Plant,\nlocated on the Hill, sends steam as far as the Campus Recreation Center and also to some of the buildings along Ninth and 10th streets.\nThe most challenging part of her job is keeping the equipment in working order and solving problems, such as when systems go offline. \u201cYou have to think on your feet. You can\u2019t waste time deciding what to do first,\u201d said Edward, who relies on experience and instinct to address problems quickly.\nBeing the only woman working at the Holland Plant was a challenge initially. \u201cThe guys have come around,\u201d she said. \u201cThey see that I am here because I enjoy the work and I want to do a good job.\u201d\nEdward is also working to implement a recycling initiative at the plant. \u201cChanging the way we dispose of waste is important today, given population growth and the massive land fill space that\u2019s occupied because of it,\u201d she said.\nAway From Work\nEdward is interested in carpentry, reading, and ballroom dancing, and she hopes to develop a green thumb.\nShe bought a house about a year ago and it keeps her busy with lawncare and general maintenance. She plans to build a woodworking shed where she can make furniture.\n\u201cI have done some carpentry work. I can operate a wood lathe, and I was a machinist working with metal. I\u2019m pretty handy,\u201d she said.\nOne of the projects on her list is a rollaway table to hold her books and magazines while she reads in bed. She likes reading technical books to keep up with what\u2019s happening in the field. She also likes reading books about the Victorian era and watching PBS\u2019\nMasterpiece.\nBefore the coronavirus pandemic and physical distancing, Edward enjoyed ballroom dancing. She danced when she lived in Detroit and she was taking lessons in Atlanta. \u201cIt\u2019s a good way to stay in shape. It\u2019s also relaxing and fun.\u201d\nEdward is not a gardener, but she loves mangos and wants to see if she can grow a tree. She gave a few mango seeds to a co-worker, Miguel Zarate, who planted the seeds and grew a sapling for her.\n\u201cI'm nurturing the plant right now,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I can keep it alive it will be the first tree that I plant in my backyard.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nThe Holland Plant\nContact\nVictor Rogers\nInstitute Communications\nEmail\nvictor.rogers@comm.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
