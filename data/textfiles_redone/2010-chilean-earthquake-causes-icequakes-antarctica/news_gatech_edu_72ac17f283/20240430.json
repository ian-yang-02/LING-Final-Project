Some scientists call them icequakes. But in March of 2010, the ice sheets in Antarctica vibrated a bit more than usual because of something more than 3,000 miles away: the 8.8-magnitude Chilean earthquake. A new Georgia Institute of Technology study\npublished in Nature Geoscience\nis the first to indicate that Antarctica\u2019s frozen ground is sensitive to seismic waves from distant earthquakes. To study the quake\u2019s impact on Antarctica, the Georgia Tech team looked at seismic data from 42 stations in the six hours before and after the 3:34 a.m. event. The researchers\nused the same technology\nthat allowed them to \u201chear\u201d the seismic response at large distances for the devastating 2011 magnitude 9 Japan earthquake as it rumbled through the earth. In other words, they simply removed the longer-period signals as the seismic waves spread from the distant epicenter to identify high-frequency signals from nearby sources. Nearly 30 percent (12 of the 42 stations) showed clear evidence of high-frequency seismic signals as the surface-wave arrived on Antarctica. \u201cWe interpret these events as small icequakes, most of which were triggered during or immediately after the passing of long-period Rayleigh waves generated from the Chilean mainshock,\u201d said Zhigang Peng, an associate professor in the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences who led the study. \u201cThis is somewhat different from the micro-earthquakes and tremor caused by both Love and Rayleigh-type surface waves that traditionally occur in other tectonically active regions thousands of miles from large earthquakes. Peng says the subtle difference is that micro-earthquakes respond to both shearing and volumetric deformation from distant events. The newly found icequakes respond only to volumetric deformation. \u201cSuch differences may be subtle, but they tell us that the mechanisms of these triggered icequakes and small earthquakes are different,\u201d Peng added. \u201cOne is more like cracking, while the other is like a shear slip event. It\u2019s similar to two hands passing each other.\u201d Some of the icequakes were quick bursts and over in less than one second. Others were long duration, tremor-like signals up to 10 seconds. They occurred in various parts of the continent, including seismic stations along the coast and near the South Pole. The researchers found the clearest indication of induced high-frequency signals at station HOWD near the northwest corner of the Ellsworth Mountains. Short bursts occurred when the P wave hit the station, then continued again when the Rayleigh wave arrived. The triggered icequakes had very similar high waveform patterns, which indicates repeated failure at a single location, possibly by the opening of cracks. Peng says the source locations of the icequakes are difficult to determine because there isn\u2019t an extensive seismic network coverage in Antarctica. \u201cBut at least some of the icequakes themselves create surface waves, so they are probably formed very close to the ice surface,\u201d he added. \u201cWhile we cannot be certain, we suspect they simply reflect fracturing of ice in the near surface due to alternating volumetric compressions and expansions as the Rayleigh waves passed through Antarctica\u2019s frozen ice.\u201d Antarctica was originally not on the research team\u2019s target list. While examining seismic stations in the Southern Hemisphere, Peng \u201caccidently\u201d found the triggered icequakes at a few openly available stations. He and former Georgia Tech postdoctoral student Jake Walter (now a research scientist at the Institute for Geophysics at UT Austin) then reached out to other seismologists (the paper\u2019s four co-authors) who\u00a0were in charge of deploying more broadband seismometers in Antarctica.\u00a0 This project is partially supported by a National Science Foundation CAREER grant (EAR-0956051).\nAny conclusions expressed are those of the principal investigator and may not necessarily represent the official views of the NSF.\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nCollege of Sciences\nNature Geoscience Paper\nSchool of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences\nContact\nJason Maderer National Media Relations maderer@gatech.edu 404-385-2966\nEmail\nmaderer@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
