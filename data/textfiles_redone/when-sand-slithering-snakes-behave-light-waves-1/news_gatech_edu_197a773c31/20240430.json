While studying that motion to learn how limbless animals control their bodies in such environments, researchers discovered that snakes colliding with these obstacles mimic aspects of light or subatomic particles when they encounter a diffraction grating.\nThe effect of this \u201cmechanical diffraction\u201d allowed researchers to observe how the snakes\u2019 trajectories were altered through passive mechanisms governed by the skeletal and muscular dynamics of the animals\u2019 propagating body waves. The researchers studied live snakes as they slithered through an obstacle made up of six force-sensitive rigid pegs that buckled the animals\u2019 bodies, changing their paths in predictable ways.\nThe results, described February 25 in the journal\nProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , indicate that the Western Shovel-nosed snakes ( Chionactis occipitalis ) do not deliberately change direction when they encounter obstacles while speeding across the sand. Understanding the movement of these limbless animals could help engineers improve the control of autonomous search and rescue robots designed to operate on sand, grass and other complex environments.\n\u201cThe idea behind passive dynamics is that there are waveform shape changes being made by the animal that are driven entirely by the passive properties of their bodies,\u201d said Perrin Schiebel, a recent Ph.D. graduate of the\nSchool of Physics\nat the Georgia Institute of Technology. \u201cInstead of sending a signal to activate a muscle, the interaction of the snakes\u2019 bodies with the external environment is what causes the shape change. The forces of the obstacles are pushing the snake bodies into a new shape.\u201d\nThe colorful shovel-nosed snake normally uses a sinusoidal S-shaped wave to move across the deserts of the Southwest United States. Running into rigid pegs in a laboratory environment doesn\u2019t lead it to actively change that waveform, which Schiebel and colleagues studied using high-speed video cameras with eight different animals.\nIn a study supported by the National Science Foundation, Army Research Office, Defense Advanced Projects Agency, and a National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate Fellowship, the researchers used 253 snake trips to build up a diffraction pattern. Remarkably, the pattern also revealed that the scattering directions were \u201cquantized\u201d such that the probability of finding a snake behind the array could be represented in a pattern mimicking wave interference. A computational model was able to capture the pattern, demonstrating how the snakes\u2019 direction would be altered by obstacle encounters via passive body buckling.\n\u201cOne problem with robots moving in the real world is that we don\u2019t yet have principles by which we can understand how best to control these robots on granular surfaces like sand, leaf litter, rubble or grass,\u201d said\nDaniel Goldman , Dunn Family Professor in Georgia Tech\u2019s School of Physics and a researcher in the Petit Institute for Bioengineering and Bioscience. \u201cThe point of this study was to try to understand how limbless locomotors, which have long bodies that can bend in interesting ways using potentially complicated neuromechanical control schemes, manage to move through complicated terrain.\u201d\nThe snake experiment was suggested by a robotic study done by postdoctoral fellow Jennifer Rieser, who found similar behavior among robots encountering obstacles.\n\u201cThe robot tends to have aspects that mimic features of the subatomic world \u2014 the quantum world,\u201d Goldman explained. \u201cWhen it collides with barriers, a robot propagates through those barriers using waves of body bending. Its trajectory deviates as it exits the barriers, and many repeated trials reveal a \u2018lumpy\u2019 scattering pattern, analogous to experiments. We realized that we could use this surprising and beautiful phenomenon, classical physics but with self-propulsion a key feature, as a scattering experiment to interrogate the control scheme used by the snakes.\u201d\nExperimentally, the researchers used a \u201csnake arena\u201d covered with shag carpet to mimic sand. Undergraduate students Alex Hubbard and Lillian Chen released the snakes one at a time into the arena and encouraged them to slither through the grating.\nThe eyes of the desert snakes are naturally covered with scales to protect them. The researchers used children\u2019s face paint to temporarily \u201cblindfold\u201d the animals so they would not be distracted by the researchers. The paint did not harm the animals.\n\u201cWhen we put the snakes down in the arena, they started moving using the same waveform they use on desert sand,\u201d explained Schiebel. \u201cThey would then encounter the dowel grating, pass through it, and continue on the other side still using that waveform.\u201d\nInstead of continuing to travel through the arena in a straight line, the snakes would exit at a different angle, though they did not grab the posts or use them to assist their movement. Schiebel worked with Zeb Rocklin, a Georgia Tech assistant professor of physics, to model the directional changes. The model showed how simple interactions between the snakes' wave pattern and the grating produce patterns of favored scattering directions.\n\u201cWe think the snake is essentially operating in a model that control engineers would consider \u2018open loop,\u2019\u201d said Goldman. \u201cIt is setting a particular motor program on its body, which generates the characteristic wave pattern, and when it collides with the obstacle, its body mechanics allow it to deform and move the posts without degrading its speed.\u201d\nGoldman believes the work could help developers of snake-like robots improve their control schemes.\n\u201cWe think that our discoveries of the role of passive dynamics in the snake can facilitate new snake robot designs that will enable them to move through complex environments more fluidly,\u201d he said. \u201cThe goal would be to build search and rescue robots that can get into these complex environments and help first responders.\u201d\nAnd as a bonus, Goldman said, \u201cWe find that the richness of interactions between self-propelled systems like snakes and robots with their environment is fascinating from the standpoint of \u2018active matter\u2019 physics.\u201d\nThis work was supported by National Science Foundation Physics of Living Systems program awards PHY-1205878, PHY-1150760 and CMMI-1361778; by the Army Research Office through award W911NF-11-1-0514; U.S. DoD National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate Fellowship (NDSEG) 32 CFR 168a; and by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Young Faculty Award.
