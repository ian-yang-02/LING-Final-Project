The establishment of an Administrative Services Center (ASC) for Georgia Tech is foundational to meeting this goal. The ASC will support campus users by handling requests to fulfill routine, high-volume administrative transactions, enabling units to focus more time and attention on mission-critical and strategic activities.\nSome, but not all, administrative, IT, and grant administration tasks and processes (or portions of processes) will be transitioned to the ASC. Some work \u2013 especially work that is highly complex, specialized, and unique to a unit (whether a central or distributed unit) \u2013 will not be well served by a shared services model. For that reason, the AdminX team is carefully evaluating which processes and functions will be moved to the ASC, and will be reaching out to those who are closest to this work to better understand the activities they typically perform and the time required to complete them. This information will also help to determine appropriate staffing levels within the ASC to support the anticipated level of activity.\n\u201cThe success of this project will depend upon how well we understand the routine\u00a0tasks that are\u00a0performed today,\u201d said Kelly Fox, executive vice president for Administration and Finance. \u201cThis survey is an important step in helping\u00a0us improve\u00a0our\u00a0processes and better serve the Institute as a whole.\u201d\nTo collect this information, the AdminX team will survey classified administrative staff (across RI, the IRIs, and GTRI). The Activity and Opportunity Identification survey will be open from July 21 through Aug. 6.\nAbout the Survey\nThe survey is made up of two parts. The Activity assessment captures the level of effort being expended on administrative tasks. Then the Opportunity portion gathers open-ended input that will help with the planning and rollout of the ASC. The survey will primarily focus on the following functions:\nHuman Resources\nFinance (e.g., accounting, budgeting, etc.)\nGrant administration (post-award)\nInformation Technology\nGeneral administrative activities (e.g., scheduling, customer service, policy management, people management, etc.)\nWhile there are some parallels between this survey and the assessment conducted for the Comprehensive Administrative Review (CAR) in 2019, there are several key differences. The Activity and Opportunity Identification survey will include the task-level of transactions, while CAR stopped at the activity level. In addition, CAR was conducted before the Workday and OneUSG Connect implementations, which have significantly affected the day-to-day activities of administrative staff. This effort does not negate the work that has been done over the past few years, but will provide more up-to-date and detailed information for planning.\nThe team is excited to begin engaging with the campus to get more information about the administrative work performed across the Institute.

In addition, information sessions will be offered to provide tips on how to prepare for and complete the survey:\nTuesday, July 20, 1:30 \u2013 2:30 p.m .\nThursday, July 29, 11 a.m. \u2013 noon\nAttending an information session, which will be conducted virtually, is optional.\nIf you have any questions, send an email to\nadminx@gatech.edu .\nAdditional Images\nContact\nadminx@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
