The worms are packed so tightly together that they must locally line up with respect to each other. In this situation, we would say the worms form a nematic liquid crystal, an ordered phase similar to the materials used in many flat panel displays.\nHowever, the nematic phase formed by the worms is filled with tiny regions where the local alignment is lost \u2013 defects in the otherwise aligned material. In addition, because the worms are constantly moving and changing their configuration, this nematic phase is active and far from equilibrium.\nIn research reported October 23 in the journal\nNature Physics , scientists from the Georgia Institute of Technology and Leiden University in The Netherlands have described the results of a combined theoretical and experimental examination of such an active nematic on the surface of donut-shaped \u2013 toroidal \u2013 droplets. However, the researchers didn\u2019t use actual worms, but an active nematic composed of flexible filaments covered with microscopic engines that are constantly converting energy into motion.\nThis particular active material, originally developed at Brandeis University, borrows elements of cellular machinery, with bundles of rod-like microtubules forming the filaments, kinesin motor proteins acting as the engines, and ATP as the fuel. When this activity is combined with defects, the defects come to life, moving around like swimming microorganisms to explore space \u2013 in this case, exploring the surface of the toroidal droplets.\nBy studying toroidal droplets covered by this active nematic, the researchers confirmed a longstanding theoretical prediction about liquid crystals at equilibrium, first discussed by Bowick, Nelson and Travesset [Phys.Rev. E 69, 041102 (2004)] that nematic defects on the curved surface of such droplets will be sensitive to the local curvature. However, since the active nematic used in this work is far from equilibrium, the researchers also found how the internal activity changed and enriched the expectations.\n\u201cThere have been predictions that say defects are very sensitive to the space they inhabit, specifically to the curvature of the space,\u201d said Perry Ellis, a graduate student in the Georgia Tech\nSchool of Physics\nand the paper\u2019s first author. \u201cThe torus is a great place to investigate this because the outside of the torus, the part that looks locally like a sphere, has positive curvature while the inner part of a torus, the part that looks like a saddle, has negative curvature.\u201d\n\u201cThe quantity that characterizes a defect is what we call its topological charge or winding number,\u201d said\nAlberto Fernandez-Nieves , a professor in Georgia Tech\u2019s School of Physics and another of the paper\u2019s co-authors. \u201cIt expresses how the alignment direction of the nematic liquid crystal changes as we go around the defect. This topological charge is quantized, meaning that it can only take values from a discrete set that are multiples of one-half. \u201c\nIn these experiments, each defect has a topological charge of +1/2 or -1/2. To determine the charge and location of every defect, Ellis observed the toroidal droplets over time using a confocal microscope and then analyzed the resulting video using techniques borrowed from computer vision. The researchers found that even with the molecular motors driving the system out of equilibrium, the defects were still able to sense the curvature, with the +1/2 defects migrating towards the region of positive curvature and the -1/2 defects migrating towards the region of negative curvature.\nIn this new work, the scientists took a step forward in understanding how to control and guide defects in an ordered material.\n\u201cWe have learned that we can control and guide partially ordered active matter using the curvature of the underlying substrate,\u201d said Fernandez-Nieves. \u201cThis work opens opportunities to study how the defects in these materials arrange on surfaces that do not have constant curvature. This opens the door for controlling active matter using curvature.\u201d\nAn unexpected finding of the study was that the constant motion of the defects causes the average topological charge to become continuous, no longer taking only values that are multiples of one-half.\n\u201cIn the active limit of our experiments, we found that the topological charge becomes a continuous variable that can now take on any value,\u201d said Fernandez-Nieves. \u201cThis is reminiscent of what happens to many quantum systems at high temperature, where the quantum, discrete nature of the accessible states and associated variables is lost. Instead of being characterized by quantized properties, the system becomes characterized by continuum properties.\u201d\nEllis\u2019 observations of the droplets compared well with those of numerical simulations done by Assistant Professor Luca Giomi and postdoctoral researcher Daniel Pearce at the Instituut-Lorentz for Theoretical Physics at the Universiteit Leiden in The Netherlands.\n\u201cOur theoretical model helped us decipher the experimental results and fully understand the physical mechanism governing defect motion,\u201d said Pearce, \u201cbut also allowed us to go beyond the current experimental evidence.\u201d Added Giomi: \u201cActivity changes the nature of the interaction between defects and curvature. In weakly active systems, defects are attracted by regions of like-sign Gaussian curvature. But in strongly active systems, this effect becomes less relevant and defects behave as persistent random-walkers confined in a closed and inhomogeneous space\u201d.\nThere are many examples of active systems driven by internal activity, including swimming microorganisms, bird flocks, robot swarms and traffic flows. \u201cActive materials are everywhere, so our results aren\u2019t limited to just this system on a torus,\u201d Ellis added. \u201cYou could see the same behavior in any active system with defects.\u201d\nThe research sets the stage for future work in active fluids. \u201cOur results introduce a new framework to explore the mechanical properties of active fluids and suggest that partially ordered active matter can be guided and controlled via gradients in the intrinsic geometry of the underlying substrate,\u201d the authors wrote in a summary of their paper.\nThis research was supported by the National Science Foundation under award 1609841 and the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research.
