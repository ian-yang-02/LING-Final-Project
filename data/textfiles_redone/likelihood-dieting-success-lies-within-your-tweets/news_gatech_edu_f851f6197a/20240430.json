If we never fall we never fail, and if we never fail we never grow! \u201d are some examples of the upbeat and self-reflective language the research indicates is most common to successful dieters.\nOther traits of successful dieters are that they tend to be more focused on topics related to health and fitness, and they are more socially interactive.\n\u201cWe see that these users are much more likely to share healthy recipes, offer tips on nutrition and exercise, and report on their own progress,\u201d said De Choudhury. \u201cTheir larger network of friends and followers, and increased engagement, means that they tend to also have stronger support systems, which positively impacts the likelihood of dieting compliance.\u201d\nAs for those who are not successful in meeting dietary goals, their Twitter content often has a demonstrably negative tone and they tend to be more uneasy and fearful in their posts.\n\u201cThese users tend to be more anxious seemingly because of a lack of emotional control, and because of certain activities and events of daily life,\u201d said De Choudhury.\nSample posts here include, \u201c I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m going to lose my mind. Completely lose what little is left. I cry at the thought of stupid things ...\u201d and \u201c Feel rough as old boots this morning :/ Ankle hurts, shin hurts, chest hurts, head hurts .\u201d\nWhile the study of Twitter in isolation can reveal insights into users\u2019 health status, this research breaks new ground in that the study group consists of individuals who have connected their MyFitnessPal (MFP) \u2013 a calorie-counting app \u2013 and Twitter accounts.\n\u201cThese areas have been individually observed to glean health indicators,\u201d explained De Choudhury. \u201cHowever, considering these data sources together and applying an established causality testing methodology allows us to validate for the very first time the efficacy of social media and quantified self-sensing in revealing risk to diet compliance.\u201d\nThe research looks at more than 2 million tweets and 100,000+ daily MFP entries from nearly 700 individuals. Twitter\u2019s official streaming API was used to identify qualified users by searching publicly shared posts with the hashtag \u201c#myfitnesspal\u201d and that contained an embedded link.\nAn individual\u2019s MFP food diary entries were coupled with Twitter posts from the corresponding time period. From this, adherence to their set dieting goals was compared to attitudes and behaviors expressed in the tweets.\nTweets were analyzed for linguistic attributes that reveal connections between a person\u2019s behavioral expression and their health and wellbeing. Along with affective and cognitive aspects, the linguistic style of the tweets was also examined.\nIn future, De Choudhury suggested the new analytical method could be pushed forward to provide greater health and wellbeing benefits.\n\u201cFor instance, by temporally aligning social media, quantified self sensing and self-reported attributes, statistical models may be able to explore dynamics of events around when or how soon an individual\u2019s diet is likely to fail,\u201d said De Choudhury. \u201cThis would allow for proactive measures to be taken to help ensure more positive health outcomes.\u201d\nA paper titled\nComputational Approaches Toward Integrating Quantified Self Sensing and Social Media\ndetails these findings and is being presented later this month at the\n20th ACM Conference on Computer-Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing .\nAdditional Images\nContact\nAlbert \"Ben\" Snedeker - Communications Manager\n404.894.7253 albert.snedeker@cc.gatech.edu\nEmail\nalbert.snedeker@cc.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
