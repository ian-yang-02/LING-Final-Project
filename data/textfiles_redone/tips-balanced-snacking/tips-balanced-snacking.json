But with a little planning, you can satisfy the craving with a healthier option. Danielle Southern, nutritionist in Health Initiatives in the Division of Student Engagement and Well-Being, provides five tips for mindful and balanced snacking.\nStock up on portable non-perishables.\nA variety of items can be kept in your office or backpack without spoiling.\nNuts or nut butter, jerky, trail mix, corn tortilla chips, popcorn, graham crackers, and cereal do not require refrigeration.\nConsider cold snacks.\nHaving access to a refrigerator or lunch bag with an ice pack increases your snack options.\nYogurt, cottage cheese, a sandwich or wrap, string cheese, berries, and dips like hummus, salsa, and guacamole stay fresh longer when refrigerated. If you don\u2019t have a place to keep these snacks cool, eat them within two hours to ensure they stay fresh.\nPair a protein or fat with a carbohydrate.\nThis combination balances blood sugars and energy levels, making it easier to focus on projects and participate in other activities throughout the day.\nExamples of these pairings include tortilla chips and guacamole, sliced vegetables and hummus, cheese and crackers, and apples and peanut butter.\nIf you didn\u2019t bring a snack from home, find grab-and-go options at various campus locations.\nCoffee shops (Blue Donkey, Kaldi\u2019s, and Gold & Bold) typically have fruit, nuts, and protein bars to accompany your beverage. Coffee drinks that are milk-based (cow\u2019s milk or soy milk) can provide the protein/fat/carbohydrate combination.\nThe Dive in the Campus Recreation Center has smoothies, fruit cups, hummus, and wraps.\nRising Roll has avocado toast, smoothies, wraps, and milk-based coffee drinks.\nRemember to hydrate.\nWater is the fluid our bodies need the most, but 100% of your fluid needs do not have to come from plain water.\nHigh water fruits and vegetables (such as cucumbers, leafy greens, watermelon, grapes, and apples), tea, coffee, milk, sparkling water, and soups all contain fluids. Be mindful of sodium and caffeine levels, as these can lead to more fluid losses when consumed in excess.\nNot a fan of plain water? Try adding fruit slices, flavor drops, or low-sugar drink mixes. You can even experiment with different temperatures of water or use ice cubes made from frozen 100% fruit juice.\n\u201cPrepping snacks can take some planning, but it can save you time, money, and energy,\u201d said Southern. \u201cExperiment with different snack combinations to see what works best for you. Your tastes can change over time, and that\u2019s OK.\u201d\nNote: If you have questions about nutrition services, email\nnutrition@gatech.edu\nfor assistance.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nVictor Rogers\nInstitute Communications\nEmail\nvictor.rogers@comm.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
