The Institute\u2019s regular testing of students, faculty, and staff has kept the number of positive cases relatively low on campus.\nIn January Georgia Tech, in collaboration with the Georgia Department of Public Health (DPH), began administering Covid-19 vaccines. Health experts recommend that, even though the vaccine is being administered, weekly surveillance testing should continue.\n\u201cStudies show that the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines are effective at preventing severe illness from Covid-19. What we don\u2019t know yet is how effective they are at preventing asymptomatic infection and whether they prevent people from carrying the virus and spreading it to other people,\u201d said Dr. Ben Holton, senior director of Stamps Health Services. \u201cThat\u2019s why the current recommendations from the CDC are, even if you\u2019ve had two doses of the Covid-19 vaccine, you still need to wear a mask and practice social distancing, because we don\u2019t know yet if you can spread the virus after being vaccinated. We are encouraging people to continue getting tested after they have had the vaccine.\u201d\nTesting is done on a walk-up basis, is free of charge, and takes just a few minutes. Participants should login to\nmytest.gatech.edu\nwith their Georgia Tech account, complete the survey, and generate a tracking barcode for the test before visiting one of the\ntesting sites\non campus ,\nHow Testing Works\nThe samples are transferred to the test lab three times a day for evaluation. To reduce the number of polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, tests that must be run each day, the saliva samples are pooled so that a single test can examine samples from five individuals. An innovative dual pooling strategy can identify one individual in a set of samples who is presumed positive.\nWhat is dual pooling? Let\u2019s follow your sample:\nYour sample is split into\ntwo pools . Each pool contains a total of\nfive samples .\u00a0With six pools from 15 participants, everyone is uniquely in two of the pools.\nThe samples are mixed together and each\npooled sample\nis tested with a single test.\nEveryone who participates in surveillance testing\nwill receive a notification\nthat they are either recommended or not recommended for a follow-up diagnostic test.\nIf\nneither of your pools\ncomes back positive, then\nyou are informed that you are not recommended for a follow-up test\nand no further action is required at this time.\nIf\nboth of your\npooled samples are positive , your original sample is then\ntested individually\nin the CLIA lab to confirm the sample has SARS-CoV-2.\nIf\none of your pools\ncomes back positive but your\nother pool does not , then usually\nyour sample was not the positive one . However, sometimes there is ambiguity and the lab retests it anyway, which is why some people are notified that they are recommended for a diagnostic test, but subsequently test negative. This double positive requirement minimizes false positives.\nThe surveillance and diagnostic testing is normally completed within 36 to 48 hours, allowing contact tracers to identify other community members who may have been exposed.\nSurveillance testing participants may notice they are asked to reconsent before their next test when they visit\nmytest.gatech.edu . The lab will now perform additional tests to identify the strain of virus, for the purpose of informing policy to help keep campus safe. The reconsent acknowledges this fact. Individuals will not be provided the strain information, since it does not change any follow-up procedures for a positive result.\nContinued surveillance testing is important in identifying asymptomatic Covid-19 members of the Tech community and keeping the daily case counts low.\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nFaces of Testing\nBroad-based Testing Helps Control Covid-19\nTesting Success Depends on Participation\nTesting site locations/hours\nVaccine Information\nContact\nVictor Rogers\nInstitute Communications\nEmail\nvictor.rogers@comm.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
