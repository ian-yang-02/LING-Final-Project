The program has averaged more than 7,500 tests per week, and has already identified more than 600 individuals who have tested positive for Covid-19. By identifying and isolating those infected as early as possible \u2014 before they even suspect they\u2019re ill \u2014 the program helps break chains of transmission that would otherwise fuel exponential growth of the highly contagious virus.\nRegular testing takes place in multiple campus locations. Data from the testing program has allowed campus scientists to identify developing clusters in student residences and focus mobile testing resources on those hot spots. The testing is part of a comprehensive program that includes mandated masks, physical distancing, traditional contact tracing, conventional diagnostic testing for symptomatic individuals, and awareness campaigns as recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nTesting to Control the Virus\n\u201cWe\u2019d like to test everybody on campus once a week because it\u2019s very clear that asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic people are transmitting the virus,\u201d said\nGreg Gibson , a professor of computational genomics in Georgia Tech\u2019s\nSchool of Biological Sciences\nand a leader of the research team that developed the testing program. \u201cThe case decline is consistent with what we predicted \u2014 and is very encouraging, in many ways even better than we\u2019d hoped.\u201d\nAfter rising past 4% at the start of fall semester in mid-August, Georgia Tech\u2019s percentage of positive cases dropped to less than 0.3% in the two-week period ending October 7. The number of cases reported daily on the campus website has been in single digits during that two-week period.\nThe strategy behind the asymptomatic testing program grew out of an appreciation of the dynamics behind the virus\u2019s exponential growth \u2014 and the major role of asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic people in that spread. If Georgia Tech could identify and isolate most of the new cases popping up each week, they realized, new incidence could be kept at a relatively low level. Aiming to test the majority of the population each week could provide the ability to stay ahead of the virus.\n\u201cThrough the work of the logistics and laboratory teams, we are now at a stage where rapid surveillance testing is being used as a form of mitigation to help control viral spread,\u201d said\nJoshua Weitz , a professor in Georgia Tech\u2019s School of Biological Sciences, director of the interdisciplinary Ph.D. in quantitative biosciences, and a leader on the team analyzing surveillance testing data. \u201cThanks to the incredible work of the logistics and testing community, we have the capacity for comprehensive surveillance testing, so we are getting early warning signs that allow us to detect and respond to outbreaks earlier rather than later.\u201d\nRead the rest of the feature article.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nJohn Toon\nResearch News\n(404) 894-6986\nEmail\njtoon@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
