A question about the accrediting body used has also delayed the release of clinical psychology program rankings.\nIn the meantime, rankings that were released April 9 show Scheller is now in the nation\u2019s top 25, with five of its program areas ranked among the country\u2019s top 10. Scheller has the No. 1-ranked part-time MBA program in Georgia. U.S. News also announced increases in every Georgia Tech computer science discipline ranked by the outlet, and there is continued momentum among programs in the Ivan Allen College of Liberal Arts.
