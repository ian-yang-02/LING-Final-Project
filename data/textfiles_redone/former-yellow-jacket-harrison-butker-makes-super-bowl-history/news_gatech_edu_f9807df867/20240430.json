Before Sunday\u2019s matchup at Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas, Steve Christie\u2019s record of a 54-yard field goal for the Bills had stood since Super Bowl 28.\nNo stranger to setting records, Butker, now a three-time Super Bowl champion, is the all-time leading scorer in Georgia Tech history and finds himself in elite company on the NFL\u2019s biggest stage. With four field goals and a pair of extra points Sunday, Butker has accounted for 37 points across his four Super Bowl appearances,\ntrailing only 49ers wide receiver Jerry Rice\u2019s 48 .\nWith his game-tying kick, the industrial engineering graduate moved past Patriots kickers Adam Vinatieri and Stephen Gostkowski for the most career Super Bowl field goals with nine.\nAt 89%, Butker is the second all-time in field goal percentage in NFL history, behind Ravens kicker Justin Tucker.\nRelated links\nButker Makes History in Super Bowl LVIII\nContact\nSteven Gagliano\n- Institute Communications\nEmail\nSteven.gagliano@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
