Enjoy the time, create memories, and connect with friends and family.\nNov 14, 2022\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nThis time of year often delivers an array of tempting foods \u2014 Halloween candy, tailgating snacks, Thanksgiving dinner, and holiday parties. There is nothing wrong with engaging with different types of food, but balance is key.\nCarli Barbo, dietitian in the Wellness Empowerment Center in the Division of Student Engagement and Well-Being, and Molly Edwards, dietetic intern with Emory University Hospital, provide tips for keeping your health on course while navigating the buffet table of the holiday season.\nThe holidays can be stressful. Don\u2019t let food be a stresor, too.\nTry to maintain the same eating patterns during the holidays as the rest of the year. If you normally eat breakfast and lunch, you should continue during the holidays.\nDon\u2019t show up at an event overly hungry, and honor your hunger by eating only when you are actually hungry.\nRemember that food is more than fuel (nutrients and calories) \u2014 it is also social. Enjoy the time, create memories, and connect with friends and family.\nDon\u2019t limit the amount or the time spent around food.\nDon\u2019t try to \u201cmake up for\u201d what you ate with extra workouts.\nTry to find balance in your meals by eating a variety of carbohydrates, protein, fat, and fiber.\nIgnore what diet culture may be telling you.\nEat until you start to feel full, then wait about 10 minutes to reassess hunger cues.

Don\u2019t label foods as \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cbad.\u201d\nDon\u2019t place restrictions on certain foods.
