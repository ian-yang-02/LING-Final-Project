They\u2019ve entered our daily lives and can be found in our homes, hospitals and our streets.\nThese robot and human interactions raise a series of questions that the general public and lawmakers must face.\n\u201cWhen robots start truly engaging with us, what does that really mean?\u201d asked Magnus Egerstedt, the Steve W. Chaddick School Chair and a professor in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering. \u201cAnd what does it mean for us to interact with them?\u201d\nThe emerging debate on ethics and robotics was the focus of two panel discussion Georgia Tech hosted Tuesday in Washington, D.C. The event \u2013 \u201cDrones, Driverless Cars and Difficult Decisions\u201d examined the expectations humans have about robots\u2019 capabilities and limits. They also spoke of the responsibilities that researchers, scientists, corporations and policymakers have as well.\nA luncheon roundtable, held on Capitol Hill, attracted congressional staffers, representatives from national associations and others from the D.C. policy community.\nDuring the evening roundtable held at the National Press Club, reporters from\u00a0 Inside Higher Ed ,\u00a0 The Washington Post and\u00a0 U.S. News & World Report\u00a0 asked questions and helped guide the conversation.\nIn addition to Egerstedt two other Georgia Tech professors served on the panel: Ronald Arkin, director of the Mobile Robot Laboratory in the College of Computing, and Ayanna Howard, chair of the School of Interactive Computing in the College of Computing and the the Linda J. and Mark C. Smith Chair professor.\nThe other four panelists were: Cindy Grimm, an associate professor of mechanical engineering at Oregon State University; Benjamin Kuipers, a professor of computer science and engineering at the University of Michigan; Bertram Malle, a professor in the department of cognitive, linguistic and psychological sciences at Brown University; and Reid Simmons, a research professor in robotics and computer science at Carnegie Mellon University.\nArkin said for years researchers focused on making new discoveries without paying as much attention to the implications. But there is acknowledgement of the responsibilities that roboticists have to make sure they don\u2019t promise more than they can deliver.\nHe noted the complexities in programming a robot on how to be good.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have the answers for all this yet,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are just beginning to make forays into this space \u2026 Please be patient.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nContact\nFor media inquiries:\u00a0Laura Diamond,\u00a0 laura.diamond@gatech.edu\nEmail\nlaura.diamond@gatech.edu\nAdditional information\nNational Roundtable Initiative\nGeorgia Tech\u2019s national media roundtable initiative brings together thought leaders from different organizations to discuss important issues. It is the result of a partnership with the Georgia Tech\u2019s Office of Development, Institute Communications, Office of Government and Community Relations and individual colleges and units.\nThis was Georgia Tech\u2019s ninth roundtable and past events have examined the changing landscape in higher education, college admissions trends, lessons learned since Hurricane Katrina and how to attract more female engineers and more African-American men into science, technology, engineering and mathematics.\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
