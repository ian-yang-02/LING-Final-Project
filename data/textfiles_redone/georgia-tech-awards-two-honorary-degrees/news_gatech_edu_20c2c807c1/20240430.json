An honorary doctorate is the most significant honor a university can bestow on an individual.\nRichard \u201cDick\u201d Bergmark\nis a 1975 industrial management graduate who has demonstrated a deep commitment to Georgia Tech. He was awarded an honorary degree during the afternoon bachelor\u2019s ceremony on Saturday, May 7.\n\u201cI\u2019m a little bit speechless about this,\u201d Bergmark said. His remarks focused on how generosity can improve the lives of others, and encouraged graduates to thank those whose generosity helped them get to their graduation day. \u201cMany of us probably wouldn\u2019t be here if it weren\u2019t for the generosity of other people. Share this moment of achievement with your supporters.\u201d\nWhile working in London, he was fortunate to be involved in a management-led buyout of a small, unprofitable division of a Fortune 100 technology conglomerate. In his role as the chief financial officer of this geological research laboratory, he led the company\u2019s IPO on NASDAQ, then later moved the listing to the New York Stock Exchange followed by a dual listing on the Amsterdam Euronext Stock Exchange. Under his leadership, the company grew substantially, with laboratories and operations in more than 50 countries and over 5,000 employees.\u00a0He also holds an MBA from the University of Oklahoma and was a certified public accountant in Texas.\nToday, Bergmark enjoys mentoring students on career development decisions as well as serving as an advisor to a STEM-related educational foundation. He stays engaged with Georgia Tech as an emeritus trustee of the Georgia Tech Foundation, chair of the Scheller College of Business advisory board, and member of the Alexander-Tharpe board of directors.\nDuring his time in London he met Toni, his wife of more than 28 years. They reside in Houston, Texas.\nWatch Dick Bergmark\u2019s remarks at Spring 2022 Commencement.\nRaphael Bostic , president and chief executive officer of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, was awarded an honorary degree during the master\u2019s ceremony on Friday, May 6, in recognition of his role as a valued friend of Georgia Tech.\nBostic has engaged students, faculty, and staff at Georgia Tech through ongoing partnerships and research conversations related to economic policy, city design, economic mobility, and sustainable futures for Atlanta, Georgia, and beyond.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t get these every day, and it\u2019s really a day of pride for me,\u201d Bostic said. He was a professor for more than 15 years, and talked about why Commencement was always his favorite day on campus. \u201cIt\u2019s the one day and the only day of the year, when everyone \u2013 students, parents, professors, instructors \u2013 is happy. Thank you for letting me share this time with you.\nBostic took office June 5, 2017, as the 15th president and chief executive officer of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. He is responsible for all the bank's activities, including monetary policy, bank supervision and regulation, and payment services. In addition, he serves on the Federal Reserve's chief monetary policy body, the Federal Open Market Committee. The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta serves the Sixth Federal Reserve District, which covers Alabama, Florida, and Georgia, and parts of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Tennessee. The Bank has branches in Birmingham, Jacksonville, Miami, Nashville, and New Orleans.\nWatch Raphael Bostic\u2019s remarks at Spring 2022 Commencement.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nevents@comm.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
