Neuman also participated last year, riding 300 miles and raising more than $1,000. The challenge, for Neuman, is personal.\n\u201cIn January 2021, my mom was diagnosed with stage 4 kidney cancer. She encouraged me to participate in the challenge last year,\u201d Neuman said. \u201cMy mom supported me proudly and wrangled many of her friends together to support my cause. In January 2022, my mom passed away after a courageous fight with cancer.\u201d\nThis year, Neuman was asked to be a GCC Champion, acting as an ambassador for her region by organizing group rides, recruiting more riders, advertising their goal, and serving as a local spokesperson for the initiative.\nHer personal goal this year is to ride 400 miles and raise $3,500.\nAs a psychology student, Neumann\u2019s research interests lie at the intersection of neuroendocrinology, aging, and behavioral and cognitive performance. Though her research is not directly related to childhood cancer or its effects, she finds overlap in the importance of an active lifestyle.\n\u201cChildhood cancer is typically not caused by lifestyle, but by genetic and environmental risks or random chance. However, healthy and active lifestyles may make cancer-related health deficiencies more obvious in children, thus leading to a quicker treatment response,\u201d she said. \u201cHealthy lifestyles are also incredibly important during and after cancer treatment in children, as this can mitigate the development of chronic diseases known as \u2018late effects.\u2019 In adults, lifestyle plays a remarkable role in cancer risk\u00a0. A healthy diet and habitual exercise decrease not only the risk of cancer in adults, but also the risk of cognitive deficiencies like Alzheimer's disease and dementia.\u201d\nIn addition to fundraising and supporting research, the challenge has proven positive for Neuman\u2019s own lifestyle \u2014 giving her a goal and prompting her to develop a habit of cycling even amid a busy academic schedule.\n\u201cMy hope is that continued research into the effects of a healthy lifestyle on a multitude of biological domains will be used to educate people young and old on the importance of eating healthy and being active. The reduction of cancer or age-related cognitive deficiencies is a win in my books. Hopefully my contributions to science and to GCC will help.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nGreat Cycle Challenge\nAbigail Neuman Rider Profile\nContact\nKristen Bailey\nInstitute Communications\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
