The goal of the project, which will be led by the\nGeorgia Tech Research Institute\n(GTRI), is to use DNA as the basis for deployable storage technologies that can eventually scale into the exabyte regime and beyond with reduced physical footprint, power and cost requirements relative to conventional storage technologies.\nThe technology already exists for storing and reading information into DNA \u2014 which also encodes the genetic blueprint for living organisms \u2014 but significant advances will be needed to make it commercially practical and cost competitive with established magnetic tape and optical disk memory. While current archival storage has a limited lifetime, information stored in DNA could last for hundreds of years.\n\u201cThe goal is to significantly reduce the size, weight and power required for archival data storage,\u201d said Alexa Harter, director of GTRI\u2019s Cybersecurity, Information Protection, and Hardware Evaluation Research (CIPHER) Laboratory. \u201cWhat would take acres in a data farm today could be kept in a device the size of the tabletop. We want to significantly improve all kinds of metrics for long-term data storage.\u201d\nThe Scalable Molecular Archival Software and Hardware (SMASH) project resulted from a proposal prepared by GTRI, San Francisco-based Twist Bioscience, San Diego-based Roswell Biotechnologies, and the University of Washington in collaboration with Microsoft.\nIn the project plans, Twist will engineer a DNA synthesis platform on silicon that \u201cwrites\u201d the DNA strands that carry the data. Roswell will provide DNA sequencing, or \"reading\" technology, and the University of Washington \u2013 in collaboration with Microsoft \u2013 will bring system architecture, data analysis and coding expertise to the project. At Georgia Tech, the project will involve fabrication facilities at the Institute for Electronics and Nanotechnology and researchers in such specialties as chemistry and information theory, who will also draw from four of GTRI\u2019s eight laboratories.\n\u201cThe reason people are looking at DNA for storage is that it has evolved over the ages as a very compact and reliable means of information storage,\u201d said Nicholas Guise, a GTRI senior research scientist. \u201cIt\u2019s so compact that a practical DNA archive could store an exabyte of data\u2014equivalent to a million terabyte hard drives\u2014in a volume about the size of a sugar cube. Scientists have been able to read DNA from animals that died centuries ago, so the data lasts essentially forever under the right conditions.\u201d\nTechnology for encoding and decoding DNA works at small scales today, but to be useful for commercial archival purposes, researchers will have to scale up the production of synthetic DNA, reliably connect it to established computing systems and improve the speed of the data writing and reading process. The project goal would be to encode and decode terabytes of data in a day at costs and rates more than 100 times better than current technologies.\nDNA data storage won\u2019t initially replace server farms for information that must be accessed quickly and often. Because of the time required for reading and decoding, the technique would be useful for information that must be kept indefinitely, but accessed infrequently.\nPart of the technical challenge is interfacing the DNA with standard CMOS electronic technologies. The researchers plan to build hybrid chips in which the DNA grows above layers containing the electronics. The overall project will leverage the efficiencies of current semiconductor technologies, said Brooke Beckert, a GTRI research engineer.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be working with commercial foundries, so when we get the processing right, it should be much easier to transition the technology over to them,\u201d she said. \u201cConnecting to the existing technology infrastructure is a critical part of this project, but we\u2019ll have to custom-make most of the components in the first stage.\u201d\nAmong the challenges will be managing the tradeoffs between speed and error, said Guise. \u201cThe issue is how far down we can scale this without introducing too many errors,\u201d he said. \u201cThe basic synthesis is proven at a scale of hundreds of microns. We want to shrink that by a factor of 100, which leads us to worry about such issues as crosstalk between different DNA strands in adjacent locations on the chips.\u201d\nCurrent technology uses modified inkjet printing to produce the DNA strands, but the SMASH project plans to grow the biopolymer more rapidly and in larger quantities using parallelized synthesis on the hybrid chips.\nTo achieve the major advances in reading cost and speed required, the program will rely on the molecular electronic DNA reader chips under development at Roswell. The data will be read from DNA strands using a molecular electronic sensor array chip, on which single molecules are drawn through nanoscale current meters that measure electrical signatures of each letter in the sequence.\u00a0 For biomedical applications, the sequencing industry has been focused on a goal of achieving a $1,000 human genome. The DNA reading goals of this program amount to delivering a $10 genome, and that will require a major technology disruption.\nThe researchers acknowledge the challenges ahead in bringing their devices to commercial scale.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t see any killers ahead for this technology,\u201d said Adam Meier, a GTRI senior research scientist. \u201cThere is a lot of emerging technology and doing this commercially will require many orders of magnitude improvement. Magnetic tape for archival storage has been improving steadily for 60 years, and this investment from IARPA will power the advancements needed to make DNA storage competitive with that.\"\nResearch News\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\n177 North Avenue\nAtlanta, Georgia\u00a0 30332-0181\u00a0 USA\nMedia Relations Contact : John Toon (404-894-6986) (jtoon@gatech.edu).\nWriter : John Toon\nAdditional Images\nContact\nJohn Toon\nResearch News\n(404) 894-6986\nEmail\njtoon@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
