Given Tech\u2019s Midtown location, however, there are occasions when events near campus may not directly affect operations but are worth monitoring. That\u2019s where the new GTENS Inform will come into play.\nAn expanded GTENS system will be used to inform the campus community that campus officials and authorities are monitoring a nearby situation, but it does not mean that an emergency currently exists or that immediate action is necessary. A separate GTENS message, branded as \u2018GTENS Emergency\u2019 to further differentiate these messages from GTENS Inform, will be sent if the situation becomes a threat to campus.\nIn addition to sending a unified and reassuring message, the system is also intended to reduce the number of inquiries\u2013\u2013ensuring that all emergency personnel are available to assist with the situation.\n\"The introduction of GTENS Inform allows us to communicate about high visibility incidents that may appear concerning but do not actually require immediate action by our community. GTENS Emergency messages are still reserved for imminent threats requiring immediate action,\u201d Will Smith, director of\nEmergency Management and Communications , said.\nGTENS Inform does not replace Clery Act Safety Alerts, and GTENS will continue to be used to announce changes in normal campus operations.\nCurrent GTENS enrollees will automatically begin receiving GTENS Inform messages through traditional channels, including phone calls, text messages, email, and social media. Parents of Tech students were recently invited to sign up for GTENS, allowing families to stay better informed and connected during emergencies. Parents opting into the system can sign up \u00a0 here .\nStudents and employees should ensure they are registered to receive text and voice alerts at passport.gatech.edu.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nSteven Gagliano\n- Communications Officer\nInstitute Communications\nEmail\nsteven.gagliano@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
