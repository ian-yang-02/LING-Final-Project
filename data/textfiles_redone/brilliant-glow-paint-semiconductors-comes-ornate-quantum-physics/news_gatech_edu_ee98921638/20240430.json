Now, next-generation semiconducting materials are on the horizon, and\u00a0 in a new study , researchers have uncovered eccentric physics behind their potential to transform lighting technology and photovoltaics yet again.\nComparing the quantum properties of these emerging so-called hybrid semiconductors with those of their established predecessors is about like comparing the Bolshoi Ballet to jumping jacks. Twirling troupes of quantum particles undulate through the emerging materials, creating, with ease, highly desirable optoelectronic (light-electronic) properties, according to a team of physical chemists led by\u00a0 researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology .\nThese same properties are impractical to achieve in established semiconductors.\nThe particles moving through these new materials also engage the material itself in the quantum action, akin to dancers enticing the floor to dance with them. The researchers were able to measure patterns in the material caused by the dancing and relate them to the emerging material\u2019s quantum properties and to energy introduced into the material.\nThese insights could help engineers work productively with the new class of semiconductors.\nUnusually flexible semiconductors\nThe emerging material\u2019s ability to house diverse, eccentric quantum particle movements, analogous to the dancers, is directly related to its unusual flexibility on a molecular level, analogous to the dancefloor that joins in the dances. By contrast, established semiconductors have rigid, straight-laced molecular structures that leave the dancing to quantum particles.\nThe class of hybrid semiconductors the researchers examined is called\u00a0 halide organic-inorganic perovskite \u00a0(HOIP), which will be explained in more detail at bottom along with the \u201chybrid\u201d semiconductor designation, which combines a crystal lattice -- common in semiconductors -- with a layer of innovatively flexing material.\nBeyond their promise of unique radiance and energy-efficiency, HOIPs are easy to produce and apply.\nPaint them on\n\u201cOne compelling advantage is that HOIPs are made using low temperatures and processed in solution,\u201d said\u00a0 Carlos Silva, a professor in Georgia Tech\u2019s School of Chemistry and Biochemistry . \u201cIt takes much less energy to make them, and you can make big batches.\u201d Silva co-led the study alongside\u00a0 Ajay Ram Srimath Kandada \u00a0from Georgia Tech and the Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia.\nIt takes high temperatures to make most semiconductors in small quantities, and they are rigid to apply to surfaces, but HOIPs could be painted on to make LEDs, lasers or even window glass that could glow in any color from aquamarine to fuchsia. Lighting with HOIPs may require very little energy, and solar panel makers could boost photovoltaics\u2019 efficiency and slash production costs.\nThe team led by Georgia Tech included researchers from the Universit\u00e9 de Mons in Belgium and the Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia. The results were published\u00a0 on January 14, 2019, in the journal\u00a0 Nature Materials . The work was funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation, EU Horizon 2020, the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, the Fond Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois pour la Recherche, and the Belgian Federal Science Policy Office.\n[Thinking about grad school?\u00a0 Here's how to apply to Georgia Tech. ]\nQuantum jumping jacks\nSemiconductors in optoelectronic devices can either convert light into electricity or electricity into light. The researchers concentrated on processes connected to the latter: light emission.\nThe trick to getting a material to emit light is, broadly speaking, to apply energy to electrons in the material, so that they take a\u00a0 quantum leap \u00a0up from their orbits around atoms then emit that energy as light when they hop back down to the orbits they had vacated. Established semiconductors can\u00a0 trap \u00a0electrons in areas of the material that strictly limit the electrons\u2019 range of motion then apply energy to those areas to make electrons do quantum leaps in unison to emit useful light when they hop back down in unison.\n\u201cThese are\u00a0 quantum wells , two-dimensional parts of the material that confine these quantum properties to create these particular light emission properties,\u201d Silva said.\nImaginary particle excitement\nThere is a potentially more attractive way to produce the light, and it is a core strength of the new hybrid semiconductors.\nAn electron has a negative charge, and an orbit it vacates after having been excited by energy is a positive charge called an\u00a0 electron hole . The electron and the hole can gyrate around each other forming a kind of imaginary particle, or\u00a0 quasiparticle , called an\u00a0 exciton .\n\u201cThe positive-negative attraction in an exciton is called\u00a0 binding energy , and it\u2019s a very high-energy phenomenon, which makes it great for light emitting,\u201d Silva said.\nWhen the electron and the hole reunite, that releases the binding energy to make light. But usually, excitons are very hard to maintain in a semiconductor.\n\u201cThe excitonic properties in conventional semiconductors are only stable at extremely cold temperatures,\u201d Silva said. \u201cBut in HOIPs the excitonic properties are very stable at room temperature.\u201d\nOrnate quasiparticle twirling\nExcitons get freed up from their atoms and move around the material. In addition, excitons in an HOIP can whirl around other excitons, forming quasiparticles called biexcitons. And there\u2019s more.\nExcitons also spin around atoms in the material lattice. Much the way an electron and an electron hole create an exciton, this twirl of the exciton around an atomic nucleus gives rise to yet another quasiparticle called a\u00a0 polaron . All that action can result in excitons transitioning to polarons back. One can even speak of some excitons taking on a \u201cpolaronic\u201d nuance.\nCompounding all those dynamics is the fact that HOIPs are full of positively and negatively charged ions. The ornateness of these quantum dances has an overarching effect on the material itself.\nWave patterns resonate\nThe uncommon participation of atoms of the material in these dances with electrons, excitons, biexcitons and polarons creates repetitive nanoscale indentations in the material that are observable as wave patterns and that shift and flux with the amount of energy added to the material.\n\u201cIn a ground state, these wave patterns would look a certain way, but with added energy, the excitons do things differently. That changes the wave patterns, and that\u2019s what we measure,\u201d Silva said. \u201cThe key observation in the study is that the wave pattern varies with different types of excitons (exciton, biexciton, polaronic/less polaronic).\u201d\nThe indentations also grip the excitons, slowing their mobility through the material, and all these ornate dynamics may affect the quality of light emission.\nRubber band sandwich\nThe material, a halide organic-inorganic perovskite, is a sandwich of two inorganic crystal lattice layers with some organic material in between them \u2013 making HOIPs an organic-inorganic hybrid material. The quantum action happens in the crystal lattices.\nThe organic layer in between is like a sheet of rubber bands that makes the crystal lattices into a wobbly but stable dancefloor. Also, HOIPs are put together with many\u00a0 non-covalent bonds , making the material soft.\nIndividual units of the crystal take a form called perovskite, which is a very even diamond shape, with a metal in the center and halogens such as chlorine or iodine at the points, thus \u201chalide.\u201d For this study, the researchers used a 2D prototype with the formula (PEA) 2 PbI 4 .\nAlso READ:\nPerking up and Crimping the 'Bristles' of Polyelectrolyte Brushes\nThe study was co-authored by F\u00e9lix Thouin (co-first author), David A.
