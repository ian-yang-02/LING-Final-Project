Bankoff\u2019s perspective on the midtown \u201cinnovation zone\u201d draws upon his experience in the arts, business, law, technology, and his role now in higher education as chair of the\nIvan Allen College\nSam Nunn School of International Affairs. \u201cWe are building strong connections among technology research, education, and entrepreneurial enterprise. Anchor businesses and infrastructure are in place. Our efforts will be to further develop those synergies with a goal of fully realizing Midtown as a hub for a work-live-play technology community.\u201d Bankoff joined the Midtown Alliance in 2006 while serving as president and CEO of the Woodruff Arts Center. Over the past two years he has chaired Midtown Alliance\u2019s Innovation Council.\u00a0 He is now one of three Georgia Tech members on the Midtown Alliance\u2019s executive committee serving with Steve Swant, executive vice president for Georgia Tech administration and finance, and Catherine Ross, the Harry West Professor in the School of City and Regional Planning. The Midtown Alliance has been working with Georgia Tech on several innovation projects under contracts with Tech\u2019s Institute for People and Technology (IPAT) led by Beth Mynatt and Georgia Tech Chief Technology Officer, Ron Hutchins. \u201cGeorgia Tech is now a magnet attracting talent and both new and established technology firms to Midtown. Working with Georgia Tech and its planned new Georgia Tech High Performance Computing Center, we have the opportunity to make Midtown Atlanta a national tech innovation powerhouse.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nContact\nRebecca Keane Director of Communications rebecca.keane@iac.gatech.edu\nEmail\nrebecca.keane@iac.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
