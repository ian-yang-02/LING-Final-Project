The findings come amid frequent studies that have discovered gender differences in communication.\nA Georgia Institute of Technology study looked at nearly 200 legal memos written by first-year law students at two Midwestern law schools. All the students were tasked with writing memoranda of law in support of or opposition to a hypothetical motion seeking dismissal of a claim or summary judgment on a claim.\nPrevious studies on written communication found that women used more \u201cinvolved\u201d components than men. They tended to use more verbs to describe states of mind, such as \u201cfeel,\u201d \u201crealize,\u201d or \u201canticipate.\u201d Other involved language includes contractions, pronouns, and dropping the word \u201cthat\u201d from sentences. Men, on the other hand, were more likely to use \u201cinformational\u201d features to cram high amounts of information into text. They included more nouns, prepositions, and attributive adjectives (such as \u201cplain\u201d language and \u201clegislative\u201d intent).\n\u201cI wondered if men and women would abandon the habitual, gendered communication practices other studies have found and conform to a professional genre when they wrote for an audience with specific expectations,\u201d said Brian Larson, an assistant professor in Georgia Tech\u2019s\nSchool of Literature, Media and Communication .\u201c\nThey did \u00ad\u2014 the writings didn\u2019t vary significantly when analyzed by a computer. \u201cIt would have been impossible for a human reader to find any differences based on gender,\u201d Larson said.\nIn the study, both sexes conformed to societal norms when reaching out to the same audience, writing for the same purpose, and attempting to avoid the same negative consequence: a failing grade.\n\u201cMen and women may communicate differently in some scenarios, especially informal ones like social media,\u201d said Larson. \u201cBut this study suggests that if you put them in a professional situation with the same training and ask them to produce similar results, their work will be indistinguishable.\u201d\nWhy does it matter? Bias.\n\u201cPeople who talk about and assume gender differences will often discuss whether a certain task may be more suited to men than to women,\u201d said Larson. \u201cDestabilizing folk beliefs about gender differences serves an important purpose in the legal profession, because we don\u2019t want those beliefs to affect the confidence placed in female attorneys. In other words, we want to prevent gender discrimination in the legal workplace.\u201d\nThe study, \u201c Gender/Genre: The lack of gendered register in texts requiring genre knowledge ,\u201d is published in the October edition of the journal\nWritten Communication .\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nBlog Post About Study\nContact\nJason Maderer\nNational Media Relations\nmaderer@gatech.edu\n404.660.2926\nEmail\nmaderer@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
