( Register:\nhttp://tiny.cc/BEDC2023 )\nThe new realities of today\u2019s workforce in a post-pandemic economy means communities must reimagine themselves in ways that make them more attractive to people as places to live and for businesses to operate.\nPresented by Georgia Tech\u2019s\nEnterprise Innovation Institute\nin collaboration with the\nInternational Economic Development Council \u00a0 and the\u00a0 Georgia Economic Developers Association ,\nthis comprehensive course will explore the use of placemaking as an economic development tool to help professionals create quality places where people want to live and businesses believe they will thrive.\nThe 2023 theme is\nPlacemaking and Economic Recovery: Creating Communities Where People Want to Live and Businesses Want to Be.\nKeynote speakers include\nEric Kronberg , founder of\nKronberg Urbanists Architects , and\nElizabeth Ward Williams , that firm\u2019s director of urban design.\n\u201cWe know the pandemic has changed the way we operate in a lot of ways with telecommuting and remote working being a fixed reality for business and job seekers,\u201d\nsaid Alan Durham, BEDC course director. With work-from-home or hybrid commuting schedules the norm, communities need to rethink how they create strategies and make them more appealing to potential residents and business investments, he said.\n\u201cOur course is designed to teach attendees how to maximize opportunities in this new reality. People aren\u2019t moving to a given community simply to be closer to work if there\u2019s no central office or even a requirement to go into one,\u201d Durham said. \u201cSo, it\u2019s imperative that officials looking to boost their communities\u2019 economic development opportunities shift their thinking.\u201d\nPart of that shift means focusing on strategies that create an attractive quality of life both for residents and business, plan for economic recovery and resilience, smart incentive packages, and other tools. Communities must also find creative ways to address the shortage of workforce and entry-level housing options.\nBEDC course speakers will address several topics over the four days that will help attendees capitalize on their communities\u2019 unique assets and how they can effectively use and maximize placemaking as an economic development tool.\nAmong the course topics:\nWorkforce Housing Strategies\nBusiness Retention and Expansion\nReal Estate Development and Reuse\nBusiness Credit Analysis\nWorkforce Development\nStrategic Planning\nEconomic Impact and Incentives\nManaging Economic Development Organizations\nEthics in Economic Development\nSmall Business and Entrepreneur Development\nMarketing and Attraction\nDisaster Recovery and Resilience\nMedia Strategy\nThis four-day conference gives attendees opportunities to network with industry peers and experts, deeply explore the fundamentals and emerging concepts of comprehensive economic development and prepare them to immediately implement tools and skills gained during the course.\nSince its inception in 1967, the Georgia Tech BEDC has prepared more than 3,300 economic developers from all over the world for the\u00a0 IEDC\u00a0Certified Economic Developer\n(CEcD) Examination. The certification is considered an essential component of a career in economic development.\u00a0BEDC at Georgia Tech\u00a0is\naccredited by the IEDC and qualifies as a professional development training requirement needed to sit for the exam.\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nGeorgia Tech Basic Economic Development Course\nContact\nP\u00e9ralte C.
