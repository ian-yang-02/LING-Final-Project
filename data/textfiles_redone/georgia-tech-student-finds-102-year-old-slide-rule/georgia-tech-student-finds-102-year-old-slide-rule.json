Before Chase Harrington found this 100-year-old slide rule, he thought he was the only person in his family to attend Georgia Tech.\nOct 01, 2020\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nThey used to be a must-have for Yellow Jackets, but the current class of Tech students may not know much about slide rules. The analog tool is the predecessor to the electronic calculator and was used for decades to help engineers, scientists, and students compute math problems more quickly.\nIn simple terms, any number to be multiplied is represented by a specific length on a moveable ruler. Because these lengths are based on logarithms, the slide rule can be manipulated to express answers for multiplication and division. They can also be used for functions such as exponents, roots, and trigonometry \u2013 often useful for scientists and engineers.\nRecently, as Chase Harrington was set to start his sophomore year at Tech, he uncovered something very special: a slide rule in a leather case reading \u201cR.F. Bobbitt Jr. Georgia Tech 1918.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a discovery that uncovered something unknown about his family and their connections to the Institute.\nThe slide rule belonged to Harrington\u2019s great-great grandfather. R.F. Bobbitt Jr. studied industrial management at Georgia Tech through the early 1920s and played tennis for the Yellow Jackets as well. He is a member of the Georgia Tech Sports Hall of Fame and also played at Wimbledon.\nNow, 102 years after the date inscribed on the slide rule, Harrington is studying industrial engineering Georgia Tech, following in his great-grandfather\u2019s footsteps. He says he doesn\u2019t actually know much about how to use the slide rule, but it\u2019s easily one of the coolest discoveries for himself and his family.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know that this person existed, and I came to Tech unaware that anyone in my family ever went here. I thought that I was the very first,\u201d Harrington said.\nAs Harrington learned more about Russell Bobbitt, owner of that slide ruler, he also learned more about his family\u2019s connections to Tech. Harrington explains that after Bobbitt graduated, he bought a house on Techwood Drive where he\u2019d have lunch with legendary Georgia Tech football coach Bobby Dodd every Sunday after church.\n\u201cIt\u2019s also mind-boggling to me that, after watching games in Bobby Dodd Stadium for a year, I had a family member who was so close to Dodd himself,\u201d Harrington says.\nNow, history seems so much closer and Harrington and his family are looking for other\nkeepsakes. Harrington says his family may have a copy of the Technique from Georgia Tech\u2019s record-setting 222-0 victory over Cumberland College in 1918\nAdditional Images\nContact\nSteven Norris\nInstitute Communications\nEmail\nsnorris@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
