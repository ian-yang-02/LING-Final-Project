However, even today, cable management in data centers is a serious challenge and limitation of the number of pins on the processor is becoming a bottleneck in designing faster computers.\nTo alleviate these problems, Zajic is exploring ways to design wireless links at terahertz frequencies that can provide data rates of hundreds of gigabytes per second that would alleviate \u201ccable management\u201d and \u201cpin-count\u201d problems. Insights and results from this project will develop fundamental understanding of wireless propagation at terahertz frequencies and also stimulate further related research in wireless communications and computer engineering.\nA member of the ECE faculty since 2012, Zajic leads the Electromagnetic Measurements in Communications and Computing Laboratory, where she advises 11 Ph.D. students. Zajic has won several best paper awards and she is currently an editor for the\nIEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications .\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nAlenka Zajic\nElectromagnetic Measurements in Communications and Computing Laboratory\nSchool of Electrical and Computer Engineering\nGeorgia Tech\nNational Science Foundation\nContact\nJackie Nemeth\nSchool of Electrical and Computer Engineering\n404-894-2906\njackie.nemeth@ece.gatech.edu\nEmail\njackie.nemeth@ece.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
