The newly created Student Engagement and Well-being unit will include all Student Life and Campus Services departments and is designed to better support student success in line with the Institute\u2019s Strategic Plan.\nWith this restructuring, all non-academic student services will now be organized under a new vice president of Student Engagement and Well-being. The role will report directly to the president, with dotted lines to the provost and executive vice president for Academic Affairs (Steven W. McLaughlin) and the executive vice president for Administration and Finance (Kelly Fox).\n\u201cStudent engagement and well-being are central to student success at Georgia Tech and beyond and are core pillars of our new strategic plan,\u201d President \u00c1ngel Cabrera said. \u201cThis new organization builds on the breadth of services that are already offered between campus services and student life, will improve coordination, and will leverage synergies to better support our students.\u201d\nThe vice president of Student Engagement and Well-being will oversee all these services in one unit to allow for unified goals, strategies, and actions across all non-academic student service disciplines. Three associate vice presidents and their teams will report to the new vice president: associate vice president and dean of students; associate vice president of Campus Services; and associate vice president for Student Well-being, which will integrate all aspects of student physical and mental health and well-being. John Stein, current vice president of Student Life and Brandt-Fritz Dean of Students, will remain in the role of dean of students where his passion and interests have served students for the past 14 years. Kasey Helton will also remain in her role as associate vice president of Campus Services.\nFox will lead the search committee for the new vice president of Student Engagement and Well-being. The search will begin later this month and is expected to take four to five months. In the meantime, all units will continue to operate in their existing structure.\nAdditional Images\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
