Their work can help improve national security and also the functional safety and resiliency of automotive or industrial control systems, which are increasingly connected to the wider world through personal devices or other means. The first project, titled\n\u201cBFT++: Attack Tolerance in Hard Real-Time Systems,\u201d\nwill develop the foundations, principles and techniques for building attack-tolerant cyber physical systems. \u201cMany intrusion tolerance techniques slow down the control system, which is undesirable and may be life-threatening in a weapons system,\u201d said primary investigator Taesoo Kim, assistant professor in the School of Computer Science at Georgia Tech. \u201cWe will develop the techniques to detect failure due to an attack, replace the compromised node with a back-up, and reconstitute it \u2013 all within the hard, real-time requirement. In addition, we will develop software and system diversification techniques to ensure that an attack is detected early.\u201d More specifically, the techniques will eliminate common software vulnerabilities in different nodes of a networked group and distribute a security protection into multiple \u2013 but not all \u2013 nodes of the group, so that protection strength remains undiluted without reducing total performance overhead. The second project, titled\n\u201cEmbedasploit: a Pen-test in a Box for Industrial Control Systems,\u201d\nwill create a system to fingerprint an industrial control network, catalog its known flaws, emulate the whole system for simulation and outline a model that prevents hackers from listening to system activity, injecting malicious traffic or obtaining binary code. The research will be tested on engine control units in a modern car. \u201cAssessing the security of industrial control systems today often takes the form of a \u2018penetration test\u2019 that requires someone familiar with security practices, reverse engineering, real-world exploitation and the intricacies of a particular industrial domain,\u201d says primary investigator Wenke Lee, director of the Georgia Tech Information Security Center in the School of Computer Science. \u201cAll of that is rare in a single team or person, so we propose an end-to-end system that can automatically detect, and adapt inside new systems and networks.\u201d Each is a three-year project. Additional researchers include Tielei Wang at Georgia Tech, Salvatore Stolfo at Columbia University, and Brendan Dolan-Gavitt at New York University Polytechnic School of Engineering, along with graduate students at Georgia Tech, Columbia and NYU Poly. Results \u2013 including technical papers, teaching materials, software prototypes and experiment data (when appropriate) \u2013 will be made available via the\nproject\u2019s web page\nmaintained at the Georgia Institute of Technology [http://gtisc.gatech.edu].\nAdditional Images\nContact\nJason Maderer National Media Relations maderer@gatech.edu 404-660-2926\nEmail\nmaderer@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
