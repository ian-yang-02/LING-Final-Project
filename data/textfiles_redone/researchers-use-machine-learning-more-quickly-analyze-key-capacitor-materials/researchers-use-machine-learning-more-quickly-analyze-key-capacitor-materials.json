But if it has a defect, unwanted charge carriers are allowed into the band gap, reducing efficiency, he said.\n\u201cIn order to understand where the defects are and what role they play, we need to compute the entire atomic structure, something that so far has been extremely difficult,\u201d said Ramprasad, who holds the Michael E. Tennenbaum Family Chair and is the Georgia Research Alliance Eminent Scholar in Energy Sustainability. \u201cThe current method of analyzing those materials using quantum mechanics is so slow that it limits how much analysis can be performed at any given time.\u201d\nRamprasad and his colleagues, who specialize in using machine learning to help develop new materials, used a sample of data created from a quantum mechanics analysis of aluminum and polyethylene as an input to teach a powerful computer how to simulate that analysis.\nAnalyzing the electronic structure of a material with quantum mechanics involves solving the Kohn-Sham equation of density functional theory, which generates data on wave functions and energy levels. That data is then used to compute the total potential energy of the system and atomic forces.\nUsing the new machine learning method produces similar results eight orders of magnitude faster than using the conventional technique based on quantum mechanics.\n\u201cThis unprecedented speedup in computational capability will allow us to design electronic materials that are superior to what is currently out there,\u201d Ramprasad said. \u201cBasically we can say, \u2018Here are defects with this material that will really diminish the efficiency of its electronic structure.\u2019 And once we can address such aspects efficiently, we can better design electronic devices.\u201d\nWhile the study focused on aluminum and polyethylene, machine learning could be used to analyze the electronic structure of a wide range materials. Beyond analyzing electronic structure, other aspects of material structure now analyzed by quantum mechanics could also be hastened by the machine learning approach, Ramprasad said.\n\u201cIn part we selected aluminum and polyethylene because they are components of a capacitor, but it also allowed us to demonstrate that you can use this method for vastly different materials, such as metals that are conductors and polymers that are insulators,\u201d Ramprasad said.\nThe faster processing allowed by the machine learning method would also enable researchers to more quickly simulate how modifications to a material will impact its electronic structure, potentially revealing new ways to improve its efficiency.\nThis research was supported by the Office of Naval Research under grant No. N0014-17-1-2656.
