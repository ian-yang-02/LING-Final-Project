Her work was recently published in the open-access journal\nPLOS ONE . Dhongde found that significant proportions of U.S. respondents were experiencing economic hardships even early in the Covid-19 pandemic, with Hispanic citizens being particularly affected.\n\u201cThe paper highlights the plight of Americans during the early months of the economic crisis set in motion amid the coronavirus pandemic,\u201d Dhongde said. \u201cIt sheds light on how economic disparities deepened along racial and ethnic lines.\u201d\nThe pandemic triggered an unprecedented economic crisis in the U.S. Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows more than 374,000 confirmed U.S. Covid-19 cases between April 3 and April 6. The Federal Reserve Board surveyed 1,030 U.S. respondents about their households. The survey compiled data on four indicators of economic deprivation: overall financial condition, loss of employment, reduction in income, and inability to pay bills in full.\nDhongde found significant deprivation among respondents, with almost 25% reporting hardships in at least two of the four indicators. One quarter of respondents saw their incomes fall compared to the previous month, and 13% were unable to pay their monthly bills.\u00a0Young adults and those without a college education experienced a disproportionate loss of economic well-being.\nShe also found that Hispanic respondents were experiencing significantly higher deprivation: over 37% of these respondents faced hardships in at least two of the four indicators, and 8% reported hardships in all four areas.\n\u201cGoing forward, it is urgent that we prioritize economic aid to vulnerable populations,\u201d Dhongde added. \u201cThese individuals are experiencing multiple hardships, and, without immediate aid, they will not be able to sustain the economic shock of the pandemic.\u201d\n###\nAbout the Georgia Institute of Technology\nThe Georgia Institute of Technology is a top ten public research university with 40,000 students who study in person at the main campus in Atlanta, at Georgia Tech- Lorraine, at Georgia Tech\u2019s Shenzhen, China campus, as well as through distance and online learning.
