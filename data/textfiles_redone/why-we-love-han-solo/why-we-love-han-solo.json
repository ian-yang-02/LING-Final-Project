That includes his novelization of\nA New Hope , where we first met Han Solo in 1977. We talked to Yaszek about why the character is so beloved and the role women played in helping to create him.\nBy now, we\u2019ve all heard the stories. Han Solo was originally supposed to be a green alien. Or an alliance sympathizer since childhood. Or even a Jedi! But instead, we get the lovable space rogue. Where did that come from? According to legend, it was a bit happenstance. George Lucas decided he wanted the character to have the same swagger as his good friend Francis Ford Coppola. Later, he would explain it in terms of Hollywood myth, calling Solo a \u201cJames Dean-esque\u201d figure.\nThe rogue space jock is one of science fiction\u2019s oldest archetypes. And even though Harrison Ford made it famous on the big screen, the first ones were actually created by women, namely C.L. Moore and Leigh Brackett. In the 1930s, C.L. Moore put Northwest Smith in a series of stories about humanity colonizing the solar system. Like Solo, Smith was a pilot and smuggler. Then in the 1940s, Leigh Brackett introduced another space pirate: Eric John Stark. Brackett would later work with Lucas on the first draft of\nThe Empire Strikes Back .\nWe love Han Solo as a rogue space jock because he\u2019s larger than life in ways we all want to be \u2014 free to roam the universe with our best friends, free not to take sides in a fight, free to determine our own fate and have a ripping good time while we do it!\nBut he\u2019s also appealing because those larger-than-life aspects are balanced by his humanity. Solo is smart, funny and fast. But he\u2019s also vain, greedy, and makes dumb choices. He\u2019s also basically a good person trying to find his way in a really big and complicated universe. In the end, he always chooses good over evil. We certainly like to dream that, in such situations, we would do the same.\nEarly science fiction often revolved around future-changing battles between the forces of good and evil; mad and heroic scientists grappling with creations that demanded recognition and remade the world in their own image; and of course, brave humans fighting \u2014 and befriending (sometimes even loving) \u2014 their alien counterparts.\nStar Wars\nwas a love letter to the early days of science fiction. And nowhere was that more obvious than in the character of Han Solo.\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nWhy Lightspeed Isn\u2019t Fast Enough for Han Solo\nThe Secret Language of Science Fiction\nGeorgia Tech\u2019s Science of Star Wars\nContact\nJason Maderer\nNational Media Relations\nmaderer@gatech.edu\n404-660-2926\nEmail\nmaderer@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
