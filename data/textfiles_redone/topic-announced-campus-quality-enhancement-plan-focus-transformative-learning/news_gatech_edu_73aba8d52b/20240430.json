After consideration of potential topics, the QEP committee has selected \u201cLeadership in Progress and Service: Creating Intentional and Transformative Learning Experiences.\u201d Planning around the new topic will take place over the next year.\nReaffirmation \u00a0is the process by which Georgia Tech must prove to a review team from peer institutions that the Institute is qualified to continue to award academic credit. The QEP should address key issues identified in our ongoing assessment process and should also support student learning. The selection committee, co-chaired by\u00a0 Laurence Jacobs , senior vice provost for Education and Learning, and\u00a0 Steven Girardot , vice provost for Undergraduate Education, reviewed 47 possible topics and found the focus of the chosen topic to be best aligned with the Institute\u2019s current\u00a0 Strategic Plan \u00a0and the\u00a0 Transformative Teaching and Learning (TTL) Strategic Initiative .\nThe heart of the topic is the creation and implementation of transformative learning experiences that prepare Georgia Tech students for leadership roles. An important aspect will also be a focus on students who may be less likely to participate in existing high impact practices: under-resourced, income-limited, and first-generation students.\n\u201cGeorgia Tech is known for developing leaders,\u201d said\u00a0 Steve McLaughlin , provost and executive vice president for Academic Affairs. \u201cThe leaders of the future arrive on our campus with a wide range of academic and life circumstances, which means that a singular, one-size-fits-all college experience isn\u2019t best to ensure student success. We want all Georgia Tech students to have the resources they need to become the leaders we know they can be, and the topic selected for our next QEP is intended to do exactly that.\u201d\nThe next step of QEP development will involve outlining a course of action that includes the creation of a timeline and budget for implementation. This work will be operationally based within the\u00a0 Office of Undergraduate Education (OUE) \u00a0and will be executed in collaboration with the\u00a0 Office of Academic Effectiveness , as well as faculty, staff, and students from across campus.\nThe Institute\u2019s reaffirmation of SACSCOC accreditation will take place in 2025, so the QEP design process will occur throughout the next year and will include opportunities for campus engagement from faculty and staff; the establishment of a design and planning committee; and hiring of a QEP faculty director. Updates on the process and ways to become involved will be made available on the\u00a0 Provost\u2019s Quality Enhancement Plan webpage .\n\u201cAn incredible amount of work goes into the QEP topic selection, design, and implementation process,\u201d said\u00a0 McLaughlin . \u201cWe are deeply appreciative of the ideas shared by our campus topic contributors, as well as the thoughtful work of the co-chairs and selection committee. Reaccreditation is no small task, but support from Georgia Tech faculty, staff, and students will help us bring the QEP topic to life in a meaningful way.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nContact\nBrittany Aiello\nFaculty Communications Program Manager\nOrganizational, Academic, and Research Communications\nEmail\nbrittany.aiello@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
