It was cosponsored by Tech\u2019s chapter of the Society of Women Engineers.\nOutsiders and Oddities\nSince the late 1800s, Bix noted, a significant part of the way men defined their identity as engineering students was to \u201cridicule the whole idea of women engineers. So you get entire sets of technical traditions set in place over years that link engineering to masculinity.\u201d\nBix walked her audience through a brief chronology of the demarcation of professional engineering as a male sphere \u2014 from specialized education at universities that barred women; to exclusion from construction, railroad, and military jobs that provided engineering training; to advertisements for toys like Erector Sets and Lionel Trains aimed specifically at boys.\nBut, beginning in the early 20 th\ncentury, a small number of women pursued engineering degrees, notably at the University of Minnesota, Iowa State University, and Purdue \u2014 even though they were commonly viewed as outsiders and oddities.\nA Telling Turning Point\nThen, the manpower shortage caused\u00a0by U.S. participation in World War II created new opportunities for women in engineering, as it did in so many other sectors of the homefront economy. This historical juncture, Bix explained, represented a larger cultural reexamination of assumptions about gender and about women\u2019s capacity for understanding engineering, machines, and other \u201cmasculine\u201d realms.\nWithin this context, allowing women to train in engineering on college campuses was treated as a necessary part of the larger war effort. Some of them even wore pants! And hundreds of them earned engineering degrees. It was an unusual step, but both government and industry supported it as a patriotic plan.\nIt also proved short-lived.\nAfter the war, the GI Bill sent millions of returning (male) veterans flooding into American colleges and universities, while the number of enrolled women declined across the board. A backlash took shape in the form of a retrenchment of traditional values that emphasized women\u2019s inherent suitability for domestic \u2014 not professional, and certainly not technological or mechanical \u2014 pursuits.\n\u201cDebutantes Looking for Husbands\u201d\nIn the postwar period, Georgia Tech was part of what Bix called \u201ca culture of masculine engineering.\u201d\nIn 1948, Atlanta women\u2019s organizations were raising money to support a test case to compel the Board of Regents to admit women to Georgia Tech \u2014 though many feared that Tech\u2019s reputation and, indeed, its quality of instruction would become inferior if women were admitted. The year before, a poll of Tech students showed 64% opposed it. In addition, 54% said they would find women in class \u201cdistracting.\u201d Administrators claimed it would cost too much to renovate facilities to make room for women. Many Regents were \u201chostile,\u201d as Bix put it, chalking it up to \u201cdebutantes looking for husbands.\u201d\nBut by the early 1950s, Blake Van Leer, Georgia Tech\u2019s president, was sympathetic to the arugment for coeducation, noting that the legal trend was heading in that direction. According to Bix, he also reasoned that Tech could admit women without too much disruption because so few of them were interested or qualified.\nIn 1952, the Regents voted 7-5 in favor of coeducation. Four women applied, and two of them, Barbara Diane Michel and Elizabeth Herndon, began as full-time Georgia Tech students. While Herndon later left school to marry, Michel became the first woman to go through Tech from start to finish, earning a B.S. in industrial engineering in 1956. She was joined that year by a transfer student, Shirley Clements, who graduated with a degree in electrical engineering.\n\u201cIs everything perfect now?\u201d Bix asked. \u201cYou know it\u2019s not. Hostile workplaces, chilly climates, harassment, and discrimination. There is no magic solution to reverse the STEM gender imbalance. But we can\u2019t ignore the historical shift that has taken place.\u201d\nAbout Bix\nBix is a professor of history at Iowa State University whose research connects the history of technology, science, and medicine with studies of women and gender, the history of education, and 20 th -century social, cultural, and intellectual history. In 2013, she published\nGirls Coming to Tech! A History of American Engineering Education for Women\n(MIT Press). She is currently working on a book about the powerful cultural shift to diversifying STEM education and, in particular, improving girls\u2019 STEM education.\nSpring Speakers Series\nTopics in the series thus far have included healthcare, voter suppression, and stop and frisk, and were planned to coincide with Black History Month (February) and Women\u2019s History Month (March). The final two events this spring will address sex selection in a transnational context and debates over immigration.\n\u201cSince many of our faculty in the Ivan Allen College of Liberal Arts focus on research with important social justice implications, we wanted to make this our lens,\u201d said Jennifer Singh, associate professor in the School of History and Sociology, and one of the series\u2019 organizers.\n\u201cThese broader topics also allow us to reach students and faculty beyond the liberal arts.\u201d\nSingh sees the value of the interdisciplinary scope of the series for all Tech students. Even more important, she said, is \u201cthe opportunity to learn beyond the classroom. These layers of exposure are essential to learning.\u201d\nSee the\nschedule of events\nand learn more about the speakers by visiting the\nSchool of History and Sociology \u2019s webpage.
