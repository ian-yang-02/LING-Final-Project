She\u2019s dancing her thesis.\nIn the\nvideo submission , Kolluru performs an Indian classical dance to demonstrate her work to help create an\neffective, safe microneedle patch for polio vaccination .\nThe \u201cDance Your Ph.D.\u201d competition is hosted annually by Science and the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS).\n\u201cI have\u00a0always loved to dance,\u201d said Kolluru, who learned Kuchipudi dance as a child in southern India. \u201cNow I\u2019m learning it again with my daughter, who is also in the video. The competition is a perfect opportunity for me to combine two things that I am passionate about:\u00a0my research and dance.\u201d\nPolio is a highly contagious disease that can cause lifelong disability. It primarily affects children and is still endemic to three countries: Pakistan, Afghanistan and Nigeria.\n\u201cAs part of the polio elimination strategy, my Ph.D. thesis involves optimization of formulations to develop a polio vaccine microneedle patch that is\u00a0safe and\u00a0stable. We are creating something that doesn\u2019t need to be refrigerated, dissolves quickly upon administration and doesn\u2019t leave behind dangerous, sharp needles.\u201d\nThe six-and-a-half-minute dance is based on a simple concept: no children should be dancing only in their dreams. It begins with two kids happily playing and dancing, only to be later attacked and paralyzed by polio. The remainder of the performance explains the research and concludes with vaccinated children fighting off the disease.\n\u201cI dream of a polio-free world,\u201d Kolluru said.\nKolluru is in Mark Prausnitz\u2019s lab in the School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering. The group garnered headlines around the world earlier this year after a\nphase I clinical trial, conducted by Emory University and Georgia Tech , tested a flu vaccination using Band-Aid-like microneedle patches.\nThe public can vote until 11:59 p.m. on Monday, October 30 . A panel of scientists will judge the entries on their artistic and scientific merits. The overall winner will screen their dance at the annual AAAS meeting in Austin, Texas, in February 2018.\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nVote Here\nMicroneedle Patches for Flu Vaccination Successful in First Human Clinical Tria\u2026\nContact\nJason Maderer\nNational Media Relations\nmaderer@gatech.edu\n404-660-2926\nEmail\nmaderer@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
