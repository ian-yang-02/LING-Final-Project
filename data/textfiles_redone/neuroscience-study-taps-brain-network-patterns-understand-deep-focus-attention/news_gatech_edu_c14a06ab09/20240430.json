Now, a new study led by Seeburger, a graduate student in the\nSchool of Psychology , alongside her advisor,\nEric Schumacher , a professor in the\nSchool of Psychology\nis unearthing the mechanisms behind it.\u00a0 The interdisciplinary Georgia Tech team also includes\nNan Xu, Sam Larson\u00a0 and\nShella Keilholz\n( Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering ), alongside\nMarcus Ma\n( College of Computing ), and\nChristine Godwin\n( School of Psychology ). The researchers\u2019 study, \u201c Time-varying functional connectivity predicts fluctuations in sustained attention in a serial tapping task ,\u201d was published in\nCognitive, Affective, and Behavioral Neuroscience\nearlier this year, and it investigates brain activity via fMRI during periods of deep focus and less-focused work.\u00a0 The work is the first to investigate low-frequency fluctuations between different networks in the brain during focus, and could act as a springboard to study more complex behaviors and focus states. \u201cYour brain is dynamic! Nothing is just on or off,\u201d Seeburger explains. \u201cThis is the phenomenon we wanted to study. How does one get into the zone? Why is it that some people can sustain their attention better than others? Is this something that can be trained? If so, can we help people get better at it?\u201d The dynamic brain The team\u2019s work is also the first to study the relationship between fluctuations in attention and the brain network patterns within these low-frequency 20-second cycles. \u201cFor quite a while, the studies on neural oscillations focused on faster temporal frequencies, and the appreciation of these very low-frequency oscillations is relatively new,\u201d Seeburger says. \u201cBut, these low-frequency fluctuations may play a key role in regulating higher cognition such as sustained attention.\u201d \u201cOne of the things we've discovered in previous research is that there's a natural fluctuation in activity in certain brain networks. When a subject is not doing a specific task while in the MRI scanner, we see that fluctuation happen roughly every 20 seconds,\u201d adds co-author Schumacher, explaining that the team was interested in the pattern because it is quasi-periodic, meaning that it doesn\u2019t repeat exactly every 20 seconds, and it varies between different trials and subjects. By studying these quasi-periodic cycles, the team hoped to measure the relationship between the brain fluctuation in these networks and the behavioral fluctuation associated with changes in attention. Your attention needed To measure attention, participants tapped along to a metronome while in an fMRI scanner. The team could measure how \u201cin the zone\u201d participants were by measuring how much variability was in each participant\u2019s taps \u2014 more variability suggested the participant was less focused, while precise tapping suggested the participant was \u201cin the zone.\u201d The researchers found that when a subject\u2019s focus level changed, different regions of the brain synchronized and desychronized, in particular the fronto-parietal control network (FPCN) and default mode network (DMN), The FPCN is engaged when a person is trying to stay on task, whereas the DMN is correlated with internally-oriented thoughts (which a participant might be having when less focused). \u201cWhen one is out-of-the-zone, these two networks synchronize, and are in phase in the low frequency,\u201d Seeburger explains. \u201cWhen one is in the zone, these networks desynchronize.\u201d The results suggest that the 20-second patterns could help predict if a person is sustaining their attention or not, and could provide key insight for researchers developing tools and techniques that help us deeply focus. The big picture While the direct relationship between behavior and brain activity is still unknown, these 20-second patterns in brain fluctuation are seen universally, and across species. \u201cIf you put someone in a scanner and their mind is wandering, you find these fluctuations. You can find these quasi-period patterns in rodents. You can find it in primates,\u201d Schumacher says. \u201cThere's something fundamental about this brain network activity.\u201d \u201cI think it answers a really fundamental question about the relationship between behavior and brain activity,\u201d he adds. \u201cUnderstanding how these brain networks work together and impact behavior could lead to new therapies to help people organize their brain networks in the most efficient way.\u201d And while this simple task might not investigate complex behaviors, the study could act as a springboard to move into more complicated behaviors and focus states. \u201cNext, I would like to study sustained attention in a more naturalistic way,\u201d Seeburger says. \u201cI hope that we can further the understanding of attention and help people get a better handle on their ability to control, sustain, and increase it.\u201d \u00a0 DOI:\nhttps://doi.org/10.3758/s13415-024-01156-1\nAdditional Media\nContact\nWritten by Selena Langner Contact:\nJess Hunt-Ralston\nEmail\njess@cos.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
