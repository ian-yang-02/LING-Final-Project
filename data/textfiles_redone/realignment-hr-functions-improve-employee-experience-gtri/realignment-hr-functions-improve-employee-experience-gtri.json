This integration aligns with the strategic goal to achieve administrative excellence by rethinking and retooling how our administrative services are performed across centralized functions and campus units.\nEffective July 1, the following structural enhancements were implemented to help further this partnership and deliver on this goal:\nGTRI Organizational Development reports to GTHR\u2019s Employee Experience team.\nGTRI Research Faculty Recruiting and Student Recruiting & Programs report to the ASC Talent Services team.\nGTRI HR Consulting Services, including Temporary Employment Services, continues to report directly to GTRI with dual line reporting to GTHR\u2019s HR Business Partner team.\nEmployee Performance, Recognition, and Wellness remains reporting to GTRI and will be embedded in GTRI HR Services.\nWhile the Organizational Development and Recruiting teams began reporting to new units on July 1, they will continue to support and serve GTRI while working alongside their new teams to share best practices and thought leadership across the organization. Looking ahead, the teams will work with leadership in the ASC, GTHR, and GTRI, as well as clients, to identify and explore opportunities for continued process enhancements. Input and engagement from all stakeholders will be essential.\nWhat This Means for GTRI Employees\nThe new structure will enable both GTRI and the broader Institute to:\nEnable subject matter expertise oversight of candidate recruiting to ensure GTRI meets high-volume hiring targets needed to sustain growth.\nEnable alignment to Institute-wide employee learning, development, and experience initiatives while ensuring GTRI receives the level of support required for its business model.\nAlign skills, knowledge, and functions to drive best practices and capabilities to support learning, development, and recruiting across the enterprise.\nThroughout this integration, the top priority is to maintain business continuity and enable GTRI\u2019s research productivity. After July 1, the Organizational Development and Recruiting teams will continue to utilize their GTRI email and have access to GTRI technology systems and buildings so they can continue to support GTRI. Any updates to service delivery, the way labs request services, and other processes will be communicated to GTRI through Troy Littles, GTRI chief operating officer, and the executive leadership team.\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nAdministrative Services Center\nGeorgia Tech Human Resources\nGTRI Careers\nContact\nRachael Pocklington\nInstitute Communications\nEmail\nrpocklington@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
