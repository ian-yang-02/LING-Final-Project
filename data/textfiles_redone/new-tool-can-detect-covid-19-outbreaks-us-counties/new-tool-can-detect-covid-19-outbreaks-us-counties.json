The\u00a0 Covid-19 Outbreak Detection Tool \u00a0is updated two to three times per week, and it predicts how fast an outbreak is spreading within a given county by estimating the doubling time of Covid-19 cases.\nTo make these predictions, the tool accounts for reported Covid-19 cases and deaths, face mask mandates, social distancing policies, changes in tests performed, rates of positive tests, and the\nCenters for Disease Control\u2019s Social Vulnerability Index\n(which assesses the health-related resilience of individual communities when confronted with external stresses, such as natural or human-caused disasters or disease outbreaks).\nThe tool offers an interactive map and a \u201cdata explorer\u201d that allows users to select a specific county to see that county\u2019s population, total new cases of Covid-19 in the past week, average daily cases in the past week, and the Covid-19 doubling rate (i.e., how many days it takes for the number of cases to double in a given county).\n\u201cFor effectively controlling the pandemic, it is critical to detect an outbreak in a timely manner so that the affected area can be isolated and the spread of Covid-19 infections to neighboring areas can be minimized; however, due to several reasons, it may take days or even weeks for humans to manually detect an outbreak. Our data-driven machine learning\u2013based solution significantly speeds up and automates that process,\u201d said Turgay Ayer, Ph.D., the director of Business Intelligence and Healthcare Analytics at the\nCenter for Health and Humanitarian Systems\nand the\u00a0George Family Foundation Early Career Professor and associate professor in Georgia Tech's H. Milton Stewart School of Industrial and Systems Engineering.\n\u201cWhile earlier mitigation responses focused on state-level measures\u2014such as a lockdown of an entire state\u2014detecting local outbreaks will allow policy makers to implement measures at the county level\u2014such as closing restaurants in a single county\u2014to effectively contain the pandemic,\u201d\u00a0said Jagpreet Chhatwal, Ph.D., the associate director at the MGH Institute for Technology Assessment and an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School. \u201cThe model is able to detect many of the prior outbreaks within a matter of days.\u201d\nUsing the Covid-19 Outbreak Tool, the research team verified an outbreak in Johnson county in Iowa last week, which was linked to an outbreak at the University of Iowa. In addition, the tool identified several counties where outbreaks could be happening now. These include Harrisonburg County in Virginia, Wheeler County in Georgia, Monroe County in Indiana, and Whitman County in Washington, where infections are doubling in less than one week.\nAdditional Images\nEmail\nswundersmith3@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
