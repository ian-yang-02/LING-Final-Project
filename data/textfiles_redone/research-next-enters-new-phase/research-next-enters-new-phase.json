Like the Institute\u2019s strategic plan, this belongs to all of us, and it will be up to us to make it a reality.\u201d\nTo create the research strategy, Georgia Tech faculty, staff, and students assessed the current landscape for research-intensive universities. They identified the internal and external forces and factors that shape the research ecosystem.\u00a0Out of this came a\nresearch landscape analysis . The Phase II work capitalized on the rich insights from the Phase I to identify 16 goals and 50 objectives for Georgia Tech to work toward over the next decade.\nNow, seven initial projects have been identified to support the vision of the Research Next.\u00a0 They are large-scale, campus-wide projects. Four of the teams have assembled, and efforts are underway, including:\nProject management support: large-scale projects and scaling PI operations\nThis group develops project management recommendations that are proactively supporting\u00a0researchers and\u00a0thinking\u00a0through the needs of both singular, large activities, as well as the demands for larger efforts\u00a0distributed\u00a0over a\u00a0range of projects.\nResearch faculty engagement & career development\nThis group takes a deeper look at Georgia Tech\u202fresearch faculty environment, including\u202fhiring, mentoring, career development, community and work environment, promotion,\u202fand compensation approaches.\nAll members of the research enterprise feel connected to and included in and able to contribute to the mission, conduct, and products of research\nThis group makes our community feel appreciated and empowered by creating an environment\u00a0and culture in which all can grow, thrive, and add value.\nStrategic & operational expansion of historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) & minority serving institutions (MSIs) research partnerships\nThis group identifies and streamlines processes that enable collaborative research with MSIs;\u00a0develops an ongoing process for identifying, networking, and finalizing potential research collaborations across Georgia Tech\u00a0and MSIs; and establish/maintain a network of sources, sponsors, and new paradigms for funding long-term research\u00a0partnerships.\nThree additional teams will be launched in FY23, including:\nResearch prioritization & annual strategic analysis\nThis team will monitor progress and metrics across all Research Next initiatives, as well advise the research enterprise on large research initiatives and directions.\nOrganizational structures & pathways of interdisciplinary research\nThis team will address crosscutting educational offering, coordinating faculty hiring with research prioritization, and integrating campus operations with research. It will also create structures for supporting and incubating new ideas; funding models (fundraising); alignment and assessment of existing structures\u202f(startup/ sunset); and integration of social sciences, diversity efforts, and the arts.\nResearch leader & mentor development\nThis team will create a comprehensive research leadership development program for\u202fGeorgia Tech. It will leverage and build off of other GTRI and Provost office leadership initiatives, but also develop the unique\u202fmaterials associated with research leadership.\nThe Research Next plan will\u00a0leverage trends and thought leadership to\u00a0prepare for changes in the research landscape, focus Georgia Tech\u2019s efforts, and resolve grand challenges.\u00a0Stay tuned for regular updates on how the project teams are evolving to meet the needs of the Institute and world.\nCheck out the\nfull Research Next website .\nContact\nGeorgia Parmelee\nEmail\ngeorgia.parmelee@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
