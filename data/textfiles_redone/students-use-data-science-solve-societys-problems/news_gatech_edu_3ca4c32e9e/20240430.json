The program is sponsored by Georgia Tech and Oracle.\nJul 07, 2015\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nFires will happen. But what if the Atlanta Fire Rescue Department could determine which buildings are at greatest risk of fire and prioritize inspections to focus on those sites? The fire department is working to do just that thanks to a summer internship program sponsored by Georgia Tech and Oracle. The city agency is one of four groups participating in this year\u2019s\nData Science for Social Good\n(DSSG), where 14 undergraduate and graduate students show non-profits and government agencies how data can tackle social and societal problems. Other projects include maintaining and improving Atlanta\u2019s urban forest, increasing efficiency for a popular hotline system, and working with Georgia Tech\u2019s WiFi data to understand mobility patterns. \u201cIt\u2019s important to get students involved in real-world projects,\u201d said Christopher LeDantec, co-director of the program and an assistant professor of digital media in the School of Literature, Media and Communication in the Ivan Allen College of Liberal Arts. \u201cWe are building out sustainable learning opportunities that allow students and Georgia Tech to have a wider impact in the community. \u201c The four students working with Atlanta Fire Rescue shadowed inspectors to learn not only how they work, but also how they create and use data. The students identified hundreds of additional commercial properties at high risk for a fire that should be inspected with greater frequency, said Matt Hinds-Aldrich, a management analyst with Atlanta Fire Rescue working with the student team. The program is \u201chelping us make more informed and data-driven decisions on how best to allocate our limited resources as we balance protecting residents, visitors and commerce in our community all while remaining fiscally responsible,\u201d Hinds-Aldrich said. While many public agencies and non-profits collect data, staff may be overwhelmed by the volume or may lack the time and capabilities to interpret the information, said Bistra Dilkina, co-director of the DSSG program and an assistant professor in the School of Computational Science and Engineering in the College of Computing. The program shows groups how data can work to their advantage, while exposing students to different career paths, Dilkina said. \u201cNonprofits and conservationists need data scientists, too,\u201d she said. Georgia Tech received more than a dozen project proposals, but could only staff four. More than 100 students applied for the 10-week paid internship and 14 were selected. Richard Huckaby, a rising third-year student in computer engineering, joined because he wanted to learn new skills and help people. He\u2019s part of the team working with the United Way of Greater Atlanta on their 211-hotline system, which is a searchable database of city services. Students will suggest ways to improve and reconstruct the existing call menu to better organize incoming calls and reduce average wait time. \u201cThere\u2019s more to data science than commercialization or helping large companies,\u201d he said. To conduct their work, students pulled data from multiple sources and had to go through several steps before it was ready for analysis. The urban forest team working with the City of Atlanta and Trees Atlanta relied on tax parcels, thermal maps, city inventories, floodplain data and other sources. \u201cGames and apps are fun, but we\u2019re setting up a system the city and Trees Atlanta can build on in the future,\u201d said Caroline Foster, who will start Georgia Tech\u2019s masters program in Human-Computer Interaction next month. Students from all four teams will present their findings and recommendations during a\npublic demonstration\nscheduled to begin at 6:30 p.m. Thursday at Ponce City Market.\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nData Science for Social Good\nContact\nLaura Diamond\u00a0 Georgia Tech Media Relations 404-894-6016\nEmail\nlaura.diamond@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
