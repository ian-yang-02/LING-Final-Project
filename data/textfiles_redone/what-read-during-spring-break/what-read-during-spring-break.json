We asked members of Book Jackets, a student club that encourages students to find joy in reading for fun and to connect with other readers, for recommendations. The books range from a thriller about a therapist uncovering the truth about a patient who will not speak, to the story of a captured con artist given a chance to redeem himself by working at the post office.\nA Visit From the Goon Squad\nBy Jennifer Egan, Knopf (2010)\n\u201c A Visit From the Goon Squad\nis an expansive and enthralling novel about relationships, time, and change. The two central characters are the president of a record company, Bennie Salazar, and his assistant, Sasha. However, the book is mainly told from the perspective of other characters whose lives are connected to theirs. Don\u2019t be discouraged if the jumps in time and point of view confuse you in the beginning. I ended up loving the unique format of this book, like the chapter in which a young girl uses a slideshow journal to confront her thoughts. This book may inspire the feeling of\nsonder !\u201d\n\u2014 Beau Martin, second-year history, technology, and society student\nCloud Cuckoo Land\nBy Anthony Doerr, Scribner\u2019s (2021)\n\u201c Cloud Cuckoo Land\nfollows the preservation and translation of a lost, ancient epic through the points of view of three different characters across time. One is a young orphan growing up in Constantinople in the early 1400s, another a librarian in the modern-day United States, and the third a young girl on a ship flying through outer space. While taking place centuries apart, each story is intricately connected to weave a beautiful tale of love, loss, and perseverance as the story of\nCloud Cuckoo Land\nis passed down generation after generation.\u201d\n\u2014 Brock Spence, third-year industrial engineering student\nThe Namesake\nBy Jhumpa Lahiri, Mariner Books (2003)\n\u201c The Namesake\nis a novel about learning to accept yourself and your identity. It follows a first-generation Bengali man named Gogol throughout his life as he struggles to accept his name and, with it, his culture. Named after the Russian author Nikolai Gogol, he feels disconnected from his namesake; similarly, he also encounters difficulty with balancing growing up in America and experiencing Bengali culture through his family. The writing of is incredible and keeps you connected to the story throughout, and Gogol\u2019s journey imparts an important message about the value of identity and self-acceptance.\u201d\n\u2014 Jordan Kopcha, second-year double major in literature, media, and communications, and psychology\nThe Blind Assassin\nBy Margaret Atwood, Anchor (2000)\n\u201c The Blind Assassin\nis a beautiful piece of historical fiction that takes place in a fictional town in Canada during the 1900s. It follows three storylines. The first is about a woman named Iris and her deceased sister, Laura, who published a book called\nThe Blind Assassin\nposthumously. Iris details their lives during the Great Depression. The second story is that of Laura\u2019s book, which describes meetings between an unnamed man and woman. In these meetings, the man spins the woman a tale about a blind assassin from another planet. This is the third story, which is a science fiction tale that reflects the life of its teller. The novel is intriguing from start to finish, and the switch between stories makes every new piece of information feel fresh as you put together the pieces of Laura\u2019s story.\u201d\n\u2014 Jordan Kopcha, second-year double major in literature, media, and communications and psychology\nGoing Postal\nBy Terry Pratchett, Doubleday (2004)\n\u201cThe story is about a con artist and professional scammer named Moist von Lipwig. Just as he\u2019s about to be hanged for his numerous crimes, the ruler of the city decides to offer him a chance to run the local post office, which has been declining for decades, to redeem himself. He is accompanied by his parole officer, a golem named Mr. Pump, and the two remaining post office employees: the elderly Junior Postman Tolliver Groat and his assistant Stanley Howler. The post office is physically wretched, covered in pigeon dung, with mail dating back years, piled and literally flooding rooms. Lipwig must make the office run smoothly while growing beyond the selfish and unscrupulous person he once was and avoiding the many perilous fates that may befall anyone trying to bring about positive change.\u201d\n\u2014 Daniel Lin, third-year civil engineering student\nThe Silent Patient\nBy Alex Michaelides, Celadon Books (2019)\n\u201cThis book is a psychological thriller about a therapist who wants to uncover the truth about a patient who will not speak. It follows him uncovering the truth about what happened between her and her deceased husband and her motive for killing him. The mystery-thriller aspect of this book was great! I literally couldn\u2019t put it down and read the entire thing in one night. I definitely recommend it for anyone who likes a good murder mystery to solve.\u201d\n\u2014 Madhu Mocharla, second-year computer science student\nWhat Is to Be Done?\nBy Nikolai Chernyshevsky, translation by Michael Katz, Cornell University Press (1989)\n\u201cForget the\nCommunist Manifesto\n\u2014 this was the book at the heart of the Russian Revolution, and other revolutions of the time. Lenin named a pamphlet for it. Nabokov and Dostoevsky savaged it. Yet it holds up marvelously, 150 years later: the narrative of Vera Pavlovna\u2019s rise to class consciousness and the founding of a successful sewing cooperative; the interwoven essayistic passages of materialist philosophy and utopian socialist theory; and the many, many divagations. Keep an eye out for Rakhmetov, especially. It\u2019s even written in that affected, impossible-to-explain, quintessentially Russian style that some find quite difficult not to love. Among the most influential novels, and loads of fun, too.\u201d\n\u2014Arya Kathik, first-year mathematics student\nMalina\nBy Ingeborg Bachmann, translation by Philip Boehm, New Directions (2019)\n\u201cI have a soft spot for prose by poets. Barnes\u2019\nNightwood,\nthe prose-poetry of Jacob, Mallarme, and Baudelaire \u2014 this is the best of those. Like every postwar Austrian novel, it\u2019s about fascism \u2014 its direct effects on body and psyche; its infiltration into even innocent social relations; the collective guilt those from collaborating countries assumed \u2014 but in a hitherto-unexplored, all-encompassing sense. This is an uncomfortably intimate portrait of a woman trapped in an aestheticized, insincere,\nviolent\nworld; her foundering, her mental-physical-intellectual collapse, her, well, erasure. Be warned: It's incredibly dark. And while no actual sexual assault occurs (probably), its narrator does relive past trauma in that realm.\u201d\n\u2014Arya Kathik, first-year mathematics student\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nBlack History Month Reading and Viewing Recommendations\nContact\nVictor Rogers\nInstitute Communications\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
