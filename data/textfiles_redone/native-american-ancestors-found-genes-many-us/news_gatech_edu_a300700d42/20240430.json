A new population genetics study shows that Americans with early European or early African ancestry can also have Native American gene groups.\nThose Americans usually have family roots near the traditional homes of the respective tribes found in their genes, according to research led by the Georgia Institute of Technology. But where the descendants are today differs between these groups.\n\u201cPeople of Western European heritage have Native gene sequences from tribes that were located near where they now live,\u201d said Andrew Conley, who led the study and is a\nresearch scientist in Georgia Tech\u2019s School of Biological Sciences . \u201cFor African descendants, Native American ancestry looks like it came from regional groups of Native Americans in the southeastern United States.\u201d\nMany Americans descending from enslaved Africans later left the South in the Great Northward Migration, took those Native American sequences with them, and apparently no longer significantly reproduced with indigenous populations.\nAmericans with European heritage going back to Spain, mostly people who immigrated to the U.S. from Mexico, carry sequences from Native American ancestors who were traditionally located in what is Mexico today. This group also carries the most Native American genetic sequences by far, roughly 40% of their total genome, according to the study.\nThe researchers came to their conclusions by tracking haplotypes, patterns of genetic variants that are passed on by one parent, and that are typical for certain regions and peoples. They published their results\nin the journal\nPLoS Genetics\non September 23, 2019.\n\u201cHaplotype combinations are very different between European, African and Native American ancestries and specific to locations,\u201d Conley said.\nThe data was extracted from a much larger study, The Health and Retirement Study, sponsored by the National Institute on Aging (NIA) and conducted by the University of Michigan. That study also followed health and finance over time but included genomes and geography. Neither the NIA nor Michigan was part of the Georgia Tech study.\nAmericans of early African heritage have about 1.0% and of Western European heritage about 0.1% Native American haplotypes, though the difference in those numbers can be deceiving. The native ancestry probably lies a similar number of generations back for both groups.\n\u201cWith African Americans, it correlates to about eight to nine generations back and probably ends there,\u201d Conley said. \u201cWith Western European ancestors, we think about eight to 10 generations ago, and the contact with Native Americans could have also been more continuous.\u201d\nFurther immigration from Europe likely dropped the percentage of Native American ancestry for the overall sample of Americans with Western European heritage.\n\u201cParticularly in the Mid-Atlantic and the Northeast there is almost no Native American ancestry among European descendants,\u201d Conley said. \u201cWhen you go out West, that\u2019s where you have the most Native American ancestry in European populations.\u201d\nThere was also an outlier group with European heritage from Spain.\n\u201cIn parts of the Southwest, there are people of Spanish descent with also distinctive Native American ancestry. These groups call themselves\nHispanos\nor\nNuevomexicanos ,\u201d Conley said. \u201cTheir native American ancestry does not come from present-day Mexico. There were Spanish settlers in the region 400 years ago, and they could be the European ancestors of the\nNuevomexicanos .\u201d\nThe following coauthors from Georgia Tech collaborated on the study: King Jordan and Lavanya Rishishwar.
