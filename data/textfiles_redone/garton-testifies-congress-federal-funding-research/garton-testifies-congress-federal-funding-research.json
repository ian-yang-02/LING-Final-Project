She recently testified before\u00a0the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Science, Space, and Technology Subcommittee on Research and Technology.\nJun 22, 2016\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nMembers of the U.S. House of Representatives convened a hearing June 16 on taxpayer-supported research leading to commercial technological innovation. Jilda Garton, vice president for research and general manager of the Georgia Tech Research Corporation, discussed how two federal programs, Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and the Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR), support start-up companies seeking to commercialize intellectual property that results from university research. Garton explained how the SBIR program helped three Atlanta startups \u2013 Pindrop, StarMobile and Zyrobotics \u2013 turn Georgia Tech research into successful companies. The U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Science, Space, and Technology Subcommittee on Research and Technology is considering reauthorization of two programs. A provision was introduced to increase the set-aside percentage from federally-funded research organizations for these programs, and Garton was called to testify to shed light on the key issues. Garton was the only witness invited from an institution of higher education. The other witnesses included Pramod Khargonekar, assistant director of the National Science Foundation; Michael Lauer, deputy director of the National Institutes of Health; and Patricia Dehmer, deputy director for Science Programs of the Department of Energy\u2019s Office of Science. The testimony comes a month after more than 70 scientific and professional societies, higher education associations, universities and research institutions undersigned a letter to the Committee\u2019s chair and ranking member noting that universities support SBIR and STTR programs. However, the institutions are concerned that there is no evidence or proof-of-necessity for increasing the set-aside for these programs. Doing so would reduce crucial research progress and disrupt the universities\u2019 discovery to commercialization ecosystem. With federal research funding on the decline, an increase in a directed percentage to SBIR and STTR programs would yield additional cuts to the research and discovery base which supports innovation at the fundamental level.\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nResearch and Technology Subcommittee Hearing\nContact\nLance Wallace lance.wallace@comm.gatech.edu\nEmail\nlance.wallace@comm.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
