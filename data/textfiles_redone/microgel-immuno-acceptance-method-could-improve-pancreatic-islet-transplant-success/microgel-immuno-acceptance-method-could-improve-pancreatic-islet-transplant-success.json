The research was led by Maria Coronel, a postdoctoral fellow in the lab of Garc\u00eda, the Parker H. Petit Chair and executive director of the\nPetit Institute for Bioengineering and Bioscience . Garc\u00eda is also a Regents Professor in the\nGeorge W. Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering .\nIn 2018, the Nobel Prize for medicine was awarded for discovering how cancer cells send molecular signals to suppress immune response, thus hiding and protecting those cancer cells from the body\u2019s immune system. Researchers soon developed pioneering treatment methods to signal and \u201cturn on\u201d the immune system (such as T cells) so the invading cancer would once again be recognized, allowing a patient\u2019s own immune system to more effectively eliminate their cancer cells.\n\u201cThe work we are doing is taking a page from that discovery and using immunotherapy in the opposite sense used by cancer treatments to control and \u2018turn off\u2019 an immune response to transplant a graft,\u201d Coronel said. \u201cWhen you get a transplant, like an islet transplant or organ transplant, even if it\u2019s matched, you will have an immune response to that graft, and your immune system will recognize it as non-self and will try to reject and attack the site of the graft.\u201d\nAfter islet transplant surgery, traditional postoperative treatments use immune-suppressing systemic drugs that affect the entire body, and can be toxic \u2014 creating numerous, unwelcome side effects, whose severity often limits the number of candidates for islet and other organ transplants.\n\u201cA unique aspect of our method is that we have greatly reduced the dosage needed, which will significantly reduce or eliminate side effects currently caused by today\u2019s systemic drug treatments,\u201d said Coronel.\nThe research team developed a new \u201cimmune-acceptance\u201d method, which inserts an engineered biomaterial \u2014 in this case a microgel \u2014 with the islets at the time of the transplantation. The microgels, which resemble clusters of micro-sized fish eggs, held and delivered a protein (SA-PD-L1) to a specific transplant area that successfully signaled the immune system to hold back an immune response, protecting a transplanted islet graft from being rejected. This locally delivered molecular signal, using SA-PD-L1, was designed to quietly suppress any immune response and was effective for up to 100 days with no additional systemic immune-suppressing drug intervention.\n\u201cWe wanted to use PD-L1 for the prevention of allogeneic islet graft rejection by simulating the way tumor cells use this molecule to evade the immune system, but without resorting to gene therapy,\u201d said Shirwan, professor of child health and molecular microbiology and immunology at the University of Missouri School of Medicine.\nTo achieve this goal, Shirwan worked with Esma Yolcu, professor of child health, also at the University of Missouri School of Medicine. Both were previously at the University of Louisville, where they generated the SA-PD-L1, a novel form of the molecule that can be positionally displayed on the surface of islet grafts or microgels for delivery to the graft site.\n\u201cMicrogels presenting SA-PD-L1 represent an important technological development that has potential not only for the treatment of type 1 diabetes, but also other autoimmune diseases and various transplant types,\u201d Shirwan said.\nIn addition to engineering this specific biomaterial microgel, the team tested its lifespan durability and dosage release possibilities. They also looked at its longer-term effects on both the graft and the immune response and function of the recipient \u2014 evaluating its long-term biocompatibility potential.\n\u201cOne of the major goals in the diabetes field over the past two decades has been to allow the immune-acceptance of grafts and avoid the toxic drugs used to induce immune suppression, which affect the entire body,\u201d Garc\u00eda said.\n\u201cGenerally speaking, organ transplantation is very successful at dealing with a variety of chronic conditions. These are very exciting results as proof of principle that demonstrate this engineered biomaterial and procedure may provide a platform technology that is applicable to other transplantation settings and may enlarge the pool of candidates who can safely receive transplants.\u201d\nThese researchers also coauthored the study: Karen E.
