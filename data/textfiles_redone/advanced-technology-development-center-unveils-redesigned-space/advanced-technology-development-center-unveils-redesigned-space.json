ATDC is Georgia Tech\u2019s statewide incubator and works with entrepreneurs in the technology space who want to build successful startups in the Peach State. It is one of the longest-running and largest university-based startup incubators in the country. \u201cWe had a lot of discussions at ATDC about how best to meet our startups\u2019 needs and make this floor more conducive to the innovation and collaboration atmosphere we have here in the Tech Square community,\u201d said Christopher Downing, interim vice president of Tech\u2019s Enterprise Innovation Institute (EI 2 ), the Georgia Tech\u2019s unit that includes its core economic development initiatives, including ATDC. \u201cThe changes you see around you are a result of those discussions and are designed not only to enhance what we do every day, but also to keep to our mission of working with entrepreneurs to help them build and launch successful technology companies right here in Georgia.\u201d Several members of the Georgia House of Representatives\u2019 Small Business Development Committee, including Reps. Dar\u2019shun Kendrick and Doreen Carter, attended the ceremony, as well as Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed, who said ATDC is a key part of the city\u2019s efforts to let those in the technology space know that Atlanta is a city of innovation and the place to launch transformative companies. \u201cI\u2019m here to congratulate you and let you know that you have a partner in the city,\u201d Reed said. The renovations \u2014 which were done through a refinancing of bonds and at no cost to taxpayers \u2014 address growing demands for ATDC\u2019S services from its companies and the greater entrepreneurial community. Key highlights include a new lobby, additional seed space and meeting offices, and a new classroom for ATDC classes that also is open and available for free in the evenings to technology entrepreneurs and organizations related to tech startups. Additional changes include a reconfigured library for entrepreneurs\u2019 use as a communal space in which to collaborate and brainstorm. \u201cSince its opening in 2003, Tech Square has become the hub of innovation and new ideas in metro Atlanta and in the greater Southeast. With that being the case, there is no more fitting home for ATDC\u2019s home base than right here in Tech Square,\u201d said Stephen E. Cross, executive vice president for research. \u201cATDC\u2019s presence here and its ongoing impact for entrepreneurs across the state are critical success factors for the innovation ecosystem as a whole and to Georgia Tech as an institution.\u201d \u2014 Peralte C.
