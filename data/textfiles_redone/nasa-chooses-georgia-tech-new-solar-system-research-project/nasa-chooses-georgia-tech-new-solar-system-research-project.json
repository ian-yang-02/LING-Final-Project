Their underground habitats, equipment, and spacesuits are protected from radiation and micrometeorites, thanks to an innovative mix of sturdy polymers and nanomaterials. In fact, a special coating allows portions of the suits to double as real-time radiation detectors.\nMeanwhile, the solar wind streaming onto Phobos\u2019 surface holds the promise of life for those astronauts.\n\u201c Does the solar wind, which is mostly protons and electrons, produce water when it interacts with the regolith?\u201d\nasks\nThomas Orlando , professor in the School of Chemistry and Biochemistry. \u201cAstronauts want water. They\nneed\nwater. They\u2019re not going to carry jugs of distilled water. Is there enough water there for on-site use or, to go even further, to transform into fuel?\u201d\nThose are questions that Orlando and a large multidisciplinary research team, with specialists from across the U.S., Germany, and Italy, will soon try to answer, thanks to\nNASA\nfunding.\nNASA announced on March 17\nthat Orlando\u2019s team\u2013 Radiation Effect on Volatiles and Exploration of Asteroids and Lunar Surfaces (REVEALS) \u2013 is one of four chosen by the space agency for inclusion in\nSSERVI\n\u2013 the Solar System Exploration Research Virtual Institute. NASA created SSERVI to work with scientific institutions around the world to learn more about the lunar surface, near-Earth asteroids, and the Martian moons Phobos and Deimos. REVEALS has requested a $5.5 million budget over five years.\nA Global Team\nWithin Georgia Tech, Orlando\u2019s team include\nPhillip First\nand \u00a0 Zhigang Jiang\nin the School of Physics,\nPeter Loutzenhiser\nin the George W. Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering,\nCarol Paty\nand\nJames Wray\nin the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences,\nJohn Reynolds\nand\nJoseph Perry\nin the School of Chemistry and Biochemistry, and\nJud Ready\nin the Georgia Tech Research Institute.\nOther institutions working with Georgia Tech on REVEALS are the University of California, Davis; Jackson State University;\nJohns Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab ; University of Notre Dame;\nFlorida Space Institute ; and the University of Central Florida (UCF).\nInternational collaborators include the\nUniversity of Stuttgart Institute of Space Systems , the\nIstituto Nazionale di Astrofisica Catania Astrophysical Observatory\nin Italy, and the\nSapienza University of Rome .\nAll the collaborations are important because they provide the\u00a0correct mix of expertise, Orlando says.\u00a0 As an example, the leadership team involves a former astronaut, Stephen Robinson (UC-Davis), and a flight physician, Esther Beltran (UCF).\nA Giant Leap for Georgia Tech Space Research\nREVEALS is an important step in the well-established relationship between Georgia Tech and NASA. It also validates Tech\u2019s interdisciplinary approach in solving big-science problems, Orlando says.\nA veteran of applying for NASA requests for proposals, Orlando says the REVEALS win is his biggest yet, because of its interdisciplinary approach. \u201cIt\u2019s probably the most important because it links many entities on campus that haven\u2019t been linked before,\u201d he says. For example, Orlando will be working with the Georgia Tech\u2019s aerospace engineers some who have launched experiments in shoebox-sized satellites, called\nCubeSats .\n\u201cThen it links us across the country, and it links us to groups in Germany and Italy, so we have this pretty strong team that\u2019s global.\u201d REVEALS is a worldwide project, Orlando says, \u201cbut it\u2019s based at Georgia Tech, and we\u2019ll manage the budget and science directions.\u201d\nREVEALS also spotlights the role of the Institute\u2019s\nCenter for Space Technology and Research\n(C-STAR). Its goal is to bring more space science enterprise projects to Georgia and the Southeast. \u201cC-STAR is a very strong entity on campus,\u201d Orlando says. \u201cREVEALS now gives some immediate higher visibility to CSTAR nationally and internationally.\u201d\u00a0 Currently, Orlando also serves as the Director of CSTAR.\nWhat REVEALS Hopes to Reveal\n\u201cIf you want to go into space and understand what you find there,\u201d says School of Chemistry and Biochemistry Chair\nM.G. Finn , \u201cyou have to understand the chemistry under your feet, no matter what world you are standing on!\u201d\nREVEALS has two research themes: understanding the interaction of radiation and micrometeorites with the surfaces of airless bodies like Earth\u2019s moon and Mars\u2019 moons and developing and testing new materials for improved safety and health during human exploration.\nFrom those starting points, the REVEALS team hopes to answer these questions:\nWhat are the primary mechanisms, such as solar wind, that produce, transport, or destroy volatiles \u2013 substances that readily vaporize, like water and hydrogen \u2013 on airless celestial bodies?\nDoes micrometeorite bombardment contribute to the evolution of volatiles?\nIs there an operationally useful inventory of resources on these airless bodies that can support human exploration? Could water and other elements be mined somehow on site?\nCan nanocomposite materials reduce the risks associated with radiation on the lunar surface or on Mars\u2019 moons so that astronauts can spend more time exploring?\nCan the novel properties of new materials be exploited to develop real-time radiation monitors?\nCan new polymer-based flexible materials be incorporated into spacesuits and/or vehicles to enhance human safety during surface operations?\nRadiation Assault and Better Spacesuits Through Chemistry\nTo help answer those questions, the REVEALS team will conduct experiments that simulate what happens when small dust grains and micrometeorites smash into regolith, the top layer of soil and broken rocks found on Earth\u2019s moon and near-Earth asteroids.\nPrevious experiments at other institutions have correctly simulated momentum and impact, but not the chemistry, Orlando says. \u201cWe are setting up a laser to accelerate actual dust grains to the right velocities before shooting them into regolith-like materials,\u201d Orlando explains. \u201cThere is nobody in the world doing this. Even NASA says that this experiment could change the landscape.\u201d\nAnother point NASA liked about the REVEALS project, Orlando says, is the goal of providing astronauts with radiation detectors. Astronauts currently have no way to find out in real-time how much radiation they\u2019re receiving in airless environments. REVEALS wants to develop a passive device or a way to coat future spacesuits with materials that can also read radiation charge. \u201cSo the material or suit itself is not only hardened against radiation, but it\u2019s also a real-time monitor of the charges produced by the impacting radiation,\u201d Orlando says. \u201cWe want to try to spin this capability into a protective coating, not just for a space suit, but also a habitat.\u201d\u00a0 Some of the work toward\u00a0radiation detectors has evolved from projects that Orlando and First have been involved in for more than a decade dealing with graphene.\n\u201cREVEALS will further establish Georgia Tech, the College of Sciences, and the Southeast region of the U.S. as leaders in this most human of scientific endeavors,\u201d Finn says.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nRenay San Miguel\nCommunications Officer/Science Writer\nCollege of Sciences\n404-894-5209\nEmail\nrenay.san@cos.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
