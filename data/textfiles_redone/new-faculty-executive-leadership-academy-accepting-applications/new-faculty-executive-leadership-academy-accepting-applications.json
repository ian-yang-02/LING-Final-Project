Applications will be accepted from tenured, full professors, and are due Friday, Oct. 15.\nFour FELA Fellows will be selected for rotations over a two-year period, from Jan. 1, 2022, through Dec. 30, 2023. Each fellow will spend six months in each of the Institute\u2019s four executive offices: president, provost, executive vice president for Research, and executive vice president for Administration and Finance.\nThrough the academy, fellows will be exposed to Institute operations and mentored on leadership strategy. They will also collaborate with the executives on four short-term, high-impact projects focused on an objective of significance to the mission or strategic goals of each of the four divisional areas of the Institute. The program will be coordinated and administered by former Provost Rafael L. Bras, who will serve as mentor to the fellows and develop activities outside of the shadowing experience.\nFELA Fellows will receive salary support funds of $20,000 for each 12-month period in the program. These funds can be used for course buyout, research support (to hire additional research staff), or summer salary. Additionally, they will have access to professional development funds of up to $5,000 to be used during the two years of the program, and will receive an administrative salary supplement of $15,000 for each of the two academic years of the program.\nTo find out more information, including how to apply, visit the\nFaculty Executive Leadership Academy\nsite.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nJaydale Codrington-Poyotte\nOffice of the Vice Provost for Graduate Education and Faculty Development\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
