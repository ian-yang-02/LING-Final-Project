The project evolved from earlier National Science Foundation-supported research on a virtual ecological research assistant that enables researchers to explore \u201cwhat if\u201d experiments about complex ecological phenomena.\nThe beauty of VERA is that users do not need a background in complex mathematical equations or computer programming to explore it. A high school student interested in finding out what it looks like to \u201cflatten the curve\u201d can log in to VERA and investigate. A parent handling middle school science lessons from home can log in to VERA and demonstrate the reason that it is important that they do lessons from home during the COVID-19 outbreak.\nFor example, a user can input 16 people as the \u201caverage contacts per day per person\u201d and see a simulation of the possible outcomes. Then, the user can lower the number of \u201caverage contacts per day per person\u201d to 12, a reduction in social contact but not a substantial one. Upon running the simulation again, users see a marked difference in \u201cpeak cases\u201d of 7,000 rather than 8,000, and healthcare capacity being exceeded after 20 days, rather than the original 15. Users can continue to adjust these numbers to see the impact of social distancing transform possible health outcomes before their eyes.\n\u201cThink of VERA as a virtual laboratory that anyone can use,\u201d said Ashok Goel, a professor in the School of Interactive Computing and the chief scientist for Georgia Tech\u2019s Center for 21st Century Universities. \u201cThe user can jump into our program and conduct \u2018what if\u2019 experiments by adjusting simulation parameters. We see education as an essential component of \u2018flattening the curve\u2019 and this is our way of providing an accessible and informal learning tool that can educate citizens about social distancing data.\u201d\nA key component of Georgia Tech\u2019s strategic vision for the future of education is an \u201cinclusive and impactful education that serves the public good.\u201d Tools like VERA provide inclusive resources that help the global community gain a greater understanding of the real-world impact of our actions during a crisis like COVID-19.\nAre you interested in trying VERA?
