Resilience Can Help Promote Civil Discourse\nSuggestions for having a civil discussion with someone who doesn't share your views.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nEmail\nOct 27, 2020\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nFor a variety of reasons 2020 has been stressful, frightening, and just plain exhausting. Because of the coronavirus pandemic, some of us have lost loved ones. Many are working from home, and others are unemployed. Wildfires ravaged the west coast as hurricanes and tornadoes battered the Southeast. Protests against racism and police brutality were held around the globe.\nAnd, of course, there is next week\u2019s election, which in some cases has pitted relatives and friends against each other.\nAt times it seems impossible to talk about politics and current events without ending in a shouting match and hurt feelings. Is it possible to have a civil discussion with someone who doesn\u2019t share the same views?\n\u201cA need to focus on being right often leads to missed opportunities to understand one another,\u201d said Tiffiny Hughes-Troutman, licensed psychologist and director of the\nCenter for Assessment, Referral, and Education (CARE)\nat Georgia Tech. \u201cSeeking to understand another\u2019s viewpoint does not equate with agreeing with them; it promotes psychological flexibility and a growth mindset.\u201d\nPsychological flexibility means recognizing and adapting to various situational demands, and being proactive instead of reactive in acknowledging and owning one\u2019s response.\n\u201cIt is natural to want to assert our own beliefs, but also very healthy to accept that someone else may hold a different opinion despite your efforts to change them,\u201d Hughes-Troutman said.\nSonia Alvarez-Robinson, executive director of Georgia Tech Strategic Consulting, agrees.\n\u201cThis time of disagreement and discourse is challenging all of us,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we need to keep our focus on what unites us at Georgia Tech \u2014 our common mission to develop leaders who advance technology and improve the human condition.\u00a0Regardless of the outcome of the election, our mission remains solid. No matter which candidate we support, vote for, or agree with, our students are our first priority and we need to keep that front and center.\u201d\nAlvarez-Robinson said vigorous disagreement with another person can often feel like an adverse event, and if prolonged it becomes a chronic stressor.\n\u201cWe often have physiological responses to being in conflict with another person \u2014 our heart rate goes up, we might have pain in our gut, we might have skin irritations, or even have trouble breathing. These are all signs of stress and distress,\u201d she said.\nStressors caused by conflict can also have a negative impact on personal and professional relationships.\n\u201cResearch has shown that diversity brings richness, new ideas, insights, and growth that does not happen in a homogeneous group,\u201d said Alvarez-Robinson, who has a doctorate in human and organizational behavior. \u201cYet studies have also shown that diversity of values, especially when they are deeply rooted, can make productivity and group efficacy more difficult.\u201d\nAlvarez-Robinson is the principal empowerment officer of Tech\u2019s Resilience Employee Resource Group. She suggests using resilience as a skill to help grow from the difficulties experienced through discourse. \u201cResilience can help groups manage diversity of values while also healing from hurt that is created when people become emotionally charged in their disagreements.\u201d\nAlvarez-Robinson suggests employing the following coping strategies during this stressful time:\nQuiet your mind . We are bombarded with messages, information, stories, opinions, and our mind is trying to make sense of all of it. Use meditation and other mindfulness techniques to quiet the noise that can keep you from thinking clearly.\nKeep Reality in Perspective . Uncertainty can cause anxiety and fear, which can lead us to create our own worst imaginings of what will happen next. It is important to discern between fear that is imagined and danger that is real. Here we need to prepare for the worst but expect the best.\nEngage in self-care . Heightened negative emotions can make us feel beaten down and depleted in our energy.\u00a0We need to rejuvenate, recharge, and restore our positive emotions by taking care of ourselves. Get out into nature, manage media consumption, set boundaries, and say kind things to ourselves.\nPut worries in their place.\nThere is a lot to worry about, but worrying can only be productive if we put it into its place.\u00a0List the things that you are worried about and put them into one of three buckets:\u00a0what I can\u2019t control (then you have to release it), what I can partially control (then figure out what you will do about it), and what I totally control (then make a plan to take action to resolve it).\nHughes-Troutman added, \u201cIt is essential to acknowledge our feelings and aim for a balanced and healthy perspective to prevent stress levels from escalating.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nContact\nVictor Rogers\nInstitute Communications\nEmail\nvictor.rogers@comm.gatech.edu\nAdditional information\nNo matter your role on campus, there are opportunities for dialogue and community support:\nResources for students\nStudent resources are available through the\nCenter for Assessment, Referral, and Education (CARE) , which will be adding drop-in hours on Wednesday, Nov. 4, from 8 a.m. - noon and 1 - 4:30 p.m. and Thursday, Nov. 5, from 9 a.m. - noon.
