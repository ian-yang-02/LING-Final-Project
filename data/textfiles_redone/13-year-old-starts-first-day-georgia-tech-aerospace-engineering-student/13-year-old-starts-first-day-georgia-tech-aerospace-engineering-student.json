When asked about his future, he was clear that his dream school was Georgia Tech where he\u2019d hope to major in\u00a0 aerospace engineering . Anderson was accepted to Georgia Tech in Spring 2021.\nA dream realized, on Monday, he was among the thousands of students welcomed to Georgia Tech\u2019s campus for the first day of fall classes. While most 13 year olds are starting middle school, Anderson started his first day as a sophomore with an integral calculus class.\nWhen asked about his first day, Anderson said, \u201cIt was pretty interesting.\u201d He also admitted that he\u2019d underestimated how large the campus is, calling it \u201cmassive.\u201d Despite the size, he says he did feel at home on campus. He shared that as the day of classes went on, his nerves subsided, and he was excited to be starting this journey. \u201cThis is the kind of school I have been wanting to go to for a very long time, and I am finally here,\u201d he added.\nHis parents, Kobi and Claire Anderson, were right by his side for his first day. He jokingly referred to his dad as his \u201cchauffeur.\u201d The Andersons beamed with pride about the experience but also expressed that it was unnerving. \u201cHave we prepared him enough?\u201d his mother questioned. \u201cHave we taught him enough about failure?\u201d\nBut his father says, \u201cHe\u2019s willing to be stretched. He knows how to get back from a punch \u2026 and continues to strive.\u201d\nAnderson is the youngest student on Georgia Tech\u2019s campus, and he doesn\u2019t take that for granted. As a young African American boy, he understands the magnitude of being a positive and inspirational influence in his community. His mom hopes that by continuing to share his story that their family can help to \u201cshift the perspective of what you see when you see a young Black man.\u00a0This could be a future aerospace engineer.\u201d\nDespite garnering the world\u2019s attention for being a genius, Anderson continues to lead with humility. He revealed it wasn\u2019t until he was sitting in his second lecture class of the day that he thought to himself, \u201cWow, maybe I\u00a0 am \u00a0advanced.\u201d\nWhen he\u2019s not studying to be an engineer, he\u2019s a normal teen that likes to sleep in \u2014 and, admittedly, procrastinates. He also says that some people believe that things come easily to him, but that is not the case.\n\u201cI am really proud of him, but I am really grateful to Georgia Tech for opening a door of opportunity to a student like Caleb,\u201d said his mom.\nWhile on campus, Anderson is hoping to join clubs like the\u00a0 Ramblin\u2019 Rocket Club . His long-term goals include earning a master\u2019s degree from Georgia Tech, pursuing a career at SpaceX, and starting his own company. His top goal is to pay it forward, saying, \u201cI want to\u00a0help others that may just need nurturing and resources.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nContact\nAyana Isles Institute Communications\nEmail\naisles3@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
