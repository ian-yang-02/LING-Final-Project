(Credit: Rob Felt, Georgia Tech)\nSep 19, 2017\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nSand-swimming lizards, slithering robotic snakes, dusk-flying moths and running roaches all have one thing in common: They're increasingly being studied by physicists interested in understanding the shared strategies these creatures have developed to overcome the challenges of moving though their environments.\nBy analyzing the rules governing the locomotion of these creatures, \"physics of living systems\" researchers are learning how animals successfully negotiate unstable surfaces like wet sand, maintain rapid motion on flat surfaces using the advantageous mechanics of their bodies, and fly in ways that would never work for modern aircraft. The knowledge these researchers develop could be useful to the designers of robots and flying vehicles of all kinds.\n\u201cLocomotion is a very natural access point for understanding how biological systems interact with the world,\u201d said\nSimon Sponberg , an assistant professor in the\nSchool of Physics\nand\nSchool of Biological Sciences\nat the Georgia Institute of Technology.\u00a0\u201cWhen they move, animals change the environment around them so they can push off from it and move through it in different ways. This capability is a defining feature of animals.\u201d\nSponberg has spent his career bridging the gap between physics and organismal biology \u2013 the study of complex creatures. His work includes studying how hawk moths slow their nervous systems to maintain vision during low-light conditions, and how muscle is a versatile material able to change function from a brake to a motor or spring.\nHe recently published a feature article, the cover story for the September issue of the American Institute of Physics magazine\nPhysics Today , on the role of physics in animal locomotion. The article was not intended as a review of the entire field, but rather to show how organismal physics \u2013 integrating complex physiological systems, the mechanics and the surrounding environment into a whole animal \u2013 has inspired his career.\n\u201cThe intersection of physics and organismal biology is a very exciting one right now,\u201d said Sponberg, who is also a researcher with the\nPetit Institute for Bioengineering and Bioscience\nat Georgia Tech said. \u201cThe assembly and interaction of multiple natural components manifests new behaviors and dynamics. The collection of these natural components manifests different patterns than the individual parts, and that\u2019s fascinating.\u201d\nSupported by new initiatives at such organizations as the\nArmy Research Office/Army Research Laboratory\nand the\nNational Science Foundation\n\u2013 which are embracing these frontiers \u2013 Georgia Tech scientists are learning the equations that dictate how snakes move, understanding how the hair spacing on the bodies of bees help them stay clean, and using X-ray equipment to see how an unusual African lizard \u201cswims\u201d through dry sand.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a really exciting time to be working at the intersection of evolutionary organismal biology that is realized in these living systems that have come about through the process of evolution, composed of seemingly very complex systems,\u201d he said. \u201cBiological systems are inescapably complex, but that doesn\u2019t mean there aren\u2019t simple patterns of behavior that we can understand. We now have the modern tools, approaches and theory that we need to be able to extract physical patterns from biological systems.\u201d\nIn his article, Sponberg makes predictions about the research that will be needed for the physics of living systems to advance as a field:\nHow feedback transforms physiological dynamics,\nHow aggregations of living components, from humans to ants to molecular motors, arise at multiple scales, and\nHow robo-physical models of these complex systems can lead to new discoveries and advance engineering.\nEngineered systems use feedback about the effects of their actions to adjust their future activities, and animals do the same to control their movement. Scientists can manipulate this feedback to understand how complex systems are put together and use the feedback to design experiments rather than just analyzing what is there.\n\u201cWe use feedback all the time to move through our environment, and feedback is a really special thing that fundamentally affects how dynamics occur,\u201d said Sponberg. \u201cBut using feedback to design experiments is really sort of new.\u201d\nFor example, in the study of how hawk moths track flowers during low-light conditions, he and his colleagues used feedback dynamics to isolate how the moth\u2019s brain adjusts its processing in dim light. The moths can still accurately track flower movements that occur less than two times per second \u2013 which matches the frequency at which the flowers sway in the wind.\nAnimals are composed of many systems operating at multiple time scales simultaneously \u2013 brain neurons, nerves and the individual fibers of muscles with molecular motors. These muscle fibers are arranged in an active crystalline lattice such that X-rays fired through them create a regular diffraction pattern. Understanding these multiscale living assemblages provides new insights into how animals manage complex actions.\nFinally, Sponberg notes in his article that robots are playing a larger and larger role in the physics laboratory as functional models that can examine principles of movement by interacting with the real world. In the laboratory of Georgia Tech Associate Professor Dan Goldman \u2013 one of Sponberg\u2019s colleagues \u2013 robotic snakes, turtles, crabs and other creatures help scientists understand what they\u2019re observing in the natural world.\n\u201cMoving physical models \u2013 robots \u2013 can be very powerful tools for understanding these complex systems,\u201d Sponberg said. \u201cThey can allow us to do experiments on robots that we couldn\u2019t do on animals to see how they interact with complex environments. We can see what physics in these systems is essential to their behaviors.\u201d\nSponberg was inspired to study the interaction of organismal biology and physics by the remarkable diversity of animal movement and by nonlinear dynamics, a field made popular when he was a young student by the 1987 best-selling book\nChaos: Making a New Science,\nauthored by former New York Times reporter James Gleick. Sponberg hopes today\u2019s students \u2013 readers of\nPhysics Today\n\u2013 will also be inspired.\n\u201cI voted on this with my career choice, so I think this is a very exciting areas of science,\u201d he added.\nResearch News\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\n177 North Avenue\nAtlanta, Georgia\u00a0 30332-0181\u00a0 USA\nMedia Relations Contacts : John Toon (404-894-6986) (jtoon@gatech.edu) or Ben Brumfield (404-660-1408) (ben.brumfield@comm.gatech.edu).\nWriter : John Toon\nAdditional Images\nContact\nJohn Toon\nResearch News\n(404) 894-6986\nEmail\njtoon@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
