Friday, she\u2019ll share that moment with her husband, family and young daughter.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nEmail\nMidori Wasielewski with her husband, Andrew, and their daughter following her dissertation defense.\nDec 13, 2022\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nDefending a 120-page dissertation on immunology and biomaterials may be a daunting task for most on its own, but in the final year of her biomedical engineering Ph.D. program, Midori Wasielewski\u2019s mornings began when her daughter woke up and ended in the late hours of the evening, with a full day\u2019s work at the lab in between.\nWhile the challenges of being a new mom and the interruption of a pandemic may have presented obstacles, Wasielewski never wavered on her path to graduation. Reflecting on a piece of advice that stuck with her throughout her time on campus, she chose actor and author Sean Patrick Flanery\u2019s message to \u201cdo something today that your future self will thank you for.\u201d\nWhen her daughter was born in 2021, Wasielewski knew that the hard work was not only for her future self but also for her growing family. \u201cEven though it was extremely hard working around the clock and not getting a lot of sleep, I was very driven to complete the program at that point and also to set a good example for my baby,\u201d she said.\nUnlike her research in engineering a DNA-based biomaterial to aid doctors and clinicians in identifying patients at high risk for autoimmune diseases, raising a child is not an exact science. Along with the support of her husband, Andrew, there is a place on campus that will forever hold a special place in Wasielewski\u2019s heart \u2014\u00a0 the Children\u2019s Campus at Georgia Tech .\n\u201cNone of this could have happened without the Children's Campus. I was very lucky that they opened their doors to me and my daughter. Without day care being a five-minute walk from my lab, this would not have happened. Georgia Tech was awesome in supporting me as a mom and as a Ph.D. student,\u201d she said.\nWasielewski arrived at Tech in 2017 alongside her advisor\nShuichi Takayama , whose lab she joined after earning her master\u2019s in macromolecular engineering at the University of Michigan. Having become a father while earning his Ph.D., Takayama \u2014 professor, GRA Eminent Scholar, and Price Gilbert Jr. Chair in the\nWallace H. Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering\n\u2014 served as an inspiration to Wasielewski as she navigated the early days of parenthood.\n\u201cWhen I was exhausted and delirious, I would just think to myself, \u2018Tomorrow, I\u2019ll be thankful if I just write for 30 minutes or if I just plan this experiment.\u2019 When I did sit down and do that, it usually turned into one or two hours. All those small efforts built into this huge thing, and looking back, I can't believe I actually finished,\u201d she said.\nThe only thing that could keep Wasielewski away from her research was Covid-19. Out of the lab for two months, she dealt with the uncertainty by pouring all of her efforts into her dissertation, which has now been successfully defended after a full-on sprint to the finish line.\n\u201cOne of the affirmations you learn during pregnancy and as a mom is that you can do anything for five minutes or for a short amount of time, and I applied that to me,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was a period of sacrifice \u2014 completely unsustainable \u2014 but we knew we could do this.\u201d\nNext, Wasielewski intends to pursue research and development opportunities in the biotech industry, but not before taking some well-earned time off to spend with her family.\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nGeorgia Tech Commencement\nFall 2022 Commencement Speakers\nMission Accomplished: An Army Veteran\u2019s Path to Commencement at Georgia Tech\nBalancing Parenthood and the Pursuit of a Ph.D.\nWhat Not to Wear: Commencement Edition\u2026and Other Tips For Your Graduation Day\nCommencement Wishes\nBeth Quay: Taking Care of Unfinished Business\nReflection Speakers Highlight Tech Community\nContact\nSteven Gagliano - Communications Officer\nInstitute Communications\nEmail\nSteven.gagliano@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
