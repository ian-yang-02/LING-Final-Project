But because poll workers are typically older, and therefore at a higher risk of developing complications if infected with Covid-19, young people, including Georgia Tech students, are stepping up to fill those roles. In Georgia, they are volunteering for the Nov. 3 general election, as well as the potential runoff elections on Dec. 1 and Jan. 5. Being a poll worker is a paid position.\n\u201cWe must usher in a new generation of poll workers,\u201d said Samuel Ellis, poll manager for the McCamish Pavilion precinct. \u201cSeeing people your age at a polling place matters. If you feel welcome on Election Day and see friendly faces that represent you, you\u2019re going to become a lifetime voter.\u201d\nA poll worker\u2019s day starts at 5 a.m., when they show up at their precinct and start setting up the polling machines under the supervision of the polling place\u2019s manager. From there, they\u2019ll do anything from helping voters check in to ensuring that voters\u2019 ballots have been cast properly to handing out the coveted \u201cI\u2019m a Georgia voter\u201d stickers.\nBecause poll workers are required to be there for the entire day, they\u2019ll have to vote with a mail-in ballot or go to the polls on a day that they\u2019re not working.\nStudents living on or near campus can apply to work at Georgia Tech\u2019s\non-campus polling place , which will be held at McCamish Pavilion starting with early voting on Oct. 21. Poll workers for the McCamish precinct must be a U.S. citizen and a resident of Fulton County; students who are living on or near campus \u2014 even if only for the academic year \u2014 are considered Fulton County residents. Those interested can learn more about the requirements and apply\nhere .
