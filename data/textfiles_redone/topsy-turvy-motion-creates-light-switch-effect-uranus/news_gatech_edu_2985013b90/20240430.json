Lamy/Observatoire de Paris).\nJun 26, 2017\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nMore than 30 years after Voyager 2 sped past Uranus, Georgia Institute of Technology researchers are using the spacecraft\u2019s data to learn more about the icy planet. Their new study suggests that Uranus\u2019 magnetosphere, the region defined by the planet\u2019s magnetic field and the material trapped inside it, gets flipped on and off like a light switch every day as it rotates along with the planet. It\u2019s \u201copen\u201d in one orientation, allowing solar wind to flow into the magnetosphere; it later closes, forming a shield against the solar wind and deflecting it away from the planet.\nThis is much different from Earth\u2019s magnetosphere, which typically only switches between open and closed in response to changes in the solar wind. Earth\u2019s magnetic field is nearly aligned with its spin axis, causing the entire magnetosphere to spin like a top along with the Earth\u2019s rotation. Since the same alignment of Earth\u2019s magnetosphere is always facing toward the sun, the magnetic field threaded in the ever-present solar wind must change direction in order to reconfigure Earth\u2019s field from closed to open. This frequently occurs with strong solar storms.\nBut Uranus lies and rotates on its side, and its magnetic field is lopsided \u2014 it\u2019s off-centered and tilted 60 degrees from its axis. Those features cause the magnetic field to tumble asymmetrically\u00a0relative to the solar wind direction as the icy giant completes its 17.24-hour full rotation.\nRather than the solar wind dictating a switch like here on Earth, the researchers say Uranus\u2019 rapid rotational change in field strength and orientation lead to a periodic open-close-open-close scenario as it tumbles through the solar wind.\n\u201cUranus is a geometric nightmare,\u201d said\nCarol Paty , the Georgia Tech associate professor who co-authored the study. \u201cThe magnetic field tumbles very fast, like a child cartwheeling down a hill head over heels. When the magnetized solar wind meets this tumbling field in the right way, it can reconnect and Uranus\u2019 magnetosphere goes from open to closed to open on a daily basis.\u201d\nPaty says this solar wind reconnection is predicted to occur upstream of Uranus\u2019 magnetosphere over a range of latitudes, with magnetic flux closing in various parts of the planet\u2019s twisted magnetotail.\nReconnection of magnetic fields is a phenomenon throughout the solar system. It occurs when the direction of the interplanetary magnetic field \u2013 which comes from the sun and is also known as the heliospheric magnetic field \u2013 is opposite a planet\u2019s magnetospheric alignment. Magnetic field lines are then spliced together and rearrange the local magnetic topology, allowing a surge of solar energy to enter the system.\nMagnetic reconnection is one reason for Earth\u2019s auroras. Auroras could be possible at a range of latitudes on Uranus due to its off-kilter magnetic field, but the aurora is difficult to observe because the planet is nearly 2 billion miles from Earth. The Hubble Space Telescope occasionally gets a faint view, but it can\u2019t directly measure Uranus\u2019 magnetosphere.\nThe Georgia Tech researchers used numerical models to simulate the planet\u2019s global magnetosphere and to predict favorable reconnection locations. They plugged in data collected by Voyager 2 during its five-day flyby in 1986. It\u2019s the only time a spacecraft has visited.\nThe researchers say learning more about Uranus is one key to discovering more about planets beyond our solar system.\n\u201cThe majority of exoplanets that have been discovered appear to also be ice giants in size,\u201d said Xin Cao, the Georgia Tech Ph.D. candidate in earth and atmospheric sciences who led the study. \u201cPerhaps what we see on Uranus and Neptune is the norm for planets: very unique magnetospheres and less-aligned magnetic fields. Understanding how these complex magnetospheres shield exoplanets from stellar radiation is of key importance for studying the habitability of these newly discovered worlds.\u201d\nThe paper, \u201c Diurnal and Seasonal Variability of Uranus\u2019 Magnetosphere ,\u201d is currently published in the Journal of Geophysical Research: Space Physics.\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nThe Sands of Titan Would Create Great Sand Castles\nPaty, Schmidt Involved in Future Europa Mission\nThe Search for Life in the Solar System\nContact\nJason Maderer\nNational Media Relations\nmaderer@gatech.edu\n404-660-2926\nEmail\nmaderer@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
