The studio is part of the\u00a0 Eco Urban Lab , directed by\u00a0 Perry Yang . In the Studio, Georgia Tech designers are changing the way we plan cities.\nAccording to Yang, designers need to know, \u201chow urban form accommodates flows of all kinds, including information, energy, and human movements, and how patterns of flows are mapped through physical configurations that change over time.\u201d Using advanced analytics on a massive pool of data, designers can see how people choose to use a space. Then, they can make decisions based on real behavior rather than theoretical models or small surveys, Yang said.\nProjects from the Studio recently drew Esri\u2019s attention for their advanced use of geographic analytics. As part of the studio, students used large-scale location data to model traffic flows in different segments of Tokyo.\nEsri is best known as the company that developed GIS (geographic information system)\u00a0software which is widely used by city and regional planners.\u00a0 Esri's blog \u00a0covers innovative use of geospatial data.\nTo date, the Studio has delivered smart-city proposals for three different Tokyo neighborhoods: Urawa-Misono in 2017, Kyojima in 2018-2019, and Shinagawa in 2020. Yang said this year\u2019s project will involve the Nihonbashi district, home of the Tokyo Stock Exchange\u00a0and a historic origin of Tokyo\u2019s modern urban culture.\nTokyo is one of the busiest, most populous cities in the world, and as such, it\u2019s difficult to create sustainable, healthy environments, said Yang. His studio focuses on global collaboration to solve the problems facing cities like Tokyo.\nFor the Nihonbashi district, the Studio is collaborating with the\u00a0 Department of Urban Engineering at the University of Tokyo ; the\u00a0 Global Carbon Project ; the\u00a0 National Institute for Environmental Studies, Japan ; and the\u00a0 Mitsui Fudosan University of Tokyo Laboratory .\nThanks to the diversity of ideas that this collaboration generates, the Tokyo Smart City Studio proposals aren\u2019t purely theoretical. Students work on real neighborhood needs identified by the local government, using real on-site data gathered and processed by groundbreaking methods. Massive amounts of data require AI techniques and algorithms to process some of them.\nDesign Makes Cities Smart\nUnlike a smartphone or a smart home, a smart city is measured by more than its Internet connection or its automation. A city is smart because its design is based on data about flows of people, resources, energy, and information. \u201cEmpowered by new tools and technologies, cities are now far more designable than ever before. Future urban design and development are to be data-driven,\" Yang said.\n\"Cities are becoming more interactive and situation-driven and have to be more responsive, adaptable, and resilient to future conditions.\u201d\nOnly in the past few years have smartphones, GPS, and Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices made real data on a city-wide scale available. These new technologies may enable good planning that is driven by social, institutional, and physical contexts, Yang said.\nStudents Predict Mobility Using AI Techniques\nBut new data and a new design philosophy require new methods of design, which haven\u2019t been created yet. \u00a0To meet this challenge, Yang\u2019s students use AI techniques to create models of behavior.\nAn early test in Urawa-Misono used Tokyo traffic data. The model was \u201ctrained\u201d using existing traffic data. Designers then check the model to see if correctly predicts congestion points. If it works, that suggests the model can be used to estimate the impact of design changes on traffic flow.\nMethods like this allow designers to move mobility analytics into the design phase. Mobility is key in the urban environment, but mobility studies usually aren\u2019t done until we envision how future urban spaces are shaped through design.\n\u201cMobility research during these studios developed test processes to better integrate mobility metrics with design decisions,\u201d Yang said.\nThe following studio in Kyojima expanded the role of deep learning techniques. Georgia Tech students participated in street experiments in Tokyo by carrying vital sensors to measure data such as \u00a0heart beat, temperature, humidity, UV, pressure and acceleration of human movement, to understand human perception and their connections to urban street environments. Students created a rapid automatic assessment of sequential urban experiences: basically, how pleasant a person would experience walking down a street.\nThe resulting article,\u00a0 Computing Sequential Experience of an Urban Street using Deep Learning Technique , led by Helen Chen, a Ph.D. student in the School of City and Regional Planning, was presented at the 2019 International Conference of Urban Informatics.\nBoth the Urawa-Misono and Kyojima studio projects made mobility analysis and feedback part of the design phase, yielding designs better supporting resilience, sustainability, and community health.\nUsing Social Media to Check Risk of Heat Stress\nIn Tokyo, studio planners expanded mobility studies to include public health. Tokyo officials were concerned that heat waves would pose a risk to the 2020 Olympic crowds.\nTo address this, researchers used a combination of GPS and social networking service information to track people\u2019s motion and response to heat \u201cin near real-time [and] in high spatial resolution,\u201d said Yang.\nStudents used thermal images from a helicopter to find hot zones. GPS data showed pedestrian exposure to those hot zones. The combination of heat and pedestrian exposure allowed prediction of risky areas.\nIn collaboration with partners in Japan, researchers searched geotagged twitter data for terms related to heat discomfort. They found a high correlation between the predicted risk zones and areas where people complained about heat.\nBoth the prediction of heat risk and the use of social media to check the prediction are new methods developed in the Studio.\nAdditional Images\nEmail\nann.hoevel@design.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
