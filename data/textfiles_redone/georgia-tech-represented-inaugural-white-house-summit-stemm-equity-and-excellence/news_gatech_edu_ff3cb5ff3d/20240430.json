The group was charged with providing oversight and input for the National STEM Education Strategic Plan, involving 19 federal agencies that support STEM education at various levels.\n\u201cSince a portion of the plan addressed diversity, equity, and inclusion in STEM, this Summit was especially relevant to our work,\u201d she said. \u201cReturning to Washington, D.C. for this momentous occasion in making STEMM education equity and access a national priority was an honor. The state of Georgia is well-positioned to make a real change in this arena with its rich ecosystem of universities and colleges, industry, and community organizations.\u201d\nThe one-day event included remarks from various government officials in support of the Biden-Harris Administration\u2019s commitment to eliminate systematic barriers to entry in STEMM followed by a series of panel discussions with representatives from the public and private sectors who work in this space.\nThe summit concluded with a call to join the\nSTEMM Opportunity Alliance (SOA) , a new landmark organization led by the American Association for the Advancement of Science with support from the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation. The SOA is responsible for coordinating current and future national efforts with over 90 partners from industry, government, education, research, foundations, and organizations already committed to achieving shared goals for equity in STEMM by 2050.\nThe five action areas that will be addressed by the SOA\nare:\nEnsure every person has opportunity to participate in STEMM,\nInvest in the STEMM teacher pipeline,\nClose the funding gap and invest in community colleges, minority-serving institutions, and community-based organizations,\nDismantle bias and discriminatory practices throughout the STEMM ecosystem, and\nClose the STEMM information gap with best practices in evaluation, shared indicators of progress and meaningful disaggregation of data.\n\u2014 Jo\u00eblle Walls, CEISMC Communications\nAdditional Images\nContact\nJo\u00eblle Walls\nCEISMC Communications\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
