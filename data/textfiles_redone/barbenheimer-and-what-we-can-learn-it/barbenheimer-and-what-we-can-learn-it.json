(Designed with Midjourney)\nJul 27, 2023\nThe simultaneous releases of\u00a0 Barbie\u00a0 and\u00a0 Oppenheimer\u00a0 in U.S. theaters over the weekend generated an enormous buzz among movie fans enchanted by the seemingly dichotomous nature of the releases, film critics eager to dig into the art of both movies, and cultural critics interested in the baggage and promise inherent in both films. We asked some of our experts on pop culture, representations of technology in media, and feminism to weigh in on the blockbuster event of the summer. Here\u2019s what Professor\u00a0 Carol Colatrella , Regents\u2019 Professor\u00a0 Lisa Yaszek , and Assistant Professor\u00a0 Ida Yoshinaga \u00a0had to say:\nThere\u2019s been so much media excitement over the premieres of these two movies in contrast to the opening of other highly anticipated blockbusters this summer, such as\u00a0 Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning ,\u00a0 Spider-Man: Across the Spider Verse ,\u00a0or\u00a0 The Flash . Why?\nYaszek : Because the Atomic Bomb and the Atomic Blonde are two cultural icons central to the modern American imagination! Oppenheimer and the Manhattan Project ushered in the era of truly world-changing technosciences and catapulted the U.S. into a position of global leadership. Barbie was the first mass-produced doll that invited girls to imagine adult roles for themselves outside of motherhood, emerging in tandem with the beginning of the sexual revolution, the revival of feminism, and the start of modern conversations about sex and gender. These are two the key ways we define ourselves as Americans! It doesn\u2019t matter if you know the details of Oppenheimer\u2019s specific role in the creation of nuclear weapons, or if you ever actually played with Barbie and her pals. Everyone knows that \u201cOppenheimer\u201d is shorthand for our complex feelings about the promises and perils of modern technologies that both sustain and threaten to end civilization as we know it, and everyone knows that \u201cBarbie\u201d is shorthand for our complex feelings about new social and sex roles that somehow both radically depart from \u2014 and yet also still echo\u00a0\u2014\u00a0more conservative ones from earlier eras.\nYoshinaga : In the financial context of the ongoing WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes as well as most of those other franchise films not meeting with summer box-office expectations, I think some industry watchers are hailing Barbenheimer\u2019s killer opening weekend as a sign of hope for the entertainment industry.\u00a0 Barbie \u00a0has enjoyed the largest open for a female-director-led movie in history, and Oppenheimer drew a respectable box office take as well. Both\u00a0 Barbie \u00a0and\u00a0 Oppenheimer , drawing strongly on the last century\u2019s sociopolitical context, promise some intellectual engagement, some critical thinking, some historical insight of who we are as a society.\nColatrella:\u00a0 That audiences connect the films \u2014 one representing the story of Barbie as documenting varying and shifting views on feminism and the other documenting varying and shifting views about the atomic bomb \u2014 resonates with contemporary concerns about women\u2019s independence and with our wartime concerns about developing and using weapons and other technologies that have unforeseen consequences. It is interesting to me that\u00a0 Barbie \u00a0incorporates the doll\u2019s creator as a character and that\u00a0 Oppenheimer \u00a0acknowledges the protagonist\u2019s technological contributions and his subsequent restraint in using what he helped create. The films present revisionist histories demonstrating the force and fluctuations of political ideologies over time.\nPlay Video\nWhy should we see\u00a0 Barbie ?\nColatrella :\u00a0It\u2019s great to see a film that celebrates feminism as a force enhancing gender equity, personal development for women and men ( Kenough !), mother-daughter bonding, and community decision-making in BarbieWorld. In developing my book\u00a0 Toys and Tools in Pink , I met with Lego marketing and production executive in Billund, Denmark, and was impressed with their commitment to design construction and building toys that could appeal to girls as powerfully as Barbie does. They valued that children\u2019s toys could contribute to collaborative play.\nYoshinaga : In the growing landscape of feminist directors, writer-director Greta Gerwig has carved out an intelligent, sensitive approach to portraying women on film\u2014from the delightfully twee\u00a0 Fr a nces Ha,\u00a0 which she co-scripted with director (and frequent filmmaking partner) Noah Baumbach, to the critically lauded\u00a0 Little Women \u00a0and autobiographical, regionalist\u00a0 Lady Bird , all of which display her signature style of gentle observational humor, gender role insight, and quiet yet powerfully accumulating ethics. By making the screen story postmodern and feminist, she\u2019s now viewed as having successfully \u201ccracked\u201d Barbie, a complex and potentially sexist/problematic IP that other skilled female comedy writers, including Diablo Cody and Amy Schumer, had not been able to pitch effectively.\nYaszek : First and foremost, we should all see the Barbie movie now because it promises a bit of hope and fun in a moment when our news cycle has become an endless loop of doom and gloom clickbait headlines. Having said that, I also think we can double or even triple our pleasure by having some serious fun with the\u00a0 Barbie \u00a0film. The history of Barbie is one of changing ideas about sex and gender. The doll debuted in 1959, just as the feminist revival was taking off and women were beginning to challenge simple gender binaries that suggested men were naturally suited to paid labor in the rough and tumble world of the public sphere while women were naturally suited to unpaid nurturing and caretaking in the home. With her many different careers and a Dream Home that originally was all dressing room and no kitchen, Barbie seemed to capture the excitement and possibility of the early Women\u2019s Liberation Movement. In a toy market flooded with baby dolls that demanded their owners act like little mothers, Barbie offered kids whole new imaginative play possibilities and, of course, whole new ways to think about sex and gender beyond the simple, pseudo-Darwinian binaries popular for much of American history. So I think it\u2019s no surprise that while Barbie is always popular, she\u2019s having a real moment right now, as we once again grapple with expanding sex and gender ideals.\nPlay Video\nWhy should the Georgia Tech community, especially, see\u00a0 Oppenheimer ?\nYaszek : I think members of the Georgia Tech community can use Oppenheimer\u2019s life story as a kind of test case for thinking through technoscientific and ethical dilemmas they might encounter in their own lives. Oppenheimer\u2019s role in the Manhattan Project was to supervise the translation of abstract concepts from theoretical physics into practical applications \u2014 in this case, the creation of a working nuclear bomb. Along the way, he had to negotiate some serious moral and ethical issues, including his own excitement at seeing the work progress and misgivings about what would happen if these weapons were really used. While most of our graduates are unlikely to be in that exact position, our students often do go on to work at the intersection between pure science and applied technology and as such, may well grapple with ethical questions and unseen social impacts in relation to their work. It\u2019s always instructive to see and hear stories that engage the issues we face in our own lives; they are virtual laboratories for testing certain courses of action before we act on them in the real world. And they give us ways to keep asking and exploring important questions about the impact of our actions on the world, long after the story itself is over.\nYoshinaga : One of my colleagues who teaches at a private aeronautical university \u2014 a Florida science-and-tech school with much less race and gender diversity in its student population than Georgia Tech \u2014 taught a section of her science-fiction studies course about the Manhattan Project. And some of her young undergraduates responded by claiming that the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki was \u201cfake news.\u201d This is the kind of dangerous misinformation trend that we faculty and researchers need to address, discuss, and teach/write about.\u00a0 Oppenheimer \u2019s focus on scientific ethics in the context of both U.S. and global geopolitical history does just that.\nColatrella:\u00a0 I want to see it to better understand the man and the historical forces contributing to and judging his work. But I\u2019d also like to read the 2005 biography\u00a0 American Prometheus \u00a0by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin because I wonder if having more women on the Los Alamos team would have made a difference.\nWhat\u2019s your most lasting memory about Barbie and her friends, or about the nuclear age, of the postwar era?\nColatrella:\u00a0 When I was young, I enjoyed playing with Barbies with cousins and friends; we would sew outfits for our dolls and imagine what decisions they would make about romance, education, and work. When my daughter was growing up, I bought her a Barbie Dreamhouse because I always wanted to have one, and I was reluctant to let it go until I could give it to the daughter of a Georgia Tech alumna who had been one of my students.\nYoshinaga : When I was a very young child, my parents couldn\u2019t afford to buy me a Barbie doll, so I went without one for much of my early years. Besides, I\u2019d always asked for mythology books! So it was my uncle who finally got me a classic Barbie, but by that time, I was in my late elementary-school era and didn\u2019t know what to do with it. I was reading a lot of Marvel comics by then, so I would put Barbie into action-sequence fights with my little brother\u2019s GI Joe. When it comes to the postwar era, I\u2019m too young to remember the nuclear-attack drills and propaganda of the 1950s and \u201860s. Still, all the sci-fi dystopias I saw in the movie theaters involved a nuclear apocalypse as the start of the end of the world. So I always believed a mushroom cloud was just around the corner. There was also a sense that we were the \u201cgood\u201d empire and the Soviets were \u201cevil\u201d; that we were helpless, caught between this global battle of geopolitical giants that might end up incinerating all of humanity.\nYaszek : I remember getting in a tussle with my mom over Barbie versus Stephie, the crafty country mom from the Sunshine family of dolls. My mom was a good second-wave feminist, very earnestly devoted to making sure her kids escaped the grip of the American beauty myth, and she thought Stephie, with her trim but realistic proportions and cute but modest clothes, was the role model for us girls. But all I wanted was the Barbie doll with the diamond jewelry and the pink satin jumpsuit! I felt that way in part because I was and still am a big fan of shine and sparkle, but also in part because Stephie\u2019s clothes only seemed appropriate for one role, that of a crafty country mom, while I could imagine Barbie\u2019s clothes taking her anywhere \u2014 from paid work as anything from a teacher to astronaut to working on her car in Barbie\u2019s Dream Garage to dinner and dancing, depending on her hairstyle and accessories. To my mom\u2019s credit, she did give in and get me the Barbie of my dreams. Plus, it turned out that my little sister, who was teething, loved chewing on the Sunshine family dolls, so everyone was happy in the end.\nInterested in more?\nHere are some suggestions for pop culture books, films, and TV series to extend your 'Barbenheimer' experience:\nThe atomic age and women\u2019s roles in it:\nYaszek recommends:\nCaroline Herzenberg and Ruth Howes\u2019s\u00a0 Their Day in the Sun: Women of the Manhattan Project\nMartha Ackman\u2019s\u00a0 The Mercury 13: The True Story of Thirteen Women and the Dream of Space Flight\nThe writings of postwar science fiction luminary Judith Merril.
