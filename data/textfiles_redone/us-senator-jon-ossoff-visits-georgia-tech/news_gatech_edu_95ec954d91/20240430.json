Jon Ossoff visited Georgia Tech\u2019s campus on Friday, April 29. His stop at Tech brought major stakeholders in Georgia together in a roundtable discussion to explore the potential for a hydrogen hub in the Southeast.\nThe Biden administration regards clean hydrogen as a critical component in a plan to transition the American energy infrastructure toward net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law includes $8 billion to establish regional hydrogen hubs that will conduct the research and development necessary to make hydrogen a viable, cost-effective, and clean energy carrier.\nSen. Ossoff has been a vocal supporter of clean and renewable energy initiatives and spoke during the roundtable discussion on the possibilities of the state of Georgia being an early adopter in the emerging clean energy market.\nHydrogen is one of Georgia Tech\u2019s strategic research initiatives, and the Strategic Energy Institute, led by Tech Professor Timothy Lieuwen, has been very instrumental in coordinating the energy research community, which is active in hydrogen-related research.\nOssoff said that in hosting this event at Georgia Tech, he hopes to position the state of Georgia and Georgia Tech as key players in the receipt of federal funds to help accelerate the Biden administration\u2019s goal of using hydrogen as a clean energy carrier rather than relying on expensive technology.\n\u201cExciting opportunities in hydrogen energy are coming to Georgia,\u201d said Ossoff. \u201cThis is a vital energy source as we continue to reduce pollution and move toward clean energy.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nContact\nSiobhan Rodriguez\nInstitute Communications\nsar30@gatech.edu\nEmail\nsar30@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
