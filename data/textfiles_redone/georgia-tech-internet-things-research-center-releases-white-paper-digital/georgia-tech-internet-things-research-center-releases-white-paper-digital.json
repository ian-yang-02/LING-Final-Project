It also explores some of the key DBT challenges, especially around IoT implementation and scale, and suggests frameworks for improving the approach to and efficacy of DBT programs and their IoT elements,\u201d said Michelle Mindala-Freeman, former Vice President in the Telecommunications, Media and Technology Practice at Capgemini, CDAIT Visiting Scholar and incoming Chair of the CDAIT IoT Thought Leadership Working Group.\nSupported by CDAIT research and members\u2019 experience, the white paper underscores three foundational components related to digital transformation and IoT:\nIoT projects must be defined, designed and delivered as part of a comprehensive DBT agenda and approach. The DIGIT framework outlined in the paper identifies the building blocks that are mission-critical to success, starting with setting and communicating a clear digital strategy.\nThe IoT end-to-end value chain is rich and complex, going well beyond devices, networks and applications. To create a more holistic view, the paper proposes the IMAGE model, which blends technological and non-technological aspects, all essential for delivering scale and benefits over time.\nIoT and business leaders should take action now to ground their DBT programs in fast emerging value vectors such as Recycling and reuse (circular economy),\u00a0 Outcome-driven business models (outcome economy), and Integration (interconnected economy), i.e., the \u201cnew ROI\u201d, which, if judiciously harnessed, will bolster up corporate return on investment.\n\u201cWe recognize that creating and scaling digital transformation and IoT programs is extremely difficult to do; in particular when it comes to maintaining a big picture mindset while dealing with a myriad of related moving parts and details,\u201d added Sebastien Lafon, former Global Head of Digital and Marketing Services at Boehringer Ingelheim, CDAIT Visiting Scholar and Vice Chair of the CDAIT IoT Standards & Management Working Group. \u201cWe trust digital transformation leaders will find in this paper a useful and concrete set of guideposts.\u201d\nAnyone who is considering launching some kind of IoT-centered DBT initiative or has hit stumbling barriers or snags \u2013 be they business buy-in, deployment speed or value delivery \u2013 should be able to capitalize on the suggestions and lessons learned that are shared throughout the report.\n\u201cAs a matter of course, we leverage industry insights from our members and Georgia Tech researchers to provide original perspectives on critical issues currently at the center of the IoT space,\u201d said Alain Louchez, Co-founder and Managing Director of CDAIT. \u201cThe white paper on digital transformation is a concrete example of this approach. It does not claim to be the be-all and end-all answer to a complex question. Rather, it shares key concerns and constraints while offering a few possible, directions, recommendations and guidelines to help decision-makers and practitioners effectively chart the course of this very challenging undertaking.\u201d\nThe white paper can be accessed free of charge here:\nhttps://c.gatech.edu/2QLbVE1\nAbout CDAIT\nThe Center for the Development and Application of Internet of Things Technologies (CDAIT, pronounced \u201csedate\u201d) is a global, nonprofit, partner-funded center located in Atlanta, GA that fosters interdisciplinary research and education while driving general awareness about the Internet of Things (IoT). CDAIT bridges sponsors with Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech) faculty and researchers, as well as industry members with similar interests. Central to its value proposition is the belief that only a holistic approach, i.e., mindful of the complexity of the entire IoT value chain and the intricate relationships between the various links, can generate superior results. CDAIT\u2019s broad overarching goal is to expand and promote IoT\u2019s huge potential and transformational capabilities. CDAIT aims to efficiently identify, understand and solve challenges and problems that may arise along the entire Internet of Things value chain through six Working Groups: IoT Education and Training; IoT Startup Ecosystem; IoT Thought Leadership; IoT Security and Privacy; IoT Standards and Management; and IoT Research.\nLearn more about CDAIT at\nwww.cdait.gatech.edu .\nAdditional Images\nContact\nDenise Ward\ndenise.ward@comm.gatech.edu\nEmail\ndenise.ward@comm.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
