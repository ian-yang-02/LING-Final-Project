Brian Kemp has convened a coronavirus task force that looks at the economic, health, emergency response and preparedness, and housing implications of the deadly disease.\nThe 66-member task force is comprised of four subcommittees, including one focused on economic impact. That subcommittee includes Alfie Meek, economist and director of the Enterprise Innovation Institute\u2019s\u00a0Center for Economic Development Research (CEDR)\u00a0at Georgia Tech.\n\u201cThe role of the Economic Impact Subcommittee is to help predict the economic effects on the state of Georgia from COVID19 and make recommendations,\u201d Meek said. \u201cWe\u2018re also being asked to brainstorm policies that might be implemented to help ease the economic pain from this event.\u201d\nMeek has more than 25 years of experience in economic/fiscal impact analysis and community-based research. He leads the five-member CEDR staff, which works with its clients \u2014 economic developers, community leaders, and industry \u2014 to help them understand the opportunities and challenges in fostering local and regional economic development.\nMeek is one of three economists selected to serve on the governor\u2019s task force subcommittee. The others are Jeffrey Dorfman, the state fiscal economist who is the subcommittee chairman, and Thomas Cunningham the Metro Atlanta Chamber\u2019s chief economist.\nThe full subcommittee met for the first time on March 19 in a virtual conference call.\n\u201cOne clear goal is to represent the many different facets of Georgia\u2019s economy that we think will be economically vulnerable at this time,\u201d Meek said.\nIn addition to Dorfman, Cunningham, and Meek, the Economic Impact Subcommittee members include:\nAllan Adams, State Director UGA Small Business Development Center\nNick Ayers, Managing Partner AFH Capital\nWill Bentley, Georgia Agribusiness Council\nDonna Bowman, Office of the State Treasurer\nLabor Commissioner Mark Butler\nPeter Carter, Delta Air Lines Chief Legal Officer (and Chair, Metro Chamber)\nBill Douglas, Athens First Bank & Trust\nGeorgia State Sen.
