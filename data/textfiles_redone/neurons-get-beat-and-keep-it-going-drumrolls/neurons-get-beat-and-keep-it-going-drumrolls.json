Drumroll\u2026cymbal crash! Repeat. With emphasis on \u201crepeat,\u201d\naccording to a new study.\nWhat used to look like fleeting cacophonies of electrical impulses in the brain is looking to neuroscience researchers more and more like a sustained matrix of electronic percussion. For years, they have been analyzing patterns hidden in neurons\u2019 electrical buzzes, and now, they have revealed in neurons continued stretches of orderly drumroll-like rumblings speckled with thrashing impulses, or spikes, that stimulate neighboring neurons.\n\u201cThese signaling patterns last a lot longer than we thought,\u201d said\nAnnabelle Singer, an assistant professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology . Singer led the\nin vivo\nstudy on mice together with\nEd Boyden, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology .\nPersistent neurons\n\u201cWe used to think that neurons would fire spikes to neighboring neurons for a few milliseconds, and that was all it would take to make the next neuron spike,\u201d Singer said. \u201cNow we\u2019re seeing that you get these repeating patterns of rumblings and spikes sustained over hundreds of milliseconds, even close to a full second.\u201d\nThat\u2019s about how long it takes a human heart to complete one full beat.\nThe rumblings are jumbly fluctuations of electrical potential within a neuron before it fires a spike. The spikes are big electrical signals that communicate with neighboring neurons.\nTaken together, the sum of the spikes in the brain make its circuitry compute so that we can walk, talk, and live life.\nThe researchers\npublished their study on the newly discovered patterns in the\nJournal of Neuroscience . Official publication date is February 14, 2018, but the study is already available online without embargo. The research was funded by the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, the Friends of the McGovern Institute, the New York Stem Cell Foundation, the MIT Intelligence Initiative, and the Lane Family.\nQuestions and answers\nThe combination of observing the patterns\u2019 percussion-like characteristics as well as their sustained lengths in the brains of awake mice make this a novel finding, Singer said. Some similar previous studies have been performed on mice that were anesthetized, which strongly altered brain activity when compared to awake brains.\nHere are some questions and answers about the observed patterns and their significance.\nWhat do these sustained patterns look like?\nThe researchers recorded the activities of individual neurons in the hippocampus, which is located in the lower center of the brain, with a robotic device called a\npatch clamp . It\u2019s a hollow glass needle one micron\u00a0in diameter that latches onto a single neuron via suction and measures its electrical activity.\nThe researchers observed electrical rumblings, symbolized here by a drumroll. And they observed spikes, symbolized here by a cymbal crash.\nThough the pattern of rumblings wasn\u2019t uniform, it rose and fell like a drumroll undulating between softer and louder volumes. Spikes occurred much more rarely than drumbeats, but with notable timing.\n\u201cThe spikes repeated in the same spots with high precision, so they weren\u2019t just random,\u201d Singer said. \u201cThey came around the peaks of rumblings, not always right on top of a peak but within a hair of it.\u201d\nIt would be like a cymbal crash hitting not every time, but every few times the undulating drumroll topped a volume peak. And the drumroll-cymbal-crash patterns sustained themselves for surprisingly long periods.\n\u201cThe time periods of activity that was structured like this were much longer than we expected,\u201d Singer said. \u201cPeople have shown sustained periods of signaling like this for 100 to 300 milliseconds before, but this appears to be the first time it\u2019s been seen for 900 milliseconds (nearly a full second), and it may go on even longer.\u201d\nWhat are neurons doing with these rumblings and spikes?\nWhen one neuron fires a spike, that electronic impulse hits neighboring neurons and influences the receiving neurons\u2019 rumblings until they fire spikes, too.\n\u201cA neuron receives these fast inputs. There are many different drumbeat patterns coming from many different neurons around it,\u201d Singer said. \u201cThe patterns we observed in one neuron were being driven by other neurons firing into it like a whole drum section with short little bursts.\u201d\nAt first sight, that may appear to be a cacophony, but if the jumbly patterns repeat, a consistent percussion of rumblings in the neuron may result.\nHow may this influence the way we picture neurons at work?\n\u201cI think people have thought about neuron firings as random then suddenly organized in a concerted kind of way,\u201d Singer said.\nThat could be pictured as many neurons behaving spastically until it was time to get to work, then abruptly firing as a group in near unison. This does appear to happen under the right circumstances, but as a prevailing picture of neuron firing, \u00a0it may be lacking something.\n\u201cWe\u2019re starting to see more structure, very complex structure in what was thought to be randomness,\u201d Singer said. \u201cThere is a lot of activity that is ongoing that is organized and that we need to understand, as well.\u201d\nThe researchers examined cells important for memory, but further research will be required to know what role the observed firing patterns may have in its function. The researchers are also working together with engineers at Georgia Tech to develop new robotic patch clamping devices that listen simultaneously to the firings of neurons connected to one another.\nAlso READ our feature on\u00a0neurology research: The Brain, Cosmos in the Cranium\nLike this article?\nGet our email newsletter here.\nThese researchers also collaborated on the study: Craig Forest, Ilya Kolb, and Michael Wang of Georgia Tech; Giovanni Talei Franzesi, and Edward S.
