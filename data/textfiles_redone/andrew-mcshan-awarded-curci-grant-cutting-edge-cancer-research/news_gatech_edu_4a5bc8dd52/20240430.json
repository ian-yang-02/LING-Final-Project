Since lipid antigens provide broad, more universal signatures than current techniques, the applications of the research span a wide range of cancers and immune disorders.\n\u201cIt's a really interesting new way of thinking about this problem,\u201d McShan says. \u201cWe hope that it's a paradigm shift in the way that we think about not only general immune system functions, but also the way that you can target cancer. This same protein system also works with pathogens and autoimmune disease\n\u2014\nit\u2019s an incredibly important system.\u201d\nA new paradigm\nPreviously, immunotherapy research has largely centered on developing treatments around targeting mutated peptides, because cancer often causes these\nmutated proteins.\nWhile peptide-based treatments have proven to be highly effective, the strategy isn\u2019t universal\n\u2014\ndifferent people present different peptide mutations to the immune system. \u201cYou would have to spend years developing an immunotherapy for just one person who has one type of cancer,\u201d McShan explains, \u201cand that therapy might not work for the next person.\u201d\nHowever, recent research indicates that lipids \u2014 fatty and waxy substances in the body that don't dissolve in water, like cholesterol \u2014 might provide a more effective avenue. \u201cLipid signals present more universal signatures to the immune system than peptides, and immune system responses to lipids are less dependent on the person,\u201d McShan says.\nResearch into lipid-based immunotherapies has historically been limited because lipids are notoriously difficult to study in the lab. However, new tools needed to study lipids have recently become available, opening the door to this groundbreaking research.\nBecause these tools are so new, though, \u201ca lot of the foundational basic research hasn\u2019t been completed yet,\u201d McShan says. \u201cThis grant is a two year grant, and we plan to do this foundational research. This research will provide what the scientific community needs to start thinking about how to move lipid antigens into a clinical area.\u201d\nUniversal treatments and the next generation of scientists\nWhile McShan\u2019s research team will focus on cancer for the Curci grant, lipid-based treatments could open the door for additional cost-effective, timely treatments\n\u2014\ntreatments that could also apply to multiple types of cancers, and to other diseases. \u201cIf we can understand these cancer lipid antigens \u2014 how they're functioning and what they\u2019re doing \u2014 there is a translation to the other applications in immunotherapy,\u201d McShan says.\n\u201cThe protein that we're studying, called CD1, plays roles in nearly every immunological response or disease,\u201d McShan adds. \u201cThis type of research could be important for responses to viral infection, bacteria and parasite pathogens, and autoimmune disease.\u201d\nLipids can aid in the development of new and improved vaccines. For example, a lipid-based tuberculosis vaccine has been shown to have the same efficacy as a tuberculosis vaccine made from a live attenuated bacterium. \u201cIf we were to discover new cancer lipids\n\u2014\nthese could potentially be used as prophylactic cancer vaccines,\u201d McShan says.\nAs a newer member of the Georgia Tech community, McShan is also already making an impact across the campus community. \u201cWe care a lot about making science accessible, and being equitable and inclusive,\u201d McShan, who joined the\nCollege of Sciences faculty in summer 2022 , says. \u201cOur lab is almost entirely women, and so the research that this grant is going to support is also going to support the next generation of women doing science amazing science \u2014 and that\u2019s something that gets me really excited.\u201d\nContact\nWritten by Selena Langner\nContact:\nJess Hunt-Ralston\nEmail\njess@cos.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
