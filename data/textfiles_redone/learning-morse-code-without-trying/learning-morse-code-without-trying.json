More like tapping it into the side.\nResearchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology have developed a system that teaches people Morse code within four hours using a series of vibrations felt near the ear. Participants wearing Google Glass learned it without paying attention to the signals \u2014they played games while feeling the taps and hearing the corresponding letters. After those few hours, they were 94 percent accurate keying a sentence that included every letter of the alphabet and 98 percent accurate writing codes for every letter.\nThis is the latest chapter of passive haptic learning (PHL) studies at Georgia Tech. The same method \u2014 using vibrations while participants aren\u2019t paying attention \u2014\nhas taught people braille ,\nhow to play the piano\nand\nimproved hand sensation for those with partial spinal cord injury.\nThe PHL projects are all led by Georgia Tech Professor Thad Starner and his Ph.D. student Caitlyn Seim. The team decided to use Glass for this study because it has both a built-in speaker and tapper (Glass\u2019s bone-conduction transducer).\nIn the study, participants played a game while feeling vibration taps between their temple and ear. The taps represented the dots and dashes of Morse code and passively \u201ctaught\u201d users through their tactile senses \u2014 even while they were distracted by the game.\nThe taps were created when researchers sent a very low-frequency signal to Glass\u2019s speaker system. At less than 15 Hz, the signal was below hearing range but, because it was played very slowly, the sound was felt as a vibration.\nHalf of the participants in the study felt the vibration taps and heads a voice prompt for each corresponding letter. The other half \u2014 the control group \u2014 felt no taps to help them learn.\nParticipants were tested throughout the study on their knowledge of Morse code and their ability to type it.\u00a0 After less than four hours of feeling every letter, everyone was challenged to type the alphabet in Morse code in a final test.\nThe control group was accurate only half the time.\u00a0 Those who felt the passive cues were nearly perfect.\nThe research was recently presented in Germany at the 20 th\nInternational Symposium on Wearable Computers.\n\u201cDoes this new study mean that people will rush out to learn Morse code? Probably not,\u201d said Starner. \u201cIt shows that PHL lowers the barrier to learn text-entry methods \u2014 something we need for smartwatches and any text-entry that doesn\u2019t require you to look at your device or keyboard.\u201d\nPrevious research on PHL used custom hardware to provide the tactile stimuli, but here researchers use an existing wearable device.\n\u201cThis research also shows that other common devices with an actuator could be used for passive haptic learning,\u201d he says. \u201cYour smartwatch, Bluetooth headset, fitness tracker or phone.\u201d\n\u201cIn our Braille and piano PHL studies, people felt vibrations on their fingers, then used their fingers for the task,\u201d said Seim. \u201cThis study was different and surprising. People were tapped on their heads, but the skill they learned was using their finger.\u201d\nSeim\u2019s next study will go a step further, investigating whether PHL can teach people how to type on the trusted QWERTY keyboard. That would mean several letters assigned to the same finger, rather than using only one finger like Morse code.\nThe work is supported in part by the National Science Foundation (Grant Number 1217473).
