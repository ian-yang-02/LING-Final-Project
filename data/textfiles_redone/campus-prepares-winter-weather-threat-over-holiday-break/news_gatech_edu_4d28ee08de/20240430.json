The forecast currently shows a high of 22 for Friday with a low of 10 before the temperature drops once again on Christmas Eve with a high of 27 and a low of 16. Christmas Day sees a slight increase with a high of 33, but with a low of 20, temperatures likely won\u2019t remain above freezing for long.\nStrong winds in the region could see wind chills fall below zero throughout the weekend. OEM Director Will Smith advises that Saturday morning will likely be the coldest period, with wind gusts up to 50 mph. High winds increase the possibility of downed power lines across the region, so OEM recommends that you build or replenish your emergency kit.\nGeorgia Governor Brian Kemp has\ndeclared a state of emergency\nahead of the drastic temperature shift. Chris Stallings, director of the Georgia Emergency Management Agency, emphasized the importance of preparation.\n\u201cThe state is ready. We\u2019re just challenging you now to make sure you\u2019re ready,\u201d Stallings said, stressing that your emergency kit should be built to last at least three days as high winds can create additional challenges for crews working to restore power.\nOEM notes that this weekend\u2019s temperatures could be \u201cup to 30 degrees below normal for this time of year,\u201d but does expect a rebound by the middle of the next week. If you\u2019re planning to be outdoors this weekend, be advised that extended time exposed to the elements carries a risk of hypothermia.\nThe brisk temperatures bring a heightened risk of broken pipes, especially with lower occupancy on campus during winter break. For students who haven\u2019t left yet, or those staying in Atlanta, be sure to leave the faucets of your home, apartment, or dorm room dripping to avoid pressure buildup.\nThursday\u2019s rain remains the only precipitation in the forecast, but due to the consistent freezing temperatures and potential runoff or broken water mains due to the extreme cold, ice may be a concern throughout the weekend both on the roadways and sidewalks. Smith explained that, even if snow flurries begin to fall, little to no accumulation is expected. OEM remains on alert and ready to respond to any hazardous conditions on campus.\nIf you notice anything on campus, call the\nGeorgia Tech Police Department\nat 404.894.2500 or report it through the\nLiveSafe app .\nIf slick conditions are present, stay off the roads if possible. If you must drive, do so with extreme caution. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration recommends that you slow down and leave additional space between yourself and other vehicles to allow for more time to stop and react to your surroundings.\nThe Georgia Department of Transportation has begun the process of pretreating roads and interstates to prevent Thursday\u2019s precipitation from freezing.\n\u201cAnytime we are talking about temperatures this low, we need to be on the lookout for black ice,\u201d Kemp said.\nBefore you leave, if your windshield is frozen, do not pour warm water over it, as the drastic temperature difference could cause the glass to crack.\nThe forecast can change at a moment\u2019s notice, so stay tuned to\n@gtpdalerts\nand\n@georgiatech\non Twitter and\nfacebook.com/gtemergency\nand\nacebook.com/georgiatech\nfor the latest updates.
