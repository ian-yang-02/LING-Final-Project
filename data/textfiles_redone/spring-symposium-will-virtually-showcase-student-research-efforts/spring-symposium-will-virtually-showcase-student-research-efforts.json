The five-hour event will be held Thursday, April 22, and it will feature a keynote address followed by oral and poster presentations and an awards ceremony. Last year\u2019s symposium was canceled because of Covid-19, but it\u2019s back this year in a virtual format that will mimic the bustling environment of an in-person event.\nThe application to participate is now open to undergraduate students, and applications are accepted on a first come, first-served basis. Applications close Friday, March 26. Students must fill out the application\npage , mark whether they want to present individually or with a team, and pick their presentation category. Lastly, students must enter a research abstract and information about their research advisor overseeing the project. Depending on the presentation category, accepted students will receive respective time slots and presentation details in mid-April.\nOral presentations will be held on BlueJeans and students will have specific time slots to present their research to the attendees, individually or with teammates. The research can be accompanied by a PowerPoint presentation or any other visual to address key points from the work being presented. As opposed to the oral presentation, the poster session will be hosted on\nGatherly,\na platform co-founded by Tech students. The poster session will have a marketplace-like environment where people can walk around the virtual rooms to ask questions about students\u2019 research.\nAfter the presentation session, the awards announcements will take place. The award categories highlight the top oral presenters, top poster presenters, Outstanding Undergraduate Researcher (OUR) from each college, and top presenters who have been enrolled or are currently enrolled in the Explore Living Learning Community. Utilizing another Tech student-founded platform,\nRocketJudge , faculty will have the opportunity to vote on the top presenters from each category. The OUR award is based on submissions from each college before the event takes place.\nThe symposium application will be open until March 26. Accepted applicants will have an opportunity to learn best practices for presenting their research from the Undergraduate Research Ambassadors (URA) at a workshop either Tuesday, April 13 at 11 a.m. (virtual session) or Thursday, April 15 at 11 a.m. (in-person session).\nTo register for a workshop, visit\nb.gatech.edu/2P290Im\nTo get more information or register for the symposium, visit\nsymposium.urop.gatech.edu\nAdditional Images\nContact\nVanesa Vargas\nInstitute Communications\nEmail\nstucomm@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
