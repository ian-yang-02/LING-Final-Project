Raphael Warnock hears from\u00a0GTRI Director Jim Hudgens and Deans\u00a0Charles Isbell and Raheem Beyah.\nJul 01, 2021\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nGeorgia U.S. Sen. Raphael Warnock visited Georgia Tech Research Institute (GTRI)\u2019s Cobb County Research Facility on Wednesday, June 30. His stop at GTRI was part of his statewide tour focused on Georgia\u2019s resources around infrastructure, defense, and research.\nGTRI Director Jim Hudgens kicked off the visit with an overview of GTRI and laid out of some of its state- focused initiatives including agricultural advancements, product development with industry partners, cybersecurity advancements, and job creation. Warnock was also able to get a firsthand look at GTRI\u2019s research during a tour of the labs, and Hudgens also highlighted Tech\u2019s work with the military and the intelligence communities.\n\u201cI was so glad to help secure support in the U.S. Innovation and Competition Act to make sure we're investing in our nation's research institutions like Georgia Tech, so we can continue innovating the solutions that our military needs to keep our national defense strong and protect our service members,\u201d said Warnock.\nSen. Warnock was also able to see the direct impact of GTRI research in a video highlighting a chicken-deboning robot, which has been designed to vastly improve efficiency at Georgia poultry factories. The innovation has the potential to save the poultry industry millions of dollars by reducing costs and waste.\nIn addition to the focus on GTRI, Sen. Warnock heard from the deans of Georgia Tech\u2019s Colleges of Computing and Engineering, Charles Isbell and Raheem Beyah. Both Isbell and Beyah gave insight into Tech\u2019s rankings and pathway programs, as well as the Institute\u2019s partnerships and academic offerings. Dean Beyah spotlighted the entrepreneurial efforts at Tech by touting CREATE-X. He also shared the ongoing efforts to strengthen and expand Georgia Tech\u2019s dual degree program with the Atlanta University Center\u00a0Consortium. Dean Isbell shared enrollment superlatives for the nation\u2019s first accredited Master of Science in Computer Science earned exclusively online: Georgia Tech\u2019s OMSCS program. Sen. Warnock was also intrigued by Dean Isbell\u2019s overview of the mission of the Constellations Center for Equity in Computing to expand computer science education in Atlanta.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nAyana Isles\nInstitute Communications aisles3@gatech.edu\nEmail\naisles3@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
