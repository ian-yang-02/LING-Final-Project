In fact, the latest science literature finds that 7% of U.S. adults, and between 10 and 20% of people in developed countries, suffer from dermatitis, a common skin inflammatory condition that causes itching.\n\u201cItch is a significant clinical problem, often caused by underlying medical conditions in the skin, liver, or kidney. Due to our limited understanding of itch mechanisms, we don\u2019t have effective treatment for the majority of patients,\u201d said\nLiang Han , an assistant professor in the Georgia Institute of Technology\u2019s\u00a0 School of Biological Sciences \u00a0who is also a researcher in the\u00a0 Parker H. Petit Institute for Bioengineering and Bioscience .\nUntil recently, neuroscientists considered the mechanisms of skin itch the same. But Han and her research team recently uncovered differences in itch in non-hairy versus hairy areas of the skin, opening new areas for research. Their research, published April 13 in the journal PNAS (Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America), could open new, more effective treatments for patients suffering from persistent skin itching.\nItch Origins More Than Skin Deep\nAccording to researchers, there are two different types of stimuli from the nervous system that trigger the itch sensation through sensory nerves in the skin: chemical and mechanical. In their study, Han and her team identified a specific neuron population that controls itching in \u2018glabrous\u2019 skin -- the smoother, tougher skin that\u2019s found on the palms of hands and feet soles.\nItching in those areas poses greater difficulty for sufferers and is surprisingly common. In the U.S., there are an estimated 200,000 cases a year of dyshidrosis, a skin condition causing itchy blisters to develop only on the palm and soles. Another chronic skin condition, palmoplantar pustulosis (a type of psoriasis that causes inflamed, scaly skin and intense itch on the palms and soles), affects as many as 1.6 million people in the U.S. each year.\n\u201cThat\u2019s actually one of the most debilitating places (to get an itch),\u201d said first author Haley R. Steele, a graduate student in the School of Biological Sciences. \u201cIf your hands are itchy, it\u2019s hard to grasp things, and if it\u2019s your feet, it can be hard to walk. If there\u2019s an itch on your arm, you can still type. You\u2019ll be distracted, but you\u2019ll be OK. But if it\u2019s your hands and feet, it\u2019s harder to do everyday things.\u201d\nAbility to Block, Activate Itch-causing Neurons in Lab Mice\nSince many biological mechanisms underlying itch \u2014 such as receptors and nerve pathways \u2014 are similar in mice and people, most itch studies rely on mice testing. Using mice in their lab, Georgia Tech researchers were able to activate or block these neurons.\nThe research shows, for the first time, \u201cthe actual neurons that send itch are different populations. Neurons that are in hairy skin that do not sense itch in glabrous skins are one population, and another senses itch in glabrous skins.\u201d\nWhy has an explanation so far eluded science? \u201cI think one reason is because most of the people in the field kind of assumed it was the same mechanism that\u2019s controlling the sensation. It\u2019s technically challenging. It\u2019s more difficult than working on hairy skin,\u201d Han said.\nTo overcome this technical hurdle, the team used a new investigative procedure, or assay, modeled after human allergic contact dermatitis, Steele said.\nThe previous method would have involved injecting itch-causing chemicals into mice skin, but most of a mouse\u2019s skin is covered with hair. The team had to focus on the smooth glabrous skin on tiny mice hands and feet. Using genetically modified mice also helped identify the right sensory neurons responsible for glabrous skin itches.\n\u201cWe activated a particular set of neurons that causes itch, and we saw that biting behavior again modeled,\u201d said Steele, referring to how mice usually deal with itchy skin.\nOne set of study mice was given a chemical to specifically kill an entire line of neurons. Focusing on three previously known neuron mechanisms related to itch sensation found in hairy skin, they found that two of the neurons, MrgprA3+\u00a0and\u00a0MrgprD+, did not play important roles in non-hairy skin itch, but the third neuron, MrgprC11+,\u00a0did. Removing it reduced both acute and chronic itching in the soles and palms of test mice.\nPotential to Drive New Treatments for Chronic Itch\nHan\u2019s team hopes that the research leads to treatments that will turn off those itch-inducing neurons, perhaps by blocking them in human skin.\n\u201cTo date, most treatments for skin itch do not discriminate between hairy and glabrous skin except for potential medication potency due to the increased skin thickness in glabrous skin,\u201d observed Ron Feldman, assistant professor in the Department of Dermatology in the Emory University School of Medicine. Georgia Tech\u2019s findings \u201cprovide a rationale for developing therapies targeting chronic itching of the hands and feet that, if left untreated, can greatly affect patient quality of life,\u201d he concluded.\nWhat\u2019s next for Han and her team? \u201cWe would like to investigate how these neurons transmit information to the spinal cord and brain,\u201d said Han, who also wants to investigate the mechanisms of chronic itch conditions that mainly affect glabrous skin such as cholestatic itch, or itch due to reduced or blocked bile flow often seen in liver and biliary system diseases.\n\u201cI joined this lab because I love working with Liang Han,\u201d added Steele, who selected glabrous skin itch research for her Ph.D. \u201cbecause it was the most technically challenging and had the greatest potential for being really interesting and significant to the field.\u201d\nThis work was supported by grants from the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NS087088 and HL141269) and the Pfizer Aspire Dermatology Award to Liang Han.\nCITATION : H.
