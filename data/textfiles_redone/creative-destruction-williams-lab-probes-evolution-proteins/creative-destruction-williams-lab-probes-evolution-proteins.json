And now, researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology are applying a 20 th -century theoretical concept to study how proteins evolve, and it might lead to the answer of one of humanity\u2019s oldest questions: How did we become us?\nInside a typical human cell are tens of thousands of proteins. We need so many because proteins are the skilled laborers of the cell with each one performing a specific job. Some lend firmness to muscle cells or neurons. Others bind to specific, targeted molecules, ferrying them to new locations. And there are others that activate the process of cell division and growth.\nA protein\u2019s specific function depends on its shape, and to achieve its functional shape \u2013 it\u2019s native state \u2013 a protein folds.\u00a0 A protein begins its life as a long chain of amino acids, called a polypeptide. The sequence of amino acids determines how the protein chain will fold and form a complex, 3D structure that allow the protein to perform an intended task.\nIn the\nlab of Loren Williams , researchers are using \u201ccreative destruction\u201d as a model for protein fold evolution and innovation. The term, coined by Austrian economist and political scientist Joseph Schumpeter in the 1940s, describes the deliberate dismantling of an established thing, like the wired telephone, to develop a new thing, like the smart phone.\n\u201cWe have protein structures that have evolved over almost four billion years, and we don\u2019t really understand where they came from or how they came to be what they are,\u201d said Claudia Alvarez-Carre\u00f1o, a postdoctoral researcher in the Williams lab, which is called the\nCenter for the Origin of Life, or COOL.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very complex process forming these structures, and there are many hypotheses on how they could have emerged in early evolution.\u201d\nOut with the Old, In with the New\nAlvarez-Carre\u00f1o is the lead author of the paper,\n\u201cCreative Destruction: New Protein Folds from Old,\u201d\npublished recently in the journal\nProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , or\nPNAS . She and her co-authors (Williams, Rohan Gupta, and Anton Petrov) excavated the deepest evolutionary history found within the translation machinery \u2013 which resides within all cells in the ribosome and is the birthplace of all proteins.\nThe researchers provide evidence supporting the common origins of some of the simplest, oldest, and most common protein folds. It suggests a form of creative destruction at work, explaining how simple protein folds spawn more complex folds.\nThey discovered that once a protein can fold and achieve its 3D structure, when it is combined with another protein which has folded into a different 3D structure, that combination can easily become a new structure. \u201cSo maybe it\u2019s not as difficult as we thought to go from one structure to another,\u201d said Williams, professor in the\nSchool of Chemistry and Biochemistry . \u201cAnd maybe this can explain the diversity of protein structures that we see today.\u201d\nIn Schumpter\u2019s creative destruction model, developing \u201cdaughter products\u201d involves the destruction of ancestral products. \u201cDaughter products can inherit features of ancestors but can in essence be different from them,\u201d they write in the paper. In the smart phone example ancestral wired phones, computers, cameras, global positioning, and other technologies that are merged to create a daughter, i.e. the smart phone.\nThe daughter inherits many features of the ancestors. These features, which interact in specific ways in the daughter, create new functional niches that were not accessible, or even possible, in the ancestors.\n\u201cSo, the creative destruction of protein folds might account for a lot of the diversity we see,\u201d Williams said.\nMolecular Mergers\nEver since the simplest and most ancient protein folds emerged on Earth billions of years ago, the number of folds has expanded to form the universe of protein function we see in modern biology.\nBut the origins of protein folds and the evolutionary mechanisms at play pose central questions in biology that Williams and his team considered. For instance, how did protein folds arise, and what led to the diverse set of protein folds in contemporary biological systems, and why did nearly four billion years of fold evolution produce fewer than 2,000 distinct folds?\nThe researchers believe that creative destruction can be generalized to explain a lot of this.\nIn creative destruction, they explain, one open reading frame \u2013 the span of DNA sequence that encodes a protein \u00a0\u2013 merges with another to produce a fused polypeptide. The merger forces these two ancestors into a new structure. The resulting polypeptide can achieve a form that was inaccessible to either of the independent ancestors, before the merger. But these new folds are not totally independent of the old. That is, a daughter fold inherits some things from the ancestral fold.\nThis, broadly speaking, is what Williams and his team observed, and they think their creative destruction model has some application in studying disease \u2013 proteins that fold improperly can impact the health of the cells and the human comprised of those cells.\n\u201cFor example, we think this process is important in the biology of cancer \u2013 there are many, many proteins that have fused and, we believe have refolded, in cancers,\u201d said Williams. \u201cAnd there\u2019s the world of protein aggregation diseases, like Parkinson\u2019s or Alzheimers, and proteins that have not folded correctly, or have refolded.\u201d\nBut right now, Williams and his team are most interested in how their creative destruction model helps them understand some of the deepest questions of our evolution.\n\u201cLike, where did we come from,\u201d Williams said. \u201cCreative destruction could help us understand where the proteins in our body came and how we came to be what we are.\u201d\nCITATION:\nClaudia Alvarez-Carre\u00f1o, Rohan J.
