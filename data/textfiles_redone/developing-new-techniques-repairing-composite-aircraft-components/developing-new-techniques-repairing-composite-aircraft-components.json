While composite parts have been used for decades, today as much as half of all airplane components can be made of composites, including major structures such as wings and the fuselage.\nFor airlines, the shift to composites creates an opportunity to rethink the repair and maintenance operations needed to keep jets in top form. Although the first of Delta\u2019s new jets won\u2019t enter service until fall 2017, the airline is already searching for better ways to maintain and repair composite aircraft parts \u2014 which are very different from the metal parts it has been maintaining for years\nThe airline is partnering with Georgia Tech to take a close look at current methods used to repair composite parts and identify ways to increase efficiency and bring down costs.\n\u201cAirlines want to create their own know-how on how to fix these structures because it\u2019s cheaper and probably faster,\u201d said Chuck Zhang, a professor in the Stewart School of Industrial and Systems Engineering. \u201cBut improved technologies are needed to help in the repair of composite parts. Much of it today is done by hand.\u201d\nRead the complete article\nin Research Horizons magazine\nAdditional Images\nContact\nJosh\u00a0Brown\nResearch News\n404-385-0500\nEmail\njosh.brown@comm.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
