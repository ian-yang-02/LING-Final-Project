The way the organization accomplishes this goal is constantly expanding, and a new service grant is a big step forward. Any student or organization at Georgia Tech that has an idea related to community service can apply for funds. Often, smaller organizations can have difficulty raising funds, and MOVE wants to help eliminate this hurdle.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have a restriction on the type of event, as long as it can bring the Tech or Atlanta community together,\u201d Lu said. This means that anyone can have access to the grant as long as they have an actionable plan. MOVE has a committee that reviews all applications on a rolling basis. As long as a person applies at least three weeks in advance of the proposed project, they are eligible to be considered for funding.\n\u201cPeople want to be involved in volunteering and service, but they don\u2019t always have the time and resources,\u201d said Lu. MOVE does not want this to be a concern for people. No idea is too small \u2014 whether it involves picking up trash or spreading positivity, MOVE believes that the Tech community and greater Atlanta area benefit when people try to make a difference through service.\nThe online application is brief. On\nEngage,\nstudent organizations navigate to the Manage Organization page, then to Finances, where they create a request. After choosing a budget request, MOVE\u2019s service grant can be selected. For individual students, after going to their user profile and choosing Submissions, they can go to the Budgeting page, choose Create a Request, and choose the MOVE grant.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nConnor White\nInstitute Communications\nEmail\nstucomm@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
