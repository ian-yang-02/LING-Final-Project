As Bond stated in his lecture, \u201cThere needs to be a constantly growing and reviving activist, progressive movement across America if we are to maintain and expand the victories we\u2019ve won. Sometimes the simplest of acts\u2014sitting at a lunch counter, going to a new school, and applying for a marriage license\u2014can challenge the way we think and act.\u201d To view his lecture at Georgia Tech earlier this year, please visit\nhttps://youtu.be/mz7jAl51ss0 .\nAdditional Images\nContact\nAnnette Filliat Communications Manager Institute Diversity annette.filliat@gatech.edu\nEmail\nannette.filliat@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
