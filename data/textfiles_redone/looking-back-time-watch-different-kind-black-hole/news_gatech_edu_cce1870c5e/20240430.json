Astronomers theorize that massive black holes could also form at the birth of a galaxy, but so far nobody has been able to look far enough back in time to observe the conditions creating these direct collapse black holes (DCBH).\nThe James Webb Space Telescope, scheduled for launch in 2021, might be able look far enough back into the early Universe to see a galaxy hosting a nascent massive black hole. Now, a simulation done by researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology has suggested what astronomers should look for if they search the skies for a DCBH in its early stages.\nThe first-of-its-kind simulation, reported September 10 in the journal Nature Astronomy, suggests that direct formation of these black holes would be accompanied by specific kinds of intense radiation, including X-rays and ultraviolet emission that would shift to infrared by the time they reach the telescope. The black holes would also likely spawn massive metal-free stars, a finding that was unexpected.\nThe research was supported by NASA, the Los Alamos National Laboratory, the National Science Foundation, the Southern Regional Education Board and two Hubble theory grants.\n\u201cThere are supermassive black holes at the center of many large galaxies, but we haven\u2019t been able to observe the way they form or how they got that large,\u201d said Kirk S. S. Barrow, the paper\u2019s first author and a recent Ph.D. graduate of Georgia Tech\u2019s School of Physics. \u201cScientists have theorized that these supermassive black holes could have formed at the birth of a galaxy, and we wanted to turn these theoretical predictions into observational predictions that could be seen by the James Webb Space Telescope.\u201d\nDCBH formation would be initiated by the collapse of a large cloud of gas during the early formation of a galaxy, said\nJohn H. Wise , a professor in Georgia Tech\u2019s\nSchool of Physics\nand the Center for Relativistic Astrophysics. But before astronomers could hope to catch this formation, they would have to know what to look for in the spectra that the telescope could detect, which is principally infrared.\nThe formation of a black hole could require a million years or so, but to envision what that might have looked like, former postdoctoral researcher Aycin Aykutalp \u2013 now at Los Alamos National Laboratory \u2013 used the National Science Foundation-supported Stampede Supercomputer at the University of Texas at Austin to run a simulation focusing on the aftermath of DCBH formation. The simulation used physics first principles such as gravity, radiation and hydrodynamics.\n\u201cIf the galaxy forms first and then the black hole forms in the center, that would have one type of signature,\u201d said Wise, who is the Dunn Family Associate Professor in the School of Physics. \u201cIf the black hole formed first, would that have a different signature? We wanted to find out whether there would be any physical differences, and if so, whether that would translate into differences we could observe with the James Webb Space Telescope.\u201d\nThe simulations provided information such as densities and temperatures, and Barrow converted that data into predictions for what might be observed through the telescope \u2013 the light likely to be observed and how it would affected by gas and dust it would have encountered on its long journey to Earth. \u201cAt the end, we had something that an observer could hopefully see,\u201d Barrow said.\nBlack holes take about a million years to form, a blip in galactic time. In the DCBH simulation, that first step involves gas collapsing into a supermassive star as much as 100,000 times more massive than our sun. The star then undergoes gravitational instability and collapses into itself to form a massive black hole. Radiation from the black hole then triggers the formation of stars over period of about 500,000 years, the simulation suggested.\n\u201cThe stars of this first generation are usually much more massive, so they live for a shorter period of time,\u201d Wise said. \u201cIn the first five to six million years after their formation, they die and go supernova. That\u2019s another one of the signatures that we report in this study.\u201d\nAfter the supernovae form, the black hole quiets down but creates a struggle between electromagnetic emissions \u2013 ultraviolet light and X-rays trying to escape \u2013 and the black hole\u2019s own gravity. \u201cThese cycles go on for another 20 or 30 million years,\u201d Wise said.\nBlack holes are relatively common in the universe, so the hope is that with enough snapshots, astronomers could catch one being born, and that could lead to a new understanding of how galaxies evolve over time.\nStar formation around the DCBH was unexpected, but in hindsight, it makes sense, Barrow said. The ionization produced by the black holes would produce photochemical reactions able to trigger the formation of the stars. Metal-free stars tend to be larger than others because the absence of a metal such as iron prevents fragmentation. But because they are so large, these stars produce tremendous amounts of radiation and end their lives in supernovae, he said.\n\u201cThis is one of the last great mysteries of the early universe,\u201d Barrow said. \u201cWe hope this study provides a good step toward figuring out how these supermassive black holes formed at the birth of a galaxy.\u201d\nThis research was supported by a Southern Regional Education Board doctoral fellowship, a LANL LDRD Exploratory Research Grant 20170317ER, National Science Foundation (NSF) grants AST-1333360 and AST-1614333, Hubble theory grants HST-AR-13895 and HST-AR-14326, and NASA grant NNX-17AG23G.\u00a0Any opinions, findings, and conclusions or recommendations expressed in this material are those of the authors\u00a0and do not necessarily reflect the views of the sponsoring organizations.\nCITATION : Kirk S.
