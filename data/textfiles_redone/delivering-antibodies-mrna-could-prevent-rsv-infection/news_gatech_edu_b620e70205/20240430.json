It\u2019s usually not a big deal if they\u2019re healthy, but every year in the U.S. some 57,000 children under the age of five are hospitalized with the infection. To make matters worse, there\u2019s no vaccine and a medication sometimes used to prevent RSV in high-risk children isn\u2019t always effective. Now researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology have developed a promising method of delivering antibodies directly to the lungs, improving their efficacy in warding off RSV.\nIt was a natural outgrowth of research in his lab, said\nPhilip Santangelo , associate professor in the\nWallace H. Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering\nat Georgia Tech and Emory University. That research focused on using RNA to deliver therapeutic antibodies, as well as with the basic virology of RSV. Combining the two was \u201ca logical choice,\u201d said Santangelo.\nOne of the medications used to treat or prevent RSV, the monoclonal antibody palivizumab, is given monthly via intramuscular (IM) injection. Only a small amount of the antibody gets into the airways. \u201cRSV tends to infect airway epithelial cells, as does flu,\u201d said Santangelo. \u201cWe really didn\u2019t see palivizumab there in large quantities. So we thought that was an opportunity.\u201d\nIn a\nstudy published October 1 in Nature Communications , Santangelo\u2019s team reported using synthetic messenger RNA (mRNA) to deliver antibodies directly to the lungs of mice via aerosol, which the study showed protected them from RSV infection.\u00a0\u00a0Two forms of palivizumab were used, the whole secreted form (sPali) and one that was engineered with a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) membrane anchor or linker (aPali), which should allow it to stay on the epithelial surface longer.\nAnother group of mice were treated with a different antibody \u2013 a VHH camelid antibody, also in secreted and anchored forms \u2013 that was previously shown to be more potent than palivizumab but is not currently used to treat RSV.\n\u201cWith palivizumab, that may or may not be as critical \u2013 we noticed that even with the secreted version we were able to block the virus reasonably well,\u201d said Santangelo. \u201cBut single-chain antibodies, which are very small, have short half-lives. You have to give them frequently, which doesn\u2019t seem practical. When we put this linker on the smaller antibody, we were able to see it on the epithelial cells 28 days later. That was really exciting to us.\u201d\nIn fact, Santangelo suspects that using the linker could cause smaller antibodies to persist for a few months, reducing the need for frequent treatments. \u201cYou could see administering this right after a child is born, when they are most vulnerable,\u201d he said.\nUsing mRNA is an effective and safe delivery option, especially crucial in a pediatric population. \u201cUsing a transient, nucleic acid-based method that doesn\u2019t end up in the cell nucleus is really important,\u201d said Santangelo, whose study was funded by a Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) grant and Children\u2019s Healthcare of Atlanta. \u201cWe do want this to be transient, so if it lasted even a month that would protect newborns in the hospital where they may be exposed to RSV. And if you could protect kids for a few months at a time, that\u2019s really all you would need to do.\u201d\nThe study found that most of the mRNA-expressed antibodies did not change baseline levels of cytokines, indicating that the approach was minimally inflammatory and suggesting that repeat dosing could be considered.\nIt\u2019s also possible that the antibodies used in this study could potentially neutralize the virus in cells, so even if a child was infected the severity of symptoms might be lessened. And RSV isn\u2019t the only potential virus this method could target \u2013 Santangelo is currently working on a project that targets flu via dry powder delivery of mRNA. That project is supported by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.\nWith the promising results from the RSV study, Santangelo hopes to move from a mouse model to additional testing. \u201cThere\u2019s more work to be done,\u201d he said. \u201cThe use of antibodies for preventing infection is a huge deal right now. But even if you found this potent antibody, if you can\u2019t deliver it where it needs to go then the efficacy may not be where you want it to be. At least with the lung, we know where we want to go, and IV or IM administration isn\u2019t really ideal for the cell types that are most critical for RSV.\u201d\nThe study was co-authored by these researchers: Pooja Munnilal Tiwari, Daryll Vanover, Kevin E.
