She is pictured at her last home football game with her boyfriend, Ben Goldenthal.\nMay 06, 2021\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nAs staff members in Institute Communications, Grace Wyner and Steven Norris are usually the ones asking questions. But now the tables have been turned. Wyner, a student worker, and Norris, director of Media Relations and Social Media, are in the spotlight as they earn Tech degrees.\nWyner is graduating with a bachelor\u2019s degree in literature, media, and communication with a minor in public policy. She has been a writer in Institute Communications since January 2019, covering campus events for the\nDaily Digest\nand\nThe Whistle.\n\u201cI never anticipated a student job would be like this,\u201d Wyner said. \u201cI was very connected to everything that was happening on campus. And I got to express it in different ways, either through writing a story or just entering an event into the campus calendar.\u201d\nWyner said that at times she felt like she was an encyclopedia of campus news and upcoming events. She also gained insights into what makes people tick.\n\u201cI realized how much people like to talk about what they\u2019re doing and how willing they are to talk about something that they enjoy and want to share with other people,\u201d she said. \u201cIf they\u2019re passionate about it, it comes shining through.\u201d\nLast year the pandemic shaped Wyner\u2019s outlook on life.\n\u201cI went through a lot of \u2018lasts\u2019 without realizing they were my lasts \u2014 looking at you, game days,\u201d said Wyner, who played trombone in the Georgia Tech Yellow Jacket Marching Band. \u201cI had just joined the campus band sorority, Tau Beta Sigma, when Covid-19 hit, and I took on a committee chair role in the SGA in the fall. It\u2019s been hard to push aside the \u2018You\u2019ll never get the true experience\u2019 thoughts. On the bright side, I realized just how nice exercise endorphins are and I am now in what\u2019s arguably the best shape of my life.\u201d She played basketball at home and worked out at the Campus Recreation Center.\nThe pandemic also changed Wyner\u2019s job as a writer and affected her internship plans.\n\u201cFor a while there weren\u2019t any campus events or really anything to write about, but everything started to pick up again,\u201d she recalled. Her summer internship was canceled because of Covid-19.\n\u201cI\u2019m taking my internship again this summer, to give myself a little more time to find a job,\u201d she said. She will work online from Atlanta for Global Strategy Group, a public affairs firm in Washington, D.C. Ultimately she would like to work in public affairs or maybe for a political campaign.\nTo celebrate her graduation, Wyner will be joined by her parents, her grandfather and his significant other, her boyfriend, and her brother, who is graduating from high school this month.\nCommencement Live and More\nSteven Norris is a familiar face and voice on Georgia Tech\u2019s social media channels. He came to Georgia Tech in December 2012 as director of social media, to start the Institute\u2019s official social media program. He was recently promoted to director of media relations and social media.\n\u201cI get to tell the stories of Georgia Tech through media outlets such as CNN and\nThe Wall Street Journal . And through social media I help prospective students learn about the Institute and remind our alumni of why they came here,\u201d Norris said.\nHe and the social media team often host live chats on Facebook during key events such as Homecoming, move-in day, and New Student Convocation. He was an integral member of the team that created \u201cCommencement Live,\u201d a pre-Commencement show that combines video stories with live interviews of the graduates.\n\u201cCommencement is special,\u201d he said. \u201cBefore the ceremony there is a captive audience of family and friends anxiously waiting for \u2018Pomp and Circumstance\u2019 to play.\u201d Norris and his colleagues introduced \u201cCommencement Live\u201d to entertain and inform the audience and to celebrate the graduates.\nThis year he will pull double duty at Commencement. In addition to working, he is also marching in the ceremony because he is earning a master\u2019s degree in global media and culture.\n\u201cI am so lucky to be in the first cohort of students in the program,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a blend of media studies and foreign language. I was drawn to the program because I grew up reading atlases and almanacs. I\u2019m a bit of a nerd, so I gravitated toward this.\u201d\nTo get accepted into the program Norris needed to speak another language.\n\u201cI started taking French courses after work,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know any French. But I had to get to a point where I could take master\u2019s level classes completely in French.\u201d In three months he was ready to interview for the program, in French.\nFor his class project he planned to give a presentation at the University of Sydney. But Covid-19 canceled his travel plans, so he decided to create a documentary instead. He directed, produced, and edited an hour-long\ndocumentary on the Eurovision Song Contest , the world\u2019s most-watched live music event, exploring the possibility of the contest expanding to the United States.\nNorris, who has a bachelor\u2019s degree in broadcasting and international relations, worked at television stations in Birmingham, Mobile, and New Orleans before coming to Tech. The graduate program has brought him back to his love of combining media and international relations.\n\u201cI have been working with the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), helping them develop media kits,\u201d he said. \u201cI am working in-depth with media analysis and media theory. All of these experiences make me a better employee at Georgia Tech.\u201d\nNorris said his educational journey is, in part, inspired by the memory of his father who died in 2018.\n\u201cI remember him studying late at night to earn his master\u2019s. I remember him typing his papers on a typewriter,\u201d he said. \u201cOne of the things he was most proud of was getting his master\u2019s. That inspires me.\u201d\nNorris will be joined at Commencement by his mom, his stepdad, his two brothers, his sister, and his partner, Matt.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nVictor Rogers\nInstitute Communications\nEmail\nvictor.rogers@comm.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
