They looked into what things are dangerous and they've banned everything that\u2019s unsafe. And that means for anything else we might want to do with our phone while driving, we're good to go.' But that's just not true scientifically speaking,\u201d said Robert Rosenberger, a professor in the Georgia Tech\nSchool of Public Policy , a unit of the\nIvan Allen College of Liberal Arts .\nThose distracting behaviors that remain legal include hands-free calling and messaging, as well as interacting with the colorful in-dash infotainment systems increasingly common in new cars.\nThe law , which goes into effect July 1, replaces the state\u2019s ban on texting while driving with a complete prohibition on holding or cradling a cell phone or other electronic device while on the road. It also limits other behaviors, such as sending or reading text-based communications, video chatting while driving or wearing headphones to listen to music.\nWith the new legislation, Georgia becomes the 17 th\nstate to\nban handheld phone use , according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.\nWhile Rosenberger said such laws undoubtedly save lives, they also ignore the large and growing body of evidence that hands-free phone use is just as dangerous as fiddling with your phone.\nWhy is that?\nRosenberger , a philosopher who studies our engagement with technology, says there is something about the experience of talking on the phone \u2014 any phone \u2014 that makes us pay less attention to what\u2019s happening around us.\n\u201cWhen you're in a room by yourself, and you're using the phone, your mind is on the conversation, right? You might have a whole bunch of things on your wall in front of you, a bookcase, or pictures or knickknacks; you're not looking at those, right? Even though your eyes are open, and you're looking forward, your mind is on the conversation. And we do that every time we're on the phone.\u201d he said.\n\u201cThe reason we're so bad at driving while using the phone is that those habits kick in,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen the driving gets boring, and the phone conversation gets interesting, our mind can drift into this place where we're thinking about the phone call rather than processing the visual information in front of us.\u201d\nConversations with passengers tend to be less distracting because they ebb and flow with what\u2019s going on around the car, helping the driver disengage from the passenger and focus on the road when conditions warrant, Rosenberger said.\nSo what\u2019s a tech-addled driver surrounded by flashing, beeping, whirring gadgets to do?\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to get out of the mindset that our time behind the wheel is a good chance to get some calls made for work, check our messages, or catch up with friends. We need to treat driving like we\u2019ve got other people\u2019s lives in our hands, because we do.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nArguments Against Cell Phone Driver Distraction\nYes, Smartphone Use Is Probably Behind the Spike in Driving Deaths.
