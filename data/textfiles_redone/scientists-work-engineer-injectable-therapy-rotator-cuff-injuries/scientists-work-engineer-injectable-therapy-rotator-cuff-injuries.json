But a new technology under development may stop this shoulder injury from becoming so severe that surgery is required. \u00a0A research team is attempting to engineer an injectable therapy for the shoulder\u2019s supraspinatus tendon, a rotator cuff tendon that is commonly torn in sports. When the tendon is damaged, the body makes things worse by activating enzymes that further break down the tendon. The scientists hope to develop an injectable compound that would deliver an inhibitor capable of blocking these enzymes, thereby reducing the severity of the injury or even healing the tissue. \u201cNormally people focus on treating tendon injuries after the tear has occurred, but we\u2019re focusing on a much earlier stage in the disease,\u201d said Johnna Temenoff, an associate professor in the Wallace H. Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering at Georgia Tech and Emory University. \u201cThis is the first time that an injectable therapy specifically designed to interact with tissue at an early disease state has been attempted for this particular tendon injury.\u201d Temenoff\u2019s work is supported by a $1 million grant from the\nNational Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS)\nfor five years of research, which began in September 2013. Collaborating on the research is Manu Platt, an assistant professor in the same department. Temenoff\u2019s previous work on tendon injuries, which focused on quarterbacks in football, was sponsored by the NFL Charities. Shoulder tendon injuries are common overuse injuries for athletes and also for industrial workers whose repetitive overhead motion put them at risk. The rotator cuff is a collation of four tendons, and the tendons are made of collagen. Overuse of the tendons damages the collagen, and people feel stiff and sore in their shoulders as the area becomes weaker. Once a tendon is damaged, the body accelerates the damage by activating enzymes that eat at the tendon, worsening the condition over time. \u201cThe interesting thing about this disease is that we don\u2019t know exactly what causes it,\u201d Temenoff said. \u201cWe\u2019re studying enzymes that are known to chew up the collagen, and we\u2019re looking at then delivering inhibitors to those enzymes in a local injection in the tendon to try to stop the degradation.\u201d In their research, the team will use an animal model to characterize when these collagen-destroying enzymes are the most active. This will give researchers a good idea of when to inject inhibitors. So that patients won\u2019t need multiple shots, the scientists are working on a drug delivery material that will release the inhibitors over time once inside the body. One idea is to control the interactions between the inhibitors and small amounts of the blood thinner heparin. The team will also study the histology and mechanics of the tendons after healing. Temenoff said that the injectable therapy could, in theory, work on other kinds of tendon injuries, not just in the shoulder. \u201cWe\u2019re studying the disease in the shoulder, but it\u2019s the same disease that causes tennis elbow, Achilles injuries, and jumper\u2019s knee,\u201d Temenoff said. \u201cIt\u2019s the same process, just in different tendons in the body.\u201d This research is supported by the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS) under award1R01AR063692-01A1 .\nAny conclusions or opinions are those of the authors and do not necessarily represent the official views of NIAMS.\nResearch News\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\n177 North Avenue\nAtlanta, Georgia\u00a0 30332-0181\u00a0 USA Media Relations Contacts : Brett Israel (404-385-1933) ( brett.israel@comm.gatech.edu ) or John Toon (404-894-6986) ( jtoon@gatech.edu ) Writer : Brett Israel\nAdditional Images\nContact\nBrett Israel 404-385-1933 brett.israel@comm.gatech.edu\nEmail\nbrett.israel@comm.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
