This could make them available to many industries that have not been able to feasibly use them before.\nIn manufacturing, electrochromic films are often coated onto other materials, such as the surface of a mirror, as inks. They are usually based in solvents that are flammable and have toxic fumes, making them unsuitable for many work settings that rely on printing and spraying machinery to apply colors.\nGeorgia Tech researchers have developed electrochromic film inks that are water-based, making them safer for diffuse application in settings where the kinds of safety precautions and protective equipment that are standard in handling volatile organic chemicals would be impractical.\nEveryday environments\n\u201cWhere people print is not always in chemically safe environments,\u201d said\nJohn Reynolds,\na professor in Georgia Tech\u2019s\nSchools of Chemistry and Biochemistry\nand\nMaterial Science and Engineering . So Reynolds and the study\u2019s first author Brian Schmatz, who came up with the water-based method, set out to make electrochromic film inks safer for everyday environments.\nThere were some hurdles to pulling it off. The finished product had to electrically operate comparable to films that are applied in an organic solvent, and also be water-resistant in spite of the water-based production. Schmatz\u2019s method also needed to be logistically and financially realistic for producers to implement.\nThe researchers published details on their solution and how it has met the criteria\nin the journal\nACS Central Science\non August 16, 2017.\nShould the chemical process progress to production, the future may see more windows, prescription glasses, or even textiles\nthat switch between colors and shades of darkness with the click of a button\nor with the help of a light-detecting switch.\nThat\u2019s how many self-dimming rear-view mirrors work: The high-beams of the motorist behind you hit a light sensor that applies a mild electric field to the mirror, and that activates the color-changing, or electrochromic, film, which switches to a darker tint.\nElectrochemical rainbow\nThe Reynolds lab\u2019s electrochromic films are made with\nconjugated polymers , colorful and electroactive organic molecules. They easily let go of a few of their more loosely attached electrons, and when they do, their colors shift.\nIf the colored films are on a clear surface, when the color vanishes, the surface becomes clear. The surface has to be conductive so that a small voltage (about 1 volt) can be applied to bump the electrons off the conjugated polymer or help them jump back on.\nThe tints don\u2019t have to be gray, blue, brown, or otherwise straight-laced. \u201cWe can make any color,\u201d Reynolds said.\n\u2018Toxic,\u2019 \u2018carcinogenic\u2019\nBecause of previous inks\u2019 organic solvents, applying electrochromic films in the past has come with significant safety requirements. Their costs could become prohibitive if the job is big, say, if a company wanted to cover the windows of an office building with an electrochromic film.\n\u201cMost research labs use chlorobenzene as a solvent. It\u2019s pretty toxic. It\u2019s carcinogenic, slightly volatile as well,\u201d Schmatz said. \u201cSo, it\u2019s not something people want to work with at scale.\u201d\nAlso, people may simply find the smell of an organic chemical in their workplace unpleasant. Examples of organic solvent smells most everyone has experienced are kerosene, gasoline, or rubbing alcohol.\nOrganic then aqueous\nWater as a solvent is much safer, but it can present other challenges. Conjugated polymers are produced in organic solvents and do not inherently dissolve in water. Also, films printed from water-based inks might wash out in the rain or smudge in high humidity.\nSchmatz\u2019s invention combines the best of both worlds by using an organic solvent and an aqueous solvent in phases.\nFirst, the conjugated polymer is produced in an organic solvent to assure quality material is made. That\u2019s also aligned with chemical industry practices.\n\u201cChemical companies really do a lot of this kind of processing, and it\u2019s advantageous to keep this as it is, so the companies can keep doing what they\u2019re doing and add this product more easily,\u201d Schmatz said.\nBut then Schmatz alters the conjugated polymer \u2013 the ink\u2019s active ingredient, so to speak -- which is usually not water soluble, so that it will indeed dissolve in water.\n\u201cWe embed a chemical trigger within the polymer. It\u2019s activated through a high pH water wash, and that transforms the organic soluble polymer into a water soluble polyelectrolyte,\u201d he said. \u201cThe reason we want to do all of this is so we can produce the polymer in an organic solvent, but then print the polymer from a water-based ink.\u201d\nUltraviolet cleaver\nTo make sure that the film doesn\u2019t smear or run after printing and that it functions well when it\u2019s completed, Schmatz cleaves off that added chemical trigger from the conjugated polymer by shining ultraviolet light on the electrochromic film.\nThe water-soluble chemical chain then becomes a simple residue that can be wiped or rinsed off. What\u2019s left is a robust, pure conjugated polymer film, which can no longer dissolve in water or organic solvents.\nReynolds envisions electrochromic films on various materials, including some other than glass or plastic. \u201cYou could apply this to camouflage, for example, with the right textiles, and have a sensor connected to a battery, and have it switch the colors to match the changing lightness or darkness of a soldier\u2019s surroundings.\u201d\nAside from electrochromics, these conjugated polymers are also being explored for printed transistors, solar cells, chemical and bio-sensors, light emitting displays and bioelectronics. Reynold\u2019s group has access to a number of delivery methods to test application of conjugated polymers.\n\u201cGeorgia Tech is a focused engineering university and has application capabilities you can find right here,\u201d Reynolds said. \u201cThe various methods of printing or spraying are here \u2013 airbrush, blade coater, ink jet. And if we don\u2019t have something, we can build it here.\u201d\nAlso READ: Rainbow of possibilities with electrochromic polymers\nGeorgia Tech\u2019s Zhibo Yuan, Augustus Lang, Jeff Hernandez and Elsa Reichmanis co-authored the study.
