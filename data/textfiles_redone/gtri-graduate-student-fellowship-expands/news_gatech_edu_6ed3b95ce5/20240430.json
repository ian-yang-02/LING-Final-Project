This year\u2019s projects will lead to innovations in everything from side-channel security to maximizing the potential of heterogenous hardware.\nWhat the researchers are most excited about is the collaboration.\n\u201cI have been collaborating with GTRI on seedling concepts recently,\u201d Muhannad Bakir, a Dan Fielder professor in the\nSchool of Electric and Computer Engineering . \u201cThis fellowship program allows us to accelerate and scale these ideas and generate the results necessary to attract new collaborators from the government and private industry.\u201d\nFaculty Research Pairs and Proposals\nAcross the seven selected fellowship awards, researchers from GTRI labs will co-advise students along with a Georgia Tech faculty member.\nWhat:\nElectronic and Photonic Integrated Circuit Heterogeneous Integration Who:\nMuhannad Bakir ,\nPaul Jo ,\nBenjamin Yang Unit:\nSchool of Electrical and Computer Engineering ,\nSEAL Why It Matters:\nThis project will develop techniques to seamlessly combine integrated circuits (ICs) from different domains (photonics, radio frequency, and digital) into a single package.\n\u201cThe fellowship will support high-risk, high-payoff research in advanced packaging and heterogeneous integration of electronics and photonics chiplets,\u201d said Bakir. \u201cThe ability to heterogeneously integrate these unique chiplet functions will enable high-performance scalable digital and\u00a0radio frequency systems. Specifically, we are exploring the co-packaging of silicon photonics and electronics using 2.5D and 3D interconnect technologies to enable seamless, low-loss, high-performance, and compact integration.\u201d\nWhat:\nSide-channel Attack Resistant Integrated Circuits Who:\nSaibal Mukhopadhyay , Christopher Clark Unit:\nSchool of Electrical and Computer Engineering ,\nCIPHER Why It Matters:\nApplication Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) are deployed in many applications critical for national security. Power and electromagnetic emission-based side-channel attacks provide a physical channel to reveal secrets contained in an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) and have emerged as a key threat to security of ASICs used in commercial and Department of Defense applications.\n\u201cSoftware-based security methods are inadequate for inhibiting SCA,\u201d said Mukhopadhyay. \u201cThe proposed research will develop and demonstrate design methods and circuit techniques to build side-channel attack-resistant ASICs.\nWhat:\nDeveloping Techniques for IPv6 Internet-Wide Scanning Who:\nFrank Li,\nAdonis Bovell Unit:\nSchool of Cybersecurity & Policy ,\nCIPHER Why It Matters:\nThe internet consists of two core network protocols: IPv4 and the relatively new but widespread IPv6.\u00a0Internet scanning allows researchers to assess security, but the techniques used for IPv4 do not work for IPv6. This research will systematically develop novel techniques and systems for IPv6 Internet-wide scanning.\n\u201cFar too often we hear about new vulnerabilities affecting widely used internet-facing software,\u201d said Bovell. \u201cIdeally, system administrators would patch or remediate these vulnerabilities as they are discovered. This research helps to provide us with an independent way of verifying how quickly we do these remediations and when we fall short.\u201d\nWhat:\nEpigraphene Edge State Terahertz Micro Antennas Who:\nWalt de Heer , John Hankinson Units:\nSchool of Physics ,\nATAS Why It Matters:\nEpigraphene on silicon carbide is one of the best platforms for high-performance graphene electronics. This project will leverage the exceptional transport properties of these epigraphene ribbons to develop on-chip Terahertz (THz) frequency graphene antennas.\u00a0THz wireless transmission allows for a significant increase in data throughput.\n\u201cWe believe that epigraphene micro-antennas will offer greatly improved efficiency, output power, and transmission rates compared to micro-antennas made from other materials or even other forms of graphene that do not have the protected edge state of epigraphene,\u201d said Hankinson.\u00a0\u201cThe fellowship will allow us to bring together experts in fundamental transport physics with experts in electronic systems engineering, which is critical for this effort.\u201d\nWhat:\nCreative use of Georgia Tech's Shock Tube Facility for Miscellaneous Hypersonic Flow Tests Who:\nDevesh Ranjan ,\nKrish Ahuja Units:\nSchool of Mechanical Engineering ,\nATAS Why It Matters:\nHypersonic speeds are the future of jet and missile propulsion\u00a0and potentially transporting cargo and passengers. This project will explore innovative use of an existing shock tube to produce flows approaching hypersonic conditions for conducting a range of tests on university-scale test models, including characterizing and controlling high-temperature, high-speed jet flows and their noise, cavity flows, and energy harvesting. New sensors and high temperature materials can also be tested.\n\u201cWe want to stay in the hypersonic game and develop things that differentiate Georgia Tech from other universities,\u201d said Ahuja. \u201cThis fellowship is to do something disruptive that aligns with\u00a0current\u00a0interests in national\u00a0security.\u201d\nWhat:\nAnalog Computation for Low-power, Adaptive, and Reconfigurable Embedded Edge Classification and Learning Who:\nJennifer Hasler ,\nNelson Lourenco Units:\nSchool of Electrical and Computer Engineering ,\nACL Why It Matters:\u00a0 Modern radio frequency (RF) systems are facing two major design challenges: mission expansion with constrained size, weight, and power (SWaP), and spectrum density. The first challenge has led to a substantial push in converged RF systems that can perform a plurality of functions with a single set of reconfigurable hardware. The second challenge leads to a need for spectrum reuse, with hardware advances that can increase capacity within a single frequency band. Custom integrated circuits and adaptive algorithms are enabling technologies for these broadband and dynamically reconfigurable RF systems.\n\u201c Professor Hasler\u2019s team is recognized as experts in the areas of programmable analog integrated circuits and signal processing algorithms \u2014 research areas that are directly applicable to converged RF systems,\u201d said Lourenco. \u201cThe developments from this partnership will be highly relevant to multiple research initiatives at GTRI, allowing the Institute to secure larger investments from our government and industry sponsors.\u201d\nWho:\nJC Gumbart ,\nRyan Westafer What:\nPredicting Encoded Electromagnetic Responses of DNA (PEER DNA) Units:\nSchool of Physics ,\nACL Why it matters:\nDNA can serve as a building block of biological and synthetic materials, such as bacterial biofilms or DNA origami. This project will use electric fields to manipulate DNA to make controlling and detecting it easier.\n\u201cFrom nanoscale self-assembly to electromagnetics and communications, there is an immense amount to learn and apply from biology,\u201d said Westafer. \"We are excited to\u00a0collaborate with the Simbac group in the School of Physics.\u201d\nAbout the GTRI Graduate Student Research Fellowship Program\nThe GTRI Graduate Student Fellowship Program is a competitive program for high-caliber Georgia Tech graduate students working in GTRI strategic research areas.
