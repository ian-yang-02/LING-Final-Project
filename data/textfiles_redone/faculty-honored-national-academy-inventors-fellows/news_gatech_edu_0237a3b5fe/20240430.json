They were chosen by the NAI for demonstrating \u201ca highly prolific spirit of innovation in creating or facilitating outstanding inventions that have made a tangible impact on the quality of life, economic development, and welfare of society.\u201d\nOyelere\nis a professor in the\nSchool of Chemistry & Biochemistry . His research spans bioorganic chemistry, biochemistry, and drug design with interrelated work across RNA-small molecule interaction, targeted histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibition, and design and synthesis of novel bioconjugates for molecular delivery applications.\nOyelere's lab has worked to\ndevelop a therapeutic strategy for cancer treatment\nto inhibit enzymes called histone deacetylases, which play an important role in the regulation of gene expression. He has also worked on the design of histone deacetylase inhibitors that can be taken up by the hormones expressed on the surface of hormone-positive breast cancer cells to stop the cells from dividing. In 2018, he received Georgia Tech\u2019s\nOutstanding Undergraduate Mentor Senior Faculty Award .\nSwaminathan\nis the John Pippin Chair in Microsystems Packaging & Electromagnetics in the\nSchool of Electrical and Computer Engineering\nand has a joint appointment in the\nSchool of Materials Science and Engineering (MSE) . He directs the\n3D Systems Packaging Research Center\nat Georgia Tech. He is an internationally recognized researcher in electronics packaging, an area that is expected to fuel the semiconductor industry over the next decade.\nSwaminathan holds 31 patents and is the founder and co-founder of two start-up companies (E-System Design and Jacket Micro Devices).\nWang\nis the Regents\u2019 Professor and Hightower Chair Emeritus in MSE. His discovery and breakthroughs in developing nanogenerators established the principle and technological roadmap for harvesting mechanical energy from environment and biological systems for powering mobile sensors.\nWang\u2019s work also p\u00adioneered the field of self-powered sensors, and he coined piezotronics and piezo-phototronics\nfor the third-generation semiconductors .\nWang holds 70 U.S. and foreign patents.\nGeorgia Tech now has 16 NAI Fellows. The new cohort will be inducted at the NAI Fellows Induction Ceremony in July.\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nCoE Newsroom: Swaminathan, Wang Honored as National Academy of Inventors Fellows\nContact\nJason Maderer\nJess Hunt-Ralston\nEmail\njess@cos.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
