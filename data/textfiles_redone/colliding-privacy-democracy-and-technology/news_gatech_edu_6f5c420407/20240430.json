The report, produced annually, is an expert-driven review of recent cybersecurity trends, developing research and threat considerations.\nAmong the findings:\nGlobal information manipulation by nation-states is now widespread, causing western nations to curtail free speech and news consumers to view information cautiously.\nHealth care fraud is taking off in the absence of good defenses, as the value of personal data far surpasses that of stolen credit cards.\nCultural differences and unresolved approaches to data encryption continue to mire companies and business leaders with uncertainty and risk in North America and Europe.\nCrowdsourced and open-source solutions hold promise for addressing insecure, aging electronic voting systems.\nPublic proof of who is behind cyberattacks remains elusive.\nInterest is growing in computer science education, suggesting a changing tide in the nation\u2019s shortfall of information technology workers.\n\u201cCyberattacks today are flourishing because almost every organization conducts some portion of its business online \u2014 putting even digitally cautious consumers at risk when it is not sufficiently protected,\u201d said Wenke Lee, co-director of the Institute for Information Security and Privacy (IISP) and professor of computer science at Georgia Tech. \u201cThere is widespread reluctance to share threat information, and there\u2019s a lack of public attribution about who is responsible, making it nearly impossible for the public to defend themselves.\u201d\nGeorgia Tech\u2019s broad understanding of cybersecurity issues can be used to develop strategies to address a range of threats, noted Bo Rotoloni, co-director of IISP.\n\u201cUnder this unique combination, Georgia Tech can help foretell how the \u2018white hats\u2019 should prepare because we continually witness how the \u2018black hats\u2019 adapt,\u201d said Rotoloni, director of the Information and Cyber Sciences Directorate at the Georgia Tech Research Institute, the university\u2019s applied research arm.\nGeorgia Tech issues the Threat Report each fall in conjunction with its annual\nCyber Security Summit , which is taking place today in Tech Square. The summit brings together government, industry and academia for objective conversation about the challenges of securing information and cyber-connected systems.\n-- Written by\u00a0Tara La Bouff\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nInstitute for Information Security & Privacy\n2017 Emerging Cyber Threats Report\nContact\nLaura Diamond\nInstitute Communications\n404-894-6016\n@LauraRDiamond\nEmail\nlaura.diamond@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
