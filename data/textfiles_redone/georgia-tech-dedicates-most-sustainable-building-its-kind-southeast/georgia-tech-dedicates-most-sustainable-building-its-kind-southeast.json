And it has reimagined from the ground up what a campus building can be.\n\u201cThe time for doing less harm is gone,\u201d said Shan Arora, director of The Kendeda Building. \u201cWe need to have buildings that provide more than they take.\u201d\nThat broad guiding principle has produced a building that will, each year, generate more on-site electricity than it consumes and collect and harvest more water than it uses. During construction, the building diverted more waste from landfills than it sent to them.\n\u201cThe Kendeda Building is an incredible and beautiful example of sustainable design, integration with nature, human inclusion and well-being. It is the most sustainable building of its kind in the Southeast,\u201d said Georgia Tech President \u00c1ngel Cabrera. \u201cThanks to our partnership with the Kendeda Fund, it will inspire architects, civil engineers, business and policy leaders for generations to come.\u201d\nIn 2015,\nThe Kendeda Fund\ncommitted $25 million for Georgia Tech to design and\nbuild a living building on campus in an effort prove a regenerative building was practical even in the Southeast\u2019s heat and humidity . An additional $5 million will support programming activities once the building is certified.\nThe Kendeda Building is the first academic and research building in the Southeast designed to be\ncertified as a living building by the International Living Future Institute . Over the next 12 months, it will have to prove its bona fides to earn Living Building Challenge 3.1 certification, delivering on its promise to be self-sufficient, healthy, and beautiful while connecting people to light, air, food, nature, and community.\n\u201cThe dedication of The Kendeda Building represents the culmination of many years of planning and partnership. We are humbled to see the vision come to life, and we hope it can be a model for change across the Southeast,\u201d said Dena Kimball, executive director of The Kendeda Fund. \u201cBut the official opening of the building is the starting point, not the finish line. Now the real work begins, as Georgia Tech embraces the goals of the Living Building Challenge and demonstrates what\u2019s required to operate a building that gives more than it takes and creates a positive impact on the human and natural systems that surround it.\u201d\nOne of the first steps in that effort is getting the on-site water treatment system certified by state environmental regulators. It will be the first rainwater-to-drinking-water system in a commercial building in this part of the country. Arora said that means the project is breaking more new ground for the Georgia Environmental Protection Division.\n\u201cWe are teaching and learning together, the regulator and the regulated,\u201d he said.\nThe Kendeda Building will host several events in the fall and then open fully in the spring for classes, when it becomes a living, learning laboratory for education and research.\n\u201cReally, the best is yet to come. Our goal is to host as many large and required courses from across campus to give our students access to a building that actually teaches us all something,\u201d said Michael Gamble, associate professor and director of Graduate Studies in the School of Architecture. \u201cIt\u2019s not just for those students interested in sustainability as a career. For example, next semester, calculus will be taught in The Kendeda Building.\u201d\nGamble helped lead efforts to embed the concepts of the Living Building Challenge more broadly in the Georgia Tech curriculum , including a series of pilot projects that helped explore the challenge\u2019s requirements. Gamble also led a series of architecture design studios focused on mass timber technology like that used in the building.\n\u201cThe pilot project program should be a part of every capital project on campus \u2014 we\u2019ve learned more and made more connections than we ever thought we would,\u201d Gamble said.\nLikewise, Arora said the project team \u2014 general contractor Skanska and architects Lord Aeck Sargent and The Miller Hull Partnership \u2014 found new sources of materials and created ways of working that now will ripple out to other projects.\n\u201cOnce you learn how to build and operate a living building, you can\u2019t unlearn it,\u201d Arora said. \u201cThrough this process, we\u2019re creating the local supply chain, the workforce, and the best practices for other buildings in the region to use living building elements.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nFacebook Live: Tour The Kendeda Building\nKendeda Building for Innovative Sustainable Design\nThe Kendeda Fund\nInternational Living Future Institute\nLiving Building Chronicle Blog\nContact\nJoshua Stewart\n404.894.6016\nEmail\njstewart@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
