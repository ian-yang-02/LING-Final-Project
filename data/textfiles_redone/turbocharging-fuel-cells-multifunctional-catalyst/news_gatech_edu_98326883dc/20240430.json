Pictured here is a prototype that Nissan says is \"the world\u2019s first Solid Oxide Fuel-Cell (SOFC)-powered prototype vehicle that runs on bio-ethanol electric power.\" Credit: Nissan Motor Corporation / press handout for editorial use only\nMar 14, 2018\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nPowering clean, efficient cars is just one way fuel cell technology could accelerate humanity into a sustainable energy future, but unfortunately, the technology has been a bit sluggish. Now,\nengineers may be able to essentially turbocharge fuel cells\nwith a new catalyst.\nThe sluggishness comes from a chemical bottleneck, the rate of processing oxygen, a key ingredient that helps fuel cells, which are related to batteries, produce electricity. The new catalyst, a nanotechnology material developed by engineers at the Georgia Institute of Technology, markedly speeds up oxygen processing and is\nthe subject of a new study .\nPartly to accommodate oxygen\u2019s limitations, fuel cells usually require pure hydrogen fuel, which reacts with the oxygen taken in from the air, but the costs of producing the hydrogen have been prohibitive. The new catalyst is a potential game-changer.\n\u201cIt can easily convert chemical fuel into electricity with high efficiency,\u201d said Meilin Liu, who led the study and is a\nRegents\u2019 Professor in Georgia Tech\u2019s School of Material Science and Engineering. \u00a0 \u201cIt can let you use readily available fuels like methane or natural gas or just use hydrogen fuel much more efficiently,\u201d Liu said.\nCatalyst 8 times as fast\nThe catalyst achieves the efficiency by rushing oxygen through a fuel cell\u2019s system. \u201cIt\u2019s more than eight times as fast as state-of-the-art materials doing the same thing now,\u201d said Yu Chen, a postdoctoral research associate in Liu\u2019s lab and the study\u2019s first author.\nThere are a few types of fuel cells, but the researchers worked to improve solid oxide fuel cells, which are found in some prototypical fuel cell cars. The research insights could also aid in honing\nsupercapacitors\nand technology paired with solar panels, thus advancing sustainable energy beyond the new catalyst\u2019s immediate potential to improve upon fuel cells.\nLiu and Chen published their study\u00a0 in the March issue of the journal\nJoule . Their research was funded by the U.S. Department of Energy and by the Guangdong Innovative and Entrepreneurial Research Program. The fuel cell work from Liu\u2019s lab has already attracted significant energy industry and automotive industry interest.\nNaturally sluggish oxygen\nThough they work differently from fuel cells and are much less efficient and clean, combustion engines make a useful metaphor to aid in understanding how fuel cells and the new catalyst work.\nIn a combustion engine, fuel from a tank and oxygen from the air come together to react in an explosion, producing energy that turns a crankshaft. Adding a turbocharger speeds the process up by mixing fuel and oxygen together more quickly and rushing them to combustion.\nCurrently, in\nfuel cells, hydrogen fuel from a tank and oxygen\nfrom the air also drive a process that produces energy, in this case, electricity. The two ingredients do come together in a reaction, but one very different from combustion, and much cleaner.\nOne end of the fuel cell, the anode, removes electrons from the hydrogen atoms in what\u2019s called\noxidation\nand sends the electrons through an external circuit as electric current to the cathode on the other side. There, oxygen, which is notoriously electron hungry, sucks the electrons up in what\u2019s called\nreduction , and that keeps the electricity flowing.\nThe hydrogen, now positively charged, and the oxygen, now negatively charged, meet up to form water, which is the fuel cell\u2019s exhaust.\nIn that reaction chain, oxygen is the slow link in two ways: Oxygen\u2019s reduction takes longer than hydrogen\u2019s oxidation, and the reduced oxygen moves more slowly through the system to meet with hydrogen. Analogous to the turbocharger, the new catalyst pushes the oxygen forward.\nOxygen rush nanotech\nThe catalyst is applied as a sheer coating only about two dozen nanometers thick and is comprised of two connected nanotechnology solutions that break both oxygen bottlenecks.\nFirst, nanoparticles highly attractive to oxygen grab the O 2\nmolecule and let inflowing electrons quickly jump onto it, easily reducing it and tearing it into two separate oxygen ions (each one an O 2- ). Then a series of chemical gaps called\noxygen vacancies\nthat are built into the nanoparticles\u2019 structures suck up the oxygen ions like chains of vacuum cleaners passing the ions hand to hand to the second phase of the catalyst.\nThe second phase is a coating that is full of oxygen vacancies that can pass the O 2-\neven more rapidly toward its final destination.\n\u201cThe oxygen goes down quickly through the channels and enters the fuel cell, where it meets with the ionized hydrogen or another electron donor like methane or natural gas.\u201d\nThe ions meet to make water, which exits the fuel cell. In the case of methane fuel, pure CO 2\nis also emitted, which can be\ncaptured and recycled back into fuel .\nInteresting rare metals\nIn the first stage, there are two different flavors of nanoparticle at work. Both have cobalt, but one contains barium and the other praseodymium, a rare-earth metal that can be pricey in high quantities.\n\u201c Praseodymium\nis in such very small amounts that it doesn\u2019t impact costs,\u201d Liu said. \u201cAnd the catalyst saves lots of money on fuel and on other things.\u201d\nHigh operating temperatures in existing fuel cells require expensive protective casings and cooling materials. The researchers believe the catalyst could help lower the temperatures by reducing electrical resistance inherent in current fuel cell chemistry. That could, in turn, reduce overall material costs.\nProtective cathode coating\nThe second stage of the catalyst is a lattice that contains praseodymium and barium, as well as calcium and cobalt (PBCC). In addition to its catalytic function, the PBCC coating protects the cathode from degradation that can limit the lifetime of fuel cells and similar devices.\nThe underlying original cathode material, which contains the metals lanthanum,\nstrontium , cobalt, and iron ( LSCF ), has become an industry standard but comes with a caveat.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very conductive, very good, but the problem is that strontium undergoes a diminishment called\nsegregation\nin the material,\u201d Liu said. \u201cOne component of our catalyst, PBCC, acts as a coating and keeps the LSCF a lot more stable.\u201d\nLSCF manufacturing is already well-established, and adding the catalyst coating to production could be likely reasonably achieved. Liu also is considering replacing the LSCF cathode completely with the new catalyst material, and his lab is developing a yet another catalyst to boost fuel oxidation reactions at the fuel cell\u2019s anode.\nLike this article?\u00a0 Get our email newsletter here.\nAlso\nREAD:\nNanogenerators boost mass spectrometry.\nCoauthors of the study were: Seonyoung Yoo, Yong Ding, Ruiqiang Yan, Kai Pei, Chong Qu, Lei Zhang, Ikwhang Cha, Bote Zhao, Ben deGlee, and Ryan Murphy of Georgia Tech; YongMan Choi from the SABIC Technology Center in Saudi Arabia; Yanxiang Zhang from the Harbin Institute of Technology in China; Huijun Chen, Yan Chen, Chenghao Yang and Jiang Liu from the South China University of Technology.
