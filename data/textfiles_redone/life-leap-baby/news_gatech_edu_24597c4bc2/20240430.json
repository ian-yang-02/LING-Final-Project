Andy Eichel is one of them.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nEmail\nAndy Eichel and Esa Sofian celebrating their engagement while on vacation in Switzerland\nFeb 28, 2024\nOnly about 5 million people worldwide \u2014 less than 0.1% of the population \u2014 have been born on Feb. 29. Andy Eichel, senior managing strategy consultant in Strategic Consulting, is one of them.\nToday, Eichel has his 10th birthday \u2014 but perhaps more accurately (or \u201cboringly\u201d as he puts it), he turns 40.\n\u201cThe most common question I get by far is, \u2018When do you celebrate your birthday?\u2019 My answer has always been the same: I was born in February, so I celebrate my birthday on the last day of February,\u201d he said. \u201cSome leap year babies have a different logic; but they are wrong. I don't usually celebrate on both days but, as I get older, maybe that will change.\u201d\nEichel has no negative feelings about only seeing his birthday on the calendar every four years. But he does think it makes it harder for him to keep track of others\u2019 birthdays.\n\u201cMy friends and family have it easy with my special day, but how can I be expected to remember if you were born on a random day in the middle of a random month?\u201d he jokes.\nHaving the rarest birthday in the world could create a special bond for some. Eichel tells a story of going on a date in high school and finding out they were born on the same day.\n\u201cHalfway through the date we discovered we had the same birthday. We didn't really have anything else in common, but the novelty of dating a fellow leap year baby kept us together for a few months, which is practically a decade in high school dating,\u201d he said.\nEichel has been at Georgia Tech since 2016 (also a leap year), when he started as a Brittain Fellow. He then worked as an academic coach in the Office of Undergraduate Education before taking on his current role in 2022.\nIn nearly eight years at Tech, this is only his second time having his birthday. So, if you see him, wish him a happy one before four more years pass.\nContact\nKristen Bailey\nInstitute Communications\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
