Their ForageFeeder replaces the zoo\u2019s previous feeding protocols, which had staff deliver food to the habitat at set times and locations.\nWith the new machine, feeding times can be set for different intervals every day. This encourages the gorillas\u2019 natural feeding behavior, giving them additional random foraging opportunities throughout the day.\n\"This is a great example of how technology can positively influence animal welfare,\" says David Hu, Faculty Advisor of the project. \"Zoo Atlanta is a local, nonprofit institution, and it was great to see Georgia Tech students learning by doing. Technology has been improving human lives for years, and now it\u2019s the gorillas\u2019 turn.\"\nRead the full story on the College of Engineering's website.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nJason Maderer\nCollege of Engineering\nEmail\nmaderer@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
