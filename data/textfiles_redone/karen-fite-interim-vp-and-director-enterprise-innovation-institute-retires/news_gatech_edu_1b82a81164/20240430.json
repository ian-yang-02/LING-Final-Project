The group also includes the\nSafety, Health, and Environmental Services (SHES) ,\nAtlanta MBDA Centers ,\nContracting Education Academy ,\nGeorgia Tech Procurement Assistance Center (GTPAC) , and the\nSoutheastern Trade Adjustment Assistance Center (SETAAC)\nprograms.\nBefore taking on that role, Fite was GaMEP director.\n\u201cOver the years at Georgia Tech, I have been privileged to serve in a wide variety of capacities \u2014 assisting companies with government procurement, their implementation of quality management systems and Lean Manufacturing protocols, the launch of a Lean Healthcare initiative, creating community economic development research and strategic plans, and directing the GaMEP,\u201d Fite said.\n\u201cAs interim vice president, I have had the opportunity to interact with virtually every EI2 employee. Working with such a talented group of employees of EI2 has been an honor because across the board they are passionate about their work, dedicated to Georgia Tech\u2019s mission of progress and service by serving clients, and continually looking to innovate, improve, and expand our services to help create long lasting and meaningful impact not only in Georgia and across the country, but around the world.\u201d\nChaouki T. Abdallah, Georgia Tech\u2019s executive vice president for research said Fite was a valued member of his leadership team.\n\u201cShe has been a very effective and engaging leader,\u201d Abdallah said. \u201cShe\u2019s brought me solutions, given me critical feedback and has been an invaluable partner. Georgia Tech is lucky to have had her contributions for so long.\u201d\nFite has a master\u2019s degree in business administration from the University of Miami and a bachelor\u2019s in health systems from Georgia Tech. In 2018, she achieved the faculty rank of principal extension professional, Georgia Tech\u2019s highest professional extension faculty rank.\n\u201cWe are fortunate to have someone of David Bridges\u2019 caliber who can not only build on Karen\u2019s legacy but also brings a wealth of experience and economic development successes,\u201d Abdallah said.\nBridges, who joined EI2 in 1994, authored, co-authored or contributed to more than 100 economic development grants totaling more than $40 million. He assisted in the formation of the two proof-of-concept units \u2014 the Global Center for Medical Innovation, a Tech affiliate in the medical device space, and I3L, a health information technology innovation hub.\nBeyond Georgia, Bridges helped catalyze the development of the Soft Landings program to bring companies from overseas to the United States. He also helped to establish the I-Corps Puerto Rico program as the National Science Foundation\u2019s first I-Corps program ever offered to teams from that community.\nHe also supported the expansion of technology extension programs in Chile and Colombia, built a new program in professional development around innovation and technology commercialization, and expanded Georgia Tech\u2019s presence by helping to build startup ecosystems around the Institute\u2019s international campuses and in Latin America.\nBridges and his EDL team have also implemented ecosystem building projects for numerous countries including Colombia, Chile, Ecuador, Peru, Panama, Costa Rica, Argentina, Guatemala, South Africa, China, Korea, and Japan.\n-\u00a0P\u00e9ralte Paul\nAdditional Images\nContact\nJohn Toon\nResearch News\n(404) 894-6986\nEmail\njtoon@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
