Ultimately, the goal of this attack is to reliably control the value of a specific uninitialized variable in the kernel space of a running program.\nThe research findings confirm that hackers using this method can automatically prepare a malicious pointer in the uninitialized variable. When the malicious pointer is used, a privilege escalation attack targeting the Linux kernel may occur.\n\u201cOur research shows that utilizing the targeted stack-spraying approach allows attackers to reliably control more than 91 percent of the Linux kernel stack, which, in combination with uninitialized-use vulnerabilities, suffices for a privilege escalation attack,\u201d said Lu.\nNot content to merely identify the vulnerability, Lu and his fellow researchers also developed a potential solution to the problem.\n\u201cOur mitigation approach leverages the fact that uninitialized-use attacks usually control an uninitialized pointer to achieve arbitrary read/write/execution,\u201d explained Lu. \u201cBy zero-initializing pointer-type fields that the compiler cannot prove are properly initialized before they are used, we can prevent an adversary from controlling these pointers.\u201d\nTo limit any unnecessary performance overhead related to zero-initializing pointer-type fields, the team developed an intra-procedural program analysis that checks whether a pointer field is properly initialized when it is used. Only uninitialized pointer fields require zero initialization.\nA paper titled\nUnleashing Use-Before-Initialization Vulnerabilities in the Linux Kernel Using Targeted Stack Spraying\nis being presented this week at the\nNetwork and Distributed System Security Symposium\nbeing held in San Diego, Calif.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nAlbert Snedeker\nCommunications Manager\nCollege of Computing\n404-844-7128\nalbert.snedeker@cc.gatech.edu\nEmail\nalbert.snedeker@cc.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
