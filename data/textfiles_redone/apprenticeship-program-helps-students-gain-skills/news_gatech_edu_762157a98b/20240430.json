Launched in 2016, GACATT\u00a0allows them to graduate on time with a high school diploma, earn technical college credentials, while obtaining real, hands-on experience in a workplace and technical skills that they can us\nNov 15, 2017\n\u2014 Griffin, GA\nAt 4 a.m. on many mornings, 17-year-old Cole McKeehan is already at work at E.G.O. North America in Newnan, Georgia.\nMcKeehan, a junior at Northgate High School in Newnan, is a student apprentice at E.G.O., which makes radiant heating elements and electronic components such as touch controls and induction heaters at the facility.\nHe is in his second year of the program \u2014 the\u00a0Georgia Consortium for\u00a0Advanced Technical Training (GA CATT) \u2014 and is gaining practical experience in machining and lathing. McKeehan is developing those skills under an apprenticeship program that would let him graduate high school with\u00a0technical college credits. He can use those credits\u00a0toward\u00a0earning\u00a0an associate\u2019s degree in industrial mechanics from West Georgia Technical College.\n\u201cI think this is a great program,\u201d McKeehan said. \u201cI will graduate with an associate\u2019s degree and continue on to college for a four-year degree in engineering or tool and die.\u201d\nMcKeehan was one of several teens in GA CATT\u00a0who shared their experiences Nov. 13 at Georgia Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle\u2019s 10 th\nAnnual Business & Education Summit.\nThe session where the teens spoke, held on the first day of the two-day summit and hosted by the Griffin Region College and Career Academy, brought Georgia\u2019s business and education leaders together for a series of collaborative meetings.\nThe hope is that these meetings will lead to innovative ideas and initiatives to better prepare high school students for the demands of a 21 st -century workforce.\nThe GA CATT session, which also featured business leaders and officials from the Georgia Institute of Technology who worked on its development and implementation, was designed to answer questions from summit attendees, as state officials look to expand it statewide.\n\u201cOur GA CATT has had great success,\u201d Cagle said. \u201cWe\u2019re in our second year now and to be able to listen to the students and the impact that it\u2019s having on their lives and how motivated and focused and determined they are \u2014 it\u2019s a win for them, it\u2019s a win for the community, and it\u2019s certainly a win for industry as well.\u201d\nThe Georgia initiative was launched in 2016 with support from the German American Chamber of Commerce of the Southern U.S., the Technical College System of Georgia, West Georgia Technical College, and the Central Educational Center, as well as Georgia Tech\u2019s Georgia Manufacturing Extension Partnership (GaMEP) and Safety and Health Consultation Program.\nThe GA CATT program seeks to follow the German apprenticeship dual education model and begin with 10 th\ngraders, the only program in the U.S. currently doing so.\nAs in Germany, GA CATT requires participating Georgia high school sophomores, juniors, and seniors to spend 70 percent of their time working at their host company and the remaining 30 percent in the classroom.\nThe 70-30 split is designed to allow them to graduate on time with a high school diploma and earn technical college credentials while obtaining real, hands-on experience in a workplace and technical skills that they can use to build their careers. In addition, apprentices have the opportunity to attain a German Certification in Industrial Mechanics that is accepted in Europe and beyond as evidence of their skill and knowledge.\nThe student apprentices are paid for their time at the company, earning $8 an hour when they start and $12 per hour as seniors.\nTwo German companies with operations in Newnan \u2014 Grenzebach Corp. and E.G.O. North America \u2014 were committed to launching GA CATT and served as the catalysts for the program.\nThe companies asked Larry Alford, GaMEP\u2019s South Metro Atlanta region manager, to leverage his long-term relationships with local companies to invite them to join the program. GA CATT began with eight companies and 10 apprentices.\nGaMEP, which works with manufacturers to innovate, increase top-line growth, and reduce bottom-line costs, also supported the GA CATT initiative, as did the Institute\u2019s Safety and Health Consultation Program.\n\u201cCollaborating with industry from the start has been GA CATT\u2019s secret to success. The educators and the German-American Chamber are key players, but the industry\u2019s commitment will determine its growth and expansion,\u201d\u00a0Alford said. \u201cMuch of the focus rightfully is placed on the students, but equally important are the process and support systems that develop the company mentors, those who are tasked with guiding the activities of the students to meet curriculum requirements and to adequately prepare the apprentices to succeed in the program and at work.\u201d\nThat commitment on all sides also helps manufacturers build a pipeline of talent, said David Keller, E.G.O. North America\u2019s president and managing director of operations. In an industry that has historically had a difficult time finding a skilled workforce, these companies are looking to the future, by developing interest and relationships with talented students early on, he said.\nThe goal is that after graduation, the students will work for those companies where they apprenticed.\nJenny Houlroyd, an industrial hygienist with Tech\u2019s Safety,\u00a0Health, and Environmental Services program, is helping GA CATT companies understand and comply with U.S. labor laws that provide flexibility for apprentices under 18 to enter the workforce as student-learners.\nIn 2017, GA CATT added two additional clusters, centered in Rockdale & Newton Counties and Spalding County. Each cluster includes local manufacturers, their local college and career academies, and the local Technical College. Alford facilitates the implementation teams in each cluster. A total of 18 manufacturers and 28 students currently participate in the program.\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nGeorgia Manufacturing Extension Partnership\nSafety, Health, and Environmental Services\nGeorgia Consortium for Advanced Technical Training\nContact\nP\u00e9ralte C.
