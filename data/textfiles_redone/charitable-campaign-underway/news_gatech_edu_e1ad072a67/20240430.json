The 2021-22 campaign runs through Nov. 16.\nThe GASCCP is a benefit for State of Georgia and University System employees that allows contributions to the charity of choice through payroll deductions or a one-time donation.\nFaculty and staff have several options for contributing. Giving online through OneUSG Connect is the preferred method because it is confidential, secure, and simple to use.\nTo contribute:\nLog in to OneUSG Connect and select \u201cMake SCCP Contribution\u201d on the \u201cState Charitable Contributions Program\u201d button in the upper left of the Employee Self Service screen.\nSelect \u201cMake Charitable Campaign Pledge\u201d and follow the instructions.\nChoose \u201cPayroll Deduction\u201d to set up the amount you choose to pledge in equal installments. Deductions will begin in January 2022.\nIf you would rather download a pledge form, you can complete it and submit with your check to your unit ambassador or to Erick Maxwell, the campaign chair, at mail code 0866.\nOver the past four years of the campaign, an average of 717 Georgia Tech employees have participated in the campaign. As a testament to the generosity of its faculty and staff, Georgia Tech has earned the Governor\u2019s Cup 13 years in a row for having the highest contribution per employee among state institutions of its size.\n\u201cI am proud to work at an institution with such a strong giving history,\u201d said Serena Wallace, last year\u2019s Charitable Campaign chair. \u201cThe generosity of staff and faculty in the midst of their own hardships shows what a caring campus community we have.\u201d\nThere are more than 700 local, state, and national nonprofit organizations to which employees can contribute.
