Using guidance from the model, researchers can avoid the time-consuming task of synthesizing and then experimentally testing new candidate MOFs for their aqueous stability. Already, researchers are expanding the model to predict other important MOF properties.\nSupported by the Office of Science\u2019s Basic Energy Sciences program within the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), the research was reported Nov. 9 in the journal\nNature Machine Intelligence . The research was conducted in the\nCenter for Understanding and Control of Acid Gas-Induced Evolution of Materials for Energy\n(UNCAGE-ME), a DOE Energy Frontier Research Center located at the Georgia Institute of Technology.\n\u201cThe issue of water stability with MOFs has existed in this field for a long time, with no easy way to predict it,\u201d said\nKrista Walton , professor and Robert \"Bud\" Moeller faculty fellow in Georgia Tech\u2019s\nSchool of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering . \u201cRather than having to do the synthesis and experimentation to figure this out for each candidate MOF, this machine learning model now provides a way to predict water stability given a set of desired features. This will really speed up the process of identifying new materials for specific applications.\u201d\nMOFs are a class of porous and crystalline materials that are synthesized from inorganic metal ions or clusters connected to organic ligands. They are known for their easily tunable components that can be customized for specific applications, but the large number of potential combinations makes it difficult to choose MOFs with the desired properties. That\u2019s where artificial intelligence can help.\nMachine learning is playing an increasingly important role in materials science, said\nRampi Ramprasad , professor and Michael E. Tennenbaum Family Chair in the Georgia Tech School of\nMaterials Science and Engineering\nand\nGeorgia Research Alliance\nEminent Scholar in Energy Sustainability.\n\u201cWhen materials scientists plan the next set of experiments, we use the intuition and insights that we have accumulated from the past,\u201d Ramprasad said. \u201cMachine learning allows us to fully tap into this past knowledge in the most efficient and effective manner. If 200 experiments have already been done, machine learning allows us to exploit all that has been learned from them as we plan the 201st experiment.\u201d\nBeyond experimental data, machine learning can also use the results of physics-based simulations. And unlike simulations, the results from machine learning models can be instantaneous. The machine learning algorithm improves as it receives more information, he noted, and both negative and positive results are useful.\n\u201cGreat discoveries are as important as not-so-exciting discoveries \u2014 failed experiments \u2014 because machine learning uses both ends of the spectrum to get better at what it does,\u201d Ramprasad said.\nThe machine learning model used information Walton and her research team had gathered on hundreds of existing MOF materials, both from compounds developed in her own lab and those reported by other researchers. To prepare the information for the model to learn from, she categorized each MOF according to four measures of water stability.\n\u201cThe couple hundred data points used to build the model represented years of experiments,\u201d Walton said. \u201cI spent basically the first half of my career working to understand this water stability problem with MOFs, so it\u2019s something we have studied extensively.\u201d\nUsing the model, researchers who are developing new adsorbents and other porous materials for specific applications can now check their proposed formulas to determine the likelihood that a new MOF would be stable in the presence of water. That could be particularly helpful for researchers who don\u2019t have this particular expertise or who don\u2019t have easy access to experimental methods for examining stability.\n\u201cThe MOF community is diverse, with a variety of subfields. Not everyone has the chemical intuition about which materials\u2019 features lead to good framework stability, and experimental evaluation often requires specialty equipment that many labs may not have or wouldn\u2019t otherwise need for their specific subfield. However, with good predictive models, they wouldn\u2019t necessarily need to develop it to choose a material for a specific application,\u201d Walton said. \u201cThis capability potentially opens up this field to a broader group of researchers that could accelerate application development.\u201d\nWhile screening for water stability is important, Ramprasad says it\u2019s just the beginning of the potential benefits from the project. The machine learning model can be trained to predict other properties as long as a sufficient amount of data exists. For instance, the team is already teaching their model about factors affecting methane absorption under varying levels of pressure. In that case, simulations will provide much of the data from which the model will learn.\n\u201cWe will have a very strong predictor that will tell us if a new MOF would be stable under aqueous conditions and a good candidate for methane uptake,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we are doing is creating a universal and scalable machine learning platform that can be trained on new properties. As long as the data is available, the model can learn from it, and make predictions for new cases.\u201d\nIn addition to those already mentioned, recent Georgia Tech postdoctoral fellow Rohit Batra and Georgia Tech graduate students Carmen Chen and Tania G. Evans were also coauthors on the\nNature Machine Intelligence\npaper.\nRamprasad has experience with machine learning techniques applied to other materials and application spaces, and recently coauthored a review article, \u201cEmerging materials intelligence ecosystems propelled by machine learning,\u201d about a range of artificial intelligence applications in materials science and engineering. Intended to demystify machine learning and to review success stories in the materials development space, it was published, also on Nov. 9, 2020, in the journal\nNature Reviews Materials .\nIn addition to Ramprasad, coauthors on the\nNature Review Materials\npaper included Batra and Le Song, associate professor in the Georgia Tech College of Computing.\nThis work was supported as part of the Center for Understanding and Control of Acid Gas-Induced Evolution of Materials for Energy (UNCAGE-ME), an Energy Frontier Research Center funded by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Basic Energy Sciences under award no.
