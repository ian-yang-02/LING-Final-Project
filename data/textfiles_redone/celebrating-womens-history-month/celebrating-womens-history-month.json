I would be remiss if I did not acknowledge the very critical role that women play across the Office of Information Technology and the IT community. I am grateful to work alongside and benefit from your contributions. I am also proud to serve among a leadership team where women are represented and reflect the broader community.\nWomen continue to steer the advancement of technology and its success in our academic, research and operational spaces at Georgia Tech. Earlier this week, the monthly Women in Technology meeting featured a few of those voices \u2013 highlighting experiences that range from authenticity in the workplace to narratives and norms that advance how women are represented in IT. Next week, OIT will publish a story that highlights additional voices and their diverse perspectives on progress that has been made in technology and the work still to be done. In the meantime, I encourage you to check out some of the events that will celebrate\nWomen\u2019s History Month across our campus .\nI thank each of you for all that you to advance IT at Georgia Tech. Have a great weekend.\nLeo\nRelated links\nCampus Events Celebrate Women\u2019s History Month\nEmail\ncio@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
