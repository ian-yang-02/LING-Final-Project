To date more than 250,000 samples have been tested, keeping the rate of\npositive results relatively low on campus .\nThe Institute collaborated with the CDC to develop Covid-19 information dashboards, including one made\navailable to the public .\nResearchers developed a\ncounty-level risk exposure tool\nas part of an interactive dashboard that estimates Covid-19 incidence at gatherings in the U.S.\nTech researchers are working with Emory University and the National Institutes of Health on the Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics (RADx) initiative\nto develop better testing for Covid-19 . The campus community is now providing samples for this study on campus at the Couch Building testing site.\nGeorgia Tech also recently began collecting samples for serological antibody testing in campus community.\nFor more on Georgia Tech\u2019s response to Covid-19, see Helping Stories at\nhelpingstories.gatech.edu .\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
