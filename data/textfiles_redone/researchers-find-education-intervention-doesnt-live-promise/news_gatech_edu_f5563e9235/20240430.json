In one study, thousands of students whose academic achievement suggested the growth mindset intervention was ineffective were discarded from the main results pre-publication;\nMany growth mindset interventions couldn\u2019t demonstrate they changed students\u2019 beliefs about intelligence\u2014the intervention\u2019s primary aim;\nOf the interventions that did change students\u2019 mindsets, there was no observable impact on academic achievement. This suggests that a student\u2019s mindset might not mean much when it comes to performing well in school; and\nWhen low-quality studies were analyzed, such as those where teacher expectations were not controlled and where the researchers had financial incentives to report positive effects, growth mindset interventions\nappeared\nto work, but the effect was very small. Achievement was only a fraction higher for students who received an intervention than students in the control groups. By contrast, when only the highest-quality studies were examined, the effect disappeared.\nWhy might low-quality studies yield more promising results?\n\u201cWe found that teachers frequently knew which students had been assigned to receive the intervention,\u201d Burgoyne said. \u201cExpectations can influence study outcomes. Teachers may expect students who receive growth mindset training to work harder, which could, in turn, influence how they interact with those students and grade them.\u201d\n\u201cCouple that with financial incentives and popular-press hype,\u201d Burgoyne said, \u201cand you have a recipe for the widespread adoption of growth mindset interventions in schools without much solid evidence to back it up.\u201d\n\u201cThe concept of growth mindset is appealing; it\u2019s a feel-good idea,\u201d Macnamara said. \u201cBut the claims of growth mindset interventions do not stand up to rigorous scientific inquiry.\u201d\nCitation:\u00a0Macnamara, B.
