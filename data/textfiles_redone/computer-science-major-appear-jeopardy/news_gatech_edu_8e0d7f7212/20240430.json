Madabushi was invited back for Jeopardy!\u2019s High School Reunion Tournament, after appearing in the 2019 Teen Tournament with 26 other contestants.\nMadabushi grew up with an interest in trivia, inspired in part by his family\u2019s tradition of sitting together each night to watch Jeopardy!. And, in early 2019, he decided on a whim to take the\nJeopardy!\nonline aptitude test. To his surprise, he was invited to audition a few months later.\nMadabushi was one of around 300 students chosen for this opportunity in San Francisco. In the end, he was selected to compete with students from around the United States in the 2019 Teen Tournament. He finished in the quarterfinals of that tournament, winning $5,000.\nHe says he was extremely surprised and excited for the chance to compete once again on\nJeopardy!,\nas contestants who have already appeared once are not allowed to try out again, unless invited back.\nWith this latest opportunity to compete on the game show, Madabushi hopes to finish stronger than before. He says one of his greatest advantages is his buzzer speed.\n\u201cI think my biggest strength is being fast on the buzzer. In high school, I competed in a lot of buzzer competitions for Science Bowl, so I feel being fastest to the answers is what I\u2019m leaning on,\u201d Madabushi explained.\nThe winner of this 14-day reunion tournament will receive a $100,000 grand prize and a spot in the Tournament of Champions.\nWatch Madabushi compete today at 7:30 p.m. on NBC\u2019s\nJeopardy!\nhosted by\nThe Big Bang Theory\nactress Mayim Bialik.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nEvan Atkinson , Institute Social Media Officer\nEmail\neatkinson6@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
