They recently presented their research at the MIT Climate CoLab's Crowds & Climate Conference, held on September 28-29.\nTheir policy proposal, \u201cStrategic Investment to Scale-up Aviation Biofuel\u201d. Aviation has recognized the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and biofuels are proposed to have an immediate, substantial impact. They focused their efforts on China as country that could benefit from this move to biofuel based on \u201cits dependence on imported petroleum and its track record of work in new energy technologies.\u201d says Arulselvan.\nThe next step in the research is to have a workshop in China, to bring together leaders of biofuel industry, aviation, and policy makers in China. They welcome any participation or ideas to assist in their research.\nFor details on their work and the Climate CoLab, click here: http://climatecolab.org/contests/2016/aviation/c/proposal/1331659\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nClimate CoLab Proposal\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
