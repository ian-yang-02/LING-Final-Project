Perhaps easier than thought.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nEmail\nGeorgia Tech's broad array of Earth chemistry, astrophysics, and evolution research, bolstered by related engineering fields, could offer insight into the possibility of complex life on exoplanets. Much of our research in these areas is funded in part by NASA Astrobiology Institute.

Then they meticulously analyzed the molecules with latest technology and new algorithms.\nThey found that the molecules, called depsipeptides, formed quickly and abundantly under conditions that would have been common on prebiotic Earth, and with ingredients that would have likely been plentiful.\nAnd some of the depsipeptides evolved into new varieties in just a few days, an ability that, eons ago, could have accelerated the birth of long molecules, called peptides, that make up proteins.\nWithout cataclysm, please\nThe new NASA-affiliated research adds to a growing body of evidence suggesting that the first polymers of life may have arisen in variations of daily processes still observed on Earth today, such as the repeated drying and refilling of pond water. They may not have all zapped into existence as a result of blazing cataclysms, an image often associated with the creation of the first chemicals of life.\n\u201cWe want to stay away from scenarios that are not readily possible,\u201d said\nFacundo Fern\u00e1ndez, a professor in Georgia Tech\u2019s School of Chemistry and Biochemistry , and one of the study\u2019s principal investigators. \u201cDon\u2019t deviate from conditions that would have been realistic and reasonably common on prebiotic Earth. Don\u2019t invoke any unreasonable chemistry.\u201d\nScientists have long puzzled over how the very first proteins formed. Their long-chain molecules, polypeptides, can be tough to make in the lab under abiotic conditions.\nSome researchers have toiled to build tiny chains, or peptides, sometimes under more extreme scenarios that probably occurred\u00a0less often on early Earth. The yields have been modest, and the resulting peptides have had only a couple of component parts, whereas natural proteins have a large variety of them.\nStep-by-step evolution\nBut complex molecules of life likely did not arise in one dramatic step that produced final products. That\u2019s the hypothesis that drives the research of Fern\u00e1ndez and his colleagues at the\nNSF/NASA Center for Chemical Evolution , headquartered at Georgia Tech and based on close collaboration with the\nScripps Research Institute .\nInstead, multiple easier chemical steps produced plentiful in-between products that were useful in subsequent reactions that eventually led to the first biopolymers. The depsipeptides produced in this latest study could have served as such a chemical stepping stone.\nThey look a lot like regular peptides and can be found today in biological systems. \u201cMany antibiotics, for example, are depsipeptides,\u201d Fern\u00e1ndez said.\nFern\u00e1ndez, his Georgia Tech colleagues\nMartha Grover\nand\nNicholas Hud , and\nRam Krishnamurthy\nfrom Scripps published their\nstudy on August 28, 2017, in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences . First author\nJay Forsythe , formerly a postdoctoral researcher at Georgia Tech, is now an assistant professor at the College of Charleston. Research was funded by the National Science Foundation and the NASA Astrobiology Program.\nThe new study joins similar work about the formation of\nRNA precursors\non prebiotic Earth, and about possible\nscenarios for the formation of the first genes . The collective insights may someday help explain how first life arose on Earth and also aid astrobiologists in determining the probability of life existing on other planets.\nUnderstanding depsipeptide Lego\nTo understand depsipeptides and the significance of the researchers\u2019 results, it\u2019s helpful to start by looking at peptides, which are chains of amino acids. When the chains get really long they are called polypeptides, and then\u00a0proteins.\nLiving cells have machinery that reads instructions in DNA on how to link up amino acids in a specific order to build very specific peptides and proteins that have functions in a living cell. For a protein to have function in a cell, its polypeptide chains have to clump up like sticky yarn to form useful shapes.\nBefore cells and DNA existed on an Earth devoid of life, for polypeptides to form, amino acids had to somehow jostle together in puddles or on the banks of rivers or lakes to form chains. But\npeptide bonds\ncan be tough to form, especially long chains of them.\nAmino stand-in double\nOther bonds, called\nester bonds , form more easily, and they can link up amino acids with very similar molecules called\nhydroxy acids . Hydroxy acids are so much like amino acids that they can, in some cases, function as their stand-in doubles.\nThe researchers mixed three amino acids with three hydroxy acids in a water solution and they formed depsipeptides, chains of amino acids and hydroxy acids held together by intermittent ester and peptide bonds. The hydroxy acids acted as an enabler to put the chains together that would have otherwise been difficult to form.\nThe primordial soup may have lapped its depsipeptides onto rocks, where they dried out in the sun, then rain or dew dissolved them back into the soup, and that happened over and over. The researchers mimicked this cycle in the lab and watched as the depsipeptide\u00a0chains further developed.\nDeath Valley heat\n\u201cWe call it an environmental cycling approach to making these early peptides,\u201d said Fern\u00e1ndez, who is Vasser Woolley Foundation Chair in Bioanalytical Chemistry. Like nature: Make the soup, dry it out, repeat.\nIn the lab, the drying temperature was 85 degrees Celsius (185 degrees Fahrenheit), although the reaction has been shown to work at temperatures of 55 \u00a0and 65 degrees Celsius (131 to 149 degrees Fahrenheit). \u201cIf you think about early Earth having a lot of volcanic activity and an atmospheric mix that promoted warming, those temperatures are realistic on many parts of an early Earth,\u201d Fern\u00e1ndez said.\nEarly Earth took hundreds of millions of years to cool, and\ntemperatures in the hundreds of degrees\nare hypothesized to have been commonplace for a long time. Even today, the hottest deserts can reach over 55 degrees Celsius.\nEster do-si-do\nSince ester bonds break more easily, in the experiment, the chains tended to come apart more at the hydroxy acids and hold together between the amino acids, which were connected by the stronger peptide bonds. As a result, chains could re-form and link up more and more amino acids with each other into sturdier peptides.\nIn a kind of square-dance, the stand-in hydroxy acids often left their amino acid\u00a0partners in the chain, and new amino acids latched onto the chain in their place, where they held on tight. In fact, a number of the depsipeptides ended up being composed almost completely of amino acids and had only remnants of hydroxy acids.\n\u201cNow\u00a0we know how peptides can form easily,\u201d Fern\u00e1ndez said. \u201cNext, we want to find out what\u2019s needed to get to the level of a functional protein.\u201d\nREAD: Possible precursor of RNA forms spontaneously in water\n10,000,000,000,000 depsipeptides\nTo identify the more than 650 depsipeptides that formed, the researchers used mass spectrometry combined with ion mobility, which could be described as a wind tunnel for molecules. Along with mass, the additional mobility measurement gave the researchers data on the shape of the depsipeptides.\nAlgorithms created by Georgia Tech researcher\nAnton Petrov\nprocessed the data to finally identify the molecules.\nTo illustrate how potentially bountiful depsipeptides could have been on prebiotic Earth: The researchers had to limit the number of amino acids and hydroxy acids to three each. Had they taken 10 each instead, the number of theoretical depsipeptides could have climbed over 10,000,000,000,000.\n\u201cEase and bounty are key,\u201d Fern\u00e1ndez said. \u201cChemical evolution is more likely to progress when components it needs are plentiful and can join together under more ordinary conditions.\u201d\nAlso READ: Was the Secret Spice in Primal Gene Soup a Thickener?\nAlso READ: The work of the NSF/NASA Center for Chemical Evolution\nGeorgia Tech\u2019s Calvin Millar and Sheng-Sheng Yu also coauthored this study.
