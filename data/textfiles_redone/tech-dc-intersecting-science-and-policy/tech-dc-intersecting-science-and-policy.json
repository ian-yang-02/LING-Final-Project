But Tech grads are undaunted and are finding that a background in engineering is quite useful\n\u2014\nand welcome in Washington, D.C.\nMarc Canellas is going to Washington. He graduated in May with a doctorate in aerospace engineering and will spend a year in the nation\u2019s capital as an IEEE Congressional Science and Technology Fellow, serving as a science and technology advisor for one year beginning this fall. He will be assigned to a congressional office to help with issues of science and technology.\n\u201c[The congressperson] may not be on a formal committee that has \u2018science and technology\u2019 in the name explicitly, but science and technology issues are ubiquitous,\u201d said Canellas. \u201cI met with Rep. John Lewis\u2019 staff, and they\u2019re very interested in Atlanta\u2019s growth, Georgia Tech, and the airport. You might ask: \u2018Why does a civil rights icon care about science and technology? There are a lot of issues with surveillance, face recognition, and body cameras that are very technology dependent. And that affects people\u2019s civil rights. So, issues of ethics and morals have technology embedded in them.\u201d\nCanellas, who plans to attend law school after his fellowship, wants to combine law and technology.\n\u201cI love technology, but I think it has to be balanced with our morals and ethics, and thus our laws and regulations. That\u2019s where the \u2018pacing problem\u2019 comes in,\u201d he said. \u201cThe capability of science and technology is increasing at such a great pace, way faster than our laws or political norms can change, creating gaps in our society\u2019s legal and ethical oversight. We need people to bridge that gap between what\u2019s coming out of Silicon Valley and what\u2019s being governed in D.C., and I want to be one of those people.\u201d\nCanellas, who studied in the\nCognitive Engineering Center\nin the School of Aerospace Engineering, said there is a place for technologists to say: \u201cHere is what the technology is really doing as we understand it.\u201d The center designs and analyzes complex, safety-critical, human-technology interaction.\n\u201cIf there is a human and a computer involved, we, as engineers, want to make sure they interact and work together very well,\u201d he said. \u201cOur job is to make sure the design of cockpits or collision avoidance systems, or the management of air traffic control is done in such a beautiful way that the humans and the technology work seamlessly, so that everybody is safe and operating effectively.\u201d\nWhen he was applying to the doctoral program in aerospace engineering, Canellas originally wanted to build spacecraft. \u201cI wanted to be an astronaut, like every other kid.\u201d\nBut then he met with Karen Feigh, aerospace associate professor and director of the Cognitive Engineering Center, who told him about their work in human-technology interaction, and he thought: \u201cThat is the coolest thing I have ever heard of in my entire life.\u201d\nCanellas said, \u201cYou can do anything with this. So, if you want to work on submarines, ships, robots, computers, or phones, our methods are valuable. We apply it to aerospace because we like planes and spacecraft.\u201d\nWorking with Congress appeals to Canellas because he can apply a diverse set of cognitive engineering methods to help deal with people and technology. For example, if a congressperson is interested in a novel technology, Canellas has formal training and experience that can help.\n\u201cI would like to bring some of my expertise to Congress,\u201d he said. \u201cFor example, law enforcement is now using face recognition algorithms to identify people from pictures and videos. I can read the literature on face recognition, apply my expertise, and say, \u2018here\u2019s the general description and its potential. Here are the main issues of accuracy and bias. Here are the questions we should be asking not just about the technology but about their training, procedures, and organization. Oh, and here\u2019s a draft of a policy or standard that would be a good first step towards good governance.\u2019 That is already in my skill set, so I would like to use it.\u201d\nCanellas also can help bridge the gap when congresspersons need to speak with engineers about technological issues. And he would like to help them learn to communicate better with voters, regardless of political affiliation.\nEngineering Public Policy\nGretchen Goldman is the research director for The Center for Science and Democracy at the\nUnion of Concerned Scientists\nin Washington, DC. The Georgia Tech graduate leads research efforts on the role of science in public policy, focusing on topics ranging from scientific integrity in government decision-making, to political interference in science-based standards on hydraulic fracturing, climate change, sugar, and chemicals.\nThe organization develops science-based solutions to highly technical policy problems and gets them into the hands of members of Congress, government officials, the media, and the public. The goal is to help ensure that the scientific community can lend its expertise to a range of policy decisions that affect people\u2019s lives, from food safety to drug approvals to clean air and water standards.\nGoldman, who has master\u2019s and doctoral degrees in environmental engineering from Tech, largely works on federal policy, but occasionally works at the state or local level.\n\u201cThe training I got at Georgia Tech as a scientist taught me how science works and what is and isn\u2019t science. I carry that with me when I think about what I\u2019m doing here,\u201d Goldman said. \u201cI think a lot about how our role \u2014 being at the intersection of science and policy, and being a science-based advocacy group \u2014 is that we make sure what we do is based on solid science. I take that very seriously in thinking about how to advocate for change and inform policies while making sure we\u2019re being accurate and true to what science tells us.\u201d\nWhen Goldman enrolled at Georgia Tech she was not thinking about going into policy. As she went through the graduate program, she realized that she felt best suited for and there was more action around translating technical information in order to make better decisions.\n\u201cThat was a place where I could really make a difference \u2014 at that intersection of science and policy, and applying my engineering training to affecting change and making people\u2019s lives better,\u201d she said.\nWhile a Tech student, Goldman was a senator for the student government for a few years, and she chaired the Bicycle Infrastructure Improvements Committee which looked at ways to improve bicycle infrastructure on campus. She took advantage of the opportunities that allowed her to hone her skills in organizing and management, and to see what that science policy interface looked like.\n\u201cI had advisors that were very open about how I could apply my work to the science policy intersection to student groups on campus,\u201d she said. \u201cI was involved with students organizing for sustainability. And I did some direct lobbying at the Georgia level that gave me a good window into the policy realm and how you can apply technical knowledge into the policy space.\u201d\nToday, Goldman has some advice for science, technology and engineering students who may be considering working in the policy arena.\n\u201cYou know more than you think you know,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re in school, especially in engineering, you are aware of how much you don\u2019t know. But, when you enter the real world you realize you have a ton of expertise, and you are valuable in the policy space. There\u2019s a huge opportunity for scientists and people with technical training to contribute. In fact, we really need people with technical training to be involved in decision making at the federal level and all levels. I think Tech students would be very well suited for policy roles.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nCognitive Engineering Center\nUnion of Concerned Scientists\nGovernment & Community Relations internship opportunities\nContact\nVictor Rogers\nInstitute Communications\n404-894-6398\nEmail\nvictor.rogers@comm.gatech.edu\nAdditional information\nGeorgia Tech\u2019s Office of Government and Community Relations fosters meaningful work experiences in public service settings for Tech students and graduates.
