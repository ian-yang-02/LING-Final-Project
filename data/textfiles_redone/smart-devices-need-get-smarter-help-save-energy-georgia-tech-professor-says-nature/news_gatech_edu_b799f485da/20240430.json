Despite their often diminutive physical footprint, such devices already exact an enormous draw on the energy supply\u2014consuming about 15% of the global growth in electricity demand.\nWriting in the September issue of\nNature Energy,\nAsensio\nsays that with forecasts calling for the installation of billions more of such devices in coming years, the need is ever more acute for ways to encourage energy conservation and address consumer misperceptions about power use.\n\u201cGiven the growth of connected, smart devices in the home, which are easily expected to outpace traditional consumer electronics, it will increasingly be harder for households to understand the uses of electricity in the home, as these devices continuously draw power for two-way, on-call communications,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is what economists refer to as a behavioral failure and it brings to center stage the need for behavioral interventions that can correct consumer misperceptions of household energy use.\u201d\nAsensio\u2019s article is a companion to a paper in the same\nNature Energy\nissue detailing research from scholars at Indiana University. That paper examines the effectiveness of two types of interventions meant to help correct consumer misperceptions about which appliances use the most energy. The randomized online experiment by the Indiana University researchers examined the effect of one intervention in which respondents were told about energy usage among devices that consumed power on the high and low ends of the scale, as well as another intervention that told study participants that large heating and cooling appliances use \u201cmore energy than people think.\u201d\nWhile the first scale-use intervention, called an anchoring intervention, had no impact on participants\u2019 ability to identify effective behaviors, the second intervention \u2014 which simply gave participants an easy to understand rule of thumb to estimate energy use \u2014 did. The conclusion: simply offering a conservation message may not be as important as how the conservation message is framed to consumers.\nAsensio also has studied such framing interventions as part of a growing body of work by behavioral researchers. In a paper published in 2015 in the\nProceedings of the National Academies of Sciences , Asensio reported on a study he conducted using high-frequency appliance monitoring data with environment and health-based information strategies highlighting the negative impacts of electricity production. Such individualized messages, which were delivered through a website and emails, resulted in an 8% reduction in power consumption versus a control group. But Asensio found that consumers took very different approaches to which appliances were targeted for conservation when the detailed breakdowns of energy use were disclosed using mobile apps at the point of use.\nWith connected devices poised to fundamentally shift patterns of electricity use, Asensio said targeted information about invisible power consumption is needed at the place where it will do the most good: built into such devices and the smartphone apps that drive them.\nIn other words, Asensio says, connected devices and apps should be designed to give consumers these science-based behavioral cues in ways that prompt them to make better decisions about the power consumption in their homes.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s exciting about this research is that direct communication to consumers is potentially a very low-cost policy,\u201d he said. \u201cThe idea that we could couple leading-edge smart devices with behavioral science-based interventions can be a powerful approach to achieving large-scale conservation goals.\u201d\nAsensio\u2019s article for the October 2019 edition of\nNature Energy , \u201cCorrecting Consumer Misperception,\u201d is available online at\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41560-019-0472-5 .\nThe School of Public Policy is a unit of the\nIvan Allen College of Liberal Arts .\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nAn 'Interdisciplinary Ecosystem': Two Ivan Allen College of Liberal Arts teams \u2026\nGeorgia Smart Communities Challenge Kicks Off in Albany\nOmar Asensio Awarded 40 for 40 Fellowship by the Association for Public Policy \u2026\nContact\nMichael Pearson michael.pearson@iac.gatech.edu\n404.894.2290\nEmail\nmichael.pearson@iac.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
