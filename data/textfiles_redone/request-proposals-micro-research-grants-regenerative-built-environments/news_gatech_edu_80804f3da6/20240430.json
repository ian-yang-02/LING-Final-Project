It will provide micro research grants ($50 to $500) to eligible participants to conduct limited, but novel, research experiments, design exercises, crafting of models or prototypes, or development and analysis of datasets. Research relevant to the topic of regenerative built environments is required. If you are thinking, \u201cwhat is a regenerative built environment?\u201d, then we recommend a review of\u00a0 www.livingbuilding.gatech.edu . The research must incorporate the campus itself or its operations. We encourage submittals that explore ways in which our campus can continue to innovate, demonstrate, prove, and promote the adoption of best and next practices in regenerative design and operations. In your proposal, define \u201cregenerative\u201d design and/or operations as it pertains to your proposed project. We encourage you to relate the project to one or more of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs,\u00a0 https://sdgs.un.org/goals ). Proposals are especially sought from staff and students at Georgia Tech that have not traditionally been directly involved in research, though proposals from all members of the Georgia Tech community are welcome.\nGrant Size: \u00a0Requests for funding are expected to range between $50 and $500\nProposal Due Date: \u00a0Email a 2-page proposal by May 31, 2021 to Kamilah Roberts at\u00a0 kamilah.roberts@sustain.gatech.edu ;\u00a0subject line of the email should read \" [Your name] - Proposal for\u00a0Micro Research Grant. \"\nProject Start Date: \u00a0June 15, 2021\nEligibility: \u00a0Georgia Tech enrolled students and current faculty and staff.
