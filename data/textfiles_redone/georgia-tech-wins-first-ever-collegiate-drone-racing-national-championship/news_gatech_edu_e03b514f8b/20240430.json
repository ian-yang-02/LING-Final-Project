It is the first year a national championship has been organized for pilots of unmanned aircraft to compete against each other at the college level.\nTwenty-seven universities fielded teams of pilots who navigated obstacle courses flying custom-designed drones. The course was designed for testing both a pilot\u2019s speed and precision.\nGeorgia Tech was led by aerospace engineering major Nick Willard, who flew in the final race to seal the victory. Willard competes in many non-collegiate Drone Racing League events, and has won racing events televised on ESPN. He is affectionately known by drone racing enthusiasts as \u201cWild Willy.\u201d\nWillard was joined by Seth Ableidinger and Davis Engelman, two mechanical engineering majors, who held strong in preliminary races to put Georgia Tech into a solid lead.\nTheir times and rankings, combined with Willard\u2019s, put Georgia Tech into first place among the field.\nThe University of California, Berkeley finished second, with Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in third, and host Purdue University coming in fourth.\nThe Georgia Tech team brought home a total of $15,000 in equipment and prizes.\nSee footage from the first collegiate drone racing championship.\n(Note, the final race begins at 6:53:53.
