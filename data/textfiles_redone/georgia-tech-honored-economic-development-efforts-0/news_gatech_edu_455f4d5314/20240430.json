Tech received the \u201cInnovation\u201d award for its technology-based focus in its economic development efforts. Tech\u2019s Enterprise Innovation Institute (EI2), its key statewide business outreach and economic development arm, is a critical component of those efforts, as well as commercialization of inventions, and other initiatives. The award follows APLU\u2019s designation of Tech as an Innovation and Economic Prosperity University earlier this summer. The IEP awards, announced Monday, Nov. 3, in Orlando, highlight the efforts of APLU\u2019s member institutions to beef up economic development in their states through a number of initiatives, including innovation and entrepreneurship, technology transfer, talent and workforce development, and other efforts. Along with Tech, APLU recognized the University of Massachusetts- Boston, North Carolina State University, and the University of Houston. \u2014 By P\u00e9ralte C.
