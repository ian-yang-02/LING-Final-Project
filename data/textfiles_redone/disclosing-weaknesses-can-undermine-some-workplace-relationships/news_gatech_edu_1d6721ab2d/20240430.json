But between coworkers, that\u2019s not always true.\nThat is at the center of new research conducted at Georgia Institute of Technology, where researchers looked into how personal disclosures in a workplace environment could impact the relationships between coworkers and task effectiveness.\nIn the study published in January in the journal Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, the researchers found that for higher status individuals, disclosing a weakness negatively affected their relationship and task effectiveness with their lowers status partners.\n\u201cWe may think that sharing personal information is always a good thing, but what we found is that when higher status individuals, which could in real situations include star employees, share personal information that highlights a potential shortcoming, it can affect the way they are perceived by coworkers,\u201d said Dana Harari, a doctoral student at Georgia Tech\u2019s Scheller College of Business. \u201cThis is important because it could undermine their ability to be an effective manager.\u201d\nThe team, which included Kerry Gibson, now an assistant professor at Babson College and Jennifer Carson Marr, now an assistant professor at the University of Maryland, focused on task-oriented relationships such as those found in a workplace.\nThe researchers devised three laboratory experiments during which a total of 762 participants completed virtual tasks with either a higher status or peer status partner. During the task, the \u201ccoworker,\u201d who was actually a confederate in the study, disclosed personal information that could be perceived either as a weakness, a positive or neutral.\nThe researchers found that although the type of disclosure did not affect peer status disclosers, higher status individuals who disclosed a weakness experienced a \u201cstatus penalty.\u201d As a result, higher status disclosers were liked less, and participants resisted their influence more during the task.\n\u201cA lot of the current conversations that we hear about leadership is that we want leaders to be authentic and to bring their true selves to work, but our findings suggest that if doing so reveals vulnerability initially such as sharing their flaws, it could have a negative impact on how well they\u2019ll be able to influence the people that they work with,\u201d Harari said.\nThe findings are particularly notable because in organizations, higher status individuals may be motivated to disclose information about their weaknesses to coworkers in the hopes of developing a closer relationship and working better together as\u00a0a result, the researchers wrote. Or, in some cases, the disclosing individual may hope to relieve the stress of trying to conceal weaknesses.\nBut that \u201cstatus loss\u201d could lead to unintended outcomes, such as the discloser having less influence and experiencing more conflict within their team, the researchers wrote.\n\u201cIt is especially interesting that although self-disclosing weakness signaled vulnerability for everyone, only higher status disclosers suffered from this \u2018status penalty,\u2019\u201d Harari said. \u201cThus, although higher status disclosers may feel closer to their coworkers after disclosing information themselves, they may not realize that the receiver may not feel closer to them.\u201d\nCITATION:\nKerry Roberts Gibson, Dana Harari, Jennifer Carson Marr,\u00a0\u201cWhen sharing hurts: How and why self-disclosing weakness undermines the task-oriented relationships of higher status disclosers,\u201d (Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, January 2018). https://doi.org/10.1016/j.obhdp.2017.09.001\nAdditional Images\nContact\nJohn Toon\nResearch News\nEmail\njohn.toon@comm.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
