As a young girl, she asked her parents to drive her to the nearby recycling center so she could deliver the neighborhood recycling. There was no formal pickup service in her neighborhood, so she did it herself.\u00a0 Her passion for recycling stems from her \u201cbelief in the intrinsic value of the resources that make up our waste and finding the best use for those resources to be used again and again.\u201d\nBrodzik joined Georgia Tech in 2019 as a recycling coordinator for Infrastructure and Sustainability (then Facilities Management) and, now as a campus sustainability manager, she oversees the solid waste and recycling efforts on campus. Working with a team of nine, the department is responsible for collecting 400 tons of landfill waste and more than 150 tons of recycling each month.\nA 2017 graduate of Georgia College and State University with a B.S. in economics, Brodzik worked in the college\u2019s Office of Sustainability and spearheaded the campus move-in recycling program through her involvement in the Student Government Association. After graduation and a stint with the environmental sustainability team at Delta Air Lines, she landed her dream job at Georgia Tech. Her long-term goals are to continue to expand campus waste diversion programs and grow in a leadership capacity.\nTo reach these goals, Brodzik realized she needed more academic training in sustainability. She used the\nGeorgia Tech Tuition Assistance Program (TAP) , and is celebrating receiving her master\u2019s degree this weekend.\nIncreasing AWAREness\nAsked what she is proudest of during her employment at Georgia Tech, Brodzik said it was the expansion of the AWARE program (Actively Working to Achieve Resource Efficiency) and the continued support it has received from the Office of the President.\nAWARE\u00a0 has grown under her guidance from a 2009 pilot program in the Carnegie Building to one that encompasses the entire campus. It allows building occupants, primarily staff, to get a personal understanding of their waste footprint by emptying their own deskside bins into central waste and recycling stations within each building.\nThe pandemic was the perfect opportunity to expand the program across campus, as implementation alleviated some of the burden on a stretched-thin custodial staff. Custodians only had to pick up waste from one area within a work environment, as opposed to picking up from each desk. This labor-saving initiative\u00a0 increases sustainability awareness among employees as well.\nSuch innovation has been recognized by many of her peers. Brodzik recently received the Georgia Tech Staff Award for Leading by Example in Sustainability. This honor is given to an employee who leads by example through inspiration, action, and achievement of sustainability goals.\n\u201cSustainability is at the forefront of my mind with every choice I make, but I always keep the saying \u2018We don\u2019t need a few people doing zero waste perfectly, we need everyone doing it imperfectly\u2019 in mind. I try to bring my coffee and my lunch in reusable containers, buy secondhand clothing, purchase items that have no packaging or recyclable packaging, sort my recycling, and save things for hard-to-recycle drop off.\u201d\nBrodzik encourages others to make the same Earth-friendly choices and has been able to share that message as a co-chair for Georgia Tech\u2019s Earth Week celebration for the past three years. Encouraging and collaborating with students is especially important to her, and she hopes one day there will be sustainability programming required for all first-year students.\n\u201cUndergraduates are becoming more and more aware of their environmental impact,\u201d she said. \u201cEach semester there are more students reaching out to learn about what happens to campus waste and how the recycling process works. It excites me to see their interest and know they want the expansion of compost and hard-to-recycle material collection.\u201d\nBrodzik often partners with students to conduct waste audits, aids in their research about the waste industry, and provides guidance via social media and campus events about what is and what isn\u2019t recyclable. After one presentation to the Students Organizing for Sustainability group, a student reached out to her about what he observed about campus waste during the pandemic. As space use on campus changed and more people opted to study and eat outdoors, he realized there could be better placement of campus waste and recycling containers \u2014 moving those containers that did not get used as much to areas with higher traffic. With Brodzik\u2019s support and encouragement, the student shared his ideas with leadership in Infrastructure and Sustainability. His suggestions are currently under consideration within the unit.\nIf chairing a successful campus event, receiving a staff award, and earning your master's doesn\u2019t make for a good year, Brodzik is also recently engaged. No doubt, sustainability will be high on the list of wedding priorities.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nCathy Brim\nCommunications Officer II\nInfrastructure & Sustainability\nEmail\ncathy.brim@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
