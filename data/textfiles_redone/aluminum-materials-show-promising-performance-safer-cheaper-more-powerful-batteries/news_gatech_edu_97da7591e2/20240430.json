For the past three decades, lithium-ion batteries have reigned supreme \u2014 proving their performance in smartphones, laptops, and electric vehicles.\nBut battery researchers have begun to approach the limits of lithium-ion. As next-generation long-range vehicles and electric aircraft start to arrive on the market, the search for safer, cheaper, and more powerful battery systems that can outperform lithium-ion is ramping up.\nA team of researchers from the Georgia Institute of Technology, led by\nMatthew McDowell , associate professor in the\nGeorge W. Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering\nand the\nSchool of Materials Science and Engineering , is using aluminum foil to create batteries with higher energy density and greater stability. The team\u2019s new battery system,\ndetailed in\nNature Communications , could enable electric vehicles to run longer on a single charge and would be cheaper to manufacture \u2014 all while having a positive impact on the environment.\n\u201cWe are always looking for batteries with higher energy density, which would enable electric vehicles to drive for longer distances on a charge,\u201d McDowell said. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting that we can use aluminum as a battery material, because it\u2019s cost-effective, highly recyclable, and easy to work with.\u201d\nThe idea of making batteries with aluminum isn\u2019t new. Researchers investigated its potential in the 1970s, but it didn\u2019t work well.\nWhen used in a conventional lithium-ion battery, aluminum fractures and fails within a few charge-discharge cycles, due to expansion and contraction as lithium travels in and out of the material. Developers concluded that aluminum wasn\u2019t a viable battery material, and the idea was largely abandoned.\nNow, solid-state batteries have entered the picture. While lithium-ion batteries contain a flammable liquid that can lead to fires, solid-state batteries contain a solid material that's not flammable and, therefore, likely safer. Solid-state batteries also enable the integration of new high-performance active materials, as shown in this research.\nThe project began as a collaboration between the Georgia Tech team and Novelis, a leading manufacturer of aluminum and the world\u2019s largest aluminum recycler, as part of the Novelis Innovation Hub at Georgia Tech. The research team knew that aluminum would have energy, cost, and manufacturing benefits when used as a material in the battery\u2019s anode \u2014 the negatively charged side of the battery that stores lithium to create energy \u2014 but pure aluminum foils were failing rapidly when tested in batteries.\nThe team decided to take a different approach. Instead of using pure aluminum in the foils, they added small amounts of other materials to the aluminum to create foils with particular \u201cmicrostructures,\u201d or arrangements of different materials. They tested over 100 different materials to understand how they would behave in batteries.\n\u201cWe needed to incorporate a material that would address aluminum\u2019s fundamental issues as a battery anode,\u201d said Yuhgene Liu, a Ph.D. student in McDowell\u2019s lab and first author on the paper. \u201cOur new aluminum foil anode demonstrated markedly improved performance and stability when implemented in solid-state batteries, as opposed to conventional lithium-ion batteries.\u201d\nThe team observed that the aluminum anode could store more lithium than conventional anode materials, and therefore more energy. In the end, they had created high energy density batteries that could potentially outperform lithium-ion batteries.\n\u201cOne of the benefits of our aluminum anode that we're excited about is that it enables performance improvements, but it also can be very cost-effective,\u201d McDowell said. \u201cOn top of that, when using a foil directly as a battery component, we actually remove a lot of the manufacturing steps that would normally be required to produce a battery material.\u201d\nShort-range electric aircraft are in development by several companies, but the limiting factor is batteries. Today\u2019s batteries do not hold enough energy to power aircraft to fly distances greater than 150 miles or so. New battery chemistries are needed, and the McDowell team\u2019s aluminum anode batteries could open the door to more powerful battery technologies.\n\u201cThe initial success of these aluminum foil anodes presents a new direction for discovering other potential battery materials,\u201d Liu said. \"This hopefully opens pathways for reimagining a more energy-optimized and cost-effective battery cell architecture.\u201d\nThe team is currently working to scale up the size of the batteries to understand how size influences the aluminum\u2019s behavior. The group is also actively exploring other materials and microstructures with the goal of creating very cheap foils for battery systems.\n\u201cThis is a story about a material that was known about for a long time, but was largely abandoned early on in battery development,\u201d McDowell said. \u201cBut with new knowledge, combined with a new technology \u2014 the solid-state battery \u2014 we've figured out how we can rejuvenate the idea and achieve really promising performance.\u201d\nFunding : Support is acknowledged from Novelis, Inc.
