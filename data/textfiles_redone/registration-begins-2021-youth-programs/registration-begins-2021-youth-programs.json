For those on campus who work with youth programs, now is the time to consider registering your program for next year.\nThe 2021 Youth Programs Registration form is now live and open on the\nYouth Programs website . As a reminder, youth programs at Georgia Tech run on a calendar year basis, not an academic year. All youth programs must submit a registration form for review and approval at the start of the new year. The form must be submitted at least 30 days prior to the start of the program.\nA youth program is an event that is designed specifically for minors where Georgia Tech faculty, staff, or students have direct contact with the participating minors. For those trying to determine whether their program falls under the umbrella of a youth program, this\ninfographic\ncan help you navigate and make that decision.\nAs 2021 approaches, the number of Covid-19 cases continues to increase. A great way to minimize the spread of the virus and keep the Georgia Tech community safe is to offer youth programs virtually. \u201cThis alternative method still provides an opportunity for youth to receive the growth and development they need to succeed, and many programs made the switch over the summer and fall,\u201d said Sally Robertson, counsel, Ethics and Compliance.\nThe registration and approval process remains the same for virtual programs as it does for the in-person program. However, there are a few differences to consider when hosting a youth program online rather than on campus.\nFor more information and resources on virtual youth programs, visit the\nVirtual Youth Programs\npage on the Youth Programs website. Questions can be directed to Sally Robertson at\nsally.robertson@carnegie.gatech.edu .\nVirtual Programs Still Require:\nRegistration Form\nThe registration form must be submitted no less than 30 days prior to the start of the program.\nThe registration form can be found on the Youth Programs website.\nBackground Checks\nBackground checks are run through HR.\nThey are required for all those in direct contact with minors.\nEven in an online setting, a videoconference or an email is still considered direct contact.\nTraining\nTraining is administered throug D2L for employees and through the Training Request form for students and non-employees.\nTraining is required for all those in direct contact with minors.\nStaff and Volunteer Code of Conduct\nAll staff and volunteers, whether in direct contact or not, are required to sign the Staff and Volunteer Code of Conduct.\nBecause virtual programs look a little different in terms of online expectations and behavior, there is a new code of conduct specifically for virtual programs.\nIt can be found on the Youth Programs website under Virtual Youth Programs.\nOther Changes and Requirements to Note\nRule of Three\nWith virtual programs, the supervision ratio changes to what is known as the \u2018Rule of Three.\u2019\nThis means that in order to prevent a minor from being left alone with an adult chaperone, there must always be at least two adults on all communications, whether through email or videoconference.\nThis way there are always at least three people present: one child and two adults.\nApproved Platforms\nIn order to prevent hacking and unauthorized sharing of personal or sensitive information, all virtual programs must use a Georgia Tech approved platform.\nThis means that Georgia Tech already has an account and an agreement in place with the vendor.\nA list of approved video collaboration tools can be found on the Services and Support website.\nMandatory Reporter\nBecause virtual programs offer a unique insight into a minor\u2019s home and family life, the mandatory reporter requirements still apply.\nFor those staff and volunteers who may see something of concern through a videoconference, there is a responsibility to say something.\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nYouth Programs\nContact\nSally Robertson\nEthics and Compliance\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
