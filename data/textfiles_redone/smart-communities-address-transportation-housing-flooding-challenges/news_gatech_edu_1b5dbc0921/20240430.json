(Credit: Russell Clark, Georgia Tech)\nApr 15, 2019\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nFour Georgia communities are exploring innovative technologies and collaborating with local partners and Georgia Institute of Technology research teams to help drive the state\u2019s smart development.\nGeorgia Tech leads the pilot\nGeorgia Smart Communities Challenge , which supports one-year projects to develop and implement smart design solutions to some of the biggest challenges facing the state.\nThe four selected localities were chosen from a pool of applicants statewide.The cities of Albany and Chamblee and the counties of Chatham and Gwinnett are focusing on pilot projects to improve local housing investments, address traffic and transportation challenges, and develop more targeted flooding forecasts of storms and sea level rise along Georgia\u2019s coast.\nA local government coordinates each project. But community and neighborhood groups, industry, and others are crucial collaborators. A Georgia Tech researcher conducts studies and provides guidance in pursuit of each project\u2019s goals, supported by graduate and undergraduate students.\nEach community has received $50,000 in grants and $25,000 from Georgia Tech in research support. Communities also raised matched funds. Georgia Power is the lead sponsor, with additional financial support from the Atlanta Regional Commission. The work began in September 2018 and will continue through September 2019.\nStudents are engaged through the research projects but also through two additional summer programs. The\nGeorgia Smart Community Corps\nis a full-time, paid summer fellowship for Georgia Tech students to become part of the project team. It is a joint collaboration with the Strategic Energy Institute, Center for Serve-Learn-Sustain, Center for Career Discovery and Development, and the Student Government Association.\nThe Georgia Tech Civic Data Science Program, led by\nEllen Zegura\nand\nChristopher Le Dantec , competitively recruits students nationally to come to the Atlanta campus for the summer and work in smaller teams with the Georgia Smart community on data analytics.\nAnd the competition will soon begin for the next group of communities, to be announced in June.\n\u201cWe define \u2018smart development\u2019 as the integration and application of technologies to improve the quality of life,\u201d said Debra Lam, managing director of Smart Cities and Inclusive Innovation at Georgia Tech. These advanced tools can be intelligent infrastructures, information, and communication technologies, Internet of Things devices, and other computational or digital systems, such as data centers and portals, web and smartphone applications, and automated digital services.\n\u201cThere is a misconception that smart community innovations always must start in a major city and trickle down to smaller places,\u201d said Lam. \u201cBut innovations can trickle up as well. They can be developed more quickly in smaller communities because you have all stakeholders in the room \u2014 the mayor and city manager, public agencies, community and neighborhood groups, industry and business. A next step will be to spread what\u2019s learned from these smart development projects to other Georgia communities and beyond.\u201d\nSmart Sea Level Tools for Emergency Planning and Response\nClimate change is driving sea levels higher, increasing flooding events during coastal storms and extreme high tides in Chatham County. But the county has only one official water level gauge, located at Fort Pulaski. The Georgia coast, however, is a complex environment where rising water impacts can vary dramatically from place to place.\n\u201cSome neighborhoods are flooding more frequently now, while in other neighborhoods not far away the flooding is more modest or erratic, depending on which way the wind is blowing, how much rain falls, and many other factors,\u201d said\nRussell Clark , Georgia Tech senior research scientist in the College of Computing.\nThat\u2019s why residents want more targeted flood warnings and forecasts.\nChatham County is using its Smart Communities support to partner with Georgia Tech researchers to develop a sensor network partnered with data analytics for more accurate, localized flooding forecasts for improved emergency planning and response.\n\u201cCoastal communities are desperate for solutions,\u201d said\nKim Cobb , the project\u2019s faculty leader, Georgia Power Chair, and professor in the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences. \u201cThrough many partnerships, Georgia Tech can design strategies to help communities adapt to climate change and sea level rise. We see this pilot as only the first step of a multi-year effort to advance real solutions with different combinations of partners, expertise, and funding.\u201d\nLocal high school students are helping to build and install a new batch of 30 sensors that will soon augment the 12 units already deployed. The sensor network will transmit data to computer models for analysis and prediction of storm strength and flooding.\nThe Smart Sea Level Sensor Project is a partnership among Chatham Emergency Management Agency officials, City of Savannah officials, and Georgia Tech scientists and engineers. The pilot project\u2019s data could be used to plan more resilient bridge, road, and water treatment infrastructure. The sensors could be adapted later to collect other environmental monitoring data, including rainfall and water quality parameters.\n\u201cResidents are excited to see that localized sensor data will be visible for them,\u201d said Clark. \u201cWe hear a lot of \u2018thank you for doing this in my neighborhood.\u2019\u201d\nEmanuele Di Lorenzo , professor of ocean and climate dynamics, will integrate sensor data into models for predictive flood-risk assessments specifically for the Chatham County coast. David Frost, Elizabeth and Bill Higginbotham Professor of civil engineering, will provide resilience planning tools for community leaders.\nResidents can offer their input during a May 16 showcase for the project sponsored by the Georgia Smart Communities Program. On smartphones and iPads, Georgia Tech undergraduates will guide residents through web-based visualizations of flood-risk scenarios for different coastal locations with augmented reality tools.\n\u201cWe continue to look for community feedback, which is so important,\u201d said Cobb. \u201cThere will be many more opportunities for local community members, students, and educators to get involved.\u201d\nAlbany Housing Data Initiative\nWhy do public investments in housing and infrastructure fail to revitalize some blighted neighborhoods? Albany, a city in the southwest corner of the state, is drawing on Georgia Smart support and guidance to develop and evaluate an automated housing registry that could help answer this question.\n\u201cAs is the case in many communities, housing has fallen into disrepair in some Albany neighborhoods,\u201d said\nOmar Isaac Asensio , assistant professor in the Georgia Tech School of Public Policy and principal investigator for the Albany project. \u201cAbandoned or uninhabitable properties have been purchased and cleaned up. But the community says, \u2018We're spending a lot of money on revitalization, but because data are siloed in different city departments and are not easily accessible, it\u2019s hard for us to really quantify the benefits of these investments.\u2019 In an effort to promote transparency, the city wants to integrate and analyze Albany\u2019s housing data, which would help the community answer questions about the effectiveness of various policies or programs designed to help neighborhoods.\u201d\nFor example, the Community Home Investment Program (CHIP) assists low- and moderate- income households with up to $25,000 in home repairs that affect the health or safety of those residing in the home. Eligible repairs include costly items such as roof replacement, heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems, and other energy efficiency measures. Today there is no way to link housing investment information with energy performance data in the city. As a result, the data needed to evaluate the effectiveness of housing programs are inaccessible, not just to the public.\nAsensio\u2019s team is collaborating with the city to bring together multiple databases to map housing address information as well as 10 years\u2019 worth of utility records held by the city. Additional information from other city departments, including transit, code enforcement data, crime data, and other open data is part of the overall initiative, and will be added later.\n\u201cUnder the leadership of Steven Carter, Albany\u2019s chief information officer, we\u2019ve already made strides on data collection, aggregation, and curation,\u201d he said. \u201cNow an open-data portal needs to be built, and data from more departments will be integrated into one place.\u201d Using record linkage and statistical algorithms, the Georgia Tech team will create maps to visualize locations of blight and housing investments and tell the hidden stories behind the data, backed by rigorous analysis.\nAlbany is hosting participatory design workshops for the public and others to develop priorities about the initiatives that can be run through the portal and ArcGIS Hub in collaboration with Georgia Tech\u2019s Christopher Le Dantec and Debra Lam. Project partners include Dougherty County, the city\u2019s Department of Community and Economic Development, and the nonprofit Fight Albany Blight.\n\u201cWe need input from both the public and private sectors about what\u2019s important to them because ultimately this process is meant to benefit communities,\u201d Asensio said. The open-data portal will evolve with new data that the city adds over time, helping officials to do their jobs, improving fiscal efficiency and enhancing transparency throughout city government.\nUrban policy scientists are often stymied by lack of access to data. \u201cThe Albany initiative allows researchers access to granular data about public investment and performance needed for rigorous policy and program evaluation,\u201d he said. \u201cThis project could provide a blueprint to other cities to open up and visualize city data in collaboration with the academic research community, the public, government, and industry. Albany\u2019s experience will be indispensable for other communities in our state, putting the city on the map for developing the latest analytical tools on open data.\u201d\nConnected Vehicle Technology Master Plan\nSuburban Gwinnett County, northeast of Atlanta, has experienced sprawling growth and increasingly heavy traffic in recent decades. County leaders, looking for solutions, took note of Atlanta\u2019s North Avenue Smart Corridor and similar high-tech projects around the country. Smart technologies can improve traffic flow and driver safety when vehicles share real-time locations with each other and with traffic signals. High-tech sensors on vehicles and roadways tell connected vehicles when to maneuver to avoid collisions, reducing crashes and traffic snarls on suburban arteries.\nNow Gwinnett County is partnering with Georgia Smart in a project to engage multiple stakeholders across the state to set the standard for application of connected vehicle technology that can improve mobility and traffic safety.\nThe county aims to develop and implement a master plan for autonomous real-time data sharing among connected vehicle applications, signals, and other roadway sensors. The Peachtree Industrial Boulevard Corridor has been chosen as the pilot smart corridor for technology deployment, which is scheduled to begin later in 2019.\nFirst, though, the county needs accurate baseline data about current traffic patterns.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had access to high-fidelity traffic signal data, but data from vehicles on the road are very sparse,\u201d said\nAngshuman Guin , the project\u2019s faculty leader and senior research engineer in the School of Civil and Environmental Engineering.\n\u201cWe were only getting a location point for emergency response vehicles every five minutes, but we need GPS points every second to understand the bottlenecks in traffic, as well as where and why the vehicles are losing time on the roadway during an emergency response.\u201d He is collaborating with the county fire chief to outfit 15 fire department vehicles with Georgia Tech-designed sensor packages.\n\u201cWe are using the fire department data to know exactly where and how long the delays are for emergency response vehicles \u2014 and compare those data to signal data. Was a delay associated with the signal being red? Or was it associated with traffic alone? This study is only possible because of our collaboration with the county, the fire department, and the other partners involved. We would not be able to gather the data we need without them.\u201d\nGuin will help the county assess the benefits of Connected Vehicle applications such as Emergency Vehicle Preemption, which help responders reach emergency scenes more quickly and safely. He will also simulate traffic operations and apply safety analyses across all systems.\n\u201cWe are helping the county develop strategies, leveraging connected vehicle technology, for extending the benefits of preemption by implementing anticipatory queue flush operations at intersections to reduce the delays experienced by emergency vehicles, and to also improve safety at intersections,\u201d he said.\nGwinnett County and Georgia Tech are collaborating on the project with the Georgia Department of Transportation and the cities of Berkeley Lake, Duluth, Norcross, and Suwanee.\nMost connected-vehicle pilot efforts focus on interstates or high-density business districts. But many commuters and other drivers in the Atlanta metro spend more miles on suburban roadways than in the city.\nSuburban arterials are typically more challenging for smart communications technologies. Heavily traveled suburban roads with higher operating speeds and irregularly spaced intersections make driving more complex and dangerous. That\u2019s why the suburban Gwinnett County corridor could form the backbone of the Connected Vehicle Technology Master Plan to improve driving experience with connected vehicle technology across city and county lines throughout the state.\nChamblee Shared Autonomous Vehicle Study\nThe city of Chamblee is attracting young people and others who seek a walkable, lively urban experience without the steep rents of Atlanta\u2019s popular, higher-density neighborhoods. The Chamblee MARTA rail station in suburban DeKalb County has been a crucial drawing card for commuters relocating to apartments in the city\u2019s redeveloping core.\nChamblee has succeeded in redeveloping properties near MARTA with urban apartments and new restaurants. \u201cNow the city wants to expand local transit opportunities to link the MARTA station to other nearby neighborhoods, some with redevelopment projects already underway,\u201d said\nEllen Dunham-Jones , director of the Georgia Tech urban design program.\nChamblee is using Georgia Smart funding to partner with a Georgia Tech team, led by Dunham-Jones, to study how improving urban design and passenger experiences can help build ridership for an experimental mode of transportation \u2014 the shared autonomous vehicle.\nChamblee anticipates operating an autonomous shuttle along a mile of Peachtree Road with five stops for 10 hours a day, seven days a week. A second phase could extend the shuttle east to Assembly Yards, a mixed-use development under construction in Doraville. At first, the shuttle would operate semi-autonomously with an onboard attendant in case of emergencies.\nThe Georgia Tech team is developing a set of recommendations for the city and a best practices manual to improve the user experience of getting to, waiting for, and riding on autonomous shuttle buses. How might they expand walkability throughout Chamblee and build social capital? Can bus stops serve as community infrastructure? The guide could be applied in other communities in Georgia and around the country.\nDunham-Jones and Ph.D. student Zachary Lancaster studied 18 autonomous shuttle projects in pilot stages worldwide, the great majority of which operate on private streets or in office parks. They interviewed industry experts, visited pilot projects, and surveyed potential passengers of Chamblee\u2019s shuttle.\nThe autonomous shuttle experience must be appealing to compete with other transit options including private cars, electric scooters, and ride-share services.\n\u201cOnce the shuttle is operating, it\u2019s important to have a data management plan that allows for feedback from users,\u201d she said. \u201cThat will help the city improve the shuttle system by learning more about how people respond to it.\u201d\nThe pilot project will also develop an operations plan for the shuttle and conduct preliminary engineering while engaging the community through public meetings, city strolls, and other events. Other city partners include the City of Doraville, Stantec, MARTA, and the Assembly Community Improvement District.\nIntroducing small autonomous transit vehicles to city streets could eventually transform how people get around.\n\u201cWith autonomous shared vehicles, you could replace the typical big bus that comes once an hour with four or five small shuttles along the same route arriving every 10 minutes, and that would be a game changer for encouraging more people to use transit,\u201d she said.\nConcluding the Projects and Next Steps\nAs the inaugural Georgia Smart projects draw to a close in September, the team with support from the Strategic Energy Institute will produce a Georgia Smart Community Playbook. Distilling best practices and findings for all communities, the playbook is being developed by Christopher Le Dantec, associate professor in the Digital Media program in the School of Literature, Media, and Communication.\nThe playbook will include a data guide.\n\u201cThe guide prompts communities to answer a number of questions about data they found useful in their projects,\u201d says Le Dantec. \u201cWhere did these data come from? What are the data standards? What are the data\u2019s limitations? What might another community do with similar data and where can it go for help?\u201d\nEach project concludes in September with a local public event to explain how the community pursued its goals, gained results, and made plans for the future. Each cohort, then, provides a road map for the next one.\nBut projects supported by Georgia Smart won\u2019t necessarily come to an end after one year. They may evolve with new sources of funding.\n\u201cGeorgia Tech scientists and engineers have become part of the local team,\u201d said Lam. \u201cMany of the researchers want to continue engaging in this work, expanding the pilot projects with new grants and other opportunities.\u201d\nGeorgia Smart is supported by the Georgia Power Company\u00a0and the Atlanta Regional Commission, the lead sponsors, as well as the Association County Commissioners of Georgia, Georgia Chamber, Georgia Department of Community Affairs, Georgia Department of Economic Development, Georgia Municipal Association, Georgia Planning Association, Global City Teams Challenge, Metro Atlanta Chamber, and Technology Association of Georgia.\nFor more information about Georgia Smart, visit\nwww.smartcities.gatech.edu/georgia-smart .\nThe links below have additional information (in PDF format) on each project:\nChatham County\nAlbany\nChamblee\nGwinnett County\nResearch News\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\n177 North Avenue\nAtlanta, Georgia\u00a0 30332-0181\u00a0 USA\nMedia Relations Contact:\nJohn Toon (404-894-6986) (jtoon@gatech.edu).\nWriter : John Tibbetts\nAdditional Images\nContact\nJohn Toon\nResearch News\n(404) 894-6986\nEmail\njtoon@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
