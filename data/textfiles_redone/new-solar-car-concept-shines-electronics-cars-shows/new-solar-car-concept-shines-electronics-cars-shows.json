The C-MAX Solar Energi Concept is a first-of-its-kind hybrid electric vehicle with the potential to free drivers of their dependence on the electric grid. Instead of recharging its battery from an electrical outlet, C-MAX Solar Energi Concept harnesses the power of the sun by parking under a special concentrator that acts like a magnifying glass, directing intensified rays from the sun onto solar panels on the parked vehicle\u2019s roof below. The result is a car that takes a day\u2019s worth of sunlight to deliver the same performance as Ford\u2019s conventional C-MAX Energi plug-in hybrid, which gets combined miles per gallon gasoline equivalent (MPGe), with EPA-estimated 108 city/92 highway/100 combined MPGe. \u201cFord didn\u2019t just want to build an electric car, but a plug-in hybrid electric car that actually uses green electricity,\u201d said Bert Bras, a professor in the George W. Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta. \u201cJust putting photovoltaic cells onto a car is not going to do it, so they reached out to us to help progress the concentrator idea.\u201d The car is continuing its media tour this week at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit. The concept car is a Ford-led collaborative project with Georgia Tech and San Jose, Calif.-based SunPower Corp. Ford and SunPower co-developed the solar panel-based roof specifically for C-MAX Solar Energi Concept. Because of the time that would be needed for conventional solar panels to absorb enough energy to fully charge the vehicle, Ford turned to Prof. Bras\u2019 Sustainable Design and Manufacturing lab at Georgia Tech for ways to amplify the sun light to make a solar-powered hybrid feasible for daily use. His lab helped develop a car port type solar concentrator that uses lenses similar to what lighthouses use to amplify a small light. Special Fresnel lenses in the car-port direct sunlight to the solar panels on the vehicle\u2019s roof, so the concentrator acts \u201clike a magnifying glass, but it\u2019s squished,\u201d Bras said. Grooves in the thin glass reflect the sunlight down to the car, boosting sunlight\u2019s impact by a factor of eight. The patent-pending system tracks the sun as it moves from east to west, drawing enough power from the sun daily to equal an 8 kilowatt hour battery charge.\u00a0The car's self-parking features can automatically move the car to keep the\u00a0sunlight focused on the rooftop panels.\u00a0Bras\u2019s lab modeled the size and dimensions of the concentrator needed to get to 8 kWh per day. That charge is possible in the concept car, but much work remains before this off-the-grid car can hit the streets. \u201cThere is more work to do, but the basic principle, can you charge a car with 8 kilowatt hours per day using pure sunlight? Yes, you can,\u201d Bras said. \u201cThe next step will be to test it in practical situations.\u201d By using renewable power, Ford estimates that the C-MAX Solar Energi Concept will reduce the annual greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) from a typical car owner by four metric tons. Internal Ford data suggests the sun could power up to 75 percent of all trips made by an average driver in a solar hybrid vehicle. This could be especially important in places where the electric grid is underdeveloped, unreliable, expensive and dirty. \u201cWe like to do these concepts that push the boundaries, like Ford does also,\u201d Bras said. \u201cThey want to boost sustainability and get off of the electricity power grid. That\u2019s what we\u2019re really after.\u201d Research News Georgia Institute of Technology 177 North Avenue Atlanta, Georgia 30332-0181 USA Media Relations Contacts:\nBrett Israel (404-385-1933) ( brett.israel@comm.gatech.edu ) or John Toon (404-894-6986) ( jtoon@gatech.edu ) Writer:\nBrett Israel\nAdditional Images\nContact\nBrett Israel 404-385-1933 brett.israel@comm.gatech.edu\nEmail\nbrett.israel@comm.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
