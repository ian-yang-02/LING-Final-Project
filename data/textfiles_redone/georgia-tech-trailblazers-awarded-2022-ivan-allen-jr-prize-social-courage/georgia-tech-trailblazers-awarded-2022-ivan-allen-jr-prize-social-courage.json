Greene.\nApr 21, 2022\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nIn 1961, three Black students began classes at Georgia Tech and made history, making the Institute the first higher education entity to peacefully integrate in the Deep South without a court order. Civil unrest was rampant throughout college campuses across the South.\nIn recognition of their roles as trailblazers, Tech\u2019s first Black students \u2014 Lawrence Williams, Ralph Long Jr., and the late Ford Greene, along with the first Black graduate Ronald Yancey \u2014 were awarded the 2022 Ivan Allen Jr. Prize for Social Courage on April 20 at the Biltmore Ballroom in Atlanta.\nA symposium was led by 2020 Ivan Allen Jr. Prize recipient Charlayne Hunter-Gault where Long Jr., Williams, and Yancey discussed the integration of the Institute, the former students\u2019 personal experiences, and the continued struggle for racial equity and inclusion at higher education institutes across the nation. During the panel session, the three former students recounted the racism they encountered \u2014 despite a facade of peaceful integration. Although their experiences left them feeling socially and intellectually isolated from most of the student body at the time, the pioneers expressed their hope that future generations of Black students at Tech feel at home on campus.\n\u201cI\u2019m so thankful for those who continue to matriculate here and carry on the tradition,\u201d said Williams.\nA video greeting from Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens, a Georgia Tech chemical engineering graduate himself, was presented at the celebration. Dickens honored the trailblazers for their courage in making history and acknowledged the hardship they faced along the way.\n\u201cI cannot imagine the tremendous amount of courage they had to arm themselves with every day they had to walk on campus,\u201d he said. \u201cThank you for paving the way for those of us who would come behind.\u201d\nThe Ivan Allen Jr. Prize honors those who have made a positive difference by risking their careers, livelihoods, and even their lives to stand up for moral principles.\u00a0For these trailblazers, though their college years were not easy, they went on to have successful and impactful careers.\nGreene studied chemical engineering at Georgia Tech. He completed his bachelor\u2019s degree in mathematics and computer science at Morgan State University and worked in telecommunications and information technology systems. He died in 2020 at the age of 76.\nAfter attending Tech, Long completed his bachelor\u2019s degree at Clark College (now Clark Atlanta University) in mathematics and physics and was the first Black systems engineer for the Large Systems Group in the Southeastern U.S. at IBM Atlanta.\nAfter his time studying electrical engineering, Williams served honorably in the Air Force during the Vietnam War, earning several distinctions and honors.\nA week after graduating with a degree in electrical engineering from Tech, Yancey began a successful career with the U.S. Department of Defense.\nBecause Greene died in 2020, members of his family joined the other prize recipients at the Biltmore for the day\u2019s events celebrating the honorees\u2019 place in history.\n\u201cFord has always been a change agent, a disruptor, and him being a recipient of this prestigious award solidifies his place in history that he so richly deserves,\u201d said Frankie Hall, Greene\u2019s wife.\nThe inaugural prize was awarded in March 2011 to former Senator Sam Nunn. A few other past recipients include Dr. Anthony Fauci, Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter, U.S. Rep. John Lewis, and humanitarian activist Nancy Parrish.\nLearn more about the prestigious Ivan Allen Prize for Social Courage here.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nSiobhan Rodriguez\nGeorgia Tech Media Relations\nEmail\nsar30@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
