Most usually learn by watching a non-amputee demonstrate the device during physical therapy and rehabilitation sessions. A Georgia Institute of Technology study that measured arm movements and analyzed brain patterns found that people do better when they learn from someone who looks like them.\nThe paper is published\nin the journal Neurorehabilitation and Neural Repair. \u201cWe wanted to see if there was something we could improve in therapy that helps amputees \u2013 something to refresh the rehab,\u201d said Lewis Wheaton, an associate professor who led the study and directs Georgia Tech\u2019s\nCognitive Motor Control Lab . \u201cIf people with a prosthesis can\u2019t figure it out in the first three days, they tend to give up.\u201d Prior research\nfound that as many as 75 percent of amputees consider their prosthesis to be primarily aesthetic, and 33 percent reject the device because it\u2019s not practical. Poor training and a bad first experience are often listed as reasons they eventually quit wearing the device. In the study, participants wore an elbow-to-hand prosthesis (a split hook device) with movement sensors embedded onto the elbow. The device was designed to limit forearm and wrist movement. They also wore an EEG cap on their heads. On the first day, participants tried various tasks (rotating a block, flipping a spatula, writing) with the device. For the next three days, they watched 30-second videos of someone demonstrating the same tasks. The person on video either wore the same device or didn\u2019t wear anything on their arm. On the fifth day, participants tried each task again. \u201cThose who watched a matched-limb participant did significantly better after three days of training,\u201d said Wheaton, a faculty member in the\nSchool of Applied Physiology . \u201cTheir arm movements were more consistent and fluid when they repeated the task. Those who only watched someone without a prosthesis didn\u2019t improve at all.\u201d Just as importantly, Wheaton noticed different brain patterns in the two groups. As people watched someone wearing a prosthesis, areas of the brain involved with motor planning were most active. For those watching an able-bodied person, the brain\u2019s visual areas were most dominant. \u201cWhen amputees watch someone without a prosthesis, it seems that their brain is more concerned with what it\u2019s seeing, rather than concentrating on how to actually do the task,\u201d said Wheaton. The current study only included non-amputees watching videos, although Wheaton is now repeating it with amputees in his Georgia Tech lab. Additional next steps will attempt to determine whether the same results are consistent with different types of prostheses for other parts of the body. The study is supported by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) 2009 Pre-Doctoral Prosthetics and Orthotics Research Fellowship Program and NIH National Center for Medical Rehabilitation Research T32 Award (#5T32HD055180-03).
