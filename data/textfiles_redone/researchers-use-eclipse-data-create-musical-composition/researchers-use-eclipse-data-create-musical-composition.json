Each will begin at 2 p.m. eastern time on Monday. The article below was written on Friday, August\u00a018. It references a nine-minute demo that was produced in advanced of the eclipse. It will be used as a base soundtrack for the live versions.\nA team of Georgia Institute of Technology researchers has created an\noriginal music composition for Monday\u2019s eclipse . The Georgia Tech Sonification Lab uses drums, synthesized tones and other sounds to symbolize the movements of the sun and moon and the gradual darkness they will produce during the August 21 event.\nThe audio experience, which at times sounds both hopeful and ominous as it builds anticipation toward the moment of the total eclipse, includes several segments ( hear it now ).\nDuring first contact, as the moon starts to slide in front of the sun, high tonal sounds (representing the moon) gradually increase in volume and consistency. During second contact, or the beginning of totality, the musical tension continues to rise, even as the overall pitch and loudness begin to diminish as light levels fade. During this portion of the music, the sound of crickets is also heard to signify the \u201cfalse dusk\u201d effect created when the moon completely covers the sun.\nDuring maximum totality, or halfway through second contact, the piece falls nearly silent. The composition continues with the end of totality, or third contact, as the tension diminishes and the feeling of hope dominates. As the sun re-emerges from behind the moon, the light returns, and the music becomes brighter and more active; bird chirps highlight this \u201cfalse dawn.\u201d A continually more uplifting tone concludes the composition.\nThe base soundtrack is available to stream now. On Monday, the Georgia Tech team will use live data to add more musical instruments to the existing piece. For example, as the outside air temperature drops during the eclipse, the notes played by a trumpet\u00a0will trend toward lower pitches. Similar live musical changes will signal variations\u00a0in brightness and barometric pressure.\nIn the end, the researchers will create a musical work of how the eclipse \u201csounded.\u201d\nThe project was created when AT&T asked Professor Bruce Walker if he would create an audio file to allow visually impaired persons to experience the eclipse.\n\u201cOur Sonification Lab uses data to translate visual information into auditory experiences for people with disabilities or visual impairment,\u201d said Walker, who holds appointments within the Georgia Tech College of Computing and College of Sciences. \u201cAll people need access. Sonification, or turning data into audible cues, is one way to provide it.\u201d\nWalker and his students have used technology to sonify fish movements for guests at the Georgia Aquarium. They also once\nturned exoplanet data into a melody\nfor a national recording artist.\nThis is the first time they\u2019ve made music with eclipse information. The team watched countless vides of total eclipses to develop the correct tone and pacing for the piece.\nAvrosh Kumar , who graduated from Georgia Tech this past spring, also talked to two blind people. One had previously seen an eclipse. The other described how she listens to her surroundings, allowing Kumar to better understand how visually impaired people use ambient sounds to develop a sense of their environment and the moments in their lives.\n\u201cThere are so many things during an eclipse that you can attempt to translate through audio,\u201d said Kumar, who recently received his master\u2019s degree in music technology. \u201cOur main motive was to use music and sound to demonstrate what\u2019s going on in the sky. At the same time, we wanted to create a pleasing, dramatic composition. It was a fine line to walk in order to achieve both goals.\u201d\nKumar, Walker and current student Takahiko Tsuchiya built and paced the soundtrack with a focus on Hopkinsville, Kentucky. The city is on the center line of the eclipse and will experience two minutes and 40 seconds of totality. Nearly 100,000 people, including NASA scientists, are expected in the small town. AT&T will play the soundtrack for a visually impaired attendee as he \u201cwatches\u201d the eclipse in Kentucky with specially designed smart glasses.\nA second pre-recorded composition, which uses the same sounds but with different pacing, was developed to match eclipse conditions in Atlanta. The Georgia Tech campus will experience 97 percent totality. Live sounds will also be added to that piece during Monday\u2019s eclipse. The music will be streamed live during Georgia Tech\u2019s telescope feed of the event.\n\u201cThink of this as a celestial orchestra, as the sun and moon dance above our planet,\u201d said Walker. \u201cIt\u2019s been an exciting project.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen a total eclipse. But I\u2019ve learned that witnessing totality is an emotional experience for many people,\u201d said Kumar. \u201cListening to music is also an emotional experience. It makes sense to combine both for Monday\u2019s once-in-a-lifetime event.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nListen to the Live Streams on Eclipse Day\nListen to the Pre-Recorded Composition\nGeorgia Tech Sonification Lab\nAvrosh Kumar: Tech Performances (Video)\nContact\nJason Maderer\nNational Media Relations\nmaderer@gatech.edu\n404-660-2926\nEmail\nmaderer@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
