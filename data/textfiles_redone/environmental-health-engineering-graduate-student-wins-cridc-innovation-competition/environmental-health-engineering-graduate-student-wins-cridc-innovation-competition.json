She was also awarded a $50,000 grant through the\u00a0 National Science Foundation\u2019s Innovation-Corps \u00a0program to participate in a seven-week bootcamp focused on experiential education to gain insight into her startup\u2019s industry. She is advised by\u00a0 Xing Xie , the Carlton S. Wilder Assistant Professor in the School of Civil and Environmental Engineering.\nStrong Contenders\nTwo other student presenters were selected as runners-up and will each receive $500.\u00a0 Nathan Zavanelli , pursuing a doctoral degree in mechanical engineering/bioengineering, and advised by\u00a0 Woon-Hong Yeo \u00a0in the\u00a0 George W. Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering , explained the benefits of his \u201csmart patch\u201d for sleep apnea assessments. The disorder affects more than 900 million adults worldwide, but most often goes undiagnosed.\nAmirtha Varshini Anbuchezhiyan Sindhanai , a computer science master\u2019s student in Tech\u2019s\u00a0 College of Computing , and advised by\u00a0 James Rehg , described how her technology uses machine learning and machine vision to help job applicants review and enhance their nonverbal communications skills.\nLaVonda Brown , a Georgia Tech alumna and founder of startup\u00a0 EyeGage ,\u00a0 served as a judge alongside\u00a0 Nammy Vedire , director of platform and operations of\u00a0 Engage ,\u00a0 the Georgia Tech-affiliated incubator for enterprise-focused startups.\nVentureLab will provide ongoing support, reaching out to all the competitors to offer guidance and help them pursue programs and grants that support the transition from success in the lab to success in the market.\nGeorgia Tech students, faculty, and staff interested in these opportunities to further the commercialization of their own research may contact VentureLab through its website,\u00a0 venturelab.gatech.edu , or by e-mailing\u00a0 info@venturelab.gatech.edu .\nAdditional Images\nContact\nP\u00e9ralte C.
