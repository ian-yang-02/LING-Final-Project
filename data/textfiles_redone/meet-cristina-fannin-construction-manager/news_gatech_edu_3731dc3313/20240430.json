As a young adult, she left her close-knit family and a comfortable career as an architect in the Philippines to strike out on her own in the U.S.\n\u201cI was working as an architect for the National Commission for Disabled Persons, making government buildings ADA compliant,\u201d Fannin said. \u201cI was making good money, but I was never going to be independent surrounded by my immediate family. I wanted more. I wanted to explore the world.\u201d\nShe landed a job at Johnson Mirmiran & Thompson in Silver Springs, Maryland, working as a drafter. Even though she has an architecture degree from the University of Santa Tomas, the license requirements in the U.S. were not the same as in the Philippines.\n\u201cI went from living like a princess with everything I wanted in the Philippines, to living in an apartment with my aunt and uncle, and sleeping on a pull-out bed in their living room,\u201d Fannin said. But she was happy. While working in Maryland she met her husband, Alan, and moved to Georgia.\nShe worked for Pond and Company, an engineering consulting firm. Then she worked for DeKalb County government for almost 15 years as a construction manager in charge of multi-million dollar projects. Her last project was a $13 million animal shelter on Chamblee Dunwoody Road.\n\u201cWe had a ribbon cutting for the facility, and two days later I started at Georgia Tech. After 15 years I needed a new environment with different challenges,\u201d Fannin said. She came to Tech in August 2017 as a construction manager for Facilities Management Design and Construction.\nFannin\u2019s job is to help campus departments make changes to their workspace. Once the design is completed, Fannin manages the construction project.\n\u201cThat is exciting for me,\u201d she said. \u201cI like seeing the project come together from drawings. I am thrilled when a project is completed and the customer is happy. It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s an office space, a lab, or a whole building.\u201d\nFannin said her group, the special projects team is very supportive.\n\u201cI\u2019m glad I came here. I\u2019m around a lot of engineers and architects, and I like that. My group is like brothers and sisters. We support each other. I love it here,\u201d she said.\nAway From the Office\nFannin enjoys going out to dinner with her husband and hanging out with her friends.\n\u201cMy husband is a homebody, but I am a social butterfly. He knew that when he married me,\u201d she said, laughing. Not being able to socialize with her friends during the last several months has been a challenge.\n\u201cI relied on technology \u2014 using FaceTime and calling to stay in touch. It was a test, but I survived,\u201d she said.\nFannin enjoys listening to smooth jazz and R&B, reading motivational books, and traveling.\n\u201cI like listening to music while I\u2019m working, but I don\u2019t like using headphones,\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t work without background music. Not loud music.\u201d She also reads a lot. \u201cI don\u2019t like mushy books. I like reading things that will help me become a better person.\u201d\nFannin also loves traveling. One of her graduation gifts from her parents was a trip to Europe.\n\u201cMy best friend and I traveled to see the cathedrals and everything else that we drew in school. We were in awe,\u201d she said. \u201cI have traveled all over Asia. One of the places I haven\u2019t been is the Middle East, so it\u2019s on my bucket list.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nRead More Staff Stories\nContact\nVictor Rogers\nInstitute Communications\nEmail\nvictor.rogers@comm.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
