Growing up in Tennessee during the 1980s, he watched the movies his family taped off television. Horror was his favorite. He was likely one of the few kindergarten students familiar with the oeuvre of Freddy Krueger and Jason from \u201cFriday the 13 th .\u201d Today Browning is a Marion L. Brittain Postdoctoral Fellow in the School of Literature, Media and Communication who is an internationally recognized vampire and horror scholar. He has published nearly a dozen books and his latest, \u201cThe Vampire in Europe: A Critical Edition,\u201d comes out this month. This semester Browning teaches \u201cFashioning Monsters, Preserving Normalcy,\u201d which examines the way we construct monsters and otherness in literature, film and society. For example, his class discussed why Leatherface from \u201cTexas Chainsaw Massacre\u201d became more horrifying after putting on lipstick. \u201cMonsters tell us a lot about society,\u201d Browning said. \u201cIn a way, monsters are just like politicians. They show us who is powerful, who should have power and who is powerless.\u201d Of all the monsters out there, Dracula captured Browning\u2019s fascination. He watched the 1979 movie starring Frank Langella over and over again. But it was the 1992 version directed by Francis Ford Coppola that made a lasting impact. \u201cI stopped thinking of Dracula as this fictional thing,\u201d Browning said. \u201cHe was\nVlad\nDracula, a person who had a real history. The movie turned some switch on, and I really honed in on vampires and Dracula.\u201d He sometimes wears a replica of the silver ring Dracula wore in the movies in the 1940s. The center of the ring is a blood cornelian stone about the size of a half dollar. On top of the stone sits a crest containing a crown, a bat and the letter \u201cD.\u201d The 34-year-old cuts an imposing figure at 6\u20194\u201d, but his soft-spoken nature and quick smile reveal an easygoing, scholarly side.\u00a0 A film theory course during his junior year at Florida State University showed he could have an academic career because of his love of Dracula. For part of his doctoral dissertation, Browning conducted ethnographic studies of people who identify themselves as real-life vampires. For his book\nDracula in Visual Media , Browning documented more than 700 Dracula films, television programs, documentaries, animations and video games. Next semester he\u2019ll teach \u201cVampires and Zombies across History and Culture.\u201d \u201cI was always someone who liked to ask questions and notice changes,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can see culture evolve by looking at Dracula.\u201d When society goes through economic crises movie studios turn to horror, especially vampires, so villains can get their comeuppance. \u201cWhat\u2019s strange now is that we want our vampires to\nlive ,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re rooting for the monsters, while it\u2019s normalcy or the people who created the monsters who are being killed off.\u201c\nAdditional Images\nContact\nLaura Diamond\u00a0 Georgia Tech Media Relations 404-894-6016\nEmail\nlaura.diamond@gatech.edu\nAdditional information\nWant to be frightened?\u00a0 With Halloween around the corner, it\u2019s time to watch scary movies. John Edgar Browning, Marion L. Brittain Postdoctoral Fellow in the School of Literature, Media and Communication, is an internationally recognized vampire and horror scholar who is also a film buff. Here are his picks for a fright fest: The Exorcist\n- This movie was so visceral, so real. For\u00a0 any Christian watching it when it first came out, nothing was more frightening than the devil or biblical demons, he said. Jaws\n- Browning still can\u2019t swim in the ocean because of this movie. Pet Cemetery\n- Browning was 9 when he saw this movie and was horrified. The movie is \u201cright in your face\u201d scary. Amityville II: Possession\n- This sequel is a prequel that stands on its own. It creates a powerful sense of evil and played off the \u201cpossession craze\u201d that was popular following \u201cThe Exorcist.\u201d The Conjuring\n- Another great possession movie filled with creepy, old-school scares and moments that catch you off-guard. Insidious\n- Like other movies on this list, it uses music and sound to create a frightening mood. It understands that less is more. The Ring\n- As a child of the \u201980s, Browning related to the VHS tapes. More than that, the powerful effects create a feeling of impending doom.\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
