In January, McDonnell will be heading to Sierra Leone to work for a company called Water4. With locations in more than a dozen African countries, Water4 helps empower local communities to lead projects that bring them clean water.\nThis opportunity came from a partnership between Water4 and Georgia Tech\u2019s Campus Christian Fellowship (CCF). When McDonnell arrives in Sierra Leone, she\u2019ll be helping to engineer solutions to bring clean water to various communities. But she\u2019ll also have a hand in creating an internship program specifically for Georgia Tech engineers who want to come do the same thing. She\u2019ll be overseeing three to four students at a time in their work with Water4.\nMcDonnell was initially drawn to environmental engineering by her love for animals, but a mission trip in high school set her on the clean water track. Halfway through her stay in Kenya, the compound she was living in experienced a water shortage. For the rest of their time there, she and her group had to walk three miles to get their water for the day.\n\u201cI realized that for some people, this is what they do every single morning for their whole lives,\u201d McDonnell said. \u201cThat\u2019s when water sanitation came to the forefront of my mind.\u201d\nShe feels confident that her degree program\u2019s emphasis on creativity and problem solving has equipped her with the skills necessary to tackle these problems.\n\u201cAll of the classes I\u2019ve been in have encouraged ingenuity and creativity in solving problems in a way that\u2019s different than the status quo,\u201d she said.\nMcDonnell also learned meaningful lessons outside of the classroom, most notably with the Ramblin\u2019 Reck Club. Since joining in her second semester at Tech, McDonnell has held multiple leadership positions within the organization, including traditions chair and vice president. To her, the Reck Club served as a way to show her Georgia Tech spirit, as well as a reminder of just how passionate her fellow students can be.\n\u201cPeople in Reck Club remind you that you\u2019re blessed to have the opportunity to be stressed over the potential to achieve exceptional things,\u201d she said.\nAfter graduation, McDonnell will have no shortage of fond memories to look back on from her time at Tech, including Midnight Bud, a finals de-stressing event on campus. At the end of her first semester, McDonnell, who had never heard of Midnight Bud, was caught off guard one night by the sound of students singing Georgia Tech songs outside her dorm. She and her friend headed outside, barefoot and in pajamas, and ended up following the crowd all the way to the North Avenue Apartments \u2014 and having the time of their lives.\n\u201cWhen I needed it most, I was reminded of how special Georgia Tech is,\u201d she said.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nGrace Wyner\nInstitute Communications\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
