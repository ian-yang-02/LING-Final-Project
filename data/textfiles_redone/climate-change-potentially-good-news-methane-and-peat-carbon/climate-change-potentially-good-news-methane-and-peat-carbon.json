The surprising result of a new study may be an early indicator that there is one less potentially large source of a powerful greenhouse gas in Earth\u2019s future.\nThe researchers\u2019 findings are early results from a long-range experiment and will need to stand the test of time and further study.\nScientists from\nFlorida State University , the University of Oregon, the Georgia Institute of Technology, Oak Ridge National Laboratory and the USDA Forest Service Northwest Station published a paper with the findings on Tuesday, December 13, 2016, in\nthe journal\u00a0 Nature Communications .\nNightmarish hypothesis\nAs global warming progresses, a hypothesis has held that methane may rise into the atmosphere from ancient layers of dead peat in cold, northern bogs to make climate change even worse.\nThese underground carbon stores have built up for some 10,000 years, and hold about 30 percent of Earth\u2019s total 1,500 billion tons of organic soil carbon. That total is as much carbon as is currently in Earth\u2019s atmosphere.\nScientists have feared climate change may lead microbes to digest the carbon stores and belch out carbon dioxide, and also methane, a particularly potent greenhouse gas that traps about 45 times as much heat as carbon dioxide. That would significantly exacerbate global warming.\nBut these latest results appear to allay those fears, should the findings hold up over time.\nEcological conditions in boreal peat bogs have helped create these underground carbon stores by allowing peat moss, or\nSphagnum , and other plants to absorb more greenhouse gasses from the atmosphere than the rest of the bog ecosystem emits. But that could change, if rising temperatures boost greenhouse gas emissions, and the bogs could switch from sinks to sources or lesser sinks.\nMORE PHOTOS: Press handouts, all rights free for reporting on this project.\nTo get a picture of possible greenhouse gas consequences, the U.S. Department of Energy is\nmethodically heating parts of a bog in northern Minnesota for a 10-year period\nto mimic various climate change scenarios. The experiment is called the\nSPRUCE\nproject, which stands for Spruce and Peatland Responses Under Climate and Environmental Change.\nFindings from the experiment should not be confused with those from studies of thawing permafrost, which contains soil carbon with different potentials for producing methane.\nPleasant surprise\nAfter about the first year of heating bog plots, methane emissions did rise significantly, but they came from the thinner layer of peat at the bog\u2019s surface. They did not come streaming out of the massive layers of deep peat soil carbon as had been hypothesized.\nThat came as a pleasant surprise to the scientists, including Georgia Tech\u2019s Joel Kostka, a microbiologist studying the activity of microbes in the carbon cycle at SPRUCE.\n\u201cIf the release of greenhouse gasses is not enhanced by temperature of the deep peat, that\u2019s great news,\u201d Kostka said, \u201cbecause that means that if all other things remain as they are, that the deep peat carbon remains in the soil.\u201d\nTo mimic what was observed in the field, University of Oregon researchers tested deep peat under anaerobic conditions in the lab, and it tenaciously hung on to its solid carbon.\nQuiet microbes\nKostka, a professor at Georgia Tech\u2019s\nSchool of Biological Sciences\nand\nSchool of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences , and postdoctoral assistant Max Kolton also heated samples to check for corresponding activity by microbes called methanogens that are known to produce methane under anaerobic conditions. The results will be submitted for future publication, but they add interesting depth to the current published results.\n\u201cWe took ancient peat out from different depths, incubated it in the lab, and at one to two meters\u2019 depth, we saw very few changes in microbial activity and little methane coming out,\u201d Kostka said. That concurred with the profiling of methanogen DNA in samples taken on site at SPRUCE in the deep peat, results that were published in the current paper.\nBut what makes the solid carbon in deep peat in boreal wetlands apparently so stable? Kostka and SPRUCE colleagues are researching to find out.\n\u201cIs it mainly because it\u2019s wet, and therefore there\u2019s not much oxygen in the soil? Is it because it\u2019s acidic?\u201d Kostka asked. \u201cIs it because it\u2019s cold? Or is it, in large part, because of organic matter recalcitrance, meaning the type of carbon that is produced by the peat moss actually poisons microbial activity? Right now our hypothesis is it\u2019s the last one.\u201d\nA potentially nasty caveat\nEven with that good news, a rise in methane coming from top layers of peat could someday be harmful to Earth\u2019s climate, if it\u2019s more than a passing phenomenon. \u201cThat could contribute to climate change because methane has such a high warming potential,\u201d Kostka said.\nLab experiments confirmed the rise in surface layer peat methane emissions observed at SPRUCE.\n\u201cIn the lab, our colleagues at the University of Oregon measured more methane at higher temperatures from the surface peat,\u201d Kostka said. In the field, Kostka and Kolton also found a high number of genetic fragments associated with methane-producing enzymes in that upper layer of peat, corroborating methanogen microbes as the source of the methane.\nIt\u2019s too early to tell if those emissions will continue and what net effect they will have. Scientists working at SPRUCE will glean more insights into warming\u2019s possible generation of methane and also CO 2\nin northern bogs, as the 10-year experiment progresses.\nSPRUCE\u2019s findings will be factored into computational climate simulations to increase their scope.\nREAD: Comprehensive background article on SPRUCE including Kostka\u2019s work on the project\nAuthors of the research paper included: R.M.
