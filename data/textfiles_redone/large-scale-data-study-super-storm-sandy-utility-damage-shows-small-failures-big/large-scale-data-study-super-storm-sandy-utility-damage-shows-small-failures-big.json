A new study shows the extent of the challenge faced by the upstate New York distribution grid and suggests what might be done to make the system more resilient against future storms.\nThe study, which required more than three years, examined power failures that affected more than 600,000 customers from four major service regions. The study showed that failures affecting small numbers of customers accounted for more than half the outage impact, defeating efforts to restore service by prioritizing repairs to substations and other major facilities \u2013 a traditional recovery strategy. The research, reported April 29 in the journal\nNature Energy , is believed to be the largest detailed study of failure reports for distribution grids using real data.\n\u201cSystem failures can affect large numbers of customers even if they occur at the distribution level of the grid and do not cascade,\u201d said\nChuanyi Ji , an associate professor in the\nSchool of Electrical and Computer Engineering\nat the Georgia Institute of Technology. \u201cTogether, these local failures can have a big non-local impact on customers. The grid simply cannot respond well to large numbers of failures.\u201d\nThe top 20 percent of distribution grid failures accounted for more than 80 percent of the customers affected. But even failures that each affected relatively small numbers of customers added up. A large number \u2013 89 percent \u2013 of small failures, represented by the bottom 34 percent of customers and commonplace devices, resulted in 56 percent of the total cost of 28 million customer interruption hours.\n\u201cIf you are just going after the big failures, the effect will be limited because there are just too many small ones that cannot be restored quickly,\u201d Ji noted. \u201cTogether, small failures were significant in the total down time of customers.\u201d\nThe large-scale study used granular data provided by the Central Hudson Gas & Electric Corporation in Poughkeepsie; National Grid in Waltham, Massachusetts; the New York State Electric and Gas Corporation in Binghamton; Orange and Rockland Utilities, Inc., in Pearl River \u2013 and the New York State Public Service Commission in Albany. Overall, the study examined the utility infrastructure serving nearly 51,000 square miles in the entirety of upstate New York.\nBeyond the storm damage information, the researchers also examined data from day-to-day operations and studied how routine issues were handled. Those resilience issues included customer service and restoration, in addition to sporadic infrastructure failures. Two Ph.D. students from the Georgia Tech School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Yun Wei and Henry Mei, were instrumental in the data study as part of the research team. The research was supported by the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority.\n\u201cOur analysis shows that extreme weather does not cause, but rather exacerbates, existing vulnerabilities in the infrastructure and service, which are obscured in daily operations,\u201d Ji said. \u201cWe also saw the issues in daily operations.\u201d\nThe researchers began the work with development of a non-stationary spatiotemporal random process model that linked a large number of infrastructure failures to recoveries and customer impact. The model was chosen because failure and recovery were subject to uncertainty and occurred over widely varying times and locations. The researchers believe their model could be useful to other service regions.\n\u201cSuper Storm Sandy was an unusual event, but we discovered that our findings about the response is broadly applicable to other states and other DSOs when we compared data from daily operations to emergency conditions,\u201d Ji said. \u201cThe infrastructure problem is generic due to the design, and the recovery problem is also somewhat generic because the response follows a similar strategy. This highlights a larger issue of how to make the nation\u2019s energy infrastructure and service more resilient to outside disruptions.\u201d\nBecause the emphasis was on restoring service, not all the records that were obtained from the storm contained information useful to the model. Still, the study is believed to be the largest ever done based on granular failure reports across multiple service regions, and could provide a foundation for future analyses of utility data, Ji noted.\n\u201cData analysis can help utilities turn what they collect into knowledge for improving services,\u201d she added. \u201cThe grid can be made more inherently resilient, like communication networks, so a failure in one place doesn\u2019t cut off services for many people in the network.\u201d\nCITATION : Chuanyi Ji, et al., \u201cLarge-scale data analysis of power grid resilience across multiple US service regions,\u201d (Nature Energy, 2016).\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nenergy.2016.52\nResearch News\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\n177 North Avenue\nAtlanta, Georgia 30332-0181 USA\nMedia Relations Assistance : John Toon ( jtoon@gatech.edu ) (404-894-6986) or Ben Brumfield ( ben.brumfield@comm.gatech.edu ) (404-385-1933).\nWriter : John Toon\nAdditional Images\nContact\nJohn Toon\nResearch News\njtoon@gatech.edu\n(404) 894-6986\nEmail\njtoon@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
