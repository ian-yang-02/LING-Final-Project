Launched in September 2013 by Ayanna Howard, the\u00a0Linda J. and Mark C. Smith Chair professor in the Georgia Institute of Technology\u2019s School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, the company is commercializing assistive technology that enables children with limited mobility to operate tablet computers, smartphones, toys, gaming apps, and interactive robots. \u201cWe are extremely excited about the opportunities that this NSF SBIR grant provides,\u201d said Howard, who is the company\u2019s chief technology officer. \u201cIt helps Zyrobotics to continue to evolve as a leader in inclusive smart mobile technologies by enhancing our ability to develop accessible learning systems that\u00a0engage and empower children with special needs and enhance their quality of life.\u201d Specifically, the Phase II project aims to focus on the development of an accessible educational platform that combines mobile interfaces and adaptive educational tablet applications (apps) to support the requirements of children with special needs. While tablet devices have given those children an interactive experience that has revolutionized their learning, in its proposal, Zyrobotics notes that while\u00a0some\u00a0tablet devices are intuitive in use and easy for lots of kids, those with disabilities are largely overlooked due to difficulties in effecting pinch-and-swipe gestures. \u201cThis project thus addresses a direct need in our society by providing an integrated educational experience, focused on math education that addresses the diverse needs of children, while providing a solution for variations found in their disabilities,\u201d the company wrote in its grant proposal. \u201cThis SBIR Phase II project addresses an unmet need by developing an innovative solution to enable children with motor disabilities access to mobile devices and apps that could engage them fully into the educational system.\u201d In this next phase, Howard and her team plan to design accessible math apps geared to children with or without disabilities in kindergarten through 12th grade. The company also plans to\u00a0design another set of apps that adapt educational content and provide feedback to parents and teachers based on real-time analytics. The company says it sees ample market opportunity for its products both domestically and abroad. Here in the United States, children with disabilities are entitled to a free and appropriate public education, and Zyrobotics sees its products as addressing that need from both a commercial and societal standpoint. Worldwide, more than\u00a093 million children live with a disability. When founded, the company went through Georgia Tech\u2019s\u00a0VentureLab\u00a0startup incubator, ranked No. 2 in North America. VentureLab, a unit of Tech\u2019s Enterprise Innovation Institute (EI 2 ), works with Georgia Tech faculty, students, and staff to help them validate and commercialize their research and ideas into viable companies. Zyrobotics is now part of Tech\u2019s Advanced Technology Development Center (ATDC), a sister startup incubator program that serves all of Georgia. Zyrobotics, with the help of ATDC\u2019s SBIR program, was able to receive its Phase I award in 2015, laying the groundwork for the Phase II grant. \u201cZyrobotics is a wonderful Georgia Tech startup, based on the fine research in Dr. Howard\u2019s lab, and enhanced by a very successful journey through the NSF I-Corps program,\u201d said Keith McGreggor, VentureLab\u2019s director. \u201cThis is a great example of how the research done in the classroom and lab, followed by idea validation, can lead to real breakthroughs that are designed to have a lasting impact on the lives touched by the technologies that Dr. Howard has created.\u201d \u2014 P\u00e9ralte C.
