The microgrid is located at Spring and Fifth Streets in\u00a0Atlanta. This project, made possible through a longstanding partnership\u00a0between Georgia Power and Georgia Tech, will help power the larger local grid in Midtown, while minimizing environmental impact.\nMicrogrids are self-contained power systems, co-located with the facilities they serve, that include generation resources, storage systems, and energy management systems.\u00a0The Tech Square Microgrid, which was approved by the Georgia Public Service Commission, is being used to evaluate how a microgrid can effectively integrate into and operate as part of the overall electrical grid.\u00a0The\u00a0facility will not only provide clean power to Midtown, but\u00a0it will\u00a0also serve as a living laboratory in which Georgia Tech,\u00a0industry,\u00a0and government researchers will work collaboratively to create\u00a0the next generation of clean energy solutions.\n\u201cGeorgia Tech is committed to addressing the most consequential challenges of our time,\u201d said Georgia Tech President \u00c1ngel Cabrera. \u201cThat involves advancing science and technology, developing leaders who can create and deploy new solutions, and leading by\u00a0example\u00a0with our own practices.\u00a0This microgrid is a great\u00a0illustration of the latter.\u00a0In our partnership with Georgia Power and the Georgia Public Service Commission, we will be\u00a0developing and adopting\u00a0some of the most advanced, efficient, and responsible energy solutions available,\u00a0in the hope we can serve\u00a0as an example for others.\u201d\nThe microgrid will provide Georgia Power with insight into how smart energy management systems, such as the one installed at the Coda data center, can interact with the grid to achieve optimal energy use. In addition, it will provide teaching and learning opportunities for Georgia Tech professors and students.\n\u201cThe Tech Square Microgrid is a proven innovative project that will help us better understand microgrids to help service our customers. It brings energy storage and data front and center for research. The microgrid\u2019s distributed energy resources are vital to enhancing grid resiliency and bringing sustainable energy solutions to Georgia\u2019s communities,\u201d said Chris Womack, chairman, president, and CEO of\u00a0Georgia Power. \u201cGeorgia Tech is one of the nation\u2019s leading research institutions and has been an integral partner in allowing their students and teachers to learn how these systems will interact not only with our grid but also with the Coda building on the Georgia Tech campus. It\u2019s by collectively working together through projects like this that we will build a brighter energy future for our state.\u201d\nThe installation includes fuel cells, battery storage, diesel generators, and a natural gas generator, and it is adaptive to new and additional distributed energy resources. It is designed to also accommodate microturbines, solar panels, and electric vehicle chargers in the future. All components will be placed on a platform and obscured from view with 7-foot-high fencing and gate access along Williams Street. The\u00a0co-branded\u00a0(Georgia Tech and Georgia Power) fencing will have a mural designed and commissioned by Atlanta-based artist George F. Baker III, to be finished later this year.\nLearn more about Georgia Tech's Strategic Energy Institute at\u00a0 research.gatech.edu/energy .\nAdditional Images\nContact\nAyana Isles\naisles3@gatech.edu\nInstitute Communications\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
