Two years ago she and her team completed the\nfirst human feasibility study\nof this \u201cflicker\u201d treatment, delivered to patients via goggles and headphones.\n\u201cAnd there\u2019s a long list of clinical trials going on right now using flicker stimulation \u2013 people are using the technology in a variety of different contexts,\u201d said Singer, associate professor in the Wallace H. Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering at Georgia Tech and Emory University. \u201cBut the mechanism underlying all of this is a major mystery. As scientists, we want to nail down the one key question: What is actually happening?\u201d\nShe\u2019s been piecing the flicker mystery together for years, along the way building a novel way to manipulate the neuroimmune system and prevent Alzheimer\u2019s damage.\nHer prior work\nfocused on using flickering light and sound set to a frequency of 40 Hertz (40 times per second) to stimulate gamma waves, which play a main role in functions such as perception and memory, and which are deficient in Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Singer\u2019s flicker treatment set neurons on a rhythmic dance that recruit microglia, the brain\u2019s primary immune cells, which engulf pathogens and secrete cytokines \u2013 small proteins that alert other immune cells to the cause.\nNow Singer and a team of multidisciplinary researchers from Georgia Tech and Emory are providing answers to that one key question \u2013 what is going on to make all of this happen? \u2013 and they shared\ntheir research this month in the journal\nScience Advances .\nStudying Rhythm in a Healthy Brain\nSinger\u2019s collaborators include fellow faculty researchers Levi Wood, associate professor in the George W. Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering at Georgia Tech, and Dieter Jaeger, professor in Emory\u2019s Department of Biology, where his work focuses on the rhythmic motor patterns generated and modulated in the central nervous system. \u00a0Both Jaeger and Wood have appointments in the Coulter Department. The lead authors are Ashley Prichard, postdoctoral researcher in Singer\u2019s lab and Kristie Garza, former graduate researcher in the lab.\nFor this study, Singer took a different approach.\n\u201cIn the past, our focus was on the diseased state. It was important for this research that we focus on brain rhythms in the healthy brain, to see the effects of sensory stimulation outside the context of Alzheimer\u2019s pathology,\u201d Singer said.\nAlso, this time the team used flicker stimulation to induce electrical activity at two different frequencies in mice: 40Hz, corresponding to gamma brain waves; and 20Hz, corresponding to beta wave.\u00a0 These brain rhythms occur naturally in the brain during everyday life and in response to flickering lights and sounds. With Jaeger\u2019s lab, the team first showed flicker lights and sounds drive these brain rhythms using cutting edge imaging of electrical signals across the brain surface.\n\u201cWe compared different frequencies, so we\u2019d have a better idea of the effects on the rhythmic activity of neurons,\u201d said Singer. \u201cThat\u2019s important because different frequencies of activity have distinct effects on microglia and cytokines.\u201d\nPreviously, the team noted the effects of different frequencies on cytokine protein expression \u2013 for example, 20Hz flicker could induce neural activity, but led to lower cytokine expression, which can be a good thing. Cytokines are necessary for a healthy immune system, but in the right amounts \u2013 cytokines run amok can lead to harmful inflammation.\nAccording to Wood, \u201calthough cytokines often come from immune cells, like microglia, we thought the cytokines might come from other kinds of brain cells. To help sort out the sources, we isolated the nuclei from different cells in the brain and looked at the genes affected by 40Hz flicker. We found that 40Hz stimulates immune genes in neurons that may regulate production of cytokines. We also found changed genes in microglia, but they were mainly involved in controlling cell shape or morphology.\u201d\u00a0 Singer added \u201cto see that such a simple thing, flickering lights and sounds at different frequencies, lead to differences in immune genes was really cool.\u201d\nIndeed, the team saw the effects that different frequencies can have on the microglia, dramatically altering its morphology \u2013 its shape and function. \u201cForty Hertz and twenty Hertz were both different from no stimulation at all, and in opposite directions,\u201d Singer said.\nDifferent Shapes, Different Functions\nAt 20Hz, microglia assumed their ramified, surveillance mode \u2013 lots of branches, or dendrites, reaching out from the cell body. At 40Hz, they look more like amoeba, an amorphous blob that eats, or engulfs, pathogens. So, microglia do a different dance based on the rhythm.\nFurthermore, their research revealed an underlying mechanism allowing all of this to happen. It\u2019s a protein complex called nuclear factor kappa B, or NFkB. This signaling mechanism, which regulates immune function, is the pathway that links flicker stimulation to inspire the brain rhythms and the resulting immune response.\nSinger, who is a mother, compared these different effects to a toddler making his way in the world. \u201cWhen microglia surveil their environment, they stretch out to the things around them, like a toddler touching ever dirty thing they can get their hands on,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd when microglia enter their engulfing state, it\u2019s like a toddler sticking everything in their mouth.\u201d\nShe added, \u201cThe important thing is, in some disease contexts, you want the surveillance state \u2013 you want to turn down the immune response. In others, you want the more active, engulfing state that we see at the higher frequency.\u201d\nSo, a different kind of stimulation for a different disease state? Or a new, non-invasive way to maintain an already healthy brain? Possibly both, eventually.\n\u201cThe potential is, we can non-invasively manipulate the brain\u2019s immune system in either direction, turning it up or turning it down, depending on the stimulation,\u201d Singer said. \u201cThat has important implications for using this technology in a lot of different ways, in the presence of disease, or as way to boost this function or that function.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nContact\nJerry Grillo\nEmail\njerry.grillo@ibb.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
