The daylong event, called\nRing Your Rep , is being hosted by SGA\u2019s government relations committee.\nDespite what the name suggests, Ring Your Rep isn\u2019t just about making phone calls. Participants can also email, fill out a contact form online, or reach out any other way that their representatives are accessible. The committee encourages people to talk to any and all of their representatives (local, state, or federal) about issues that matter to them. Many offices will have staff members specifically dedicated to logging constituent opinions and passing them up to the elected official.\n\u201cWe saw exciting student participation in the November and January elections, but it\u2019s important to remind students that civic engagement doesn\u2019t stop at elections,\u201d said Kate Cullen, co-chair of the government relations committee. \u201cBeing an engaged citizen means learning to advocate for causes you are passionate about, that affect you.\u201d\nOne of the easiest ways for people to reach their representatives in Congress is to call the Capitol Switchboard at 202.224.3121. Georgia residents looking to contact their state representatives can start with the state\u2019s\nFind Your Legislator\npage. For those not wanting to talk on the phone,\ndemocracy.io\nlets you input your street address and write a custom message to your congressional representatives without having to type in their individual emails.\nThe government relations committee will be hosting virtual office hours on\nBlueJeans\nfrom 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. for anyone who wants to drop in with questions or simply have someone help them contact their representatives.\n\u201cYour representatives depend on your input to effectively represent your interests,\u201d said Samuel Ellis, SGA\u2019s vice president of external affairs. \u201cI hope that students leave this event feeling empowered to contact their representatives and make calling politicians a part of their habits as involved citizens.\u201d\nMore information and resources about how to find your elected officials, sample scripts and tips for calling offices, and potential issues to talk about can be found\nhere .\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nRing Your Rep Resources\nContact\nGrace Wyner\nInstitute Communications\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
