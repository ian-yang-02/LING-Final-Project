At Tech, Will Fuss and Jack Purdy accepted the challenge.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nEmail\nOct 26, 2021\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nEvery year, the Associated Press and Coaches Poll rank the top 25 college football teams throughout the season. These rankings give the public a better idea of what teams stand out, and the people who vote in these polls are chosen specifically to be unbiased and informed. Now, college newspapers around the country are hoping to give voices to all the students in the stands watching games.\nPatrick Felts, a writer for The Indiana Daily Student, reached out to colleges around the country looking for others willing to participate in this new idea. At Tech, Will Fuss and Jack Purdy accepted the challenge. Every week, they submit their rankings of the teams they believe make up the 25 best. \u201cIt\u2019s fun to have an opinion on football outside of Tech and work with others while forming a community,\u201d said Fuss, the sports editor of the\nTechnique , Georgia Tech\u2019s newspaper. The poll has been a way to engage the sports side of the paper, in a broader student journalism network. Because of this poll, Fuss appeared on a podcast with the Northern Illinois student beat writer before the two schools faced off, which brought the Technique\u2019s name beyond the confines of Tech.\nMost importantly, it has been fun for everyone involved. \u201cIt\u2019s an excuse to watch more football. I\u2019m up all day watching all the games,\u201d Fuss said. College football is an integral part of the college experience, which is what makes it special to the students involved. On top of this, there is something that no coach or professional journalist has. \u201cWe have the soul of the teams. There is a different perspective that comes with being part of the student section compared to the press box,\u201d said Purdy, the assistant sports editor. These students understand the opportunity and do not take it lightly. Both Purdy and Fuss strive to be objective as the participants in the other polls do.\nFuss was so thrilled by the opportunity that he immediately thought of putting it in print in the Technique. After reaching out to the Indiana Daily Student, they were delighted at the idea of informing more students about the poll. The Technique became the first college newspaper in the country to publish the poll in print media, and they have inspired many others to do the same. \u201cThis is a good thing for student media, and we want this to continue after us,\u201d Purdy said. And it is an idea that will go beyond football, as they plan to continue polling for men's and women\u2019s basketball.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nConnor White\nInstitute Communications\nEmail\nstucomm@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
