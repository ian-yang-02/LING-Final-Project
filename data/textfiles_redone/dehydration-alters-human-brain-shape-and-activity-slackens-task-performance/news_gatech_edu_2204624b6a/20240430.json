The fluid loss led most of the subjects to make more goofs on the task, and areas of participants\u2019 brains showed conspicuous changes.\nThe researchers also found that even without dehydration, exertion and heat put a dent in test subjects\u2019 performance, but water loss made the dent about twice as deep.\n\u201cWe wanted to tease out whether exercise and heat stress alone have an impact on your cognitive function and study the effect of dehydration on top of that,\u201d\u00a0 said Mindy Millard-Stafford, the study\u2019s principal investigator and a professor in Georgia Tech\u2019s School of Biological Sciences . \u201cWe found a two-step decline.\u201d\nHeat, strain, accident\nThe researchers hope that someday this kind of research will offer insights into how increased cognitive slipups in hot settings with strenuous labor and poor hydration may endanger occupational safety, especially around heavy machines or military hardware. The fuzzed cognition could also contribute to reduced performance in competitive sports.\n\u201cWhen I was just getting interested in this subject, my brother was doing an internship at a steel plant, where I visited him, and it was extremely hot,\u201d said the study\u2019s first author\u00a0 Matt Wittbrodt , a former graduate research assistant at Georgia Tech. \u201cIn addition, everyone had on layers of protective clothing. We want to figure out if we can help prevent accidents in those environments.\u201d\nMillard-Stafford and Wittbrodt, who is now a postdoctoral researcher at Emory University, published\ntheir study on Thursday, August 23, in the journal\u00a0 Physiological Reports . Their research was partly funded by The American College of Sports Medicine Foundation.\nBrain ventricles expand\nIn the experiments, when participants exercised, sweated and drank water, fluid-filled spaces called\nventricles in the center of their brains\ncontracted. But with exertion plus dehydration, the ventricles did the opposite; they expanded.\nFunctional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) revealed the differences. Oddly, the ventricle expansion in dehydrated test subjects may not have had much to do with their deeper slumps in task performance.\n\u201cThe structural changes were remarkably consistent across individuals,\u201d said Millard-Stafford a past president of The American College of Sports Medicine. \u201cBut performance differences in the tasks could not be explained by changes in the size of those brain areas.\u201d\nChanges in neural firing patterns showed up during dehydration, too.\n\u201cThe areas in the brain required for doing the task appeared to activate more intensely than before, and also, areas lit up that were not necessarily involved in completing the task,\u201d Wittbrodt said. \u201cWe think the latter may be in response to the physiological state: the body signaling, \u2018I\u2019m dehydrated\u2019.\u201d\nMind-numbing task\nThe task the subjects completed was mindless and repetitive.\nFor 20 straight minutes, they were expected to punch a button every time a yellow square appeared on a monitor. Sometimes the square appeared in a regular pattern, and sometimes it appeared randomly. The task was dull for a reason.\n\u201cIt helped us to avoid the cognitive complexity behind elaborate tasks and strip cognition down to simple motor output,\u201d Wittbrodt said. \u201cIt was designed to hit essential neural processing one would use to make straightforward, repetitive movements.\u201d\nPast studies have indicated that this kind of task reflects the neural processing involved in real-life motor functioning, especially in the repetition common in manual labor or military exercises. Such monotony can foster attention lapses that heat, strain, and fluid loss may exacerbate.\nSweating for science\nThirteen volunteers performed the task on three separate occasions:\nOnce after just relaxing and staying hydrated.\nOnce after extended heat, exertion, and sweat but\u00a0 with \u00a0drinking water during exercise.\nAnd once with heat, exertion, and sweat but\u00a0 without \u00a0drinking water.\nEven after just relaxing, task performance gradually slipped as the 20 minutes crept by. But under the subsequent stressors, average overall performance ratcheted down. A few of the volunteers did perform the task stalwartly under all imposed conditions.\nThe subjects completed the task in air-conditioned rooms and after a break from strenuous activity. In a real-world scenario, in which heat and toil are unrelenting, performance may collapse even further.\nOverhydration also bad\nGoing forward, the researchers would like to know if hydrating with electrolyte drinks might mitigate performance slumps even better than water did.\n\u201cBlood plasma gets diluted with water replacement alone,\u201d Millard-Stafford said. \u201cIf blood sodium -- plain old salt -- drops too much while water in the blood increases too much, that\u2019s dangerous. It\u2019s a condition known as water intoxication or\nhyponatremia .\u201d\nUltra-endurance athletes who end up in the medical tent are sometimes suffering from dehydration but also sometimes from water intoxication. Just the right balance of water seems to be important for the brain.\nLike this article?\u00a0 Subscribe to our email newsletter\nAlso READ:\nAs We Get Parched, Cognition Can Sputter\nGeorgia Tech\u2019s Michael Sawka and Lewis Wheaton, and J.
