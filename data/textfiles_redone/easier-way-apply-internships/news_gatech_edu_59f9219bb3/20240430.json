The invention is up for the InVenture Prize.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nEmail\nInternBlitz finds internships for students; automatically fills in their personal contact information and resume; and then sends applicants the extra, company-specific questions. It is similar to the online Common App students use to apply for colleges.\u00a0The invention is one of six competing for the 2017 Georgia Tech InVenture Prize.\nThe inventors are\u00a0Murtaza Bambot,\u00a0an industrial engineering major, and\u00a0Nathan Dass, a computer science major.\nPhoto by Rob Felt.\nMar 14, 2017\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nLast year Murtaza Bambot applied to 125 different companies for internships. He spent about 70 hours filling out applications, and much of it was repetitious \u2013 providing his contact information and uploading his resume over and over again.\n\u201cI realized if I was having this problem, so were thousands of other college students across the country,\u201d said Bambot, an industrial engineering major from Duluth, Ga.\nHe teamed up with Nathan Dass, a computer science major, and together they invented a computer program to streamline the internship application process.\nInternBlitz finds internships for students, automatically fills in their personal contact information and resume, and then sends applicants the extra, company-specific questions. It is similar to the online Common App students use to apply for colleges. If InternBlitz had existed last year, Bambot estimates he could have applied for all 125 internships in just one hour.\nThe invention is one of six competing for the 2017 Georgia Tech InVenture Prize. The annual competition awards $35,000 in cash prizes and brings together student innovators from all academic backgrounds to foster creativity, invention and entrepreneurship.\nBambot and Dass, who are members of Alpha Kappa Psi, started working on the invention in October.\n\u201cWriting the script for the program wasn\u2019t hard,\u201d said Dass, who is from Woodbridge, Va. \u201cThe biggest challenge was getting a high number of good internship jobs so students would want to use our site.\u201d\nThey pulled applications from different servers and have about 600 openings on the site now. The number is expected to more than double in the fall, during the height of internship application season, the team said.\nThe site is going through beta testing with roughly 100 students from Georgia Tech and Georgia State University. The service is free for students.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want money to be a barrier for jobs,\u201d Bambot said. \u201cAll college students should have easy and free access to good internships.\u201d\nOnce they have enough students go through the application process they plan to use machine learning to analyze how far applicants got with each internship.\nThe data could reveal to both students and companies what type of applicant profile is most likely to be selected for a first-round interview. This in turn could allow the internship process to become more efficient for both students and companies, they said.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be able to make internship recommendations the same way Netflix gives movie recommendations,\u201d Dass said.\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nGeorgia Tech's InVenture Prize\nContact\nLaura Diamond\nMedia Relations\n404-894-6016\n@LauraRDiamond\nEmail\nlaura.diamond@gatech.edu\nAdditional information\nThe winning InVenture Prize team will take home $20,000 and represent Georgia Tech in the annual ACC InVenture Prize, taking place on campus March 31.\nThe second-place team earns $10,000.\nBoth first- and second-place finishers will receive free U.S. patent filings.\nA $5,000 People\u2019s Choice Award will go to the fans\u2019 favorite invention.
