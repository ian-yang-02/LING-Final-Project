When floodwaters hit, they self-assemble and form rafts to stay alive. They can also use their bodies to build bridges and span gaps. What are the properties of these ant aggregations that allow for this wide range of abilities? New research from the Georgia Institute of Technology says it\u2019s because the insects are actually liquid-like and solid-like simultaneously. The study is currently published in Nature Materials. The Georgia Tech group probed the mechanical properties of fire ant aggregations by putting thousands of ants into a rheometer, a machine used to test the solid-like and liquid-like response of materials such as food, hand cream or melted plastic. The ants were sheared at constant speeds from about 0.0001 rpm up to about 100 rpm. The researchers found that the behavior of live ants was similar to that of dead ants: when the aggregation is forced to flow, live ants let go and play dead. In this case, the viscosity dramatically decreased as the speed increased. \u201cIt\u2019s not unlike ketchup,\u201d said Alberto Fernandez-Nieves, an associate professor in the School of Physics. \u201cThe harder you squeeze, the easier it flows. But with ants, this happens much more dramatically than with ketchup.\u201d \u201c Ants seem to have an on/off switch\nin that they let go for sufficiently large applied forces,\u201d said David Hu, an associate professor in the George W. Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering. \u201cDespite wanting to be together, they let go and behave like a fluid to prevent getting injured or killed.\u201d This same behavior\ncan be seen by dropping a penny\nthrough an ant aggregation. Ants will flow around the coin as it sinks through the aggregation. This flow takes a relatively long time to happen. However, when the aggregation is poked quickly, it responds like a spring and returns to its original shape. \u201cThis is the hallmark of viscoelastic behavior,\u201d said Fernandez-Nieves. \u201cThe ants exhibit a springy-response when probed at short times, but behave fluid-like at longer times.\u201d The group quantified this by looking at the ants\u2019 response to tiny wiggles of the rheometer. They found that the ants are equally liquid-like and solid-like. They did the same experiment with dead ants and saw that they are also solid-like. This showed that live ants are liquid-like and solid-like because of their activity. \u201cRemarkably, the observed behavior is similar to what is seen in materials that are not alive, like polymer gels right at the point when they become a gel,\u201d said Fernandez-Nieves. \u201cThis is quite puzzling, and we are now performing many more experiments to try and understand where these similarities arise from and how much they can be pushed. Doing this will hopefully extend our current way of thinking about materials, that like the ants, are active and thus out-of-equilibrium. There is much more interesting work we plan on doing with ants.\u201d Hu has studied ant behavior for nearly 10 years. Fernandez-Nieves is a physicist who uses rheology to understand the mechanics of soft materials and unravel the microscopic origin of their overall properties and behaviors. Michael Tennenbaum , a graduate research assistant who participated in the study, also compared the behavior of the ant aggregation to jello. \u201cImagine if you wanted to make the most jello possible out of a packet of gelatin. It would be solid, but also very liquidy,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s because there would be just barely enough gelatin to make it solid-like but not enough to make it completely solid. The jello would be both solid-like and liquid-like.\u201d Hu has also used the liquid-like nature of the ants to study self-healing materials. \u201cIf you cut a dinner roll with a knife, you\u2019re going to end up with two pieces of bread,\u201d said Hu. \u201cBut if you cut through a pile of ants, they\u2019ll simply let the knife go through, then reform on the other side. They\u2019re like liquid metal \u2013 just like that scene in the Terminator movie.\u201d Hu says it\u2019s this flexibility that allows ants to enjoy the best of both worlds. They\u2019re able to become solids to make things and liquids to avoid breaking into \u201csmithereens.\u201d The study, \u201c Mechanics of Ant Aggregations ,\u201d was published in Nature Materials on October 26, 2015.
