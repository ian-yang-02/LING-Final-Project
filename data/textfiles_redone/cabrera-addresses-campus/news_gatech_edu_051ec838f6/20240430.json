We have each faced unique challenges in our own personal lives. And, together, we have managed to keep Georgia Tech strong and delivering on its important mission.\u201d\nCabrera said that despite the challenges created by the coronavirus pandemic, Georgia Tech is having a bigger impact in the world than ever before.\n\u201cWe educate more students and graduate them at higher rates. We conduct more research that helps address some of the biggest challenges we face. We drive more innovation in our local economy and are helping attract some of the most iconic companies of our time \u2014 the likes of Google and Microsoft \u2014 to our neighborhood,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI am humbled and grateful that I get to work with a fine group of people every day,\u201d he said. \u201cIf there is one message today, that is a big, huge thank you!\u201d\nCabrera talked about the far-reaching effects of Covid-19 around the world, in the U.S., and at Georgia Tech.\n\u201cThe impact has been felt in our very own community. I know it has created a lot of stress among many of us, and it has created a lot of stress in all of us together as an institution. This was a time of very difficult questions, very difficult issues, with very difficult answers,\u201d Cabrera said. \u201cThe path we\u2019ve taken at Georgia Tech is to try our best to return to campus and resume our activities safely. It hasn\u2019t been easy. But it has allowed us to keep our important work moving forward while minimizing the economic damage, not just to the Institute but to many people whose livelihoods depend on us.\u201d\nCabrera thanked the many members of the Tech community who helped keep Georgia Tech open and moving forward, from students and their families, to Stamps Health Services, Facilities, Environmental Health and Safety, and so many others.\n\u201cAmong all the things we have done to navigate this storm, I am particularly appreciative of the impressive surveillance testing we have built \u2014 not only because it has helped us identify and contain outbreaks and curb infections, but because it shows what Georgia Tech is all about: bringing people together, collaborating, innovating, advancing and leveraging technology, solving problems, and serving others.\u201d\nHe recognized the individuals who joined Tech\u2019s leadership team in recent months: Kelly Fox, executive vice president for Administration and Finance; Kaye Husbands Fealing, dean and Ivan Allen Jr. Chair, Ivan Allen College of Liberal Arts; Leslie Sharp, dean of the Library; Jodi Geary, chief audit executive; Daren Hubbard, chief information officer; and Steve McLaughlin, incoming provost and executive vice president for Academic Affairs.\nCabrera noted that even while battling a pandemic, the Institute continued to plan for the future with a new 10-year strategic plan. The new plan, currently under development, is grounded in a new mission statement and values, declaring Tech\u2019s commitment to \u201cdeveloping leaders who advance technology and improve the human condition.\u201d\n\u201cThe mission and the values are not just words on paper,\u201d Cabrera said. \u201cThey describe who we are when we are at our best and who we aspire to be every day. They are also, as we have learned, our lodestar in times of crisis. Not only as we deal with Covid-19.\u201d\nHe outlined how Tech\u2019s vision is grounded in six areas of strategic priority:\nAmplify impact\nChampion innovation\nConnect globally\nExpand access\nCultivate well-Being\nLead by example\n\u201cTogether, we have crafted a vision of inclusive and meaningful innovation, of service to the public good, of developing exceptional leaders, and producing ideas that can help us break new ground in addressing the biggest local, national, and global challenges of our time,\u201d he said.\nCabrera thanked Provost Rafael L. Bras, who is retiring, for his exemplary service to the Institute.\n\u201cUnder Rafael\u2019s leadership, Tech increased enrollment by 74% and now has as many graduate students as undergraduates; created new degree programs; expanded cocurricular and extracurricular programs; launched Georgia Tech Arts; transformed the campus; increased international collaborations and started a new campus in Shenzhen; and devised new, accessible pathways to graduate education and alternate educational options for learners around the world,\u201d Cabrera said.\nHe concluded as he began, with words of gratitude.\n\u201cLet me thank each one of you for your commitment to Georgia Tech and our students during this difficult year,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThe challenges we have faced have been significant, and we can be proud of how we have responded. I am convinced that this experience will ultimately make us stronger. More committed to our mission of Progress and Service and to the idea that technology, the science that supports it, the scholarship that guides it, and the leadership that deploys it can help us improve the human condition \u2014 and be more open to envisioning new ways to deliver on that mission.\u201d\nThe Institute Address was followed by a question and answer session.
