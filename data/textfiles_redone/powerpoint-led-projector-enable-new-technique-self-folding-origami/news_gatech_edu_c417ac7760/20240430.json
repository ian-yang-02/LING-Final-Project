(Credit: Rob Felt, Georgia Tech)\nApr 28, 2017\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nResearchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology and Peking University have found a new use for the ubiquitous PowerPoint slide: Producing self-folding three-dimensional origami structures from photocurable liquid polymers.\nThe technique involves projecting a grayscale pattern of light and dark shapes onto a thin layer of liquid acrylate polymer placed in a plate or between two glass slides. A photoinitiator material mixed into the polymer initiates a crosslinking reaction when struck by light from an ordinary LED projector, causing a solid film to form. A light-absorbing dye in the polymer serves as a regulator for the light. Due to the complicated interaction between the evolution of the polymer network and volume shrinkage during photo curing, areas of the polymer that receive less light exhibit more apparent bending behavior.\nWhen the newly-created polymer film is removed from the liquid polymer, the stress created in the film by the differential shrinkage causes the folding to begin. To make the most complex origami structures, the researchers shine light onto both sides of the structures.\nOrigami structures produced so far include tiny tables, capsules, flowers, birds and the traditional miura-ori fold \u2013 all about a half-inch in size. The origami structures could have applications in soft robots, microelectronics, soft actuators, mechanical metamaterials and biomedical devices.\n\u201cThe basic idea of our method is to utilize the volume shrinkage phenomenon during photo-polymerization,\u201d said\nJerry Qi , a professor in the\nWoodruff School of Mechanical Engineering\nat Georgia Tech. \u201cDuring a specific type of photopolymerization, frontal photopolymerization, the liquid resin is cured continuously from the side under light irradiation toward the inner side. This creates a non-uniform stress field that drives the film to bend along the direction of light path.\u201d\nDetails of the work were published April 28 in the journal\nScience Advances . The research was supported by the National Science Foundation, the Air Force Office of Scientific Research and the Chinese Scholarship Council. It is believed to be the first application to create self-folding origami structures through the control of volume shrinkage during patterned photopolymerization.\nThe process that creates the shrinkage phenomenon is considered harmful in other uses of the polymer.\n\u201cVolume shrinkage of polymer was always assumed to be detrimental in the fabrication of composites and in the conventional 3-D printing technology,\u201d said Daining Fang, a co-author of the paper and a professor at Peking University when the research was done. \u201cOur work shows that with a change of perspective, this phenomenon can become quite useful.\u201d Fang is now at Beijing Institute of Technology.\nTo make the most complex shapes with bending in both directions, the researchers can flip the patterned film over to create crosslinking on the other side.\n\u201cWe have developed two types of fabrication processes,\u201d said Zeang Zhao, a Ph.D. student at Georgia Tech and Peking University. \u201cIn the first one, you can just shine the light pattern towards a layer of liquid resin, and then you will get the origami structure. In the second one, you may need to flip the layer and shine a second pattern. This second process gives you much wider design freedom.\u201d\nLight is shined onto the film for five to ten seconds, which produces a film about 200 microns thick. \u201cThe areas that receive light become solid; the other parts of the pattern remain liquid, and the structure can then be removed from the liquid polymer,\u201d said Qi. \u201cThe technique is very simple.\u201d\nFrontal photopolymerization is a process in which a polymer film is continuously cured from one side in a thick layer of liquid resin. In the presence of strong light attenuation, the solidification front initiates at the surface upon illumination and propagates toward the liquid side as the irradiation time increases. The process can be delicately tuned by controlling the illumination time and the light intensity, and the method has been used to fabricate microfluidic devices and synthesize microparticles.\nThe researchers used poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate in this demonstration, but the technique should work with a broad range of photocurable polymers. An orange dye was used in the demonstration, but other dyes could produce structures in a range of different colors.\nFor the proof-of-principle, Zhao created a PowerPoint pattern by hand. To scale the process up, the system could be connected to a computer-aided design (CAD) tool for generating more precise grayscale patterns.\nQi believes the technique could be used to produce structures as much as an inch in size. \u201cThe self-folding requires relatively thin films which might not be possible in larger structures,\u201d he said.\nAdded Qi, \u201cWe have developed a simple approach to fold a thin sheet of polymer into complicated three-dimensional origami structures. Our approach is not limited by specific materials, and the patterning is so simple that anybody with PowerPoint and a projector could do it.\u201d\nThis research was supported by NSF awards CMMI-1462894, CMMI-1462895, and EFRI-1435452; and the Air Force Office of Scientific Research grant 15RT0885.
