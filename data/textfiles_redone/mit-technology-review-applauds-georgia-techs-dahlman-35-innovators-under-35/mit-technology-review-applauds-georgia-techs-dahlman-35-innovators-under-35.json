Credit: MIT Technology Review\nJul 02, 2018\n\u2014 Atlanta, GA\nWhen a recognition makes your name fit comfortably into the same sentence with Facebook\u2019s \u201cMark Zuckerberg\u201d or Google co-founder \u201cLarry Page,\u201d you know it\u2019s something special. A shout-out in the\nMIT Technology Review \u2019s annual roster of \u201c35 Innovators Under 35\u201d did just that for Georgia Tech biomedical researcher James Dahlman.\nThe iconic research magazine applauded Dahlman because, as it stated in its headline, \u201c His method makes it possible to test 300 drugs at once .\u201d The \u201c35\u201d roster is noted for having anticipated the successes of Zuckerberg and Page, as well as that of Helen Greiner, co-founder of iRobot, Jonathan Ive, chief designer at Apple, and other consummate go-getters in industry, technology, and research.\nDahlman felt honored to join the list, which was published on June 27, but also humbled.\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t put myself in the same category as those people, but research colleagues who have made this list have gone on to make very significant contributions to science,\u201d said Dahlman, an assistant professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to get on that list, so I was thrilled, and a little surprised,\u201d he said. \u201cIt also comes with certain expectations to live up to.\u201d\nDNA-barcoding\nWhat Dahlman scrutinizes with his methods are, more precisely, nanoparticles designed to deliver a drug or gene therapy.\nHe calls\nhis invention \u201cDNA-barcoding, \"\u00a0because it tracks hundreds of different nanoparticles at once to see how well they hit targeted tumor cells by loading up each one of the particles with its own custom-coded piece\u00a0of DNA. Researchers can inject the particles all at once into a live mouse then later excise the tumor and sequence the DNA strands to see which nanoparticles best delivered their payloads to tumor cells.\nThe top nanoparticles could be loaded up with an effective therapy for targeted delivery.\n\u201cDNA makes for a fantastic tracker,\u201d Dahlman said. \u201cThere are thousands to millions to billions of code combinations. It\u2019s nature\u2019s way of storing information, so we can exploit that.\u201d\nDNA barcoding has upended other methods of tracking nanoparticles. It has flatly nullified the results of tracking via lab samples,\nin vitro . And barcoding has left traditional tracking \u00a0in vivo,\nin live mice, which can only follow one or a few particles at a time, in the dust.\nParkinson\u2019s and heart disease\nThe\nReview\ncited specifically DNA barcoding\u2019s potential for honing nanoparticles\u2019 aim at cancer cells, but there are many possible uses.\n\u201cIt can be for any cell type. We\u2019re also using it for heart disease and for Parkinson\u2019s,\u201d Dahlman said.\nDahlman gives the real credit for the \u201c35\u201d kudos to the graduate students and postdoctoral researchers in his Lab for Precision Therapies in the\nWallace H. Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering at Georgia Tech and Emory University .\n\u201cThey have done a lot of the actual work,\u201d Dahlman said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t get good students, you won\u2019t be able to do anything, and the school here should get a lot of credit for recruiting them.\u201d\nThe graduate students were jazzed to see their principal investigator on a pedestal.\n\u201cWe were all super excited and all huddled around the computer looking at James\u2019s profile and at the other people on that list to see what they accomplished to get on that list,\u201d said Ph.D. student Cory Sago, who chose Georgia Tech largely because of Dahlman.\nPast Georgia Tech honorees\nPast Georgia Tech researchers named in the \u201c35\u201d list include\nmicroneedle patch co-inventor\nMark Prausnitz , and microfluidics engineer and genotype-phenotype researcher\nHang Lu . More Georgia Tech graduates, mainly from master\u2019s programs, have appeared on the\nMIT Technology Review\nroster for making notable entrepreneurial waves.\nDahlman\u2019s inclusion in the 2018 edition of \u201c35 Innovators Under 35\u201d follows a string of prior acknowledgments and fellowships awarded Dahlman by the National Science Foundation, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, the National Institutes of Health and private foundations.\nThe\nMIT Technology Review\nwas founded at the\u00a0 Massachusetts Institute of Technology \u00a0in 1899, and later became independent but maintains its affiliation with MIT. Dahlman received his Ph.D. jointly from MIT and Harvard Medical School in 2014 and was a postdoctoral researcher at their shared Broad Institute, which is dedicated to improving human health through genomics.\nLike this article?\u00a0 Get our email newsletter here.\nMedia Relations Contact : Ben Brumfield (404-660-1408) (ben.brumfield@comm.gatech.edu).\nWriter : Ben Brumfield\nAdditional Images\nContact\nResearch News\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\n177 North Avenue\nAtlanta, Georgia\u00a0 30332-0181\u00a0 USA\nEmail\nben.brumfield@comm.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
