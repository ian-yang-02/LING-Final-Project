It goes out to cancer fighters and tempts them with a\nnew program that predicts cancer drug effectiveness\nvia machine learning and raw genetic data.\nThe researchers who built the program at the Georgia Institute of Technology would like cancer fighters to take it for free, or even just swipe parts of their programming code, so they\u2019ve made it open source. They hope to attract a crowd of researchers who will also share their own cancer and computer expertise and data to improve upon the program and save more lives together.\nThe researchers\u2019 invitation to take their code is also a gauntlet.\nThey\u2019re challenging others to come beat them at their own game and help hone\u00a0a formidable software tool for the greater good. Not only the labor but also the fruits will remain openly accessible to benefit the treatment of patients as best possible.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to hold the code or data for ourselves or make profits with this,\u201d said John McDonald, the\ndirector of Georgia Tech\u2019s Integrated Cancer Research Center . \u00a0\u201cWe want to keep this\u00a0wide open so it will spread.\u201d\nThe goods\nResearchers wanting to participate can\nfollow this link to a new study published on October 26, 2017, in the journal\nPLOS One . There they will find links to download the software from GitHub and to access the code.\nThey\u2019ll start out with a current program that has been about 85% accurate in assessing treatment effectiveness of nine drugs across the genetic data of 273 cancer patients. The study by McDonald and collaborator Fredrik Vannberg details how and why.\n\u201cNine drugs are in the published study, but we\u2019ve actually run about 120 drugs through the program all total,\u201d said Vannberg, an\nassistant professor in Georgia Tech\u2019s School of Biological Sciences .\nThe program uses proven machine learning mechanisms and also normalizes data. The latter allows the machine learning to work with data from varying sources by making them compatible.\nThe bias\nAnd the researchers have reduced human bias about which data are important for predicting outcomes.\n\u201cIt\u2019s much more effective to put in loads of raw data and let the algorithm sort it out,\u201d McDonald said. \u201cIt\u2019s looking for correlations, not causes, so it\u2019s not good to preselect data for what you suspect are most relevant.\u201d\nOne big bias the researchers tossed out was a concentration only on gene expression data pertaining to the specific type of cancer they were aiming to treat.\n\u201cIt turns out that it\u2019s better to give the program data from a broad diversity of cancers, and that will actually later give a better prediction of drug effectiveness for a specific cancer like breast cancer,\u201d Vannberg said.\n\u201cOn a molecular level, some breast cancers, for example, are going to be more similar to some ovarian cancers than to other breast cancers,\u201d McDonald said. \u201cWe just let the algorithm work with about everything we had, and we got high accuracy.\u201d\nThe winners\nThe researchers also want the project to pool large amounts of anonymous patient treatment success and failure data, which will help the program optimize predictions for everyone\u2019s benefit. But that doesn\u2019t mean some companies can\u2019t benefit, too.\n\u201cIf a company comes along and makes profits while using the program to help patients, that\u2019s fine, and there\u2019s no obligation to give back to the project,\u201d said McDonald, who is also a professor in Georgia Tech\u2019s\nSchool of Biological Sciences . \u201cOthers may just take if they so please.\u201d\nBut hopefully, most players will catch the spirit of kindness.\n\u201cWith our project, we\u2019re advertising that sharing should be what everybody does,\u201d Vannberg said. \u201cThis can be a win for everybody, but really it\u2019s a win for the cancer patients.\u201d\nAlso READ: Basic premise in targeted cancer treatments\nwrong\n60% of the time\nGeorgia Tech researchers Cai Huang and Roman Mezencev\ncoauthored\nthe study.
