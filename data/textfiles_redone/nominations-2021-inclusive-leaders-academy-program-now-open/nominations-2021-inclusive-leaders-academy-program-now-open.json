The community has grown to over 300 members and has exposed over 500 managers to various modules.\n\u201cIt\u2019s encouraging during this double pandemic to hear and see greater interest from our executives to continue cultivating inclusive leadership capacity,\u201d said Pearl Alexander, SDIE\u2019s executive director of diversity, inclusion, and engagement. \u201cLeaders own the culture of the Institute, and accelerating our progress toward inclusive excellence requires proactive, intentional, and focused efforts among the various levels of administrators and managers here. Top-down development is essential to support the Institute\u2019s values and goals.\u201d\nCheryl Cofield, SDIE\u2019s director of inclusion and engagement, added, \u201cThrough e-learning modules, interactive dialogues, storytelling, and group coaching sessions, this all-virtual experience will help leaders to proactively consider their legacies.\u201d\nCurriculum content for the program is curated from the NeuroLeadership Institute on the neuroscience of teams, unconscious bias, and research on inclusion. The 2021 cohort will also study \u201cDare to Lead,\u201d written by and based on the research of\u00a0Bren\u00e9 Brown,\u00a0 New York Times \u00a0bestselling author.
