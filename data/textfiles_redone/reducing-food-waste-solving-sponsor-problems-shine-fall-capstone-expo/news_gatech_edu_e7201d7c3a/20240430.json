The goal is to collect information that chefs can use to improve what and how much they serve. The bucket also helps students think about the carbon footprint of their trash.\n\u201cFood waste is a major overlooked issue in the United States. That's what really motivated us to tackle this problem,\u201d said Ivan Zou, a computer engineering major and member of\u00a0 Team Raccoon Eyes . \u201cOur project is really about reducing waste at the source by improving food quality, helping with portion sizes, and making students more aware of what they're actually throwing away.\u201d\nThe team\u2019s approach to reducing the estimated 7 billion pounds of food discarded every year on college campuses won the Best Overall Project award Dec. 5 at Capstone Expo. This fall, the showcase of semester-long senior design projects featured 110 teams across seven schools in the Colleges of Engineering, Computing, and Design. They displayed work ranging from\u00a0 Martian missions \u00a0and\u00a0 hedge trimmers with a removable blade \u00a0to\u00a0 play structures for kids \u00a0and an\u00a0 easier-to-use epinephrine injector for allergic reactions .
