As the construction fencing comes down, a fresh, new greenspace welcomes students for the spring semester.\nThe campus EcoCommons is 80 acres of\u00a0smartly designed and engineered performance landscape.\u00a0This new 8-acre portion features more than 600 trees, tens of thousands of perennials, and an abundance of ferns and grasses. A granite outcropping adjacent to The Kendeda Building for Innovative Sustainable Design provides an area of engagement featuring multi-level grassy areas perfect for picnics and excellent views of the entire acreage. Nestled among the granite boulders will be three bright yellow slides slated for installation this March. Nearby, a \u201csnag,\u201d or dying tree, has been purposely left in the area to encourage a wildlife habitat, and work is ongoing to certify the area as an Audubon bird sanctuary. Close to Ferst Drive will be a temporary sculpture\u00a0installation by Stickworks artist Patrick Dougherty.\u00a0With the help of hundreds of campus volunteers, the piece, resembling a small fortress, blends seamlessly into the landscape.\u00a0Read more about the artist and his work\nhere.\nTraversing the area are pervious pathways, wooden bridges, and natural trails that will encourage a relaxing walk in the park between classes and meetings. Benches throughout will provide additional places to rest and enjoy this refreshed and renewed area of campus.\u00a0Landscape Project Manager Jerry Young has guided the site transformation and looks forward to seeing the Georgia Tech community enjoy its natural beauty.\u00a0\"I've worked for Georgia Tech since 2006 and have overseen lots of projects.\u00a0I can honestly say that this one was quite complex and extremely satisfying to watch evolve.\u00a0I'm excited for\u00a0spring to see it really come alive.\"\nAcross from Couch Park, a swath of tupelo trees strung with hammocks encircles a raised meadow planted with native grasses. There is also a contemplative grove, which pays tribute to and symbolizes an important moment in civil rights history. From 1947 to 1964, the Pickrick Restaurant stood on this portion of land and was the site of conflict over equal access to public accommodations. Historical signage will be in place to explain and contextualize the events that occurred there. Read more about the EcoCommons design, and the Pickrick and its significance,\nhere .\nThe EcoCommons is more than just a park. According to Jason Gregory, senior planner in Capital Planning and Space Management, \u201cIf people think this is just a park, we have failed.\u201d Georgia Tech\u2019s overall EcoCommons project envisions 80 acres of greenspaces throughout campus that follow what were once naturally occurring stream paths before urbanization. These greenspaces are being designed, connected, and engineered to reduce stormwater runoff by 50%, increase biodiversity on campus, and provide a living, learning laboratory for the Georgia Tech community.\nExtensive grading, soil amendments, and installation of drainage infrastructure were the first steps in transforming this area into an ecological treasure. Located near the Dalney Building is a large bioswale, capable of holding 500,000 gallons of water before releasing any of it back into the city\u2019s water system. This large channel is designed to convey stormwater runoff while removing debris and pollution. A covered platform overlooks this seepage wetland and provides unique vantage points for observing this smart and effective water stewardship.\nLocated throughout the 8 acres will be numerous sensors connected to the LORA-WAN (Long Range Wide Area Network) Internet of Things (a networking protocol wirelessly connecting battery-operated \u201cthings\u201d to the internet), which will measure air temperature and humidity, wind speed and direction, barometric pressure, carbon dioxide levels, soil moisture, and water depth and pressure. Sensors placed at Tech Green will allow for a comparison of data between its open, grassy expanse and this piedmont woodland. The trove of ecological data collected from the sensors will be available to campus operators, researchers, and students alike so that the entire campus community can leverage this living laboratory.\nWith more than 10 years in planning and design, this latest portion of the campus EcoCommons performance landscape exemplifies Georgia Tech\u2019s commitment to the individual health and well-being of its campus inhabitants while supporting its sustainability initiatives well into the 21 st\ncentury.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nCathy Brim\nCommunications Officer\nSustainability, Facilities and Safety\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
