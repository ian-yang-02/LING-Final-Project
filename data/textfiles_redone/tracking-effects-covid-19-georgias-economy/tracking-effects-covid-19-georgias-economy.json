Messner, Scheller Professor of the Practice with over 23 years of experience on Wall Street, had divided the class into small groups with each one responsible for monitoring stocks within a specific industry sector.\nThe economy was booming. The group watching healthcare stocks also started tracking the number of cases coming from Wuhan and began noticing an upward curve. \u201cThey started getting a bit antsy,\u201d Messner recalled. \u201cWe were very much up to speed on what we thought was going to be localized in China, but clearly, it wasn\u2019t,\u201d he said, thinking back to those early days.\nRapid Changes\nSuddenly, the market started falling and not just in healthcare. Over the next few weeks, students following the transportation industry watched their stocks decline and students monitoring the energy sector watched oil prices take a nose-dive. In fact, all sectors plunged. According to Messner, the virus then became the number one concern as they watched it take hold of the market.\nThe class decided to pivot from looking at stocks in the U.S. industry sectors to monitoring industries in the Georgia economy to see how Covid-19 was impacting the state\u2019s overall health. \u201cThere was a lot of experience being built up in watching these markets, so we thought, \u2018Let\u2019s take that experience and\ncreate a website to track Georgia industries ,\u2019\" he stated. Their mission became to collect and provide real-time, ongoing data and share it with the citizens of Georgia.\n\u2018Understanding Exactly What Has Happened\u2019\nWith the support of students in the\nFinancial Services Innovation Lab\nwithin Scheller and sponsorship by the Speedwell Foundation, the website took form. It now contains\ndata from 11 industry sectors\nincluding health care, employment, public companies, real estate, sales tax, transportation, air travel, hotels, and municipal bonds. The ability to show each segment\u2019s health at a glance makes it one of a kind.\nFor example, data from the healthcare industry is collected weekly, and sometimes daily from the\nGeorgia Department of Public Health\nand the\nCovid Tracking Project . At a single glance, viewers can see graphs on the number of tests, deaths, and hospitalizations, along with maps of Georgia showing where the outbreaks are occurring by county. The page also breaks down the number of cases by age, ethnicity, and race.\nSidney Lofton, an undergraduate student at Scheller, is covering the real estate market. \u201cI think the first thing this project will do is open everyone\u2019s eyes to the impact this pandemic has had on the Georgia economy. Everyone knows it\u2019s been a tough few months for the entire country and the world but seeing the numbers and graphs will help people understand what exactly has happened,\u201d she said. For instance, her findings show that the commercial real estate market is being impacted more significantly than the residential market - data that is useful in real estate planning.\nBecause the project is ongoing, Lofton and fellow students continue to gather data even though the semester is over. Dr.\nSudheer Chava , Alton M. Costley Chair, professor of Finance, and director of the Quantitative and Computational Finance (QCF) Program, oversees the Financial Services Innovation Lab and sees an additional value to their work. \u201cThe students are getting the real-world experience they can add to their CV,\u201d he noted.\nIn fact, some students in Messner\u2019s class were preparing for their summer internships when the pandemic hit and lost these opportunities. The Speedwell Foundation, a gift from Messner and his wife, is providing additional support to the students as well as the project. \u201cWe\u2019ve supported professorships in Civil Engineering and the Georgia Tech Promise campaign so it\u2019s just a logical extension of what we\u2019ve done. We\u2019ve always thought that the investment in Georgia Tech gives us a high return because you\u2019re graduating very smart, capable kids who are contributors to society,\u201d he said.\n\u2018The More People Involved, the More Capable We Are of Providing Data\u2019\nThe project is also expanding to include students from other schools within the Tech ecosystem. \u201cThere\u2019s undergraduate students, master\u2019s students, and PhDs from Scheller as well as from the School of Civil and Environmental Engineering and City and Regional Planning. The more people involved and the more collaboration there is, the more capable we are of providing data that is important and useful to the Georgia community,\u201d said Chava.\nRachael Panik, PhD student in the School of Civil and Environmental Engineering heard about the project from her advisor, Dr. Kari Watkins, Frederick Law Olmsted associate professor. \u201cPeople are changing the way they travel not only because of the economy but also for public health reasons. While it\u2019s not clear what this will mean for the future, it\u2019s important to track these trends now so that we can continue to learn about the relationship between travel and the economy,\u201d she said.\n\u2018It\u2019s Not Just About Data Analysis, But Doing Something Purposeful\u2019\nThe project will continue under Chava\u2019s supervision and the students will be adding surveys and interviews with representatives from organizations such as the Georgia Restaurant Association and the Georgia Department of Transportation. They\u2019ve already started a podcast series which is available on the site. \u201cWe want to bring in the human element,\u201d Chava said.\nHe and Messner also plan to continue the project after the pandemic is contained with the possibility of adding more industries and statistics over time and foresees the project having far-reaching effects not just in learning about how industries will be affected in the long term, but in what students gain at a personal level. \u201cOne thing I like is drawing Georgia Tech students into a meaningful exercise that helps society. It\u2019s not just about data analysis but doing something purposeful and meaningful that will have an impact on society.\"\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nImpact of Covid-19 on Georgia\u2019s Economy website\nFinancial Services Innovation Lab\nContact\nLorrie Burroughs\nlorrie.burroughs@scheller.gatech.edu\nEmail\nlorrie.burroughs@scheller.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
