The campus community is invited to participate in a variety of events that increase awareness of and encourage actions that advance the\n17 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals\n(SDGs).\nThe SDGs were adopted by the UN General Assembly in 2015 as part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. They address the world\u2019s most monumental challenges, including poverty, inequality, climate change, environmental degradation, and peace and justice. Some of the objectives are improved industry, innovation, and infrastructure; affordable and clean energy; and sustainable cities and communities. The SDGs appear by name in the\nInstitute\u2019s strategic plan\nas long-term goals that should guide teaching, research, and operations.\nSDG Action and Awareness Week 2022 will begin with an interactive campus discussion, titled\nEngaging With the SDGs Across Campus , focusing on how the goals are being realized across the Institute and ways to better work together across disciplines and departments to amplify our impact. President \u00c1ngel Cabrera will moderate the discussion with participants from the College of Sciences, Serve-Learn-Sustain, Interdisciplinary Research, and Engineers Without Borders.\nOther events during the week include a Tech Dining Sustainability Showcase, a panel on Infrastructure and Sustainability, Changing Relationships: You and Your Aging Parents, Toilet Talk With Shan and Shannon, A Healthy Georgia: Exploring the Impact of the Energy Transition on Public Health, the Association for Sustainable Investment Podcast Club Kickoff, and Engaging With the SDGs to Advance Sustainability in Atlanta.\nView a full listing of the week\u2019s events .\nIn Fall 2020, a\npanel discussion and keynote address\nby Cabrera introduced the Tech community to the 17 goals. The event covered their relevance to the Institute and emphasized how Georgia Tech can lead the region in implementing and advancing these goals.\n\u201cIf we are committed to improving the human condition, then we should embrace the SDGs to guide our actions as a university,\u201d Cabrera said when introducing the SDGs.\nSDG Action and Awareness Week is part of a larger global effort through the University Global Coalition, whose partners are hosting a variety of\nonline events\nthat are open to all.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nVictor Rogers\nInstitute Communications\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
