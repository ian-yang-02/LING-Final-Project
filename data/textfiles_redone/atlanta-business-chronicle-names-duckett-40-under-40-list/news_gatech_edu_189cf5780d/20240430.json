The publication recognizes rising stars who are making a mark in their industries and leading in their communities.\n\u201cIt\u2019s incredibly humbling to be part of a group being honored for making a positive contribution to Atlanta early in their careers,\u201d Duckett said. \u201cI\u2019ve planted roots here, Atlanta is my home, and I always want to do my best for the city and its institutions.\u201d\nDuckett joined Georgia Tech in January .

As a longtime Atlanta resident, she has nearly 20 years of experience in HR roles in urban educational settings.\n\u201cIt is especially meaningful to receive this award during my first year at Georgia Tech.
