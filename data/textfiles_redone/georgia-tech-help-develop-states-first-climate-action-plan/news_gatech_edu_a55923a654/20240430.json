Now, the state Department of Natural Resources\u2019 Environmental Protection Division has tapped them to help develop the state\u2019s first climate action plan.\nThe plan will help the state compete for up to $500 million in federal funding for climate mitigation efforts under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.\u00a0Under a contract with the agency, the Georgia Tech team will work with partners across Georgia to help the state develop its greenhouse gas inventory, develop a plan to address the most important immediate opportunities the state can take to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions, and potentially help develop policies and programs to reach those goals.\n\u201cGeorgia Tech and our academic, business, and community partners from across the state are uniquely suited to help Georgia identify implementation-ready solutions that can significantly reduce emissions and have beneficial impacts on Georgia communities,\u201d said Marilyn A. Brown, Regents\u2019 Professor and Brook Byers Professor of Sustainable Systems in the\nSchool of Public Policy .\n\u201cAs part of our work with Drawdown Georgia, we already have been deeply involved in identifying climate pollution reduction strategies to drive economic and employment growth, improve air quality, deliver benefits to under-resourced residents, and protect the environment.\u00a0That work gives us a great head start in providing the state the information it needs to develop Georgia\u2019s first climate action plan,\u201d\nBrown\nsaid.\nGeorgia Tech-Built Emissions Tracker Key Component\nDrawdown Georgia\nis an initiative of the Ray C. Anderson Foundation to accelerate progress toward net zero greenhouse gas emissions in Georgia. Brown led the interdisciplinary science and policy team that\nhelped develop\nthe plan\u2019s recommendations.\nCentral to the project is the\nclimate emissions tracker\ndeveloped at Georgia Tech as part of that project. The tool provides monthly insights into carbon emissions across Georgia\u2019s 159 counties, providing more timely, accurate, and cost-effective data than the traditional tools used in other climate planning efforts.\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency reviewed the tracker and gave special permission for the state to use it, said William J. Drummond, associate professor in the\nSchool of City & Regional Planning\nand co-principal investigator on the project.\nMany other states will instead have to use more traditional bottom-up inventories that take longer to create and are not as frequently updated, he said.\n\u201cThe work we have done has been peer-reviewed and published, and so it has a level of authoritativeness that other states may not enjoy,\u201d said\nDrummond , who led the tracker\u2019s development. \u201cWe are uniquely positioned to identify actionable solutions for Georgia, help the state meet its incredibly tight timeline, and give Georgia a competitive advantage that other states just can\u2019t match.\u201d\nThe Atlanta Regional Commission, which received separate funding to make a plan specific to metro Atlanta, also will use the tracker in its work.\nState Plan Due in March\nThe state\u2019s priority plan is due in March, with the full plan due a year later.\n\u201cThe Georgia Environmental Protection Division is excited to work with Georgia Tech in the development of the state's first climate action plan and appreciates all the work that Georgia Tech and other Drawdown Georgia partners have done to lay the groundwork for this project,\u201d said DeAnna Oser, assistant branch chief of the Georgia Environmental Protection Division\u2019s Air Protection Branch.\nThe effort is focused on implementation-ready solutions. Brown said proposals could include projects that advance transportation electrification, energy-efficient housing, climate-smart agriculture, forest management, and urban tree canopies, among other opportunities.\nShe said it is exciting to see the years of work her team has put into climate mitigation practices and policies to help move Georgia closer to being climate-neutral.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve always hoped that this work would have real policy impacts that will help improve our environment, economy, and society,\u201d Brown said. \u201cIt\u2019s exhilarating to see the state recognize and incorporate our work, and I look forward to seeing where it leads.\u201d\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nGeorgia Tech Leads Team Effort to Reduce Georgia\u2019s Carbon Footprint\nNational Academy Publishes Study Showing How Georgia Could Halve its Carbon Foo\u2026\nGeorgia Emissions Declining, Georgia Tech-led Drawdown Georgia Research Team Sh\u2026\nContact\nMichael Pearson\nIvan Allen College of Liberal Arts\nEmail\nmichael.pearson@iac.gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
