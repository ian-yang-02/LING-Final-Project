HANDLD kicks into full gear if a vehicle comes within that three-foot zone.\n\u201cIf it gets triggered, the front-facing camera takes a series of pictures of the violator\u2019s license plate,\u201d explains HANDLD co-creator Erik Van Winkle. Through a smartphone app, users will be able to take video and photos as well as time-stamped and geotagged data, and report the violation to police.\nThe HANDLD team believes the data they collect could also be used to make more roads safer for cyclists.\u00a0\u201cWe can actually make a heat map of all the violations that happened on a street corner or a stoplight,\u201d says avid cyclist and Georgia Tech engineering student Colin Santoro.\nSantoro says that the HANDLD device could share data with city planners to determine where infrastructure could be updated to benefit bicyclists.\u00a0According to the League of American Cyclists, 42 of 50 states have adopted safe-passing laws.\nUntil now, according to HANDLD, many cyclists have tried to develop their own methods to stay safe while sharing the road.\u00a0They spoke with one woman who attached foam pool noodles to her bicycle to maintain a three-foot buffer between herself and traffic.\n\u201cWe want cyclists to take their safety into their own hands,\u201d Van Winkle says. And save the water flotation devices for the swimming pool.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nSteven Norris\nInstitute Communications\nEmail\nsnorris@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
