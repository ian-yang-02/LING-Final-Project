With the help of a classmate with a deft hand at photography, she took photos to replicate all of Swift\u2019s album covers.\n\u201cI knew what most of them looked like from memory,\u201d she explained.\nLeonard says she wanted to do something different and fun with her photos. She has also noticed how many people on campus have recognized her from the album cover remakes as they\u2019ve been shared around social media.\nAs for the album that she listens to most, she says it's Reputation. \u201cThe songs just make me feel tough, like I can do anything,\u201d she said.\nAnd the Taylor Swift track that encapsulates her time here at Tech is \u201cLong Live.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a song about remembering all the times you\u2019ve had with your friends, and how you made it through by leaning on each other.\u201d Leonard says that\u2019s her walk-out song. And after graduating she\u2019s boldly walking into a new role with Jones Carter, a civil engineering, planning, and surveying firm based in Texas.\nAdditional Images\nContact\nBrice Zimmerman\nInstitute Communications\nGeorgia Tech\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
