Your brain possesses what some researchers call \u201ccommon drive.\u201d It wants to activate and relax all muscles in synchrony, including the opposing ones. It\u2019s probably why you find yourself swaying while trying to balance on one leg. When you start to teeter, your mind drives all the muscles to stiffen at the same time. The problem: This drive contains muscle oscillations, which cause you to sway again and continue the process.\nAll muscles typically have slight oscillations at the same time \u2014 less than three per second or three Hz \u2014 when they\u2019re used. This is the common motor drive.\nThis common drive may also be a reason why stroke survivors have trouble keeping their hands from becoming rigid and shaking. Only when you control both sets of muscles individually, or overcome this common drive, the rigidity and wobbling may stop.\nGeorgia Institute of Technology researchers wanted to learn why some people are better than others at controlling joint stiffness by co-contracting opposing muscles to overcome this common drive. They also wanted to know if that skill could be taught. If so, it could lead to more effective rehabilitation exercises for stroke survivors or people with Parkinson\u2019s disease.\nIn a new study, the researchers set up an experiment for healthy young adults. They were tasked with flexing their bicep muscles and maintaining that activation at a designated level while also extending their triceps and keeping them steady at a different level. By wearing EMG sensors, the researchers were able to determine who was more effective in steady co-contraction.\n\u201cThe opposing muscles fought against each other to maintain different activation levels,\u201d said Minoru Shinohara, an associate professor in the\nSchool of Biological Sciences\nat Georgia Tech. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t easy. Some participants were actually sweating after just 30 seconds, struggling to keep both muscles activated and consistent at different levels.\u201d\nThe people who were worst at the experiment were unable to reduce the synchronized oscillations from both muscles. They rose and fell at the same time.\n\u201cIn contrast, better performers were able to dissociate the signal to both muscles and control them individually,\u201d said Shinohara. \u201cThey overcame the mind\u2019s willingness to send synchronized signals across muscles. They activated individually to better control both.\u201d\nThe next part of the experiment was to see if the healthy adults could train their muscles to more easily overcome the common drive. A third of the participants were trained for dissociated co-contraction \u2014 to flex and contract both muscles simultaneously but at different levels, back and forth, for an hour. Others worked on one muscle for a while, then switched to the other. The third group rested for 60 minutes.\nAfterward, everyone did the first test again. The improvement was the same across groups. Those who did nothing for an hour were just as successful (or not) as those who practiced, simply due to familiarization with the test.\n\u201cIf you practice anything specific for an hour, you\u2019re likely to see specific improvement,\u201d said Shinohara. \u201cBut there were no specific improvements with the dissociation practice. This means that the common drive is deeply embedded into the mind. It would take a long time for healthy adults to efficiently dissociate their muscles.\u201d\nAnd that may partially explain why stroke survivors are slow to see any improvement after extensive rehab.\n\u201cIf healthy adults have trouble controlling their muscles individually, we shouldn\u2019t be surprised that those who always struggle to control their muscles would have an even more difficult experience. An hour isn\u2019t enough, which isn\u2019t too surprising. But it\u2019s important that people don\u2019t give up if it takes a while to progress.\u201d\nThe paper, \u201cSlow intermuscular oscillations are associated with cocontraction steadiness,\u201d is currently published ahead of print in the journal\nMedicine & Science in Sports & Exercise .\nThe study is supported by the National Science Foundation (IIS-1317718).
