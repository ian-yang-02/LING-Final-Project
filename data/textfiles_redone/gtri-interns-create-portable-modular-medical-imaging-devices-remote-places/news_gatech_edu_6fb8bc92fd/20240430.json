But the idea is to design and print other modular components so the same basic structure could be assembled into a spectrometer, a chemical sensor, or anything else engineers could dream up.\n\u201cInstead of hauling in a microscope and a camera to see into your eye and a spectrometer to check your blood, maybe we could take the raw materials, which you can pack in a small box, and then build what you need as the need arises,\u201d said Jack Wood, who worked with the students and is a senior research scientist at the Georgia Tech Research Institute, or GTRI.\nWood said the students ran with a seed of an idea that has been floating around GTRI\u2019s\nElectro-Optical Systems Laboratory\n\u2014\u00a0as he put it: \u201cCan we quickly create biomedical optical systems to accomplish some important goals using limited infrastructure?\u201d\nAccording to Chloe Collins, a fourth-year biomedical engineering student from Bellevue, Washington: \u201cWe basically started from scratch. We didn\u2019t really have a basis or instructions for what to do like we would have in a class. But our mentor, Jack, was very good at giving us some fundamental ideas that we could work off of [and] teaching us about the optics that we needed to know.\u201d\nCollins worked on the project with computer science major Farouk Marhaba from Bridgewater, New Jersey; fellow biomedical engineering student Aaron Metyko from Galveston, Texas; and chemical and biomolecular engineering student Boluwaji Omodele from Buford, Georgia. They were part of a two-year-old internship program at GTRI that brings in undergraduates to get a taste of real-world, applied research.\nOther groups in the program worked on projects such as automatically classifying malware using neural networks or using LiDAR scans of water depths to create visualizations of the seabed. One team worked on a project developing an artificial \u201cpredator\u201d to help control invasive marine species, like lionfish in parts of the Atlantic Ocean.\n\u201cA big part of the internship program is giving students the opportunity to work on their own and figure things out as they go and also learning how research works,\u201d said Emily Farmer, a mechanical engineering student from Clarkesville, Georgia, who worked on a digital signal processing project. \u201cIt\u2019s not so much your typical internship where you go in and sit at a computer all day and do whatever they tell you to do. It\u2019s more so learning about how research works and figuring out how you can apply that to your academics.\u201d\nWood said his team did exactly that \u2014 exploring research, probing for answers and driving their ultimate design.\n\u201cI found myself having to apologize, because they're used to having a professor know what he's doing, knowing the end result, and then mentoring them through a process,\u201d he said. \u201cThis was something brand new for us, so in one sense, it was exciting \u2014 they got to explore and help define the path. By the same token, that path wandered a little bit.\u201d\nThe team Wood mentored ultimately followed the path to a simple microscope and retinal camera because that\u2019s where they identified needs they could meet.\n\u201cA big issue [for the military] is retinal detachment along with macular degeneration. The best way to find out about retinal detachment is to have a retinal camera, a fundus camera,\u201d Omodele said. \u201cWe also thought about things like malaria in developing countries and how could we pick out the malaria pathogens? The fastest way we can do that is with a microscope. So we thought, why not create a microscope and a fundus camera, because these two things pretty much have the same function.\u201d\nWood said the goal of the project was to develop a proof of concept that researchers at GTRI could further develop and then pursue outside funding. That could expand the potential applications of the device into other kinds of sensors \u2014 maybe to measure heart rate or oxygen levels in blood \u2014 or for non-medical uses built on the same infrastructure.\nThere also was a team working on complementary software to automate the design process for the imaging device. Users without technical backgrounds could enter the kinds of functions they need, and the software would design device components.\nAll of that will take more work, but Wood said he\u2019s optimistic about the foundation the students have created.\nFor the students, the experience proved eye-opening.\n\u201cDuring this job, I had to become an optical engineer,\u201d said Omodele, the fifth-year chemical engineering student, \u201cand one thing that Georgia Tech has taught me is being able to morph myself into whatever kind of engineer I need [to be].\u201d\nAdditional Images\nRelated links\nGTRI Electro-Optical Systems Laboratory\nContact\nJoshua Stewart\n404.894.6016\nEmail\njstewart@gatech.edu\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nNorth Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332\n+1 404.894.2000\nCampus Map\nGeneral\nDirectory\nEmployment\nEmergency Information\nLegal\nEqual Opportunity, Nondiscrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy\nLegal & Privacy Information\nHuman Trafficking Notice\nTitle IX/Sexual Misconduct\nHazing Public Disclosures\nAccessibility\nAccountability\nAccreditation\nReport Free Speech and Censorship Concern\n\u00a9 2024 Georgia Institute of\nTechnology\nGT LOGIN\nResources\nGeorgia Tech Resources\nOffices and Departments\nNews Center\nCampus Calendar\nSpecial Events\nGreenBuzz\nInstitute Communications\nVisitor Resources\nCampus Visits\nDirections to Campus\nVisitor Parking Information\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\nFerst Center for the Arts\nRobert C.
