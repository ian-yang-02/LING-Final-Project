 - atlanta, ga 
 katrina remains one of the deadliest and costliest hurricanes in u.s. history, with more than 1,800 lives lost and damages estimated at over $100 billion. when the levees failed, about 80 percent of new orleans flooded. more than 1 million people across the gulf coast were forced to leave their homes - many never returned. in the years since, the region has served as a laboratory for researchers from the georgia institute of technology who have traveled to new orleans and other locations to study the effects of the disaster. their work has helped determine what went wrong; how best to rebuild the region; and how to help the nation prepare for future calamities. read the full story:

100-campus-leaders-currently-engaged-2021-inclusive-leaders-academy-program.txt,"100 campus leaders currently engaged in 2021 inclusive leaders academy program 
 the latest class of campus leaders began matriculation in the 2021 inclusive leaders academy program at georgia tech on february 5. 
 the 2021 inclusive leaders academy cohort 
 apr 12, 2021 
 - atlanta, ga 
 the latest class of campus leaders began matriculation in the 2021 inclusive leaders academy program at georgia tech on february 5. the participants represent the fifth cohort of the program and include more than 100 managers, directors, executives, senior researchers, and faculty administrators from across the institute. 
 the inclusive leaders academy is designed to support managers and leaders in developing and honing global competencies and to positively shape tech's culture towards inclusive excellence. key learning benefits of the program and core curriculum topic areas facilitate social intelligence, self-awareness, resilience, and courage as leadership attributes. the curriculum provides an individualized path of self-guided learning as well as integration and practice techniques through virtual wisdom labs and dialogues. 
 this year's program will span 12 weeks. participants who complete the program will gain the equivalent of 18 hours of learning and practice and will receive a ""culture champions"" certificate. since the academy's initiative, more than 300 have completed the program. 
 the program was launched in 2017 by 
 institute diversity, equity, and 
 inclusion 's staff diversity, inclusion and engagement unit. pearl alexander, executive director of diversity, inclusion, and engagement and inclusive leaders academy director said, ""the initiative was responsive to the need to cultivate skills to foster inclusivity and to meet the increasing desires for meaningful professional development. the inclusive leaders academy offers practical guides and tools that help us ‘thrive on diversity,' act ethically, nurture the wellbeing of our community, and more. 
 curriculum content has been curated from the neuroleadership institute and  dare to lead,  the most recent book authored by and based on the research of brené brown. ""content is also inclusive of other research-based leadership practices that will support the institute's aspirational goals and ensure that we deliver on the mission of progress and service outlined in our 2030 strategic plan,"" alexander added. 
 one of the first instructor-led courses for the cohort was stories we live. participants learned how stories shape individual identity and improve social intelligence and relational abilities. 
 during the two-hour course, the cohort worked with georgia tech story coaches -- including alexander; emma blandford, assistant director for living learning communities for the college of sciences; lindsey laney, academic program manager for georgia tech professional education; kathleen schaag, brittan fellow with the school of literature, media, and communication (lmc); stephanie ray, associate dean of students and director of diversity programs for the division of student life; and wendy truran, visiting lecturer with the school of lmc  -- who advised participants on how to excavate thought details and boost expression and creativity. some stories may emerge for publication in institute diversity, equity, and inclusion's growing digital story library, the 
 transformative narratives . 
 the cohort have also completed the neuroleadership institute's neuroscience of smart teams (include) and neuroscience of breaking bias (decide) modules. participants completed self-guided learning exercises and weekly reflections on the practices of creating inclusive team cultures and recognizing biases. later into the program, neuroleadership's jeff salters and ric oslin facilitated the cohort through 60-minute interactive webinars to hone the module teachings. 
 ""at this point in the program participants should have a good sense of how to identify and mitigate their unconscious biases, the power of vulnerability, and stories to create connected, collaborative, and engaging work environments,"" alexander said. ""additional sessions to come include instruction on antiracism empathy, creating a calling-in culture, and resilience. the session on resilience will be facilitated by joi alexander, director of health initiatives, and sonia alvarez-robinson, executive director of georgia tech strategic consulting. 
 after completing all of the basic certificate requirements, participants will be celebrated during a closing program in may. they will also be eligible for diversity, equity, and inclusion leadership and career coaching as part of a growing community of practice. 
 ""through this award-winning initiative, we believe that georgia tech is leading by example,"" alexander added. ""we are already developing staff and faculty leaders at all levels who are inclusive, accountable, and determined to be exceptional champions of a culture where all contributors can thrive. the challenge ahead is to scale this and similar opportunities to more leaders at tech, higher education, and the world."" 
 the 2021 inclusive leaders academy participants are: rashidah bahar-graham, lula baker, kathryn ballou, susan belmonte, kelley bennett, ashton bettis, james black, scott bleiweis, ilana blumenfeld-gantz, neil bright, l. renee brown, pam buffington, michele burts, karen cannon, mayumi cole, mysty connelly, malvenia dasher, jessica tyler davis, aiesha dawda, harry dewhurst, debbie dorsey, jim fortner, dana foster, kelly fox, melissa fralick, andy frazee, ivy gardner, evan goldberg, tigiste habtemariam, robert hampson, casey hampton, jimmie hardin, kayli harlan, kim harrington, kasey helton, bryony higgins, courtney hill, brittany hodges, nasrin hooshmand, jessica howard, daren hubbard, gail imoukhuede, mitsuko ito, kristy jennings, monique johnson, amy johnson, shiraz karaa, april kelly, bridgett kemp, kathleen kirk, anita lamb, season lewis, nicole little, chantal manchester, rachel matthews, keith mcbride, leigh mccook, tammy mccoy, cassy mcinnis, janise mckenzie, melanie megenity, derrick morse, allison noffsinger, lorie paulez, rachael pocklington, elisha quillen smith, kerry-gaye rainford-creary, victoria razin, tangirala reddy, elizabeth reese, franz reneau, kelci reyes-brannon, jon riling, yelena rivera, arianna robinson, will roddy, kyla ross, tina rousselot de saint ceran, elizabeth ryan, lakeita servance, mike shannon, keisha simmons, andy smith, vincent sollicito, quinn spadola, tanesha steward, yevgenya (jenny) strakovsky, diana sutton-fernandez, janaki tambe, denise thomas, john thornton, duc (david) tran, troy walcott, kerry wallaert, jeff white, mark whorton, kristen wingate, shaunitra wisdom, leyu wondwossen. natalie wood, nazia zakir, nuyun zhang, and tony zivalich.

 during the weekend commemorating the life and inspiration of dr. martin luther king jr., 76 students and 24 faculty and staff from georgia tech traveled to washington, d.c., to tour several civil rights sites. this tour is part of the institute's mlk celebration, an ambitious slate of educational programs, arts and cultural performances, and service opportunities to encourage active participation from the campus and atlanta community. 
 students, faculty, and staff departed in charter buses on the night of january 12 to visit museums and memorials over the next two days, including the national museum of african american history and culture, the king memorial, national mall, national museum of the american indian, and the united states holocaust memorial museum. 
 associate dean of students and director of student diversity programs stephanie ray reflected on why georgia tech's mlk student board organized the civil rights tour in d.c.: ""we followed the life of dr. king. after leading civil rights trips in montgomery, ala. in 2012 and birmingham, ala. in 2013, the next goal was to end our tour by visiting the king memorial and national museum of african american history and culture in our nation's capital."" 
 here is what student participants said about their experiences during the civil rights tour: 
 why did you want to go on this trip? 
 ""i wanted to experience the history and culture of africans before being brought to america. i also wanted to learn more about the native american culture beyond what is presented in history books."" 
 - 
 alexander pegues, undergraduate student in the george w. woodruff school of mechanical engineering 
 what was your favorite part of this trip? 
 ""the national museum of african american history and culture, hands down. from the photos to the interactive learning, it was beautifully designed and presented. the experience was more than you could imagine.""

13-year-old-starts-first-day-georgia-tech-aerospace-engineering-student.txt,"13-year-old starts first day at georgia tech as aerospace engineering student 
 caleb anderson realizes his dream of being a student at georgia tech at just 13 years old. 
 aug 24, 2021 
 - atlanta, ga 
 caleb anderson stunned the world when his family shared a now viral story highlighting just how gifted he was - reading the u.s. constitution at the age of 2 and starting high school at just 10. 
 his brilliance caught the attention of admissions offices at colleges around the country. when asked about his future, he was clear that his dream school was georgia tech where he'd hope to major in  aerospace engineering . anderson was accepted to georgia tech in spring 2021. 
 a dream realized, on monday, he was among the thousands of students welcomed to georgia tech's campus for the first day of fall classes. while most 13 year olds are starting middle school, anderson started his first day as a sophomore with an integral calculus class. 
 when asked about his first day, anderson said, ""it was pretty interesting."" he also admitted that he'd underestimated how large the campus is, calling it ""massive."" despite the size, he says he did feel at home on campus. he shared that as the day of classes went on, his nerves subsided, and he was excited to be starting this journey. ""this is the kind of school i have been wanting to go to for a very long time, and i am finally here,"" he added. 
 his parents, kobi and claire anderson, were right by his side for his first day. he jokingly referred to his dad as his ""chauffeur."" the andersons beamed with pride about the experience but also expressed that it was unnerving. ""have we prepared him enough?"" his mother questioned. ""have we taught him enough about failure?"" 
 but his father says, ""he's willing to be stretched. he knows how to get back from a punch … and continues to strive."" 
 anderson is the youngest student on georgia tech's campus, and he doesn't take that for granted. as a young african american boy, he understands the magnitude of being a positive and inspirational influence in his community. his mom hopes that by continuing to share his story that their family can help to ""shift the perspective of what you see when you see a young black man. this could be a future aerospace engineer."" 
 despite garnering the world's attention for being a genius, anderson continues to lead with humility. he revealed it wasn't until he was sitting in his second lecture class of the day that he thought to himself, ""wow, maybe i  am  advanced."" 
 when he's not studying to be an engineer, he's a normal teen that likes to sleep in - and, admittedly, procrastinates. he also says that some people believe that things come easily to him, but that is not the case. 
 ""i am really proud of him, but i am really grateful to georgia tech for opening a door of opportunity to a student like caleb,"" said his mom. 
 while on campus, anderson is hoping to join clubs like the  ramblin' rocket club . his long-term goals include earning a master's degree from georgia tech, pursuing a career at spacex, and starting his own company. his top goal is to pay it forward, saying, ""i want to help others that may just need nurturing and resources.""

18-million-face-shields-delivered-protect-medical-workers-covid-19.txt,"1.8 million face shields delivered to protect medical workers from covid-19 
 an initiative launched by georgia tech and supported by a community of companies has helped produce nearly 2 million face shields. 
 robin mauldin, rn, bsn, wears a face shield at prisma health medical group in columbia, south carolina. the shield was produced through a manufacturing effort launched by georgia tech and supported by a group of industrial collaborators. (prisma health midlands foundation) 
 jul 27, 2020 
 - atlanta, ga 
 personal initiatives by a pediatrician and by researchers to make face shields for medical workers have transformed into an industry collaboration that by june had delivered 1.8 million shields to hospitals and other organizations around the country with plans to produce 2.5 million all total. a $2 million donation from aflac incorporated for personal protective equipment (ppe) financed the bulk of the shields. 
 to make it happen, a team of researchers and industry partners convened at the 
 global center for medical innovation 
 (gcmi), a georgia tech-affiliated nonprofit that guides new experimental medical solutions to market. the group combined the physician's vision with the researchers' original designs, adjusted them to pass fda emergency guidelines, and then coordinated mass production and distribution. 
 a physician's wisdom 
 the project grew wings in mid-march, after dr. joanna newton became concerned that the nationwide shortage of ppe was leaving healthcare workers across the country vulnerable. newton is a physician specializing in improving healthcare safety through technology at 
 children's healthcare of atlanta , and she was already collaborating with georgia tech on other projects. 
 she grabbed the phone to leverage the connection. 
 ""i called sherry farrugia to tell her about my idea to 3d-print ppe. we needed to quickly find a solution for the ppe shortage around the country, and i knew we had the right team here in atlanta to help,"" said newton, a pediatric hematologist / oncologist at the aflac cancer and blood disorders center of children's. 
 ""the situation was urgent, and i knew who would have the right expertise to get this done,"" said farrugia, chief operating officer and strategy officer of 
 children's healthcare of atlanta pediatric technology center , which is part of georgia tech. 
 farrugia had newton present her idea at gcmi to researchers, advisors, and industry partners who immediately put together a team to address the need for face shields to protect healthcare workers from droplets containing the coronavirus. she also discussed the need with 
 devesh ranjan , associate chair of the 
 george w. woodruff school of mechanical engineering , who suggested connecting the effort to a parallel initiative in that school. 
 bringing in engineers 
 at the same time, along with ranjan,  sam graham , chair of the 
 george w. woodruff school of mechanical engineering , and 
 susan margulies , chair of the 
 wallace h. coulter department of biomedical engineering , were coordinating efforts across campus to develop various medical devices in response to the pandemic. graham, margulies, and ranjan quickly connected gcmi with 
 christopher saldana 
 and 
 saad bhamla , faculty members in georgia tech's college of engineering, who were leading an simultaneous effort to address the face shield problem with their students using rapid fabrication techniques like 3-d printing, laser cutting, and waterjet cutting. 
 ""the georgia tech mechanical engineering team used rapid fabrication equipment and quickly produced multiple face shield designs that could be manufactured in high volumes for the rapid response environment that covid-19 required,"" saldana said. 
 making a few thousand shields in a lab had likely already saved lives, but the georgia tech researchers and gcmi put their designs on the internet, where they have been downloaded thousands of times by organizations manufacturing them around the world. and the manufacturing partners they engaged have been turning out hundreds of thousands of shields to save many more lives. 
 ""you may need 45 minutes for a headband with a 3d printer, but manufacturers turn out six of them every 19 seconds. then making a million face shields becomes a real possibility,"" said mike fisher, who leads product development at gcmi. 
 gcmi opened a gofundme page, which brought in $20,000, and then engaged their first manufacturing partner, delta air lines. 
 a manufacturing explosion 
 ""delta converted one of their groups from manufacturing airplane interiors to doing the face shields. they started off by manufacturing 6,000 shields, and that got the momentum going,"" leiter said. ""two thousand shields went to mount sinai hospital in new york; 2,000 went to piedmont healthcare in atlanta; and 2,000 went to children's healthcare of atlanta."" 
 things began to snowball. 
 graham engaged siemens industries to fulfill a face shield order from the georgia emergency management agency (gema) for distribution in georgia. partners from exxonmobil began looking for more potential manufacturers. and aflac contacted children's looking for worthy covid-19 related efforts to support. 
 ""we asked for a donation of $500,000 for manufacturers to retool their operations. aflac made a gift of $2 million to gcmi to promote the production of ppe,"" farrugia said. ""we were able to buy tooling for an automotive plastics manufacturer called quality model in south carolina, and they have made over 750,000 face shields so far."" 
 gcmi won a bid from the federal emergency management agency (fema) for 1,141,600 face shields, which are being made by quality model, where exxonmobil helped rearrange production lines for shields. 
 siemens made an additional 100,000 shields from aflac's gift, which is also being used to purchase existing ppe to donate to healthcare workers. kia motors quickly produced an initial 15,000 shields, which the company financed itself. 
 ""kia got the open source design from the georgia tech website and ran with it on their own,"" saldana said. 
 these partners are delivering the following number of shields: quality model, 1,251,600; kia motors, 300,000; siemens industries, 205,000; delta air lines, 106,100; georgia tech, 20,000; and eis, 15,000. and more are still to come. 
 the shields went across the country, from hospitals in new york city to prisma health in south carolina, to nursing homes in the pensacola area, and to rural louisiana and mississippi, leiter said.

 a new $21.9 million research initiative will modulate gene expression to help protect against pandemic flu.

 a multifaceted research effort aimed at temporarily modulating gene expression using rna-based techniques could help protect against pandemic flu by boosting lung resistance to infection, attacking the influenza virus directly, enhancing immune system response and improving the effects of existing vaccines. 
 drugs developed through the up to $21.9 million effort, which is funded by the defense advanced research projects agency (darpa), would provide rapid response against a broad range of flu variants - and could potentially be used against other viruses in the future. the rna-based drugs could be delivered to the lungs through a nebulizer or inhaler, which are well-established techniques. 
 led by researchers at the georgia institute of technology, the planned four-year initiative includes scientists from duke university, emory university, the university of georgia, the university of louisiana, rockefeller university and acorda therapeutics. the centers for disease control and prevention will also partner with the team and will be funded separately by darpa. the funding was announced june 27 as part of darpa's 
 prepare 
 (preemptive expression of protective alleles and response elements) initiative. 
 ""viruses are very good at adapting, but they are not very good at adapting when we can use orthogonal methods of fighting them,"" said 
 philip santangelo , a professor in the 
 wallace h. coulter department of biomedical engineering at georgia tech and emory university . ""if we can make this simple and easy for people to use, we will have the ability to fight the virus in multiple ways."" 
 key to the project is modulating gene response - up-regulating or down-regulating certain gene expression - but not permanently affecting dna. ""we need for what we do to be transient,"" santangelo said. ""the immediate threat from a flu pandemic won't last that long, so we may need the rna effects to last for a couple of weeks to months."" 
 the first line of defense would be equipping the lungs to better resist infection by the influenza virus. that strategy will involve first identifying genetic targets that could help ward off the virus by making the lungs very resistant to infection. researchers will then develop drugs to bring about those changes. 
 ""our major goal is to identify host genes that, when either suppressed or activated, make cells refractory to influenza virus infection,"" said nicholas heaton, assistant professor in the department of molecular genetics and microbiology at duke university medical center. ""we will perform a series of genetic screens to identify these host factors, and then also perform a series of target validation studies both 
 in-vitro 
 and 
 in-vivo ."" 
 no drug works perfectly, however, so some people treated to boost resistance to the virus will be infected anyway. but that would open the door to another component of the strategy: drugs that destroy virus rna. 
 ""we have already shown that we can chew up viral rna, and in this project we will demonstrate that first in small animal models,"" said santangelo. 
 other strategies will be designed to boost the body's immune system, modifying the neutrophils that respond to influenza to help them more effectively and more rapidly clear infection from the lungs. 
 ""neutrophils are the first white blood cells coming into the lung, within minutes of an encounter with the virus,"" said rabindra tirouvanziam, associate professor in the emory university school of medicine. ""because neutrophils are fast acting, their ability to change rna expression to adapt to particular conditions was thought to be limited. however, we discovered that neutrophils change their rna very rapidly after coming into the lung, which opens a critical avenue for rna-based modulation at the very beginning of inflammation, in order to minimize damaging side effects and maximize protection."" 
 finally, the initiative will attempt to take advantage of influenza vaccines that most people have received during their lifetimes. flu vaccines made available each year differ according to the expected flu variants, and their effectiveness is rarely more than about 45 percent. 
 ""for people who have been vaccinated against flu, we want to strengthen the vaccine to boost the effectiveness of b cells and t cells,"" santangelo said. 
 the research team will develop gene modulation tools that would alter expression in the lungs using rna-based modulators. the task will involve identifying potential targets, verifying them, and developing drugs that can induce temporary changes. the goal is to have drugs ready for clinical trials by the end of the four-year period. 
 ""this is incredibly ambitious,"" santangelo said. ""this work should open a lot of doors for completely new classes of drugs. conceptually, the ability to temporarily modulate genes to make people more resistant to a pathogen is incredibly exciting."" 
 ultimately, the work will open up new means for protecting humans against the effects of viruses. 
 ""vaccines have a well-established protective capacity against seasonal flu, but they take time to act and become obsolete because of continuous evolution of the flu virus,"" tirouvanziam noted. ""this project proposes to enact rapid modulation of host responses to the flu virus by manipulating rna in cells. rna is the transient template that cells use to make proteins, and rapid rna regulation therefore has the potential to impact acute symptoms and transmission in settings of a flu epidemic with aggressive strains where vaccines would be largely ineffective."" 
 in addition to those already named, the research team will include: james dahlman, gabe kwong and krish roy at the georgia institute of technology; rafi ahmed, richard compans, jacob kohlmeier, sanjeev gumber and eliver ghosn at emory university; ian york from the centers for disease control and prevention; jessica kissinger and mustafa nural at the university of georgia; charles gersbach, gregory crawford, timothy reddy and xiling shen at duke university; francois villinger at the university of louisiana at lafayette; jeffrey ravetch from rockefeller university; and michael tauber at acorda therapeutics.

 a new consortium has been awarded $25 million to develop new technologies and educational program to support nuclear nonproliferation.

 - atlanta, ga 
 a consortium of 12 universities and 10 national laboratories led by the georgia institute of technology has been awarded $25 million from the u.s. department of energy's 
 national nuclear security administration 
 (nnsa) to develop new technologies and educational programs to support the agency's nuclear science, security and nonproliferation goals. 
 the award will provide $5 million per year across a five-year period to link basic research at universities with the capabilities of national laboratories through the consortium for enabling technologies and innovation (eti). the effort will focus on three core disciplines: computer and engineering science research through machine learning and high performance computing, advanced manufacturing and nuclear detection technologies. 
 ""we will be developing new enabling technologies to address not only the current challenges, but also those we might anticipate in the future,"" said 
 anna erickson , the consortium's principal investigator and an associate professor in georgia tech's 
 woodruff school of mechanical engineering . ""beyond these technologies, we will create the next cohort of students and researchers able to join the national laboratories to implement cutting-edge technologies to help the nnsa achieve its goals."" 
 among the potential research topics are understanding how advanced manufacturing might produce nuclear reactor components and fuel assemblies, machine learning to predict and uncover new phenomena affecting proliferation, and novel instrumentation to leverage cutting-edge capabilities in microelectronics, solid state technologies and other areas to detect radioactive materials. 
 ""machine learning and additive manufacturing are being actively used and pursued by leading private organizations, but they are not well utilized in our field today,"" she explained. ""we need to get away from conventional thinking and cultivate new technologies that take advantage of developments outside traditional nuclear engineering."" 
 the nnsa and the national laboratories are responsible for the nation's nuclear stockpile, and also for preventing the spread of nuclear weapons and materials worldwide. that challenge is growing as new technologies - including additive manufacturing, also known as 3d printing - makes possible manufacturing that in the past could only be done in a limited number of facilities. 
 ""we need to look at securing the technologies of the future,"" erickson said. 
 the technologies of the future will require people to use them. the eti consortium will be developing new coursework and pathways to national laboratory internships designed to attract the best students and give them a broad education that goes beyond traditional nuclear engineering. the courses will be taught by the participating universities, and potentially also through online platforms. 
 ""we want to educate students who have a good understanding of new technologies in general,"" erickson said. ""we will encourage them to challenge the world and see the world differently. over the next five years, our goals are to create something that will have a lasting effect on this industry."" 
 the consortium's education goal is to transfer more than 40 graduate students and 20 undergraduate students to the national laboratories over the next five years. as part of that strategy, it will provide approximately 70 internships, and establish eight faculty-student laboratory visit fellowships. 
 consistent with the vision of broadening the technology base, only a quarter of the faculty involved in the eti consortium will be traditional nuclear engineers. ""people will come from all kinds of disciplines, from materials science to chemistry, advanced manufacturing and computer science. we are taking people with very diverse backgrounds and asking them to work together to create a new vision."" 
 in addition to georgia tech, the consortium will include the university of wisconsin and the ohio state university as leads of thrust areas, as well as the massachusetts institute of technology, university of michigan, university of hawaii, colorado school of mines, texas a&m university, university of north carolina at chapel hill, washington state university, duke university and university of texas at austin. 
 the national laboratory partners will include brookhaven national laboratory, los alamos national laboratory, lawrence livermore national laboratory, lawrence berkeley national laboratory, idaho national laboratory, oak ridge national laboratory, princeton plasma physics laboratory, sandia national laboratory, argonne national laboratory and pacific northwest national laboratory. 
 ""these grants will foster development of concepts and technologies that keep the united states at the forefront of nuclear monitoring and verification capabilities and allow us to nurture tomorrow's nonproliferation experts,"" said brent k. park, nnsa's deputy administrator for defense nuclear nonproliferation. 
 at georgia tech, the effort will also include steven biegalski, professor in the woodruff school of mechanical engineering and chair of the nuclear and radiological engineering and medical physics program; tim lieuwen, executive director of the strategic energy institute and a professor in the school of aerospace engineering; amit jariwala, senior academic professional in the school of mechanical engineering; bernard kippelen, the joseph m. pettit professor and director of the center for organic photonics and electronics, and chris summers, professor emeritus and director of the phosphor technology center of excellence. 
 success with the five-year eti consortium could help change the way students see the field of nuclear engineering and how the u.s. population views nuclear power and other components of the industry. 
 ""we want people to think about nuclear engineering in a different light,"" said erickson. ""nuclear engineering has been very specific to a narrow discipline, but we are trying to show the community that we are much more. we want to create the next-generation thinker, and there is nothing traditional about this effort."" 
 the nnsa also announced the consortium for monitoring, technology & verification, a partnership of 14 universities led by the university of michigan that is also funded for $25 million over five years. that organization seeks to improve u.s. capabilities to monitor the nuclear fuel cycle. ""its nonproliferation focus will be nuclear and particle physics, signals and source terms, and the physics of monitoring nuclear materials,"" the nnsa announcement said.

25-million-project-will-advance-dna-based-archival-data-storage.txt,"$25 million project will advance dna-based archival data storage 
 a new research initiative is using dna as an efficient and robust archival storage medium.

(credit: branden camp, georgia tech) 
 jan 16, 2020 
 - atlanta, ga 
 the demand for archival data storage has been skyrocketing, and if a new research initiative reaches its goals, that need could be met by taking advantage of an efficient and robust information storage medium that has proven itself through the centuries: the biopolymer dna. 
 the intelligence advanced research projects activity's (iarpa) molecular information storage (mist) program has awarded a multi-phase contract worth up to $25 million to develop scalable dna-based molecular storage techniques. the goal of the project, which will be led by the 
 georgia tech research institute 
 (gtri), is to use dna as the basis for deployable storage technologies that can eventually scale into the exabyte regime and beyond with reduced physical footprint, power and cost requirements relative to conventional storage technologies. 
 the technology already exists for storing and reading information into dna - which also encodes the genetic blueprint for living organisms - but significant advances will be needed to make it commercially practical and cost competitive with established magnetic tape and optical disk memory. while current archival storage has a limited lifetime, information stored in dna could last for hundreds of years. 
 ""the goal is to significantly reduce the size, weight and power required for archival data storage,"" said alexa harter, director of gtri's cybersecurity, information protection, and hardware evaluation research (cipher) laboratory. ""what would take acres in a data farm today could be kept in a device the size of the tabletop. we want to significantly improve all kinds of metrics for long-term data storage."" 
 the scalable molecular archival software and hardware (smash) project resulted from a proposal prepared by gtri, san francisco-based twist bioscience, san diego-based roswell biotechnologies, and the university of washington in collaboration with microsoft. 
 in the project plans, twist will engineer a dna synthesis platform on silicon that ""writes"" the dna strands that carry the data. roswell will provide dna sequencing, or ""reading"" technology, and the university of washington - in collaboration with microsoft - will bring system architecture, data analysis and coding expertise to the project. at georgia tech, the project will involve fabrication facilities at the institute for electronics and nanotechnology and researchers in such specialties as chemistry and information theory, who will also draw from four of gtri's eight laboratories. 
 ""the reason people are looking at dna for storage is that it has evolved over the ages as a very compact and reliable means of information storage,"" said nicholas guise, a gtri senior research scientist. ""it's so compact that a practical dna archive could store an exabyte of data-equivalent to a million terabyte hard drives-in a volume about the size of a sugar cube. scientists have been able to read dna from animals that died centuries ago, so the data lasts essentially forever under the right conditions."" 
 technology for encoding and decoding dna works at small scales today, but to be useful for commercial archival purposes, researchers will have to scale up the production of synthetic dna, reliably connect it to established computing systems and improve the speed of the data writing and reading process. the project goal would be to encode and decode terabytes of data in a day at costs and rates more than 100 times better than current technologies. 
 dna data storage won't initially replace server farms for information that must be accessed quickly and often. because of the time required for reading and decoding, the technique would be useful for information that must be kept indefinitely, but accessed infrequently. 
 part of the technical challenge is interfacing the dna with standard cmos electronic technologies. the researchers plan to build hybrid chips in which the dna grows above layers containing the electronics. the overall project will leverage the efficiencies of current semiconductor technologies, said brooke beckert, a gtri research engineer. 
 ""we'll be working with commercial foundries, so when we get the processing right, it should be much easier to transition the technology over to them,"" she said. ""connecting to the existing technology infrastructure is a critical part of this project, but we'll have to custom-make most of the components in the first stage."" 
 among the challenges will be managing the tradeoffs between speed and error, said guise. ""the issue is how far down we can scale this without introducing too many errors,"" he said. ""the basic synthesis is proven at a scale of hundreds of microns. we want to shrink that by a factor of 100, which leads us to worry about such issues as crosstalk between different dna strands in adjacent locations on the chips."" 
 current technology uses modified inkjet printing to produce the dna strands, but the smash project plans to grow the biopolymer more rapidly and in larger quantities using parallelized synthesis on the hybrid chips. 
 to achieve the major advances in reading cost and speed required, the program will rely on the molecular electronic dna reader chips under development at roswell. the data will be read from dna strands using a molecular electronic sensor array chip, on which single molecules are drawn through nanoscale current meters that measure electrical signatures of each letter in the sequence.  for biomedical applications, the sequencing industry has been focused on a goal of achieving a $1,000 human genome. the dna reading goals of this program amount to delivering a $10 genome, and that will require a major technology disruption. 
 the researchers acknowledge the challenges ahead in bringing their devices to commercial scale. 
 ""we don't see any killers ahead for this technology,"" said adam meier, a gtri senior research scientist. ""there is a lot of emerging technology and doing this commercially will require many orders of magnitude improvement. magnetic tape for archival storage has been improving steadily for 60 years, and this investment from iarpa will power the advancements needed to make dna storage competitive with that.""

 joycelyn wilson, assistant professor in the school of literature, media, and communication, says the release of 'freaknik: the wildest party never told' continues to raise the profile of atlanta's role in hip-hop overall, not just in the south. 
 mar 20, 2024 
 what started as a picnic for 
 b lack college students in 
 1983 
 turned into a national - even international - party that filled the parks and streets of atlanta. it turned into 
 freaknik , and 
 it's 
 now the subject of a hulu documentary. 
 joycelyn wilson , assistant professor in the school of literature, media, and communication, says the release of 
 freaknik : the wildest party never told 
 continues to raise the profile of atlanta's role in hip-hop overall, not just in the south. 
 ""it was 
 b lack college weekend, and it attracted folks from all over. it grew into a big weekend for 
 b lack youth and 
 artists 
 to come together and enjoy the weekend and each other,"" she said. 
 wilson, who grew up in 
 atlanta 
 and 
 is 
 a black 
 media 
 studies and hip-hop scholar, has been familiar with 
 f reaknik 
 since she was in middle school 
 - although, the first time she was there, she 
 d idn't 
 even realize it . 
 ""i was with my cousin, and he told me to sit in the car while he talked to his friends,"" she said. 
 the documentary , produced by lu ther 
 campbell, jermaine dupri, 
 and 21 savage,  highlights 
 freaknik 
 in 1994, which wilson says was a 
 pivotal 
 year for hip-hop. it brought the release of 
 outkast's 
 debut album, 
 southernplayalisticadillacmuzik , 
 along with albums from 
 nas 
 and biggie smalls. 
 "" freaknik 
 was a platform for them to perform and really expanded how hip-hop came together,"" wilson said. 
 as 
 freaknik 
 grew, so did its problems. amid 
 reported 
 sexual assault s , traffic, and safety concerns, atlanta police 
 attempted 
 to shut it down in 1999. wilson covered the decline of 
 freaknik 
 as a journalist for 
 rap pages 
 at the time with her article, 
 "" they don't freak no mo ' . "" 
 ""visitors were welcomed 
 only 
 to 
 the sweet auburn fest, while downtown was filled with nothing more than ghosts of 
 freakniks 
 past,"" she wrote 
 in the august 1999 issue . 
 still, the essence of the original 
 freaknik 
 fellowship lives on elsewhere in 
 black 
 culture , 
 at hbcu events such as homecoming and music festivals. wilson 
 recalled 
 the one music festival in 
 atlanta's 
 piedmont park last year, where , 
 as kendrick lamar performed, 
 she felt a similar feeling 
 to wh at 
 freak nik 
 once evoked. 
 others have 
 attempted 
 to revive the event in the past. 
 whether the documentary's release could spur a nother attempt 
 remains 
 to be see n - but, as wilson said, ""i t could get a remix .""

 researchers have demonstrated a new process for rapidly fabricating complex three-dimensional nanostructures from a variety of materials, including metals. the new technique uses nanoelectrospray to provide a continuous supply of liquid precursor, which can include metal ions that are converted to high-purity metal by a focused electron beam. the new process generates structures that would be impossible to make using gas-phase focused electron beam-induced deposition (febid) techniques, and allows fabrication at rates up to five orders of magnitude faster than the gas-phase technique. and because it uses standard liquid solvents, the new process could take advantage of a broad range of precursor materials. multiple materials can also be deposited simultaneously. ""by allowing us to grow structures much faster with a broad range of precursors, this technique really opens up a whole new direction for making a hierarchy of complex three-dimensional structures with nanoscale resolution at the rate that is demanded for manufacturing scalability,"" said 
 andrei fedorov , a professor in the

 nano letters . applications for the rapid electron beam writing of topologically complex 3d nanostructures could include new types of electrode topologies for batteries and fuel cells, vertically-stacked electronic memory, substrates for controlling cell differentiation and tiny electrochemical conversion devices. in the established febid process, an electron beam is used to write structures from molecules adsorbed onto a solid surface that provides support and nucleation sites for deposit growth. the precursors are introduced into the high-vacuum electron microscope chamber in gas phase. high-energy electrons in the beam interact with the substrate to produce the low-energy secondary electrons, which dissociate the adsorbed precursor molecules, resulting in deposition of solid material onto the substrate surface. though it enables precise atom-by-atom fabrication of nanostructures, the process is very slow because the low density of adsorbed gas molecules in the vacuum environment limits the amount of material available for fabrication. and structures must be fabricated from the substrate surface up at continually decreasing growth rate and from a limited number of precursor gases available. fedorov and his collaborators have dramatically accelerated the process by introducing electrically-charged liquid-phase precursors directly into high vacuum of the electron microscope chamber. liquid-phase precursors had been demonstrated before, but the materials had to be enclosed in a tiny capsule where the reaction took place, limiting fabrication flexibility, capacity and utility of the approach for 3d nanofabrication. the research team - including graduate student and first author jeffrey fisher, postdoctoral fellow songkil kim and senior research engineer peter kottke - used low volatility solvents such as ethylene glycol, dissolving a salt of silver in the liquid. in solution, the salt dissociates into silver cations, allowing production of silver metal deposits by electrochemical reduction reaction using solvated secondary electrons rather direct molecular decomposition. the solvent containing the desired material ions is introduced into the chamber using a nanoelectrospray system composed of a tiny nozzle just a few microns in diameter. by applying the focused electric field to the nozzle, the fluid jet is drawn and delivers to the substrate forming a precisely controlled thin liquid film. the electrospray produces nanometer-scale charged droplets from a taylor cone jet just 100 nanometers in diameter, which coalesce upon impingement and form a thin film of the precursor on the solid substrate. the research team used the electron beam itself to visualize the taylor cone jet in the vacuum environment, the first time this has ever demonstrated, as well as to measure the thickness of the liquid film in situ by using a nanoscale ""ruler"" prefabricated on the deposition substrate. the electron beam then scans over the liquid film following a desired pattern, producing suitable energy electrons which solvate and reduce the cations, writing structures in precise formation from the precursor delivered by the electrified jet. though evaporation of the solvent does occur, the nanoelectrospray can maintain a stable film long enough for the structures to form. the combination of a denser precursor, reduction in material surface transfer problems and elimination of the need to break chemical bonds with the electron beam allows fabrication up to five orders of magnitude - a factor of 5,000 - faster than the earlier gas-phase technique. ""by changing the energy of the beam and current, we can preferentially grow nanostructures in 3d at much faster rate,"" fedorov said. ""all of a sudden, there are a whole host of different applications that were not possible before."" varying the precursor type, film thickness, concentration of ions and the energy and current of the electron beam controls the kinds of structures that can be made, fedorov said. structures such as bridges connecting posts become possible because material can be written atop the thin films. the researchers have fabricated carbon nanopillars five microns tall, wall-like nanostructures connecting two nanopillars, and suspended bridge-like arch nanostructures connecting nanopillars. the structures required growth times ranging from 2 to 40 seconds. silver micropillars have also been fabricated. the new process allows considerable flexibility in fabrication, opening the possibility of depositing more than one material simultaneously. that could allow production of alloys and composites, such as combinations of silver and gold. or, one material could be used as a template to be coated by another material with the simple substitution of precursor materials. so far, the georgia tech team has produced structures of silver and carbon, but the process could be used to fabricate a wide range of metallic and non-metallic nanomaterials. metals produced using the technique can be highly pure because a carbon-producing precursor dissociation step can be mitigated. the next step will be to understand the physics and chemistry governing the fabrication process to allow more precise control and to guide others who may wish to use it for their own specific applications. ""we expect that the role of the solvents is going to be very important in the kinds of kinetic pathways that we can control to produce many different kinds of structures with desired chemical make-up,"" said fedorov. ""this gives us an opportunity to explore a regime of chemistry and physics that had previously been outside what we could study. we want to establish an understanding of the basic physics and chemistry of the process."" future work will include a study of how the interaction of beams with different energies, vacuum environments, solvents and concentrations of ionic species affect the outcome. ""we have demonstrated that we can electrospray liquid precursors inside a high vacuum environment of an electron microscope and then use electrons to facilitate useful chemical transformations,"" said fedorov.

3d-printing-technique-accelerates-nanoscale-fabrication-thousandfold.txt,"3d printing technique accelerates nanoscale fabrication a thousandfold 
 a new 3d-printing technique can create nanoscale structures a thousand times faster than current processes.

 oct 03, 2019 
 - atlanta, ga 
 using a new time-based method to control light from an ultrafast laser, researchers have developed a nanoscale 3d printing technique that can fabricate tiny structures a thousand times faster than conventional two-photon lithography (tpl) techniques, without sacrificing resolution. 
 despite the high throughput, the new parallelized technique - known as femtosecond projection tpl (fp-tpl) - produces depth resolution of 175 nanometers, which is better than established methods and can fabricate structures with 90-degree overhangs that can't currently be made. the technique could lead to manufacturing-scale production of bioscaffolds, flexible electronics, electrochemical interfaces, micro-optics, mechanical and optical metamaterials, and other functional micro- and nanostructures. 
 the work, reported oct. 3 in the journal 
 science , was done by researchers from lawrence livermore national laboratory (llnl) and the chinese university of hong kong. 
 sourabh saha , the paper's lead and corresponding author, is now an assistant professor in the 
 george w. woodruff school of mechanical engineering 
 at the georgia institute of technology. 
 existing nanoscale additive manufacturing techniques use a single spot of high-intensity light - typically around 700 to 800 nanometers in diameter - to convert photopolymer materials from liquids to solids. because the point must scan through the entire structure being fabricated, the existing tpl technique can require many hours to produce complex 3d structures, which limits its ability to be scaled up for practical applications. 
 ""instead of using a single point of light, we project a million points simultaneously,"" said saha. ""this scales up the process dramatically because instead of working with a single point that has to be scanned to create the structure, we can use an entire plane of projected light. instead of focusing a single point, we have an entire focused plane that can be patterned into arbitrary structures."" 
 to create a million points, the researchers use a digital mask similar to those used in projectors to create images and videos. in this case, the mask controls a femtosecond laser to create the desired light pattern in the precursor liquid polymer material. the high-intensity light causes a polymerization reaction that turns the liquid to solid, where desired, to create 3d structures. 
 each layer of the fabricated structure is formed by a 35-femtosecond burst of high-intensity light. the projector and mask are then used to create layer after layer until the entire structure is produced. the liquid polymer is then removed, leaving behind the solid. the fp-tpl technique allows the researchers to produce in eight minutes a structure that would take several hours to produce using earlier processes. 
 ""the parallel two-photon system that has been developed is a breakthrough in nanoscale printing that will enable the remarkable performance in materials and structures at this size scale to be realized in usable components,"" said llnl's center for engineered materials and manufacturing director chris spadaccini. 
 unlike consumer 3d printing that uses particles sprayed onto a surface, the new technique goes deep into the liquid precursor, allowing the fabrication of structures that could not be produced with surface fabrication alone. for instance, the technique can produce what saha calls an ""impossible bridge"" with 90-degree overhangs and with more than a 1,000:1 aspect ratio of length to feature size. ""we can project the light to any depth that we want in the material, so we can make suspended 3d structures,"" he said. 
 the researchers have printed suspended structures a millimeter long between bases that are smaller than 100 microns by 100 microns. the structure doesn't collapse while being fabricated because the liquid and solid are about the same density - and the production happens so quickly that the liquid doesn't have time to be disturbed. 
 beyond bridges, the researchers made a variety of structures chosen to demonstrate the technique, including micro-pillars, cuboids, log-piles, wires and spirals. the researchers used conventional polymer precursors, but saha believes the technique would also work for metals and ceramics that can be generated from precursor polymers. 
 ""the real application for this would be in industrial-scale production of small devices that may be integrated into larger products, such as components in smartphones,"" he said. ""the next step is to demonstrate that we can print with other materials to expand the material palette."" 
 research groups have been working for years to accelerate the two-photon lithography process used to produce nanoscale 3d structures. the success of this group came from adopting a different way of focusing the light, using its time-domain properties, which allowed production of very thin light sheets capable of high resolution - and tiny features. 
 use of the femtosecond laser allowed the research team to maintain enough light intensity to trigger the two-photon process polymerization while keeping the point sizes thin. in the fp-tpl technique, the femtosecond pulses are stretched and compressed as they pass through the optical system to implement temporal focusing. the process, which can generate 3d features smaller than the diffraction-limited, focused light spot, requires that two photons hit the liquid precursor molecules simultaneously. 
 ""traditionally, there are tradeoffs between speed and resolution,"" saha said. ""if you want a faster process, you would lose resolution. we have broken this engineering tradeoff, allowing us to print a thousand times faster with the smallest of features."" 
 at georgia tech, saha intends to continue advancing the work with new materials and further scale-up of the process. 
 ""so far, we have shown that we can do pretty well on speed and resolution,"" he said. ""the next questions will be how well we can predict the features and how well we can control the quality over large scales. that will require more work to understand the process itself.""

40-year-math-mystery-and-four-generations-figuring.txt,"40-year math mystery and four generations of figuring 
 in social media and much computer technology, a field of math called graph theory is used to make networks work. georgia tech mathematicians have solved a 40-year graph theory mystery. 
 georgia tech mathematicians xingxing yu, yan wang and dawei he have offered a proof of the kelmans-seymour conjecture nearly 40 years after princeton mathematician paul seymour made it in 1977. 
 may 25, 2016 
 - atlanta, ga 
 this may sound like a familiar kind of riddle: how many brilliant mathematicians does it take to come up with and prove the kelmans-seymour conjecture? but the answer is no joke, because arriving at it took mental toil that spanned four decades until this year, when mathematicians at the georgia institute of technology 
 finally announced a proof 
 of that conjecture in graph theory. their research was funded by the national science foundation. graph theory is a field of mathematics that's instrumental in complex tangles. it helps you make more connecting flights, helps get your gps unstuck in traffic, and helps manage your facebook posts. back to the question. how many? six (at least). one made the conjecture. one tried for years to prove it and failed but passed on his insights. one advanced the mathematical basis for 10 more years. one helped that person solve part of the proof. and two more finally helped him complete the rest of the proof. elapsed time: 39 years. so, what is the kelmans-seymour conjecture, anyway? its name comes from paul seymour from princeton university, who came up with the notion in 1977. then another mathematician named alexander kelmans, arrived at the same conjecture in 1979. and though the georgia tech proof fills some 120 pages of math reasoning, the conjecture itself is only one short sentence: if a graph g is 5-connected and non-planar, then g has a tk 5 . the devil called ‘tk 5 ' you could call a tk 5 
 the devil in the details. tk 5 s are larger relatives of k 5 , a very simple formation that looks like a 5-point star fenced in by a pentagon. it resembles an occult or anarchy symbol, and that's fitting. a tk 5 
 in a ""graph"" is guaranteed to thwart any nice, neat ""planar"" status. graph theory. planar. non-planar. tk 5 . let's go to the real world to understand them better. ""graph theory is used, for example, in designing microprocessors and the logic behind computer programs,"" said georgia tech mathematician xingxing yu, who has shepherded the kelmans-seymour conjecture's proof to completion. ""it's helpful in detailed networks to get quick solutions that are reasonable and require low computational complexity."" to picture a graph, draw some cities as points on a whiteboard and lines representing interstate highways connecting them. but the resulting drawings are not geometrical figures like squares and trapezoids. instead, the lines, called ""edges,"" are like wires connecting points called ""vertices."" for a planar graph, there is always some way to draw it so that the lines from point to point do not cross. in the real world, a microprocessor is sending electrons from point to point down myriad conductive paths. get them crossed, and the processor shorts out. in such intricate scenarios, optimizing connections is key. graphs and graph algorithms play a role in modeling them. ""you want to get as close to planar as you can in these situations,"" yu said. in graph theory, wherever k 5 
 or its sprawling relatives tk 5 s show up, you can forget planar. that's why it's important to know where one may be hiding in a very large graph. the human connections the human connections that led to the proof of the kelmans-seymour conjecture are equally interesting, if less complicated. seymour had a collaborator, 
 robin thomas, a regent's professor at georgia tech 
 who heads a 
 program that includes a concentration on graph theory . his team has a track record of cracking decades-old math problems. one was even more than a century old. ""i tried moderately hard to prove the kelmans-seymour conjecture in the 1990s, but failed,"" thomas said. ""yu is a rare mathematician, and this shows it. i'm delighted that he pushed the proof to completion."" yu, once thomas' postdoc and now a professor at the school of mathematics, picked up on the conjecture many years later. ""around 2000, i was working on related concepts and around 2007, i became convinced that i was ready to work on that conjecture,"" yu said. he planned to involve graduate students but waited a year. ""i needed to have a clearer plan of how to proceed. otherwise, it would have been too risky,"" yu said. then he brought in graduate student jie ma in 2008, and together they proved the conjecture part of the way. two years later, yu brought graduate students yan wang and dawei he into the picture. ""wang worked very hard and efficiently full time on the problem,"" yu said. the team delivered the rest of the proof quicker than anticipated and 
 currently have two 
 submitted papers 
 and two more in the works. in addition to the six mathematicians who made and proved the conjecture, others tried but didn't complete the proof but left behind useful cues. nearly four decades after seymour had his idea, the fight for its proof is still not over. other researchers are now called to tear at it for about two years like an invading mob. not until they've thoroughly failed to destroy it, will the proof officially stand. seymour's first reaction to news of the proof reflected that reality. ""congratulations! (if it's true…),"" he wrote. graduate student wang is not terribly worried. ""we spent lots and lots of our time trying to wreck it ourselves and couldn't, so i hope things will be fine,"" he said. if so, the conjecture will get a new name: kelmans-seymour conjecture proved by he, wang and yu. and it will trigger a mathematical chain reaction, automatically confirming a past conjecture, dirac's conjecture proved by mader, and also putting within reach proof of another conjecture, hajos' conjecture. for princeton mathematician seymour, it's nice to see an intuition he held so strongly is now likely to enter into the realm of proven mathematics. ""sometimes you conjecture some pretty thing, and it's just wrong, and the truth is just a mess,"" he wrote in an email message. ""but sometimes, the pretty thing is also the truth; that that does happen sometimes is basically what keeps math going i suppose. there's a profound thought."" the national science foundation funded this research under grants dms-1265564 and ast-1247545.  any opinions, findings, and conclusions or recommendations expressed in this material are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the views of the national science foundation.

40th-challenge-program-hosts-75-incoming-students.txt,"40th challenge program hosts 75 incoming students 
 the 2020 omed challenge program successfully hosted 75 incoming first-year student participants in the wake of covid-19. 
 aug 25, 2020 
 - atlanta, ga 
 the 2020  omed: educational services 
 (omed) challenge program operated a little differently this year. 
 the typically five-week summer intensive academic program was shortened to three. 
 the incoming first-year student participants engaged in the program's various community, athletic, and corporate activities while wearing protective masks. 
 academic courses were hybrid - and smaller - to accommodate for physical distancing. 
 students resided in single-occupancy dorm rooms in the campus' gray house (formerly known as fourth street apartments). 
 a smaller cohort of 75 were welcomed this year. 
 still, the 40 th 
 iteration of the program successfully upheld its pledge to prepare incoming first-year underrepresented minority students for college life at georgia tech by addressing the 7cs: computer science, chemistry, calculus, communication, career development, cultural competency, and community service. 
 ""the 2020 challenge program will be remembered as historic for at least two reasons,"" said archie ervin, vice president of 
 institute diversity, equity, and inclusion  on a recorded video message during the program's closing ceremonies on august 13. 
 ""first, you as members of challenge 2020 helped defy the odds and overcome obstacles the covid-19 pandemic presented to us which threatened our chances for even conducting challenge for its 40 th 
 straight year. second, history will acknowledge all of you for doing all the right things and staying focused on your academic goals that helped make challenge 2020 successful in spite of the odds against us,"" he continued. ""even though challenge 2020 was shortened by a couple of weeks, i'm confident we accomplished all of our important goals and objects for the program."" 
 ""challenge has been one of the best experiences of my life,"" said cameron heard, an incoming biomedical engineering major. ""the academic courses here were very rigorous and i feel like they've prepared me for the courses i'll see at tech. most importantly, i feel challenge has helped me grow overall as a person."" 
 in addition to the academic rigor, participants took part in virtual dinners with corporate partners; performed community service activities; participated for a scavenger hunt; made new friends during the opening weekend cookout; and battled the rapids of the ocoee river during the annual white water rafting excursion - all while practicing safe measures in the wake of the pandemic. 
 ""we implemented additional measures for challenge outside of what many of our participants were used to practicing on their own, so naturally there was a period of adjustment,"" said jelani liddell, omed's assistant director of outreach initiatives and director of the program. ""our challenge counselors did a great job monitoring and reminding students of safety protocols. and our participants understood the precautions and adjusted very well to our modified program."" 
 some of the added precautions were: requesting participants to self-isolate prior to arrival on campus; single-occupancy housing on campus; restricted travel off campus; required isolation upon non-essential off-campus travel; required face coverings in all public spaces; body temperature monitoring; designated isolation rooms; and physical distancing guidelines. 
 ""our hybrid-program model allowed us to maintain safe distancing while still maintaining the engagement dynamic which consisted of participant social interaction and peer relationship development,"" added liddell. ""we wanted to ensure that physical distancing did not assume 
 social 
 distancing. we believe we were able to accomplish that this year."" 
 the closing program was conducted across two ceremonies to account for physical distancing. awards for most improved and exemplary academic performance were presented to six students in the program's computer science, mathematics, and chemistry courses. 
 corporate sponsor bp joined with omed to support the recognition of 35 students for outstanding academic performance, including 18 who earned a 4.0 gpa during the program. 
 ""coming into college, i wasn't sure what to expect,"" said nathnael aberra, a computer science major, ahead of the closing. ""but challenge has put my worries to rest. i feel great that i got the opportunity to give myself this head start at tech."" 
 this year's closing ceremonies also included the presentation of a new award on behalf of tech's center of engineering education and diversity (ceed): the national action council for minorities in engineering (nacme) offered awards to five challenge students eligible to receive an annual scholarship. ""you are an impressive, proven, and resilient group,"" said sybrina atwaters, director of omed and academic coordinator of challenge. ""during unprecedented times, this cohort has confronted every challenge placed before them, collectively earned over $30,000 in incentives for the upcoming fall semester, and established a new challenge academic record."" 
 the 2020 program hosted participants from seven states with an ethnicity breakdown of 59% black / african american, 32% latinx, 4% asian, and 4% two or more ethnicities. student participants majored in more than a dozen areas of study. 
 this year's program was supported by corporate sponsors bp, eaton, and procter & gamble.

 aaron stebner  outlined an aggressive plan for artificial intelligence and manufacturing when he applied for a faculty position in 2019. in his cover letter, he promised ""to establish the georgia institute of technology as a world leader in additive manufacturing of solid materials (ceramics & metals) r&d, especially in the fusion of data sciences and ai to create new, world-leading technologies."" 
 stebner thought it would take 10-15 years of incremental steps and funding to achieve the goal. he was wrong. 
 thanks to a new  $65 million grant from the u.s. department of commerce's economic development administration , announced by president joe biden,  stebner's plan will begin to become a reality  - and include the entire state of georgia and all of its manufacturing sectors from agriculture to airplanes - two years after arriving on campus. 
 the largest of the nine projects within the larger georgia ai manufacturing (ga-aim) technology corridor grant will allow stebner and georgia tech to transform the  advanced manufacturing pilot facility (ampf)  into the artificial intelligence manufacturing pilot facility (ai-mpf). the 24,000 square-foot facility on 14th street will more than double in size after georgia tech and statewide ga-aim partners were selected as one of 21 phase ii awardees in the $1 billion  build back better regional challenge  (bbb) competition, part of the  investing in america's communities  initiative under the  american rescue plan act of 2021 .

 this year, 77 teams participated in the competition from all across georgia and 70 judges participated with live video pitches and a q&a. on thursday, students presented their projects to the judges and the projects were then evaluated based on criteria such as practicality, creativity, marketability and design-based thinking. each team had their own judging rooms where judges could join in and out of to review all the teams. the synchronous virtual setting allowed for students to receive feedback in real time. 
 ""the students and teachers were absolutely thrilled,"" said jasmine patel, ceismc research associate, ""they loved that they were able to keep the interaction with the judges and to pitch them 'shark tank' style."" 
 on wednesday, march 17th, the award ceremony followed the event and included keynote speaker, marques colston. colston is a former nfl super bowl champion, and he is now an entrepreneur and venture capitalist. the keynote incorporated a pre-recorded inspirational message about colston's career experience and the hardships he had to overcome. colton then followed up with a 20-minute live q&a. 
 ""[students] asked amazing questions like: what made you want to become an entrepreneur? what other hardships did you face? did you encounter racism throughout your career, and how did you overcome that?"" said patel.

aaas-honors-cola-fox-and-weitz-fellows.txt,"aaas honors cola, fox and weitz as fellows 
 three georgia tech researchers honored as aaas fellows for 2017 for their contributions to the advancement of science. 
 mary frank fox has been named aaas fellow for 2917. she is known for her research on women and men in scientific organizations and occupations. fox is nationally recognized as a leader on issues of diversity, equity, and equity in science. 
 dec 04, 2017 
 - atlanta, ga 
 the american association for the advancement of science (aaas) has named three researchers from the georgia institute of technology as fellows for 2017 for their contributions to the advancement of science. 
 baratunde cola, mary frank fox, and joshua weitz, who are members of aaas, were elected by their peers to receive the honor and join hundreds of their contemporaries who became fellows this year. ""this year 396 members have been awarded this honor by aaas because of their scientifically or socially distinguished efforts to advance science or its applications,"" the aaas wrote in its announcement of this year's fellows. 
 all three georgia tech fellows saw the aaas fellowship as encouragement to continue serving science and humanity. 
 the three have excelled in research in the following fields, according to aaas: cola in nanoscale engineering, fox in the participation and performance of women and men in science, and weitz in virus dynamics in populations and in ecosystems. here are summaries of the researchers' achievements and interests. 
 baratunda cola 
 may be best known for engineering the first-ever optical rectenna. a rectenna, or rectifying antenna, turns electromagnetic waves into direct current electricity, and cola's invention was the first known to work with sunlight instead of radio waves, making it an innovation in efficient solar energy generation. 
 cola, who is an associate professor in the george w. woodruff school of mechanical engineering at georgia tech, is currently focused on the transfer of heat, and the conversion of energy in nanostructures, particularly those based on carbon nanotubes. he holds three carbon nanotube related patents and is interested in making his innovations producible on a large scale for practical use. 
 ""i was honored that aaas chose to recognize my contributions to science over the years,"" cola said. ""the fellowship gives a bigger platform to my work so it can reach more people and be useful to them."" 
 cola's vision transcends arbitrary confines of a research field. ""i think of myself less as being a mechanical engineer and more as a person concerned with the advancement and well-being of people, and i appreciate the power of science to positively affect lives through practical applications."" 
 in april, cola 
 received the highest honor awarded by the national science foundation to up-and-coming scientists and engineers . like the aaas fellowship, the alan t. waterman award also recognized cola's achievements in transforming light and heat into electricity on the nanoscale, and it added $1 million in funding to his research. 
 cola also serves as ceo of carbice corporation, a georgia tech spinoff company that has developed a heat-conducting tape that helps prevent electronic devices from overheating. 
 mary frank fox 
 is known for her research on women and men in scientific organizations and occupations. she is nationally recognized as a leader on issues of diversity, equity, and equity in science, and her work has had a significant influence on science and technology policy. 
 fox, who is an 
 advance professor 
 at the school of public policy in georgia tech's ivan allen college of liberal arts, is particularly interested in how social and organizational settings, in which scientists are educated and work, influence their performance. she holds multiple board of director positions in societies connected to science and technology policy. 
 ""i'm deeply honored by the aaas award,"" fox said. ""i value that it recognizes my years of research on women and men in sciences and the policy implications for equity."" 
 fox sees the award as recognition that her work advances science and is aligned with aaas's commitments. ""i'm one of the founders of this area of science, and i value this award recognizing this research that advances science,"" fox said. 
 joshua weitz 
 uses models to predict the effects of viruses on populations and on ecosystems, but his work encompasses many complex biological systems. his group combines methods from physics, math, computational biology, and bioinformatics to develop in-depth analytical models of biological dynamics to understand experimental and environmental data. 
 in the field of virology, he applies this approach to the molecular workings of viruses, their spread through a population and their evolution into new strains. his work is theoretical, but he uses his detailed computational methods to collaborate with experimentalists. weitz is a professor in georgia tech's school of biological sciences, courtesy professor of physics and the director of the interdisciplinary graduate program in quantitative biosciences. 
 ""when aaas first informed me, i was honored and humbled.  and i was proud of my group and its collective effort in the last 10 years at georgia tech to study viral ecology,"" weitz said. 
 ""the mission of the aaas is ever more important in these times, and being a fellow gives us a greater responsibility to communicate our research beyond the scientific community, to let the public know how it serves society's betterment by improving public health and environmental health."" 
 the american association for the advancement of science lays claim to the distinction of being ""the world's largest general scientific society."" aaas was founded in 1848 and publishes the journal 
 science 
 as well as many other prestigious research periodicals. the aaas fellowship began in 1874.

 chaouki t. abdallah testifies on u.s. competitiveness, research, stem pipeline at congressional hearing 
 jan 30, 2020 
 - atlanta, ga 
 on jan. 29, chaouki abdallah, georgia tech's executive vice president for research, testified before a u.s. house of representatives committee about the cooperative united states research and development (r&d) enterprise, including the threat of falling behind other nations in critical technologies, investment in the nation's institutions of higher education, and the future of the stem talent pipeline. 
 along with abdallah, the hearing brought together expert testimony from representatives from federal and industry perspectives, including diane souvaine, chair of the national science board, and eric schmidt, former ceo of google and founder of schmidt futures. 
 in his testimony to the committee on science, space, and technology, abdallah stressed the importance of maintaining the u.s. position of leadership in r&d, and the importance of the collaboration between the federal government, higher education, and the private sector. 
 ""the mission, alignment, and cooperation of these three actors have historically made the u.s. research landscape the most productive and admired in the world … and made the u.s. safer, healthier, and wealthier."" 
 he testified that those successes have also created competitors that now pose a threat to the nation's competitiveness in critical technologies. the u.s. now risks falling behind in areas such as cybersecurity, quantum information systems, advanced manufacturing and materials, bioscience, and others. those threats, abdallah shared, pose an immediate national security risk and a long-term economic risk, including a negative effect on the capacity of the u.s. to create new knowledge, the potential to diminish the nation's industry, and the possibility of losing the ability to attract the best and brightest minds in the world. 
 in his remarks, abdallah testified that the united states must commit to cooperation and competition, when necessary, with an ever-vigilant eye toward research safeguards. he added that as the number of u.s.-born, college-age students and graduates dwindles, the u.s. must refocus its commitment to serving as a magnet for diverse talent in stem from around the world, including american women and underrepresented minorities, as well as foreign-born students. 
 ""such individuals, many of whom, like myself, were initially educated under a different educational system and funded by the resources of another country, bring with them a different way of thinking, learning, and problem-solving,"" he said. ""those unique perspectives, when coupled with our open research system and our american values, lead to a dynamic and healthy r&d enterprise."" 
 for abdallah, the best opportunity and most enduring strategy for improving our national position in science and technology is to start with the talent pipeline, and for universities to admit college-ready students. 
 ""[we must] nurture and engage a larger number from untapped domestic populations and provide an academic environment for them to strive and succeed as students, faculty, and researchers,"" he said. ""that rich and diverse pool of candidates must be increased, prepared, and nurtured in the k-12 system. it is incumbent upon american universities to continue to strengthen their collaboration with the federal agencies, government, and industry, and to assume more responsibility outside of our traditional roles."" 
 abdallah also reiterated the importance of certain and long-term federal investment in institutions of higher education, emphasizing the varied roles federal funds play in academia, including recruiting, educating, and retaining top talent, supporting research facilities, and creating new intellectual property that leads to new markets and enterprises. 
 ""it is important to keep in mind that what is now a critical technology was once a basic science research idea, or likely fundamental research funded by the federal government at a research university,"" he said. ""the federal dollar is usually the first dollar in the chain, and is converted by universities into basic knowledge and talent, feeding businesses and leading to solutions, technologies, and products that generate returns back into the federal treasury and benefit society.""

accessible-affordable-and-applicable-future-higher-education.txt,"accessible, affordable and applicable: the future of higher education 
 georgia tech held a discussion in nyc with reporters and higher education community about what colleges must do to guarantee student success. 
 nov 08, 2018 
 - atlanta, ga 
 one of the challenges colleges face is how to best prepare students for the career pathways that exist today and will be created in the future. 
 to meet students' needs colleges must look at how and where they operate, as well as who they serve and who is left out. 
 these were just a few of the topics discussed thursday during a media roundtable discussion georgia tech organized in new york city with peers in higher education, corporate leaders and foundations looking into this issue. 
 ""higher education is going to change. it's going to have to change,"" president g.p. ""bud"" peterson said. ""what is that new model of higher education going to look like?"" 
 peterson noted three possibilities at the conclusion of the discussion. first, education will move away from a calendar-driven model to a knowledge-based one. second, student success will need new definitions beyond attending college for four years to earn a bachelor's degree. and third, knowledge isn't just held by teachers. students are teaching and learning from one another as well. 
 provost rafael l. bras also participated in the discussion, which included reporters from  the new york times ,  the wall street journal ,  inside higher ed 
 and other media outlets. 
 the other panelists were: 
 anant agarwal, ceo, edx 
 ángel cabrera, president, george mason university

 georgia tech organized the event following the release of its report,  deliberate innovation, lifetime education , which looks at how colleges must change to meet the evolving needs of students and employers. 
 using the year 2040 as a vantage point, the report envisions a university that provides an educational experience that can be personalized as professional interests and needs shift throughout a person's lifetime. it looks at ways to improve advising, how to use artificial intelligence to personalize education, and what new products and services will make it possible to meet demand as learners' professional and personal needs change.

 soon scientists and the public will have the chance to easily test hypotheses about america's ecological challenges with the help of an ensemble of technologies, including artificial intelligence. researchers at georgia institute of technology will link their technology for systems thinking with ibm watson and the encyclopedia of life at the smithsonian. scientists will then be able to use the information to create their own models about the environment and efficiently test them. 
 the project is one of 
 10 ""big data spokes"" announced by the national science foundation (nsf) . the nsf's $10 million initiative was created to improve the ability to solve the nation's most pressing challenges with the use of big data. the georgia tech, smithsonian and ibm ""spoke"" will receive $1 million from nsf. ibm will also provide in-kind gifts. overall, the project engages 24 researchers from 14 institutions from academia, industry, government and non-profit organizations. 
 ""environmental sustainability is a growing concern for our country. scientists and citizens needbetter tools and data to rapidly build and test conceptual models of ecological phenomena,"" said ashok goel, a georgia tech professor who is the principal investigator of the collaboration. ""we want to empower them."" 
 the encyclopedia of life (eol), headquartered at the smithsonian institution, is an online, open-access database that gathers information about all biological species on earth. 
 ""modelers tell us that predicting an ecosystem's response to global changes requires knowledge of things like the mass of an algal cell, the lifespan of a copepod and the ecological partners of a reef-building coral,"" said bob corrigan, eol's director of operations. ""eol is surfacing, structuring and sharing hundreds of years of careful measurements by generations of biologists. combining these assets with the capabilities of georgia tech and ibm will give scientists and students alike the ability to model and study our biosphere at scales that have not been possible before."" 
 as part of the spoke project, watson developer cloud's language and vision services will be trained to deeply understand the specialized ecology domain represented in the eol webpages and images. 
 ""unlocking all of this unstructured information from the smithsonian's encyclopedia of life, bringing it into the context of other relevant structured knowledge, and making it available for further human and machine reasoning holds tremendous potential,"" said lisa amini, director, cognitive computing: knowledge and reasoning at ibm research. ""the possibilities are endless."" 
 users will then take that information and plug it into georgia tech's modeling & inquiry learning application (mila) system. the interactive tool allows scientists to rapidly generate conceptual models, evaluates them through simulation and provides results. 
 the nsf grant will allow the team to seamlessly link eol, watson and mila. the goal is to build a working system that enables ecological modeling by early 2018. 
 ""you can have all the information in the world, but if you can't easily find the knowledge, you can't build a model,"" said goel. ""and if you can't build a good model, the information is useless. our project uses artificial intelligence to address these concerns."" 
 the big data spokes program is supported and organized by the nsf's big data regional innovation hubs (bd hubs). the four hubs (south, northeast, midwest and west) foster multi-sector collaborations among academia, industry and government. georgia tech co-leads the south hub with the university of north carolina. 
 ""the big data spokes advance the goals and regional priorities of each bd hub, fusing the strengths of a range of institutions and investigators and applying them to problems that affect the communities and populations within their regions,"" said jim kurose, assistant director of nsf for computer and information science and engineering. ""we are pleased to be making this substantial investment today to accelerate the nation's big data r&d innovation ecosystem."" 
 two other spoke awards have ties to georgia tech. santiago grijalva, georgia power distinguished professor in the 
 school of electrical and computer engineering , will study smart grids using big data with texas a&m. gari clifford, an emory university associate professor with a joint appointment in the 
 wallace h. coulter department of biomedical engineering , will investigate how to use data from fitness trackers and environmental monitors to improve patient care. 
 ""georgia tech's inclusion in these awards is reflective of the institute's unique breadth and depth of expertise that spans all areas of data science and data-driven discovery,"" said srinivas aluru, co-executive director of georgia tech's 
 institute for data engineering and science 
 and principal investigator of the 
 south big data hub .

 researchers at georgia institute of technology are looking at that mixture of ingredients as a model for a bioinspired glue because of its unique adhesive properties and ability to remain sticky through a range of conditions.

 honey bees spend hours each day collecting pollen and packing it into tidy bundles attached to their hind legs. 
 but all of that hard work could instantly be undone during a sudden rainstorm were it not for two substances the insect uses to keep the pollen firmly stuck in place: bee spit and flower oil. 
 now researchers at georgia institute of technology are looking at that mixture of ingredients as a model for a bioinspired glue because of its unique adhesive properties and ability to remain sticky through a range of conditions. 
 ""a bee encounters not just wet and humid environments but windy and dry surroundings as well, so its pollen pellet must counteract those variations in humidity while remaining adhered,"" said j. carson meredith, a professor in georgia tech's school of chemical and biomolecular engineering. ""being able to withstand those kinds of changes in humidity is still a challenge for synthetic adhesives."" 
 in a study published march 26 in the journal 
 nature communications 
 and sponsored by the air force office of scientific research, the researchers described how those two natural liquids work together to protect the bee's bounty as it travels back to its hive. 
 the first component of the glue is the bee's own salivary secretions, which coat the pollen grains and allow them to stick together. the bees produce those sugary secretions, the main ingredient in honey, from nectar they drink from the flowers. 
 the second ingredient is a plant-based oil that coats the pollen grains called pollenkitt, which helps stabilize the adhesive properties of the nectar and protect it from the impact of too much or too little humidity. 
 ""it works similarly to a layer of cooking oil covering a pool of syrup,"" meredith said. ""the oil separates the syrup from the air and slows down drying considerably."" 
 the researchers tested the adhesive properties of the bee's glue by separating the oil-based component from the sugar-based component and evaluating how sticky the nectar remained under various humidity conditions. as expected, as humidity increased and the nectar absorbed more water, its adhesive properties diminished. the same effect was true when humidity decreased and the nectar dried out. meanwhile, under similar conditions, nectar coated with the pollenkitt oil remained sticky despite changes in humidity. 
 ""we believe you could take the essential concepts of this material and develop a novel adhesive with a water-barrier external oil layer that could better resist humidity changes in the same way,"" meredith said.  ""or potentially this concept would apply to controlling the working time of an adhesive, such as its ability to flow and time to dry or cure."" 
 the research team, which included victor breedveld, an associate professor in the school of chemical and biomolecular engineering, also examined dynamics of the bee adhesive. 
 ""we wanted to know, if the pollen can stay so firmly attached to the bee's hind legs, how do the bees manage to remove it when they return to the hive,"" meredith said. 
 the answer may lie in the adhesive's a rate-sensitive response. in other words, the faster the force attempting to remove it, the more it would resist. 
 ""this is a property of capillary adhesion, which we believe could be harnessed and tailored for specific applications, such as controlling motion in microscopic or nanoscale devices, in fields ranging from construction to medicine,"" meredith said. 
 this work was supported by the air force office of scientific research under grant no. fa9550-10-1-0555. any conclusions or recommendations are those of the authors and do not necessarily represent the official views of the sponsoring organizations.

 the advanced technology development center (atdc) has named michelangelo ho its financial technology catalyst, and he will lead the agency's effort to focus on georgia-based startups in that sector. ho is expected to start on april 20, and the announcement of his hiring is the first significant step in atdc's financial technology accelerator initiative. in march 2015, worldpay, a global payments technology and services company, gave $1 million to the georgia institute of technology to create a financial technology accelerator at atdc. the gift, which will fully fund the accelerator for the next three years, called for the hiring of a fintech expert to mentor startups. atdc, a program of tech's enterprise innovation institute, is a statewide technology startup incubator and is charged with helping entrepreneurs build and launch successful companies. it is one of the oldest university-based incubators in the country. ""the fintech startups in georgia are really underserved, so this is a great opportunity for us at atdc and it's a unique challenge for me,"" ho said. the focus on financial technology is strategically important to georgia because the state is a leader in the space. indeed, the american transaction processors coalition says more than 70 percent of all u.s. payments are processed in georgia and more than 60 percent of the industry's companies call metro atlanta home. that's led to the creation of a sizable number of fintech startups in georgia and increased interest from entrepreneurs who want to launch their own companies in the sector, ho said. ""from my perspective, it's a great opportunity and that opportunity is huge because of the volume of startups out there that atdc has a chance to help and accelerate."" ho, who has deep experience in fintech, has been involved with a number of innovative companies and projects in the sector, including merchant customer exchange (mcx) / currentc, google wallet, and isis / softcard. an entrepreneur himself who founded two companies, gospring and veritas product group, ho led innovation and strategy efforts at first data corp. and as a consultant for at&t, among others. as a mentor at atdc for the past three years, he has advised a number of entrepreneurs and startups. a tech graduate, he holds a master of management executive mba from the institute, and bachelor's and master's degrees in electrical engineering from mercer university. by péralte c. paul

ai-and-neuroscience-become-dance-partners-georgia-tech-arts-event.txt,"ai and neuroscience to become dance partners for georgia tech arts event 
 dance will mix with the fields of neuroscience, technology, and artificial intelligence (ai) to create a unique performance 
 sep 30, 2021 
 - atlanta, ga 
 an unlikely combination will take center stage on campus this friday, october 1. with assistance from college of engineering researchers, 
 georgia tech arts 
 and 
 terminus ballet theatre (tmbt) 
 will mix dance with the fields of neuroscience, technology, and artificial intelligence (ai) to create a unique performance. tmbt dancers will perform excerpts of 
 interactions | boundaries of sensory experience , a work-in-progress that is a physical embodiment of neuroscience and an exploration of the ethics and mechanics of how it's used in ai technologies. 
 georgia tech researchers have been meeting with the choreographer, troy schumacher, and the ballet company for the last year and a half to shape the concept, which explores ideas at the forefront of mechanical interventions into the human body and mind. 
 ""i think the arts can be a really powerful way to bring people from all backgrounds into a conversation about science and technology,"" said 
 chris rozell , a professor in the 
 school of electrical and computer engineering 
 who has worked on the project since its genesis. ""my goal is to facilitate that conversation by helping to translate between the scientists doing amazing work and the artists who are approaching these ideas from the perspective of making something beautiful."" 
 georgia tech arts and tmbt have dubbed the project the ""grand neuroethics challenge."" 
 ""a lot of the concepts, technologies, research, and ethics we've been discussing in this work are extremely complicated, but what's come through for me is that a lot of their work is going to have profound implications for the future of humanity,"" said schumacher. ""so, for this ballet, i've decided to focus on the emotional relationship to brain-machine interfaces, while touching on what i've learned so far. i've spent most of my career collaborating with artists with little to no relationship to dance, but nothing quite as complex and fascinating as this."" 
 aaron shackelford, director of georgia tech arts, said the project is a worthwhile endeavor because it offers a case study as to the importance of collaboration between artists and researchers, while demonstrating the importance of the arts in the mission and strategic plan of georgia tech. 
 ""we recognize that the arts are critical to championing innovation and creativity at georgia tech,"" said shackelford. ""our mission is to develop leaders who advance technology and improve the human condition. the arts - and artists - provide a vital avenue for pursuing this work. this project illuminates the impact of artists and researchers coming together to mutually inspire and learn from each other, while inviting audiences to participate in the discussions about their discoveries."" 
 ""as a director coming from an arts / dance background and facilitator to this project, i have become fascinated with the work of the scientists during the conceiving / creation process and how this gets interwoven into the choreography and dancers' bodies,"" said john welker, tmbt's artistic director. ""in any collaboration, there are surprises that are part of my joy for discovery, but this particular process has made me so much more aware and appreciative of the intimate connection between our minds' intention and how that is carried out through the movement of our bodies."" 
 this friday will be more than a dance performance. it will also include talks from the researchers involved in the project and opportunities for audience to ask questions. rozell will discuss his work on ai and its applications in treating depression. 
 chethan pandarinath , assistant professor in the 
 wallace h. coulter department of biomedical engineering at emory university and georgia tech , will talk about his ai research and how the brain controls movement. they'll be joined by karen rommelfanger, director of emory's neuroethics program. 
 rommelfanger knows the field of neuroscience can introduce complex words and concepts. when mixed with dance, however, she sees the project as a powerful opportunity for audiences to engage with multiple modalities of sensation and comprehension. 
 ""i believe neuroscience brings great hope and promise for humanity. but my fear is that the promise of the field will be undermined by a deterioration of trust related to a real and hyped threats of unconsidered ways neuroscience might interface with individuals and society,"" said rommelfanger."" my hope is that this project will invite audiences, including myself, to challenge and surface our unspoken values and assumptions about the brain and technologies that interface with it."" 
 friday's event starts at 8pm at the 
 ferst center for the arts . 
 tickets are just $10 . the full work, which is made possible in part through a grant from the charles loridans foundation, will premiere on campus next fall. 
 ""i'm excited to see how something as abstract as the concepts in neuroscience, neurotechnology, and neuroethics can be translated into dance,"" rozell said. ""as a researcher, we can get really caught up in the technical details. i can't wait to see how those details turn into an overall impression that is both beautiful and gives us a new way to think about what we do.""

ai4opt-sets-stage-future-engineers-and-leaders-through-seth-bonder-camp.txt,"ai4opt sets stage for future engineers and leaders through seth bonder camp 
 the seth bonder camp is part of ai4opt's mission to inspire young georgians to pursue stem. 
 sep 15, 2022 
 - atlanta, ga 
 when alexandria sweeny, better known as alex, considered what she wanted to accomplish before graduating from drew charter school, the then high school junior set two goals: complete her engineering internship and make a positive impact. 
 she did both while strengthening her coding knowledge during her time as a camper and mentor at the seth bonder camp in computational and data science for engineering (sbc). 
 ""i did it when it was fully virtual, and it was definitely an experience,"" said sweeny who spent a week being introduced to computing and data science where she performed virtual activities, last june. 
 the camp, which is offered either as an online course or on-campus summer camp at georgia tech, is designed to build students' problem-solving and analytical skills while furthering their interest in computer science as a potential career. it is also part of ai4opt's mission to inspire young georgians to pursue stem (science, technology, engineering and mathematics). 
 ai4opt hosted its first in-person summer camp at georgia tech in june. the camp brought together 60 students from schools across georgia including drew charter, banneker high school, and westlake high school. 
 sweeny was asked to return to this particular camp-but this time, as a mentor. 
 ""of course, i said yes, because it was something fun that i could do over the summer preparing for college without it being too hefty,"" said sweeny. ""it was something that i felt prepared for from attending the camp."" 
 responses like sweeny's motivates sbc site managers like reem khir to introduce more bright minds to the camp centered around computer programming logic, programming language for ai, and teamwork. 
 ""we expose them [high school students] to certain types of education areas like twitter analysis, how to solve a sudoku, and even computational biology, if they wanted to consider a career in biology,"" said khir, who joined the camp last year to help students with assignments. this year, she took on even bigger leadership role by maintaining and observing two camps and facilitating 50 students and seven teaching assistants (tas). she worked under a ‘student to student and student to ta' interactive structure so that each participant took away a useful skill in data science. 
 ""it's the time where high school students start forming opinions and decisions about the career path they want to pursue,"" said khir. ""the steppingstone is their college education, and we can help students in that period."" 
 ai4opt will acquire and advance seth bonder camp 
 ai4opt is working to adopt a short-term system used to track students after the camp. the institute wants to build up the system to see majors, colleges, and career paths each student has vowed to pursue before they head off to college or the workforce. 
 ""this is a critical period for students,"" said khir. ""it's a time where students start thinking about a major for college and later impacting the next 20 or 30 years of their life. being a part of that is very unique in terms of creating a positive influence in the next generation."" 
 ai4opt is taking the lead over the sbc to offer the initiative more organizational support as the program has seen tremendous growth and has become a much broader initiative. the seth bonder foundation, which first introduced the camp to those ages 10-18, will continue to fund the camp now more targeted towards high school students interested in engineering, but do not have access to computer science and / or data science in their middle and high schools. 
 ""a lot of the different communities are not exposed to this and may never see this opportunity. the seth bonder camp exposes high school students to ai opportunities and gives them skills to successfully enter the field of stem with confidence,"" said professor pascal van hentenryck, who's brought his data sciences skills and knowledge to georgia tech and leads both ai4opt and the sbc. 
 ai4opt is in transition to lead the sbc to offer more organizational support as the program sees tremendous growth. the research institute will expand the longitudinal camps to engage middle and high school students in these topics, while also bringing ai education and research programs to hbcu's and hispanic-serving colleges throughout the nation, addressing the widening gap in job opportunities. 
 though sweeny has transitioned away from coding and transcended into research, she never stopped setting goals even now as a first-year biomedical engineering major at georgia tech. 
 ""do anything you can to take it [the sbc] even if you don't want to go into coding,"" said sweeny. ""it is a good way to meet new people learn new skills, it is something that you don't necessarily have to have a love for coding to have to do it.""

 - atlanta, ga 
 black soldier fly larvae devour food waste and other organic matter and are made of 60% protein, making them an attractive sustainable food source in agriculture. but increasingly, black soldier larvae are dying before they reach livestock facilities as animal feed. 
 georgia tech researchers, recognizing the culprit is the collective heat generated when the maggots eat in crowded conditions, have found that delivering the right amount of airflow could help solve the overheating issue. their findings were published this month in 
 frontiers in physics 
 as part of a special issue on the 
 ""physics of social interactions."" 
 ""black soldier fly larvae are widely used in an emerging food-recycling industry. the idea is to feed the larvae with food waste and then turn them into chicken feed,"" explained first author hungtang ko, a ph.d. student in the 
 george w. woodruff school of mechanical engineering .  ""these larvae make a great candidate for this process because they eat just about everything."" 
 each year humans waste more than one billion tons of food, or a third of all food production, and many countries are running out of options for disposing of this waste. 
 the larvae thrive in and around compost piles, where their larvae help break down organic material, from rotten produce to animal remains and manure. black soldier fly larvae commonly grow to about 1,000 times their size, noted david hu, professor in the school of mechanical engineering. 
 ""it's like going from the size of a person to the size of a big truck,"" he said of the larvae's growth from eggs to adults. 
 hu has appeared on 
 science friday 
 graphically showing the voracious appetite of black soldier fly larvae, which can eat twice their body mass in food per day. but when these maggots feed while tightly packed in container bins, they generate metabolic heat that collectively can turn lethal for them. 
 air flow matters 
 ko and hu collaborated with daniel goldman, dunn family professor in the 
 school of physics , to set up the experiments. goldman uses fluidized beds -widely used in industrial applications like oil refining ― to control properties of granular media in animal and robot locomotion studies. fluidized beds operate by forcing a vertical flow of fluid through a collection of particulate matter; above a certain flow rate, the grains transition from a solid pile to a fluid-like arrangement, where they collide and jostle. 
 the researchers placed the larvae in a container subjected to regular air flow at a consistent temperature. they then attached a leaf blower to supply air flow into the chamber, manually ramping up and down the air speed in five-minute trials. 
 because of the larvae's constant activity, the collectives' behavior under air fluidization differs from what is observed in traditional fluidized beds: larvae were un-jammable when air flow became low. instead, they behave like a fluid that adapted and adjusted to external forces. 
 ""an interesting aspect of this work is that it probes a regime of ‘active matter,' which has received less attention from physicists: instead of 3d swarms composed of widely separated, non-colliding flying birds and insects, our `swarm' exists in another regime, where animals are packed tightly together,"" goldman said. 
 in a second experiment, the team used x-ray imaging and constant air speed to see how fast larvae eat. specifically, ko measured the average velocity and pressure of the larvae, as well as how much food they ate under various airflow speeds. 
 ""as you continue to increase the flow, you'll reach a point where all the larvae are flying [through the air]. the airflow is too fast, and they won't eat well,"" he said. 
 optimal air velocity will ensure the larvae are cooled off properly and can still feed effectively. ""probing optimal flow velocity will be a good next step. also, from an engineering perspective, we need to consider other ways that we can cool the larvae down, including using heat transfer,"" he added. 
 the results indicated that as larvae are agitated by rapid flows, the insects are more likely to be suspended in mid-air without contacting the food, suggesting that a moderate flow rate would be optimal for feeding dense groups of larvae. 
 the researchers also hope this work will enable black soldier fly larvae to be more readily available as recyclers of food waste, which totals 
 1.3 billion tons per year , according to the food and agriculture organization of the united nations. but just as important is the potential of these protein-rich insects to reduce the carbon effects of feeding animals. global food production contributes more than 17 billion metric tons of human-made greenhouse gas emissions every year, according to a study published in september in 
 nature food . animal-based foods produce more than twice the emissions of plant-based food, the study found. 
 ""there's no sustainable protein source for the animals that we eat,"" noted ko. ""the black soldier fly larvae could play a role in reducing the environmental impact of feeding these animals.""

 jan 20, 2022 
 - atlanta, ga 
 today, airbnb announced it selected the interlock at 14 th  street and howell mill road in atlanta's west midtown as the new home for its planned technical hub. 
 the tech hub is slated to open later this year - subject to pandemic conditions. it follows airbnb's 2020  announcement of its plans to open a technical hub in atlanta  to serve as the home for one of its product development teams, the regional base for new technical and non-technical roles over time, and the first step in a broader commitment to a long-term presence in metro atlanta. 
 ""with the opening of our atlanta tech hub, we hope to create many new high-skilled jobs over time and further expand our commitment to serving all stakeholders in airbnb's diverse community: hosts, guests, communities, employees, and shareholders,"" said dave stephenson, chief financial officer at airbnb. ""atlanta emerged as the perfect choice for our new tech hub because of its strong educational infrastructure and institutions committed to supporting communities of color."" 
 the space airbnb has leased in the mixed-use interlock complex is managed by georgia advanced technology ventures (gatv), an affiliate of the georgia institute of technology. gatv acquires and develops properties near the campus that addresses both georgia tech's academic needs and that of technology companies interested in tapping into its research innovations and student talent.  t. dallas smith & company , the nation's largest african american-owned, pure tenant rep, commercial real estate brokerage firm, represented airbnb in its search. 
 ""atlanta is and always will be open to business, innovation and attracting talent,"" said atlanta mayor andre dickens, a georgia tech alum. ""this investment is a vote of confidence in the strength of our tech industry and atlanta's existing talent. we welcome airbnb's new tech hub and i look forward to working together to create a pipeline of technical jobs and economic opportunities for our residents."" 
 committed to the next generation 
 as part of its recruitment and hiring efforts, airbnb is constantly innovating and creating new programs to provide local candidates of all backgrounds and experience levels opportunities to join the company. with the opening of the atlanta tech hub, airbnb will continue its work in developing community partnerships in the city to expand entrepreneurship and create pathways for atlanta residents to pursue careers in technology. this work builds on airbnb's existing partnerships with the naacp, the russell center for innovation and entrepreneurship (rice), tech bridge, and others in the atlanta community. 
 supporting the atlanta community 
 airbnb is a tool for economic empowerment, providing a path to entrepreneurship for atlanta residents and helping local families pay their bills by sharing their homes. in the first nine months of 2021, airbnb brought more than 500,000 total guest arrivals into atlanta and 1.7 million to georgia. since 2010, airbnb hosts in georgia have  earned a total of $1.2 billion , and home sharing has served as a source of income for more than 40,000 hosts across the state. some 56 percent of hosts in atlanta self-identify as women, and 35 percent are families. 
 most hosts on airbnb are everyday people sharing the homes in which they live, and the typical host earns $9,600 each year. according to a survey of airbnb's u.s. host community, 42 percent said the money they earned on the online lodging marketplace's platform helped them stay in their homes. one quarter of atlanta hosts said either they or someone in their household experienced a pay cut or lost work hours in 2020 because of the pandemic; 18 percent said they lost their jobs or were laid off themselves or lived with someone who did. 
 airbnb guest spending also supports local businesses.  oxford economics research  found that in 2019, airbnb guest spending in atlanta supported 3,400 jobs, including 1,200 in the restaurant industry. almost 40 percent of guests said saving money on their accommodations by staying at an airbnb listing allowed them to spend more on other goods or services in atlanta. 
 ""we are committed to being a long-term partner to the city of atlanta,"" stephenson said, ""and look forward to continuing our work with local leaders as they promote entrepreneurship and tourism recovery.""

 al vivian, a national diversity and inclusion facilitator and son of civil rights leader c.t. vivian, was the keynote speaker for the race at georgia tech: a call to action conversation on thursday, jan. 21. the virtual discussion was the second in a series of campus discussions on race. 
 ""talking about issues of race and racism is hard,"" said vice president for institute diversity, equity, and inclusion archie ervin during the conversation. ""over the past year, in the wake of last summer's national racial turmoil, marked by the sensless killings of george floyd, breonna taylor, ahmaud arbery and others, and more recently, the events in our nation's capitol earlier this month, have made these converrsations even more difficult as concerns about racism and its impact have intensified and continues to bubble to the surface of our national discourse."" 
 vivian heads basic diversity inc., a national full-service cultural diversity training and consulting firm best known for its race awareness workshop. his father, a confidant of martin luther king jr., founded the organization more than 45 years ago. the firm has worked with a diverse range of clients and organizations including corporations, nonprofits and, government agencies. 
 ""i'll start off with a statement that is just outright true: racism in america is nothing new; it's our original sin. it's been with us from the beginning,"" vivian said, beginning his presentation. ""if you don't understand race, your future success will be limited.""

 amazon and georgia tech have announced a music remix competition using coding. 
 nov 20, 2019 
 - atlanta, ga 
 amazon has announced a new addition to its amazon future engineer program - a  music remix competition  that teaches students how to write code that makes music. alongside georgia tech and their learn-to-code-through music platform, earsketch, participating high school students have the opportunity to win prizes by composing an original remix featuring original music stems from grammy award winning singer / songwriter  ciara  and her song, ""set"" from her latest album  beauty marks . the competition is intended to uniquely activate young people to try computer science and coding. all high school students across the country are encouraged to  enter  the competition now through january 20 th . teaching guides are available for teachers to bring the competition to their classroom, or as part of their introductory computer science curriculum. 
 students will use computer science and coding to build their remix using musical samples from ciara's song ""set,"" as well as other sounds from the earsketch library. students will learn looping (repeating) to extend the length of their song, use strings to create new beats, create custom functions representing different song sections, and learn to upload their own sounds to the earsketch library. 
 ""we are excited to support the innovative and unique work georgia tech and earsketch are pioneering to give students across the country more access to computer science, coding, and music,"" said jeff wilke, ceo worldwide consumer, amazon. ""this competition will give thousands of students from underserved and underrepresented communities the opportunity to try something new and fun. it will build their confidence and, most importantly, encourage them to think creatively."" 
 students and teachers can learn more about the competition details at  www.amazonfutureengineer.com / earsketch  - all high school students are encouraged to participate, either in class or on their own. the top three student winners will each receive an all-expenses-paid trip to amazon's headquarters in seattle, washington to be an ""amazon future engineer"" for the day. additional winners will receive a presonus audiobox 96 studio and amazon.com gift cards. the competition opens today and will close on monday, january 20 at 11:59pm est. 
 the bureau of labor statistics projects that by 2020 there will be 1.4 million computer-science-related jobs available and only 400,000 computer science graduates with the skills to apply for those jobs. computer science is the fastest-growing profession within the science, technology, engineering and math (stem) field, but only 8% of stem graduates earn a computer science degree, with a small percentage from underserved backgrounds. in multiple research studies, students using the earsketch platform significantly increased their positive attitudes towards computing and their intentions to persist in computing, with particularly significant impacts on students from groups historically underrepresented in the field. female students expressed even greater gains in computing confidence, motivation, and identity as compared to their male counterparts. 
 ""music and coding are both highly prevalent today, but coding is less apparent-earsketch provides an amazing way to experience these creative disciplines simultaneously,"" said dr. roxanne moore, senior research engineer at georgia tech and project lead for the remix competition. 
 ""we know that creativity is the key to success in both music and computer science,"" said professor jason freeman, chair of the school of music at georgia tech and co-creator of the earsketch platform. ""we're thrilled to partner with amazon to support more students as they unlock their creative potential through earsketch."" 
 to date, more than 375,000 students in all 50 states and over 100 countries have used earsketch. programs like earsketch serve georgia tech's mission to meet the demand for stem (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) professionals by opening the eyes of more students to these engaging and important subjects. 
 launched in november 2018, amazon future engineer is a four-part childhood-to-career program intended to inspire, educate, and prepare children and young adults from underrepresented and underserved communities to pursue careers in the fast-growing field of computer science. each year,  amazon future engineer  aims to inspire millions of kids to explore computer science; provides over 100,000 young people in over 2,000 high schools access to intro or ap computer science courses; awards 100 students with four-year $10,000 scholarships, as well as offers guaranteed and paid amazon internships to gain work experience. amazon future engineer is part of amazon's $50 million investment in computer science / stem education. in addition, amazon future engineer has donated more than $10 million to organizations that promote computer science / stem education across the country.

 georgia tech will hold a series of events on september 13 to honor ambassador young's lifelong dedication to civil and human rights. 
 andrew j. young will receive the 2018 ivan allen jr. prize for social courage in recognition of his lifelong dedication to civil and human rights. 
 jul 24, 2018 
 - atlanta, ga 
 andrew j. young will receive the 
 ivan allen jr. prize for social courage , georgia institute of technology president g.p. ""bud"" peterson announced today. 
 young's lifelong dedication to public service and civil and human rights helped changed the course of history. 
 he was a key strategist and negotiator during the civil rights campaigns that led to the passage of the civil rights act of 1964 and the voting rights act of 1965. when he was elected to congress in 1972 he was the first african-american representative from the deep south since reconstruction. president carter appointed him as ambassador to the united nations in 1977, making him the first african-american to hold that position. young later returned to atlanta, becoming mayor and leading the effort to bring the olympics to the city. 
 today the ordained minister continues to champion efforts to end poverty and hunger worldwide and works to support the next generation of visionary leaders. his life demonstrates how religion, education, politics and activism can be combined in ways to support the public good. 
 ""it doesn't take courage when you know something is right,"" young said. ""it takes determination and you see a vision and commit to it and you risk your life and your future."" 
 the ivan allen prize honors those who demonstrate leadership to improve the human condition despite personal risks and challenges. 
 young was born in new orleans and attended segregated schools. he first became active in the civil rights movement as a pastor in southern georgia in the 1950s. he organized voter registration drives and didn't back down when faced with death threats. later he became a close confidant of martin luther king jr. and was instrumental in organizing desegregation efforts across the south. 
 as an ambassador he advocated for human rights on a global scale and helped negotiate an end to white-majority rule in namibia and zimbabwe. 
 during his two terms as mayor of atlanta, young laid the foundation for the city's present-day international reputation. he attracted new businesses and billions in private investment, and worked to develop hartsfield international airport. 
 young has long had connections to georgia tech as well. he was a commencement speaker in december 2010, and the following year he returned to campus to participate in the first-year reading project. 
 young will be honored during a series of events, scheduled for september 13 at the biltmore, in georgia tech's technology square. planned activities include a town hall discussion for students. details about how to register will be provided closer to the event. 
 ""as a confidant and advisor at a young age to martin luther king jr., andrew young has earned his place in history as a giant of the american civil rights movement, but his efforts to build a more just world extend far beyond our borders and that historical era,"" georgia tech president g.p. ""bud"" peterson said. ""his eloquent advocacy for human rights as the u.s. ambassador to the united nations helped cement his visionary legacy around the world, and he continues his tireless, compassionate work to improve the lot of the world's challenged communities through his atlanta-based andrew j. young foundation. as a successor to ivan allen jr. in the atlanta mayor's chair, it's altogether fitting that he will be honored as the 2018 winner of the ivan allen jr. prize for social courage."" 
 ivan allen was yong's mentor in urban affairs. young described him as a person with a vision for creating sustainable urban futures. 
 ""georgia tech students are blessed to be in this city because i think we are the city of the future, not that we have accomplished everything now, but that all of the basic ingredients of an amazing future are here in our midst,"" young said. ""we have a kind of courage and vision that really is necessary for global transformation of the urban environment. so, the thing that has sustained me is the experience that everything we have believed in looked difficult when they were conceived."" 
 the ivan allen jr. prize in social courage honors the people behind the efforts to improve the human condition. the award is named for former atlanta mayor ivan allen jr. and funded in perpetuity by a grant from the wilbur and hilda glenn family foundation. recipients are awarded a $100,000 stipend. 
 the inaugural prize was awarded in march 2011 to former senator sam nunn. past recipients include jimmy and rosalynn carter, u.s. rep. john lewis and humanitarian activist nancy parrish.

 - atlanta, ga 
 esteemed activist, author, and educator angela davis delivered a virtual keynote address at georgia tech's 2021 black history month lecture on feb. 10. a pioneer in international civil rights and black feminist movements, davis has been a prominent figure for decades, working as an academic and authoring more than 10 books on race, class, gender, prison abolition, and the criminalization of marginalized communities. 
 the lecture was seen by more than 1,700 unique viewers. 
 ""we are thankful to carter g. woodson for initiating the observance in 1926 of what was then called negro history week,"" she opened, referring to the historian and one of the first scholars to study african american history. woodson became known as the ""father of black history."" ""this week is precisely the week we would be celebrating [negro history week] in those days."" 
 decades later, black history month became, in davis' words, ""the 28 days that are allocated to us to reflect not only on the contributions of black people, but on the meaning of the phenomenal collective struggle for freedom that stretches back to the days when the first africans were forcefully brought to the americas."" 
 she was born in birmingham, alabama, in 1944, growing up in the infamous ""dynamite hill"" neighborhood, which gained its name from frequent bombings to drive out middle-class black residents in the 1950s and 1960s, including the 16 th 
 street baptist church bombing that killed four girls in 1963. davis attended segregated schools but reflected on the resilience her early upbringing and surroundings afforded her, saying, ""even as we boldly challenged racial segregation, i later came to understand what a gift it was to be able to grow up in a community that realized that resistance was at the core of our visions of new futures. we learned how to resist not so much as a choice, not as an extracurricular activity, but rather as a condition of life - as a condition of our collective conviction that we would someday be free."" 
 after completing high school in new york (via a program that placed black students from the south into integrated schools in the north), she would go on to study at brandeis university in boston; the sorbonne in paris; the university of frankfurt in germany; and the university of california, san diego. in 1969, she received a doctorate in philosophy from humboldt university in what was then east berlin. 
 davis noted the critical role that black women have played in advancing civil rights in the u.s., beginning with early suffrage movements. ""especially because i am speaking virtually here at georgia tech in atlanta, i want to pay tribute to stacey abrams,"" the 2018 georgia democratic nominee for governor and the first black woman of a major political party to win a gubernatorial nomination. through her voting rights advocacy, abrams is largely credited with helping president joseph biden jr. win the state of georgia in the 2020 presidential election and for delivering two democratic georgia senate seats in january. ""there's been a long history of black women not only saving the black community but saving the country."" 
 the lecture, sponsored by institute diversity, equity, and inclusion and the georgia tech african american student union (aasu), included a question-and-answer session moderated by aasu members shelbe johnson and kemuel russell. 
 viewers asked davis several questions on criminal justice reform. a common theme throughout much of her scholarly work has been the social issues associated with incarceration and the criminalization of communities hardest hit by poverty and racism. she rose to national prominence in 1970 for her arrest - and subsequent acquittal - in a high-profile criminal case for which she spent 18 months in jail and on trial after being placed on the fbi's ten most wanted fugitives list. in 1997, she helped found critical resistance, which aims to dismantle prison systems worldwide. 
 her teaching career has taken her to san francisco state university and the university of california, berkeley. she also has taught at the university of california, los angeles (ucla), vassar college, syracuse university, and stanford university. most recently she spent 15 years at the university of california santa cruz, where she is now a distinguished professor emerita of history of consciousness and of feminist studies. 
 ""i was hired to teach at ucla in 1969,"" she said, but before she could teach, she was fired for being a member of the communist party. ""when i think back on the campaign to save my job, i had an enormous amount of support, including from white students and white faculty. what i attempted to do was to develop what we might call an intersectional approach. i was at the same time involved in campaigns to free political prisoners - campaigns against racism against prisoners,"" davis continued, while describing herself as a prison abolitionist rather than a prison reformer. ""i took the position that people who supported me and my right to teach at ucla should also support people in prisons who were facing far worse forms of oppression because of their political beliefs."" 
 davis will return to teach at ucla this spring, but noted her slight disdain for the fanfare her return has already brought to the campus. ""i don't want to be accepted. i still want to make trouble - i like john lewis' notion of ‘good trouble,'"" a nod to the late civil rights giant and georgia congressman. ""so whereas i am going to be teaching at ucla again, i will continue to critique the institution, call out the racism, point to the heteropatriarchy, and point to their support of capitalist systems."" 
 davis paused when asked a final question about how black people can best handle racial trauma. 
 ""for so long, we haven't acknowledged racial trauma. i think what is exciting about this current era is that so many people are taking holistic approaches, teaching us how to make sense of these issues. it's important how you incorporate acknowledgment of people's trauma into the very work of organizing against racism. 
 ""since this is the last question, i just want to point out that we can't let up. we can't stop. we should recognize that this is the time that the real work is getting done.""

apollo-11-one-giant-leap-scientific-discovery.txt,"apollo 11: one giant leap for scientific discovery 
 a group of georgia tech researchers, and an alumnus with a front-row seat to history, remember apollo 11. 
 jul 19, 2019 
 - atlanta, ga 
 for those who were around at the time, it was history forever burned into their memories, with the roar from a rocket as tall as a skyscraper and 11 scratchy-sounding words uttered from the surface of the moon. 
 for those people, as well as those born after july 20, 1969, the 50th anniversary of the 
 apollo 11 moon landing 
 is a chance to loudly celebrate the advances in science and technology created by the space program. 
 ""the money was well spent, and we should do it again,"" says 
 bob mcdonald , a georgia tech alumnus who, as a young engineer for a nasa contractor, worked on the engines in that saturn v rocket that lifted astronauts neil armstrong, buzz aldrin, and michael collins into space on july 16,1969. 
 armstrong and aldrin piloted their lunar lander to the moon's surface on july 20, 1969. later that day, armstrong became the first man on the moon. as he stepped off the lander, he told an estimated tv audience of a half-billion, ""that's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind."" 
 those memories will flood back on saturday, july 20, 50 years to the day since that moment in history. we asked some georgia tech college of sciences researchers - and an alumnus with a special connection to that day - their thoughts on how apollo 11 and the space program impacted the cause of science and technology in the u.s. 
 bob mcdonald 
 he's 83 years old and enrolled in the 
 online master of science in analytics 
 program, making him georgia tech's oldest graduate student, according to 
 georgia tech professional education . this will be his fourth degree from tech. he already has a b.s. in 
 chemical engineering 
 ('57) and a masters ('61) and ph.d. ('66) in 
 nuclear engineering . mcdonald had a unique front-row seat for the apollo program. 
 ""i was a brand new engineer working for 
 rocketdyne , who had a contract to manufacture the j2 engines for the saturn rocket.  there were five j2s on the saturn second stage to get into earth orbit.  a single j2 powered the third stage to the moon and back. 
 ""the j2 was a new, liquid hydrogen- and liquid oxygen-fueled engine. to prevent the rocket exhaust from melting the engine, liquid hydrogen was pumped through small tubes down to the end of the engine bell, then back up to the combustion chamber for burning.  my job was to do the heat transfer and flow calculations for the hydrogen in those tubes to make sure temperatures would be within design limits. this was prior to engine testing when the temperatures could be measured directly. when the engine was tested and performed correctly, my job was finished. 
 ""one interesting thing about the [apollo] project was that we already knew all the science and math needed for success. we knew where the moon was, how far we had to travel, how long it would take, and how much energy was required.  what we did not have was any of the hardware, the machinery, or equipment necessary to make the trip.  developing, testing, and learning to use the necessary equipment was a job for the engineers.  engineering and science are like one pair of gloves, and both benefitted. at the end of the project the united states was stronger, more prosperous, and wiser than when it began. the money was well spent, and we should do it again."" 
 ""the money was well spent, and we should do it again.""

 school of earth and atmospheric sciences , 
 glass  was a 
 nasa astrobiology 
 postdoctoral fellow at the 
 california institute of technology 
 from 2011 to 2013. her research area is biogeochemistry. 
 ""the moon gives the earth tides and stabilizes our climate by preventing the planet's tilt from changing more than a few degrees. but until the apollo program, we didn't know exactly how old the moon was or what it was made of. a major achievement of the apollo program was reconstruction of the timeline of the moon's formation. these data came from measurements of the isotopic composition of rock samples that apollo 11 astronauts collected on the moon 50 years ago this month. one of these scientists was my academic grandfather (my ph.d. advisor's ph.d. advisor), the late 
 gerald wasserburg , who ran a lab at caltech called the ‘lunatic asylum'. 
 ""perhaps the most important emblem of the apollo program was the iconic photo of earth rising over the lunar horizon, captured by apollo 8 astronaut 
 william anders . the 
 earthrise photo 
 profoundly changed human consciousness. that image made people realize how special our own planet is - a pale blue dot against the vastness of space. it ushered in the environmental awareness of the 1970s.""

 $100,000 nasa grant 
 to research how math could help make space travel less costly and more efficient. 
 ""when the moon landing happened, i was a kid in spain. like everybody else in the world, i was deeply moved and full of admiration. 
 ""the moon landing changed the vision we had of our planet and of our species. it was technology impacting on religion and philosophy, not just on everyday life, from gps, and mobile cameras to wireless technology. 
 the moon landing also changed politics; it showed that big democratic and united organizations, where ideas percolate up and down, are more efficient than rigid ones. it was an accomplishment that made the whole world reflect.""

 ""the apollo program accelerated rocket technology and space science for years to come, not only in the u.s. but around the globe. the feats achieved by the whole team inspired a generation of young people into stem fields, fascinated by the depths of space. the advancements in rockets led to many space telescopes and planetary probes in decades to come. 
 ""the discoveries by nasa telescopes and probes partly motivated me to pursue astrophysics as a career. as an 80's kid, i lingered over pictures of the gas giant planets sent back by the voyager spacecraft. 
 ""a decade later, the 
 hubble space telescope 
 gave us images of galaxies across the universe. many other scientists have told me that they had similar formative memories of nasa missions. without the apollo program pushing the limits of humankind, these space science missions might have not been possible in the 20th century.""

 are you a georgia tech graduate student interested in pursuing your own research opportunity that links science, technology, and innovation to economic development? 
 the science, technology, and innovation policy (stip) program at georgia tech is now accepting applications for the 2019 georgia innovative economic development internship program. (for details and requirements, apply here:  stip.gatech.edu / apply / ). 
 the highly competitive, 10-week, paid internship is designed to allow graduate students to further develop and pursue research in an innovative economic development project. at the end of the internship period, interns, who will receive a $6,000 stipend, will have an opportunity to present their project findings to economic development and innovation groups. 
 applications will be accepted through feb. 28, 2019 and the internship is open to any graduate student who has completed the first year of a two-year master's program or enrolled in a doctoral program at a public university in the university system of georgia. 
 those accepted into the program will be notified by the end of march 2019. 
 stip is a globally recognized program that conducts research-based policy analyses and reports of innovation policy, science, and technology for organizations and governments domestically and internationally. 
 ""students can delve deeply into their research and apply that analysis and study to real-world challenges,"" said jan youtie, stip program director. 
 ""this is an excellent opportunity for enterprising students who want to explore how their own ideas can have an impact on any number of subject areas ranging from strategic or emerging technologies and economic modeling, to research commercialization and sustainability."" 
 former interns, such as mirit friedman, a graduate student pursuing a master's degree in city and regional planning at georgia tech's school of city & regional planning, say the experience is a rewarding one. 
 her research explored ways the atlanta community food bank could activate its vast partnership network in new ways to better support its clients' economic mobility. 
 ""i was able to explore my research interests under the guidance of economic development experts and restricting the research to the summer period forced me to focus on an initial research question i could test and explore in the short period,"" friedman said, adding the program's pace and structure was invaluable. 
 ""we had to develop our research substantially each week and being held to that pace of research development helped prepare me for the demanding deadlines the workforce expects,"" she said. ""additionally, having my research be pushed in directions i hadn't anticipated required me to respond to and explore new ideas that ultimately helped me hone in on a more explicit research topic."" 
 supraja sudharsan, a doctoral candidate studying comparative urban governance in tech's sam nunn school of international affairs, echoed friedman's sentiments. 
 ""i evaluated the smart city projects that have been piloted, underway or completed in three cities in atlanta, austin, and pittsburgh,"" she said. ""by comparatively studying their plans, initiatives, associated partnerships, and the organizational process involved in their development and implementation, the study served to look beyond the hype of smart cities to understand how cities develop and implement smart city projects. 
 ""the program provided exposure to organizational processes within city government organizations and the challenge of effecting change, which is an area of interest in my doctoral research.""

assessing-california-storms.txt,"assessing the california storms 
 faculty members in georgia tech's school of earth and atmospheric sciences share their expertise following the recent storm in california. 
 atmospheric river over california. image courtesy of noaa 
 feb 08, 2024 
 as californians begin to dry out after a week of near-constant rain, residents are assessing damage from the recent storms. meanwhile, scientists are evaluating the storm itself and reflecting on how it fits into the larger landscape of weather events. 
 parts of california 
 received 10 to 15 inches of rainfall in a day 
 - the amount they might usually get in a season. many areas experienced mudslides, landslides, flooding, power outages, and other issues. 
 ""it's not uncommon to see increased precipitation during the winter in california,"" said 
 zachary handlos , senior academic professional in the school of earth and atmospheric sciences. ""the problem is when it's too much at once, which is exactly what happened."" 
 an atmospheric river, as it is called, is a weather phenomenon that transports water moisture from the ocean toward land areas following relatively narrow paths. as 
 annalisa bracco 
 said, most of these are harmless and useful. in an el niño year, though, the ocean is warmer than usual, and more moisture is carried in the atmosphere. 
 ""is this event exceptional? yes and no. it is not the strongest recorded, but it's up there among the very strong,"" said bracco, professor and associate chair for research in the school of earth and atmospheric sciences. ""the problem is that global warming is poised to make strong atmospheric rivers more common. warming tends also to make the atmosphere more stable, which implies that weather systems evolve more slowly. and this atmospheric river indeed moved slowly, causing more damage."" 
 though california's geography is somewhat unusual in having atmospheric rivers, other areas experience them as well. handlos noted that, though the terminology is not used as often, a similar effect can take place with southwesterly winds from the gulf of mexico toward the atlanta area when impacted by weather systems. 
 both bracco and handlos cautioned against attributing a single event to climate change too quickly but said that the california storm has all the markings of one that was more intense because of warming. ""it is in line with all global warming predictions: more extreme weather events, conducive to both floods and droughts."" 
 as recovery efforts begin, handlos noted that this storm was very much in line with forecasts. but even with preparations, damage can be severe. 
 ""the good news is that it wasn't some sort of day-before surprise, but even with excellent forecasting, you can only do so much to prepare for landslides and flooding,"" he said. ""there are still going to be unfortunate consequences for people in the area, even with preparations."" 
 he expects climatologists will look at the data from this event soon, and for several years to come.

assessing-role-negative-citations-science.txt,"assessing the role of negative citations in science 
 a new study examines the role of negative citations in academic publishing. 
 oct 26, 2015 
 - atlanta, ga 
 the number of times academic articles are cited by subsequent publications is among the time-honored measures used to assess scholarly standing and evaluate academic productivity. but not all of these citations are positive ones, and a paper published this week in the journal 
 proceedings of the national academy of science s finds that as many as one in 50 citations in a top immunology journal were critical in nature. these negative citations may point out limitations, inconsistences or flaws in previous work. the study found that these negative citations were more likely to criticize highly-read papers, and that the criticisms focused on specific sections of the papers. negative citations tended to originate from scholars who were close to the authors of the original articles in academic discipline and social distance - but at least 150 miles away geographically. the research, by authors at the georgia institute of technology, university of toronto and massachusetts institute of technology, may be the first to systematically quantify and examine these negative citations. the authors hope to expand their study to other disciplines, and believe their work could ultimately lead to a re-examination of how citations are used in academia. ""given that we rely so heavily on these citation metrics as measures of quality, it's important to note that the intent of these citations isn't homogeneous,"" said alexander oettl, an assistant professor in georgia tech's 
 scheller college of business 
 and one of the study's three co-authors. ""criticism is really the cornerstone of the scientific enterprise, yet it's difficult to get accurate measures of the extent to which criticism of academic papers truly occurs. the negative citations really are different from objective citations."" the researchers, who also include nicola lacetera from the university of toronto and christian catalini from mit, began with 15,731 full-text articles that had been published in the 
 journal of immunology , the top academic journal in that field. from those articles, they extracted 762,355 citations, which referred to 146,891 unique published papers. beginning with a manual process, they created a set of citations that was used to train a natural language processing program which classified the remainder of the citations as either objective or negative. the process identified 18,304 negative citations, about 2.4 percent of the total citations studied. ""the majority of these negative citations appear to take issue with the ‘results' and ‘discussion' sections of the papers, so they are really not attempting to overturn theory,"" said oettl. ""they can be attempting to constrain results, note inconsistencies with other research, point out statistical flaws or correct other issues."" in their study, the authors point out the relative rarity of these negative citations, and speculate that they could either demonstrate a ""limited, uninfluential role"" for criticism in science - or show a hesitancy to criticize. ""making these negative citations isn't without cost,"" oettl noted. ""there could be reputational harm from making these negative citations, and if your criticism turns out to be false, this could heavily impact your reputation within the field. without this cost, perhaps we might see more overt criticism appearing in the journals."" the researchers found that while negative citations tended to come from scientists close to the narrow academic topic, the criticism was more likely to involve geographic distance. ""we see that the probability of making a negative citation is much, much lower if you are co-located with the scientist whose work is being critiqued,"" oettl said. ""that potentially speaks to the social component, the social cost of criticism - you don't want to criticize someone you may run into on campus. another possible interpretation is that these issues may be aired face-to-face among scientists who are located near each other geographically."" in the study, frequently-cited papers were more likely than less-read papers to get negative citations, which stands to reason, oettl said. ""these are typically more influential papers, so this may have more to do with more people reading them and more of an incentive for scholars to take issue with important papers,"" he explained. ""furthermore, less important papers may receive less scrutiny, as pointing out limitations and shortcomings of trivial work will not drastically shift the scientific frontier."" replication of previous work helps ensure the accuracy of research, and criticism of published studies can lead to correction that makes science more robust. but does the current scientific publishing system encourage enough discussion? ""the pessimistic view is that only one in 50 citations is negative in nature, so possibly there isn't as much debate as we would want for a healthy discussion,"" oettl said. ""but on the other hand, by the time a major manuscript makes it into print, it has undergone a tremendous amount of criticism. we now have some evidence of the extent to which criticism, in the form of negative citations, occurs within scientific manuscripts."" the researchers chose immunology because they had access to the papers, which were consistent in format. they found similar numbers of negative citations in a small set of mathematics-related papers, but hope to expand their work to determine if their findings apply to other disciplines. ultimately, they hope the work could change the way citations are used in science. ""we wanted to put forward a methodology to help future scholars think about how we can possibly expand this classification infrastructure and attract additional metadata to the citations that we make,"" oettl said. ""our paper is very descriptive, but it identifies something that nobody has really demonstrated before: that these negative citations behave very differently from others."" though the current study focused on a single discipline, immunology, ""we would really like to see this work and methodology expanded to other disciplines,"" oettl said. ""ultimately, though, we care about what role these negative citations play in aiding scientific debate and in the advancement of the scientific frontier."" the paper was published october 26 in the journal's early edition. citation : christian catalini, nicola lacetera, alexander oettl, ""beyond citation counts: exploring negative citations in science,"" (proceedings of the national academy of sciences, 2015).

astrobiology-rising-georgia-tech-0.txt,"astrobiology rising at georgia tech 
 the growing visibility of researchers interested in astrobiology is helping georgia tech emerge as a powerhouse in the field. 
 nov 01, 2017 
 - atlanta, ga 
 in the ford environmental science and technology building, the office of martha grover is three doors from that of jennifer glass. both are georgia tech scientists doing research related to astrobiology - life in the cosmos - but until last year they hardly talked to each other as researchers with common interests. 
 ""we are all so busy,"" says 
 grover , a professor in the school of chemical and biomolecular engineering, a scientific collaborator at the 
 nsf / nasa center for chemical evolution (cce) , and a member of the 
 center for space technology and research (c-star) . 
 now, grover, 
 glass , and others at tech are members of a growing community that's coalescing astrobiology activities across campus. in a public debut of sorts, six members of 
 georgia tech astrobiology , as the community calls itself, participated in 
 the 2017 dragon con , the premier pop-culture convention on science fiction and fantasy. they wowed the audience, not by fiction or fantasy or over-the-top costumes, but by progress in answering fundamental questions - how did life begin? where else could life exist? - happening right next door from the meeting venue, at georgia tech. 
 the growing visibility of researchers interested in astrobiology is helping georgia tech emerge as a powerhouse in the field. at minimum, says 
 kenneth knoespel , a historian of science and professor in the ivan allen college of liberal arts, ""it affirms the importance of this community at georgia tech and the importance of astrobiology as a new configuration of disciplines that brings together the natural and human sciences."" 
 teeming with talent 
 ""georgia tech is clearly recognized as a hub for astrobiology and maybe the one that's growing the most quickly,"" says 
 edward goolish , the deputy director of the 
 nasa astrobiology institute 
 (nai), one of the six elements of the nasa astrobiology program. people at georgia tech, goolish adds, ""have been generous with their time and have contributed in important ways when nasa has reached out to the science community for input."" 
 the community includes physicists, chemists, biologists, earth and planetary scientists, and engineers, as well as historians of science and writers. the scientists are figuring out how life emerged and evolved to the biosphere we know, inventing instruments to detect life outside earth, and searching for other habitable places in the universe. the science historians and writers are witnessing science in the making and perhaps gathering fodder for the next volume of science fiction. 
 broadly defined, astrobiology is the study of life in the cosmos. its central questions are ""what is the origin of life?"" and ""does life exist beyond earth?"" humans have asked these questions since time immemorial. that they are still around attests to the difficulty of discovering and assembling the pieces of a formidable puzzle: the emergence of a biosphere on a planet. 
 how formidable? according to 
 eric smith , a theoretician in the 
 nasa astrobiology institute's team at georgia tech 
 (nai-gt), understanding the nature of the transition from a planet without a biosphere to one with a biosphere should be central to origins-of-life inquiries. however, he says, ""a lot of the language to enable that understanding doesn't exist yet."" 
 three pillars 
 at georgia tech, research teams are working across the breadth of questions central to astrobiology. their activities are exemplified by three specialized research groups: cce, nai-gt, and c-star. 
 cce is building a community in origin-of-life research, said its director, 
 nicholas v. hud , 
 at a symposium organized by georgia tech astrobiology last month . in finding answers, cce takes two approaches, hud explained. ""bottom up,"" it starts with geology and chemistry and understanding the formation of the first polymers of life, which is a major focus of hud's. ""top down,"" it starts with biology, genetics, and looking back in time at persistent, conserved molecular motifs, as exemplified by 
 the work of loren williams on ribosomes . 
 like digging a tunnel underground from opposite ends and meeting somewhere in between, the two approaches are converging on the coevolution of the biopolymers of life. chemistry and biology are telling us the same thing, say hud and williams, both professors in the school of chemistry and biochemistry (socb) and members of the parker h. petit institute for bioengineering and bioscience (ibb). 
 at nai-gt, ""we start at the level of the cell,"" says 
 frank rosenzweig , the school of biological sciences (sobs) professor who leads the nasa group. ""once you have all this biochemistry wrapped in a cell, what happens then? how do they become associated as multicellular organisms? how do they engage in biochemistries that change the environment? we need to understand the interaction between the evolution of life and the evolution of its abiotic surrounding to have a chance of recognizing life elsewhere. 
 ""although life on earth manifests in different forms, all are governed by laws of growth, inheritance, and variability,"" says rosenzweig, also a member of ibb. nai-gt aims to ""illuminate and interpret these laws via laboratory-based evolution experiments with microbial populations."" an example is the 
 exploration of the origin of multicellularity by experimentally evolving yeast , as described in the september symposium by 
 will ratcliff , an assistant professor in sobs. 
 for c-star-affiliated faculty, habitability is one key question. what events and conditions in the abiotic sphere yield environments that support life? the nasa-supported work of 
 jennifer glass 
 and 
 chris reinhard , in the school of earth and atmospheric sciences (eas), exemplify the search for answers in this realm. 
 what signals should we monitor in search of life elsewhere in the universe? what tools do we need to probe for signs of life from the comfort of earth? what hazards should we prepare for if humans were to go to other worlds? 
 in eas, c-star members and planetary scientists 
 carol paty , 
 britney schmidt , and 
 james wray 
 are co-investigators of nasa-funded projects to answer these questions. so is c-star member 
 paul steffes , in the school of electrical and computer engineering, as well as c-star director 
 thomas orlando 
 and c-star member 
 amanda stockton , in socb. 
 what's next 
 with the talent on campus, georgia tech is becoming well known in the field of astrobiology. at the 
 2017 astrobiology scientific conference , in mesa, ariz., last april, the georgia tech ""posse"" numbered about 30 faculty and students. last summer, attendees of 
 abgradcon (astrobiology graduate conference) 2017 
 selected georgia tech to host the 
 2018 event . this popular meeting for students is funded primarily by the 
 nasa astrobiology institute . 
 the astrobiology community at georgia tech is ""healthy,"" smith says. ""the people in strategic positions have good priorities in the sophistication and intellectual integrity they are trying to support."" 
 the community - now 85 strong and growing - is raring to make its presence felt. it has an ambitious schedule for the 2017-18 school year, spearheaded by the september symposium. 
 led by grover as principal investigator, and with contributions from glass, knoespel, paty, reinhard, rosenzweig, schmidt, williams, and others - 
 rebecca burnett , ivan allen college of liberal arts; 
 glenn lightsey , school of aerospace engineering and c-star; and 
 christopher parsons , cce - their proposal for seven projects received funding from the georgia tech 
 strategic plan advisory group (spag) 
 and the colleges of engineering, liberal arts, and sciences. 
 the projects aim to showcase the quality and variety of astrobiology projects at tech, highlight the social impact of these projects, and strengthen the sense of community among faculty and students. the goals will be achieved through formal gatherings, educational innovations, and public outreach.

astrobiology-rising-georgia-tech.txt,"astrobiology rising at georgia tech 
 the growing visibility of researchers interested in astrobiology is helping georgia tech emerge as a powerhouse in the field. 
 nov 01, 2017 
 - atlanta, ga 
 in the ford environmental science and technology building, the office of martha grover is three doors from that of jennifer glass. both are georgia tech scientists doing research related to astrobiology - life in the cosmos - but until last year they hardly talked to each other as researchers with common interests. 
 ""we are all so busy,"" says  grover , a professor in the school of chemical and biomolecular engineering, a scientific collaborator at the  nsf / nasa center for chemical evolution (cce) , and a member of the  center for space technology and research (c-star) . 
 now, grover,  glass , and others at tech are members of a growing community that's coalescing astrobiology activities across campus. in a public debut of sorts, six members of  georgia tech astrobiology , as the community calls itself, participated in  the 2017 dragon con , the premier pop-culture convention on science fiction and fantasy. they wowed the audience, not by fiction or fantasy or over-the-top costumes, but by progress in answering fundamental questions - how did life begin? where else could life exist? all happening right next door to the meeting venue, at georgia tech. 
 the growing visibility of researchers interested in astrobiology is helping georgia tech emerge as a powerhouse in the field. at minimum, says  kenneth knoespel , a historian of science and professor in the ivan allen college of liberal arts, ""it affirms the importance of this community at georgia tech and the importance of astrobiology as a new configuration of disciplines that brings together the natural and human sciences."" 
 teeming with talent 
 ""georgia tech is clearly recognized as a hub for astrobiology and maybe the one that's growing the most quickly,"" says  edward goolish , the deputy director of the  nasa astrobiology institute  (nai), one of the six elements of the nasa astrobiology program. people at georgia tech, goolish adds, ""have been generous with their time and have contributed in important ways when nasa has reached out to the science community for input."" 
 the community includes physicists, chemists, biologists, earth and planetary scientists, and engineers, as well as historians of science and writers. the scientists are figuring out how life emerged and evolved to the biosphere we know, inventing instruments to detect life outside earth, and searching for other habitable places in the universe. the science historians and writers are witnessing science in the making and perhaps gathering fodder for the next volume of science fiction. 
 broadly defined, astrobiology is the study of life in the cosmos. its central questions are ""what is the origin of life?"" and ""does life exist beyond earth?"" humans have asked these questions since  time immemorial . that they are still around attests to the difficulty of discovering and assembling the pieces of a formidable puzzle: the emergence of a biosphere on a planet. 
 how formidable? according to  eric smith , a theoretician in the  nasa astrobiology institute's team at georgia tech  (nai-gt), understanding the nature of the transition from a planet without a biosphere to one with a biosphere should be central to origins-of-life inquiries. however, he says, ""a lot of the language to enable that understanding doesn't exist yet."" 
 three pillars 
 at georgia tech, research teams are working across the breadth of questions central to astrobiology. their activities are exemplified by three specialized research groups: cce, nai-gt, and c-star. 
 cce is building a community in origin-of-life research, said its director,  nicholas v. hud ,  at a symposium organized by georgia tech astrobiology last month . in finding answers, cce takes two approaches, hud explained. ""bottom up,"" it starts with geology and chemistry and understanding the  formation  of the first polymers of life, which is a major focus of hud's. ""top down,"" it starts with biology, genetics, and looking back in time at persistent, conserved molecular motifs, as exemplified by  the work of loren williams on ribosomes . 
 like digging a tunnel underground from opposite ends and meeting somewhere in between, the two approaches are converging on the coevolution of the biopolymers of life. chemistry and biology are telling us the same thing, say hud and williams, both professors in the school of chemistry and biochemistry (socb) and members of the parker h. petit institute for bioengineering and bioscience (ibb). 
 at nai-gt, ""we  start  at the level of the cell,"" says  frank rosenzweig , the school of biological sciences (sobs) professor who leads the nasa group. ""once you have all this biochemistry wrapped in a cell, what happens then? how do they become associated as multicellular organisms? how do they engage in biochemistries that change the environment? we need to understand the interaction between the evolution of life and the evolution of its abiotic surrounding to have a chance of recognizing life elsewhere. 
 ""although life on earth manifests in different forms, all are governed by laws of growth, inheritance, and variability,"" says rosenzweig, also a member of ibb. nai-gt aims to ""illuminate and interpret these laws via laboratory-based evolution experiments with microbial populations."" an example is the  exploration of the origin of multicellularity by experimentally evolving yeast , as described in the september symposium by  will ratcliff , an  assistant professor  in sobs. 
 for c-star-affiliated faculty, habitability is one key question. what events and conditions in the abiotic sphere yield environments that support life? the nasa-supported work of  jennifer glass  and  chris reinhard , in the school of earth and atmospheric sciences (eas), exemplify the search for answers in this realm. 
 what signals should we monitor in search of life elsewhere in the universe? what tools do we need to probe for signs of life from the comfort of earth? what hazards should we prepare for if humans were to go to other worlds? 
 in eas, c-star members and planetary scientists  carol paty ,  britney schmidt , and  james wray  are co-investigators of nasa-funded projects to answer these questions. so is c-star member  paul steffes , in the school of electrical and  computer engineering , as well as c-star director  thomas orlando  and c-star member  amanda stockton , in socb. 
 what's next 
 with the talent on campus, georgia tech is becoming well known in the field of astrobiology. at the  2017 astrobiology scientific conference , in mesa, ariz., last april, the georgia tech ""posse"" numbered about 30 faculty and students. last summer, attendees of  abgradcon (astrobiology graduate conference) 2017  selected georgia tech to host the  2018 event . this popular meeting for students is funded primarily by the  nasa astrobiology institute . 
 the astrobiology community at georgia tech is ""healthy,"" smith says. ""the people in strategic positions have good priorities in the sophistication and intellectual integrity they are trying to support."" 
 the community - now 85 strong and growing - is raring to make its presence felt. it has an ambitious schedule for the 2017 - 18 school year, spearheaded by the september symposium. 
 led by grover as principal investigator, and with contributions from glass, knoespel, paty, reinhard, rosenzweig, schmidt, williams, and others -  rebecca burnett , ivan allen college of liberal arts;  glenn lightsey , school of aerospace engineering and c-star; and  christopher parsons , cce - their proposal for seven projects received funding from the georgia tech  strategic plan advisory group (spag)  and the colleges of engineering, liberal arts, and sciences. 
 the projects aim to showcase the quality and variety of astrobiology projects at tech, highlight the social impact of these projects, and strengthen the sense of community among faculty and students. the goals will be achieved through formal gatherings, educational innovations, and public outreach. 
 ""as i see it, the point of research universities is to tackle the really important, really deep, and really challenging questions - the ones at the edge of, or even beyond, our reach; the ones that present not just the possibility but the likelihood of failure,"" said college of sciences dean and  sutherland chair  paul m. goldbart at the september symposium. ""it's our duty as administrators to do everything we can to support this kind of truly adventurous research."" 
 what the astrobiology community is doing not only is exciting, goldbart said. but also, ""it could hardly fit better with the dreams of the college of sciences and of georgia tech.""

astronomical-odds.txt,"the astronomical odds 
 a georgia tech mathematician calculates the odds of winning powerball's largest jackpot ever. 
 dr. lew lefton, a georgia tech mathematician, crunches the astronomical odds of winning the lottery. 
 jan 12, 2016 
 - atlanta, ga 
 lottery officials have announced the powerball jackpot has reached a record-smashing $1.5 billion. that has sent fortune-seeking americans to gas stations and grocery stores in droves to try their luck. unfortunately, the odds aren't ever in your favor. the powerball lottery is hitting a record jackpot of $1.5 billion, but the odds are stacked against you. professor lew lefton from 
 georgia tech's school of mathematics 
 crunches numbers like these for a living. saying that your chances are slim to none is a complete understatement. ""there are 292 million possible winning combinations,"" lefton says. that means you have a 1 in 292 million chance of winning. so just how unlikely is that? imagine you walked into georgia tech's bobby dodd stadium and placed a penny on the field somewhere. then, you asked a friend to put on a blindfold and walk into the stadium with a penny as well. if they placed the penny in the exact same location, that would be 15 times more likely to happen than winning the powerball jackpot. imagine rolling ten dice all at the same time. if all ten landed on the same number the very first time you tried, that's still five times more likely than winning the $1.5 billion dollar jackpot. dice aren't your thing? you're 500 times more likely to get a royal flush in the first five cards you are dealt than taking home the big prize. ""there isn't a way to improve your odds,"" lefton explains. so forget what you might have heard. but you can increase the chances of winning the jackpot all by yourself. ""play numbers higher than 31,"" lefton says. many people play birthday numbers, so choosing higher, less-popular numbers decreases the chances of sharing the pot. also, people statistically choose odd numbers more often. choosing high, even numbers is your best bet, according to lefton. lefton says very few mathematicians like himself spring for tickets because they are the first to know the odds are so astronomically against them. speaking of odds, take this into consideration when march madness rolls around: you're 100 times more likely to win the powerball twice in a row than you are to select a perfect ncaa basketball bracket. the chances of a flawless bracket? 1 in 9.2 quintillion.

 view the slideshow 
 the ivan allen college of liberal arts namesake,  mayor ivan allen jr ., was celebrated on november 25 with the dedication of a downtown atlanta bridge as a new outdoor walking museum in his name. an alumnus of georgia tech (commerce 1933), allen transformed atlanta during his mayorship in the turbulent 1960s. 
 the  path foundation  brought together the  allen family ,  jim and sarah kennedy , and the  james m. cox foundation  to fund the project with hopes of helping younger generations understand mayor allen's role in forging a new era in atlanta, pushing forward civil rights for african americans and creating the foundations for the modern city we know today. among those quoted in the bridge exhibit is  former ivan allen college dean jacqueline royster . 
 part of atlanta's extensive path system, the newly dedicated ivan allen jr. legacy bridge connects marietta street and the westside symbolizing mayor allen's example in risking everything to break down the barriers of jim crow laws, and revitalize atlanta as a city where all its citizens could flourish together. the bridge was designed by mad dworschak, signature design, and perez planning + design who spent months researching mayor allen's life and accomplishments. 
 a series of placards runs the length of the bridge under colorful ribbons, which creates a linear timeline for visitors as they walk by. the story is divided into several themes including allen's character, his civil rights record, his business pragmatism, his vision for the city's cultural institutions, and his collaboration with other leaders. 
 the bridge also offers onlookers a multimedia experience as the placards include mobile hyperlinks and qr codes that visitors can scan with their smart phone to access supplementary video content. the colors used in the display mirror mayor allen's story, beginning on the marietta street side of the bridge with traditional reds, white, and blues to signify when mayor allen took office. they morph into an intense palette of varied bright colors to signify the radical change of the 1960s and atlanta's transition into an international city under mayor allen's leadership. 
 the ivan allen jr. legacy bridge is now one of many remembrances of mayor allen and his impact on atlanta that can be found around the city. georgia tech's ivan allen college of liberal arts is the steward of the allen legacy which underpins the school's research, teaching, and public engagement.

 the atlanta regional commission has recognized 
 a new landmark building at georgia tech 
 as the best development in the region for 2019. 
 the kendeda building for innovative sustainable design 
 received the commission's 
 development of excellence award nov. 8 
 for setting a new standard for sustainability in the atlanta region. the honor recognizes projects and places every year that are improving the quality of life for residents. 
 ""the building exemplifies the sustainability and exceptional design goals in the atlanta region's plan,"" said shan arora, kendeda building director, referring to metro atlanta's long-range, comprehensive blueprint. ""it is a tangible example that can show others how to also advance those goals across the region."" 
 made possible by a grant from 
 the kendeda fund , the building was designed and constructed to achieve 
 living building challenge 3.1 certification  - meaning that it gives back more to the environment than it takes through its construction and operation. the building is designed to annually collect more water and energy than it consumes, and it diverted nearly all construction waste from landfills and repurposed salvaged materials. it also largely eliminated materials containing 22 chemicals known to harm people or the environment. 
 arora said the building's water system and materials features, in particular, are important to the atlanta region's future. 
 ""aside from its first-in-the-state commercial system to turn rainwater into drinkable water, the building manages its greywater and biowaste on site without adding burden to the region's already stressed wastewater infrastructure,"" he said. 
 the regional commission cited the kendeda building's makerspace, edible landscape, public art, and outdoor spaces as other features worthy of distinction and praised the project for developing new best practices in high performance construction. 
 ""we are deeply honored to be recognized by the atlanta regional commission,"" said jim fortner, interim executive vice president for administration and finance. ""we have learned much through the design and construction of this amazing project. we want this building to be a catalyst for innovative design and performance, and this award helps us share those lessons across the region.""

 today, atomic beam collimators are mostly found in physics labs, where they shoot out atoms in a beam that produces exotic quantum phenomena and which has properties that may be useful in precision technologies. by shrinking collimators from the size of a small appliance to fit on a fingertip, researchers at the georgia institute of technology want to make the technology available to engineers advancing devices like atomic clocks or  accelerometers , a component found in smartphones. 
 ""a typical device you might make out of this is a next-generation gyroscope for a precision navigation system that is independent of gps and can be used when you're out of satellite range in a remote region or traveling in space,"" said chandra raman,  an associate professor in georgia tech's school of physics  and a co-principal investigator on the study. 
 the research was funded by the office of navy research. the researchers 
 published their results in the journal  nature communications  on april 23, 2019. 
 here's what a collimator is, some of the quantum potential in atomic beams, and how the miniature collimator format could help atomic beams shape new generations of technology. 
 pocket atomic shotgun 
 ""collimated atomic beams have been around for decades,"" raman said, ""but currently, collimators must be large in order to be precise."" 
 the atomic beam starts in a box full of atoms, often  rubidium , heated to a vapor so that the atoms zing about chaotically. a tube taps into the box, and random atoms with the right trajectory shoot into the tube like pellets entering the barrel of a shotgun. 
 like pellets leaving a shotgun, the atoms exit the end of the tube shooting reasonably straight but also with a random spray of atomic shot flying at skewed angles. in an atomic beam, that spray produces signal noise, and the improved collimator-on-a-chip eliminates most of it for a more precise, nearly perfectly parallel beam of atoms. 
 the beam is much more focused and pure than beams coming from existing collimators. the researchers would also like their collimator to enable experimental physicists to more conveniently create complex quantum states. 
 [thinking about grad school?  here's how to apply to georgia tech. ] 
 unwavering inertia machine 
 but more immediately, the collimator sets up newtonian mechanics that could be adapted for practical use. 
 the improved beams are streams of unwavering  inertia  because, unlike a laser beam, which is made of massless photons, atoms have mass and thus momentum and inertia. this makes their beams potentially ideal reference points in beam-driven  gyroscopes  that help track motion and changes in location. 
 current gyroscopes in gps-free navigation devices are precise in the short run but not the long run, which means recalibrating or replacing them ever so often, and that makes them less convenient, say, on the moon or on mars. 
 ""conventional chip-scale instruments based on  mems (microelectromechanical systems) technology  suffer from drift over time from various stresses,"" said co-principal investigator farrokh ayazi, who is ken byers  professor in georgia tech's school of electrical and computer engineering . ""to eliminate that drift, you need an absolutely stable mechanism. this atomic beam creates that kind of reference on a chip."" 
 quantum entanglement beam 
 heat-excited atoms in a beam can also be converted into  rydberg atoms, which provide a cornucopia of quantum properties . 
 when an atom is energized enough, its outermost orbiting electron bumps out so far that the atom balloons in size. orbiting so far out with so much energy, that outermost electron behaves like the lone electron of a hydrogen atom, and the rydberg atom acts as if it had only a single proton. 
 ""you can engineer certain kinds of multi-atom quantum entanglement by using rydberg states because the atoms interact with each other much more strongly than two atoms in the ground state,"" raman said. 
 ""rydberg atoms could also advance future sensor technologies because they're sensitive to fluxes in force or in electronic fields smaller than an electron in scale,"" ayazi said. ""they could also be used in quantum information processing."" 
 lithographed silicon grooves 
 the researchers devised a surprisingly convenient way to make the new collimator, which could encourage manufacturers to adopt it: they cut long, extremely narrow channels through a silicon wafer running parallel to its flat surface. the channels were like shotgun barrels lined up side-by-side to shoot out an array of atomic beams. 
 silicon is an exceptionally slick material for the atoms to fly through and also is used in many existing microelectronic and computing technologies. that opens up the possibility for combining these technologies on a chip with the new miniature collimator. lithography, which is used to etch existing chip technology, was used to precisely cut the collimator's channels. 
 the researchers' biggest innovation greatly reduced the shotgun-like spray, i.e. the signal noise. they sliced two gaps in the channels, forming an aligned cascade of three sets of parallel arrays of barrels. 
 atoms flying at skewed angles jump out of the channels at the gaps and those flying reasonably parallel in the first array of channels continue on to the next one, then the process repeats going from the second into the third array of channels. this gives the new collimator's atomic beams their exceptional straightness.

atomic-level-imaging-could-offer-roadmap-metals-new-properties.txt,"atomic-level imaging could offer roadmap to metals with new properties 
 a team of researchers at the georgia institute of technology has developed a new process that could help gain new insights into individual high-entropy alloys. 
 this schematic illustration of the new palladium-containing high entropy allow shows how new alloy contains large palladium clusters (blue atoms). 
 oct 09, 2019 
 - atlanta, ga 
 high-entropy alloys, which are made from nearly equal parts of several primary metals, could hold great potential for creating materials with superior mechanical properties. 
 but with a practically unlimited number of possible combinations, one challenge for metallurgists is figuring out where to focus their research efforts in a vast, unexplored world of metallic mixtures. 
 a team of researchers at the georgia institute of technology has developed a new process that could help guide such efforts. their approach involves building an atomic resolution chemical map to help gain new insights into individual high-entropy alloys and help characterize their properties. 
 in a study published oct. 9 in the journal  nature , the researchers described using energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy to create maps of individual metals in two high-entropy alloys. this spectroscopy technique, used in conjunction with transmission electron microscopy, detects x-rays emitted from a sample during bombardment by an electron beam to characterize the elemental composition of an analyzed sample. the maps show how individual atoms arrange themselves within the alloy, allowing researchers to look for patterns that could help them design alloys emphasizing individual properties. 
 for example, the maps could give researchers clues to understand why substituting one metal for another could make an alloy stronger or weaker, or why one metal outperforms others in extremely cold environments. 
 ""most alloys used in engineering applications have only one primary metal, such as iron in steel or nickel in nickel-based super alloys, with relatively small amounts of other metals,"" said ting zhu, a professor in the george w. woodruff school of mechanical engineering at georgia tech. ""these new alloys that have relatively high concentrations of five or more metals open up the possibility of unconventional alloys that may have unprecedented properties. but this is a new compositional space that has not been explored, and we still have a very limited understanding of this class of materials."" 
 the name ""high entropy"" refers to the lack of uniformity in the mixture of metals as well as how many different and somewhat random ways the atoms from the metals can be arranged as they are combined. 
 the new maps could help researchers determine whether there are any unconventional atomic structures that such alloys take that could be leveraged for engineering applications, and how much control researchers could have over the mixtures in order to ""tune"" them for specific traits, zhu said. 
 to test the new imaging approach, the research team compared two high-entropy alloys containing five metals. one was a mixture of chromium, iron, cobalt, nickel, and manganese, a combination commonly referred to as a ""cantor"" alloy. the other was similar but substituted palladium for the manganese. that one substitution resulted in much different behavior in how the atoms arranged themselves in the mixture. 
 ""in the cantor alloy, the distribution of all five elements is consistently random,"" zhu said. ""but with the new alloy containing palladium, the elements show significant aggregations due to the much different atomic size of palladium atoms as well as their difference in electronegativity compared to the other elements."" 
 in the new alloy with palladium, the mapping showed that palladium tended to form large clusters while cobalt seemed to collect in places where iron was in low concentrations. 
 those aggregations, with their sizes and spacings in the range of a few nanometers, provide strong deformation resistance and could explain the differences in mechanical properties from one high-entropy alloy to another. in straining tests, the alloy with palladium showed higher yield strength while keeping similar strain hardening and tensile ductility as the cantor alloy. 
 ""the atomic scale modulation of element distribution produces the fluctuation of lattice resistance, which strongly tunes dislocation behaviors,"" said qian yu, a coauthor of the paper and a professor in zhejiang university. ""such modulation occurs at a scale that is finer than precipitation hardening and is larger than that of traditional solid solution strengthening. and it provides understanding for the intrinsic character of high-entropy alloys."" 
 the findings could enable researchers to custom design alloys in the future, leveraging one property or another. 
 ""we believe that this work is really important, as local chemical ordering in these extremely high profile, high-entropy alloys is critical to dictating their properties."" said robert ritchie, another coauthor and a professor at the university of california, berkeley. ""indeed, this presents a way to tailor these materials to attain optimal properties by atomic design."" 
 the team also included researchers from the university of tennessee, knoxville; tsinghua university; and the chinese academy of sciences.

augmenting-reality-gt-students-fare-well-annual-hackmit.txt,"augmenting reality: gt students fare well at annual hackmit 
 gt computing students earns top honor at a recent hackathon event hosted by mit. 
 oct 03, 2016 
 - atlanta, ga 
 what if you could access crucial stock information with little more than the movement of a finger? what if education, which often relies on static images within the confines of a textbook, could become a more interactive experience for students? 
 these are a pair of questions that georgia tech students 
 nathan dass 
 and 
 kshitij kulkarni 
 were attempting to address when they attended 
 hackmit 
 last month at the massachusetts institute of technology. utilizing microsoft's hololens, both dass' and kulkarni's teams fared well at the event, the former earning the nasdaq api prize for using the api in the most creative way and the latter placing in the top 10. 
 dass, who is in his third year as a computer science major, enjoys artificial intelligence and human-computer interaction. he has worked in the past on a virtual reality project at google, and said that helped direct his specific interests. 
 although he had never participated in a hackathon before, when he heard that the 
 hololens , an augmented reality device that enhances the experience of your physical surroundings, would be available for use, he wanted to participate. 
 ""i knew there was really no other place that students could get basically a whole weekend with the hololens and make anything,"" dass said. ""this was the opportunity in my opinion, so i sort of pushed my team toward that."" 
 what they came up with was an application that could retrieve and display stock information from the 
 nasdaq api 
 on the hololens display in real time. when a user is wearing the device, they can simply look at a logo of a company, indicate through one of the device's built-in gestures that they would like to access its information, and a graphic showing items such as current price and percent change would appear on the screen. 
 for their work, dass' team won the nasdaq sponsor prize, which was awarded for the most creative use of nasdaq's api. the group will be flown to new york to meet with nasdaq executives. organizers are also trying to coordinate with representatives from microsoft to attend the demonstration, as well. that trip is tentatively planned for some time during winter break, dass said. 
 while in new york, dass and his teammates will take part in the closing bell ceremony at the new york stock exchange, which will be broadcast live on the big screen in times square. 
 kulkarni, who is a second-year undergraduate in electrical engineering, and his team finished among the top 10, earning the opportunity to present their project on stage to the hackathon attendees. their hack, which also utilized the hololens, involved providing a more interactive experience for students in and out of the classroom. the goal was to create an application that could associate interactive graphs with specific key words on a page. 
 the team achieved the independent functionality for reading text off an image and putting it onto the hololens, as well as a separate function for visualizing the algorithm. 
 ""what we were not able to do is put them together,"" kulkarni said. ""our next step is to bridge those two worlds together so that you have a seamless experience of having a book open, looking at it with the hololens, highlighting a word and then attaching an interactive visual display to that word."" 
 kulkarni and his teammates came up with the concept when considering the shared experience they had during their first two years of undergraduate studies. learning in-depth scientific and technological concepts out of a textbook presents challenges because of the difficulty in visualizing information that should be interactive. 
 ""for example, if someone is trying to learn sorting or another algorithm, it's very difficult to visualize that on a static sheet of paper,"" kulkarni said. ""so we harnessed the power of the hololens and its augmented reality to attempt to overlay onto it educational modules that, in real time, show these algorithms happening."" 
 kulkarni said their work at hackmit was a proof of concept for many future modules. 
 dass plans to finish his undergraduate degree in december 2017, then pursue a graduate degree and, eventually, work in technological innovation with the goal of eventually integrating artificial intelligence and human-computer interaction into our everyday lives. kulkarni, who is interested in data visualization and processing and machine learning, plans to pursue a graduate degree upon his graduation and continue to work on those large-scale problems ""that are currently stumping people."" 
 hackmit is mit's headline hackathon, with more than 1,000 undergraduate attendees from around the world. during a 24-hour period, hackers collaborated and experimented on an assortment of software and hardware projects.

autonomous-trucking-collaboration-could-lead-more-resilient-affordable-supply-chain.txt,"autonomous trucking collaboration could lead to a more resilient, affordable supply chain 
 a. russell chandler iii chair and professor pascal van hentenryck and his team look at transportation through a different lens 
 nov 02, 2021 
 - atlanta, ga 
 a. russell chandler iii chair and professor 
 pascal van hentenryck 
 is collaborating with 
 ryder system, inc. 
 on the 
 industry's first data-driven study of the potential impact of autonomous trucking . 
 van hentenryck and his team have spent years developing an 
 on-demand multimodal transit system (odmts) 
 to address the first- and last-mile problems in public transportation and provide equitable, efficient, and low-cost public transportation options. the multimodal approach uses small on-demand vehicles to take riders to and from their locations to high-frequency bus and rail hubs. increasing the use of public transit will not only decrease reliance on personal vehicles and reduce traffic congestion and greenhouse gas emissions; it will also increase accessibility to jobs, healthcare, education, and fresh food. 
 however, when executives from ryder, a leading logistics and transportation company with more than 235,000 vehicles and 8,600 professional truck drivers, reached out to van hentenryck about a collaboration, the research team began to look at the model through a different lens. 
 ""we have been focusing on people mobility and had not looked at other types of transportation,"" said van hentenryck. ""so when ryder came to us, we were very interested to see if the techniques that we were using for people could apply more generally to freight. in this project specifically, we are looking at how adding autonomous vehicles could unlock additional value."" 
 van hentenryck, who also serves as associate chair for innovation and entrepreneurship and leads the 
 socially aware mobility (sam) lab 
 in the h. milton stewart school of industrial and systems engineering (isye), and his team met with ryder to better understand the company's goals and to determine if this multimodal approach could be applied to another system. working with a company like ryder gave the team access to large amounts of data and to logistics experts who understand the industry's current and future challenges. 
 ""there is a lot of back-and-forth between researchers and company representatives in a project like this,"" explained van hentenryck. ""sometimes the solutions we come up with in the lab will not work in the field, and so you have this iterative process in transforming the research idea into something that is applicable in the field."" 
 ryder operates a network of dedicated fleets for its customers, and even with high levels of performance, inflexible transportation lanes and schedules often lead to inefficiencies. 
 ""we learned that sometimes these trucks are traveling many miles completely empty, which is not cost effective,"" van hentenryck said. ""we started looking at how we can avoid these ‘empty miles.'"" 
 to meet customer needs, ryder must execute a large number of freight movements across the country. the team realized that by breaking each trip into three sections - origin-to-hub, hub-to-hub, and hub-to-destination - it could organize a network using both regular and autonomous trucks. the first and last segments would rely on smaller human-operated vehicles, since these will typically occur in more densely populated locations. connections between hubs would rely solely on autonomous trucks (those without a human driver), generally in sparsely populated, controlled environments like highways and exit ramps. 
 ""safety is especially important to our researchers and to ryder, and we take it very seriously,"" said van hentenryck. ""keeping the autonomous trucks on the longer-haul middle leg, and human drivers in the first and final legs, schedules autonomy on lengthy, often overnight trips, and places drivers in dense environments where there are many other variables at play like left-hand turns, stop signs, pedestrians, etc."" 
 the autonomous hub-to-hub aspect allows van hentenryck's model to be optimized in a whole new way because it doesn't depend on having drivers available - autonomous trucks are extremely flexible. this can deliver significant projected savings for ryder if the model is implemented. 
 ""the whole team was stunned by the projected savings from this project,"" said van hentenryck. ""i have worked on many different transportation problems during my career, and 1% improvement is magical. in this case, improvement goes from 29% to 40%, depending on the price of autonomous trucks and the cost of operating them. also, the flexibility to move these autonomous trucks around gave us the ability to optimize the business model in ways people didn't even consider before."" 
 the agility of the new model also provides better reactions to supply chain disruptions, because it can adapt more quickly to a new situation. 
 ""autonomous driving technology is poised to be incredibly disruptive to our industry in safety, service, and cost. as such, it was clear to us that this was not something we could wait to figure out or be handed a playbook. this collaboration with georgia tech was an advancement in our commitment to becoming a leader in fostering innovation and bringing it to our customers,"" said michael plasencia, group director of new product strategy at ryder. 
 ""we are designing a much more resilient supply chain logistics system, and that is because we are thinking differently,"" van hentenryck added. ""this technology provides more resilience, more flexibility, and is more affordable. 
 ""this project is only a first step. the whole field of transportation, logistics, and supply chains is being transformed by technology, automation, and the changes in attitudes and expectations that emerged during covid-19. we are looking forward to working with ryder on many of these.""

 rotorjackets, georgia tech's drone racing team, captured their second straight national title, but their mission extends beyond winning championships.

 may 05, 2023 
 april was a month of national championships at georgia tech as buzz was crowned the nation's best mascot, and the rotorjackets took home their second straight collegiate drone racing championship. 
 tech's team, comprised of four racers, narrowly emerged from the field of 15 schools and 52 individual pilots to take home the title following two days of competition at the fayette fliers field in tyrone, georgia. while scores from the qualifying round and the previous races in the knockout round are compiled into a sum, it was rotorjackets' vice president tanner beard who put his team in the lead in the final race of the competition. beard also finished in second place in the individual competition, but it's the team's accomplishment that he's proudest of. 
 beard and outgoing team president luke lawver started flying first-person view (fpv) drones together in 2018 before officially founding rotorjackets in the fall of 2020. as beard, a 
 mechanical engineering 
 student, and lawver, an 
 aerospace graduate student , get set to leave tech, the pair couldn't have imagined the success the group has achieved in a short time. 
 ""i'm just very proud of how far it's come. we started out practicing on fields with pvc pipes, and our gates and materials were falling apart. we didn't really have anything, but we were able to build everything up, and we've practiced every single weekend for events like this,"" beard said. 
 the team learned the layout of the championship track just two weeks before the event, but practicing from first light to sundown was nothing new for the rotorjackets. the hard work and preparation continued up until the last minute as the team was forced to replace a drone the night before the competition. but the two senior members of the team were impressed by first-year 
 computer engineering 
 student ian boraks -- the incoming president -- and dylan wyckoff, in his first-ever drone race. wyckoff is a third-year 
 computer science 
 major and will take over as the club's treasurer. 
 both relished the opportunity to fly alongside their experienced teammates and are now focused on continuing their legacy in pursuit of a three-peat. 
 other than winning titles, the club also wants to expand the drone-flying community on campus. when the fall semester begins, monthly events will be held on tech green, where all students can learn how to fly. no experience is necessary, and all equipment will be provided. not all club members are racers, and the benefits of learning the skill go well beyond the group. 
 ""the cool thing about fpv as a hobby is that, especially as an engineering major or someone in any stem field, it teaches you a ton of practical skills that are incredibly useful in your day-to-day job,"" lawver said. ""we build all of our drones basically from scratch, so you can learn about electrical hardware design, mechanical hardware design, and software engineering and dive into whatever areas you want. or, you can just treat it as a black box, and you'll have fun with it."" 
 using the skills they've acquired, the rotorjackets have expanded their footprint at tech, using drones to enhance coverage of events like the iconic 
 mini-500 
 as well the pi mile, and they've assisted athletics in creating digital content. 
 while not necessary to join the club and learn the ropes, obtaining your remote pilot certificate from the faa is recommended if you're interested in the more advanced stages of drone piloting, and the plan is to offer this certification through the club in the coming semesters.

bacterial-conversations-cystic-fibrosis.txt,"bacterial conversations in cystic fibrosis 
 georgia tech researchers obtain benchmark data for the impact of spatial arrangement in bacterial signaling in a cystic fibrosis model. 
 may 31, 2018 
 - atlanta, ga 
 ""a large part of my research is thinking about how bacteria communicate,"" says 
 sophie darch . the postdoctoral researcher works with school of biological sciences professor 
 marvin whiteley , studying the social lives of bacteria. 
 darch observes the conversations of bacteria, which take place via molecules they release into the environment and are sensed by other bacteria. in darch's experiments, completed messages are marked by the red-to-green change in the color of the bacterium sensing the molecule. 
 by sending and receiving extracellular signals, bacteria sense their neighbors. when enough bacteria are in the conversation, things happen. sometimes it leads to changes in virulence or ability to establish an infection. the phenomenon is called quorum sensing. 
 yet little is known about how quorum sensing proceeds during infection ""much of what is known about quorum sensing,"" darch says, ""comes from studies of large populations of bacteria in an environment that does not compare with the natural infection site."" in infections, for example, bacteria are often found in small, dense clusters, called aggregates. ""it's really important for us as scientists to think about what bacterial growth looks like in an infection,"" darch says. 
 in a paper in the 
 proceedings of the national academy of sciences usa , darch, whiteley, and colleagues describe for the first time how close bacteria need to be to ""talk"" with each other in an environment similar to an infection. their findings could reveal new ways to disrupt bacterial signaling and provide other targets to treat infections. 
 the work was supported by the national institutes of health, the cystic fibrosis foundation, human frontiers science, and the welch foundation. 
 cystic fibrosis model 
 the study uses an environment similar to the chronic infection of the cystic fibrosis (cf) lung. 
 cf is a genetic disease that causes buildup of sticky mucus in the lung. the viscous setting cf creates makes the organ prime real estate for disease-causing bacteria. among the most prevalent of these in the cf lung is 
 pseudomonas aeruginosa. 
 p. aeruginosa 
 infections pose a huge problem because they are resistant to many antibiotics and are difficult to treat. often 
 p. aeruginosa 
 infection is what causes death among patients with cf. 
 the team used a synthetic cf sputum media (scfm2), based on the makeup of lung secretions from patients. in nutritional content and physical form, the medium is similar to sputum from the lung. importantly, 
 p. aeruginosa 
 forms aggregates in scfm2 that are similar in size to those observed in cf lung tissue. 
 3-d printed bacteria 
 to begin to answer the question ""how close do you have to be to talk to your neighbor?"" the team collaborated with 
 jason shear 
 at the university of texas, austin. the 
 shear lab 
 had developed a micro-3d-printing platform that could be used to engineer the growth of bacteria to mimic infections. 
 bacteria are not uniformly distributed in infections. ""instead we see bacterial aggregates that vary in size and can be separated by large distances,"" whiteley says. ""we needed an experimental method to engineer these types of infection landscapes in the lab."" 
 using shear's micro-3d-printing platform, the team printed bacterial aggregates of exact positions and sizes. 
 a typical experiment starts by enclosing one producer cell in a picoliter-sized trap, using micro-3d-printing. after multiple cell divisions, the population fills the volume of the trap. then scfm2-containing aggregates of responder cells are overlaid the porous trap. 
 they observe the one-way flow of signals from aggregates in a trap (producers) to aggregates outside receiving signals (responders). they could see the response of completed conversations by responders changing color from red to green. 
 implications for cystic fibrosis 
 ""we found that bacterial aggregates slightly larger than those in cf lung - containing about 2,000 cells - were not large enough to signal to other aggregates,"" darch says. 
 prior to this study, it was thought that bacterial signaling could occur over extended distances. however, in the cf lung, small populations of bacteria are scattered across a large volume and separated by large distances. aggregates are unlikely to ""talk"" to each other. 
 it took aggregates containing at least 5,000 cells to successfully send signals to neighbors as far away as 176 micrometers. ""these aggregates are around five times the size of the average aggregate observed in cf lung tissue"" darch says ""from these data, communication is likely confined within an individual aggregate rather than being a population-wide phenomenon"". 
 among cf patients who are at least 20 years old, 
 80% are infected with p. aeruginosa . ""infection with 
 p. aeruginosa 
 remains a significant clinical problem in immunocompromised patients, particularly those with cf,"" darch says. ""understanding better how bacteria communicate has the potential to find ways of disrupting the communication and potentially diminishing bacterial virulence."" 
 ""the study provides benchmark data for how quorum sensing might proceed in an environment similar to the cf lung,"" says 
 whiteley, who is a member of the parker h. petit institute for bioengineering and bioscience . ""in different settings, where 
 p. aeruginosa 
 and other bacteria exist as aggregates of different sizes, communication may look different. future studies will involve experimental and modeling work to further examine the spatial parameters of quorum sensing in cf and other infections, such as a chronic wound.""

 - atlanta, ga 
 evil armies of internet-connected ev chargers, ovens, hot-water heaters, air-conditioners, and other high-wattage appliances could be hijacked to slightly manipulate energy demand, potentially driving price swings and creating financial damage to deregulated energy markets, warns a new report scheduled to be presented aug. 5 at the black hat usa 2020 conference. 
 by turning the compromised equipment on or off to artificially increase or decrease power demand, botnets made up of these energy-consuming devices might help an unscrupulous energy supplier or retailer (electric utility) alter prices to create a business advantage, or give a nation-state a way to remotely harm the economy of another country by causing financial damage to its electricity market. if done within the bounds of normal power demand variation, such an attack would be difficult to detect, the researchers said. 
 ""if an attacker can slightly affect electricity market prices in their favor, it would be like knowing today what's going to happen in tomorrow's stock market,"" said tohid shekari, a graduate research assistant in the 
 school of electrical and computer engineering 
 at the georgia institute of technology. ""if the manipulation stays within a certain range, it would be stealthy and difficult to differentiate from a typical load forecasting error."" 
 believed to be the first proposed energy market manipulation cyberattack, the operation would depend on botnets composed of thousands of appliances that could be controlled centrally by attackers who had taken over their internet of things (iot) controllers. malicious actors have already demonstrated iot botnet attacks such as mirai, which used a network of compromised internet-connected cameras and routers to launch attacks on key internet infrastructure. 
 the attack, dubbed ""iot skimmer,"" would be made possible by the deregulation of energy markets, which has created a system to efficiently supply electrical power. to meet the demand for electrical energy, utility companies must predict future demand and purchase power from the day-ahead wholesale energy market at competitive prices. if the predictions turn out to be wrong, the utilities may have to pay more or less for the energy they need to meet the demands of their customers by participating in the real-time market, which has more volatile prices in general. creating erroneous demand data to manipulate forecasts could be profitable to the suppliers selling energy to meet the unexpected demand, or the retailers or utilities buying cheaper energy from the real-time market. 
 the researchers weren't able to determine whether such an attack might have already taken place because iot devices - beyond being insecure - also lack the kind of monitoring that would be necessary to detect such hijacking. but they used real data sets from two of the largest u.s. energy markets - new york and california - to evaluate the feasibility of their proposed attack. 
 ""we did a lot of simulation and mathematical analysis to show that this kind of transfer could occur,"" said 
 raheem beyah , the motorola foundation professor in the school of electrical and computer engineering who is also georgia tech's vice president for interdisciplinary research and co-founder of the company fortiphyd logic. ""we also did a feasibility analysis of the supporting areas to show that this would be possible from various perspectives."" 
 the researchers assume that such botnets already exist, and that attackers could simply rent their use on the dark web. more than 20 million smart thermostats already exist in the north american market, and they are connected to at least one high-wattage device - a heating and air-conditioning system that could be controlled by attackers on an intermittent basis. 
 ""if you consider all of the smart thermostats and internet-connected electric ovens, water heaters, and electric vehicle chargers that are already in use, there are plenty of devices to be compromised,"" shekari said. ""homeowners would likely never notice if the ev charger turns on when electricity demand is highest, or if the air conditioning cools a little more than they expected when they are not home."" 
 to counter the potential attack, researchers suggest both detection and prevention steps. through integrated monitoring of the normal power use of high-wattage iot-connected devices, unexpected peaks or valleys in power consumption triggered by an attacker could be detected. and access to data on expected energy demand - which is now made available publicly - could be restricted to those who actually need it. 
 the primary factor that makes this attack possible is the detailed online data sharing of electricity market information, which is usually updated every five minutes. 
 ""this energy demand information is really a data privacy issue, and we need to think long and hard about the balance between transparency and security,"" beyah said. ""there's always a tension there, but limiting the amount of detail could make it more difficult for attackers who want to hide their manipulations to know what the normal variations are."" 
 the potential attack highlights the need for considering cybersecurity threats in technology areas where they had perhaps never been possible before. 
 ""this is an interesting intersection between the iot security world and energy markets,"" said beyah. ""right now, it seems that there is a large gap between the two worlds. our point is that there are implications for combining iot technology and high-wattage devices that can compromise markets in ways we would never have thought of before."" 
 the presentation, ""iot skimmer: energy market manipulation through high-wattage iot botnets,"" will be presented on wednesday, aug. 5, at 2:30 p.m. as part of the black hat usa 2020 conference.

balancing-parenthood-and-pursuit-phd.txt,"balancing parenthood and the pursuit of a ph.d. 
 midori wasielewski dreamed of earning her ph.d. ever since she was a child. friday, she'll share that moment with her husband, family and young daughter. 
 midori wasielewski with her husband, andrew, and their daughter following her dissertation defense. 
 dec 13, 2022 
 - atlanta, ga 
 defending a 120-page dissertation on immunology and biomaterials may be a daunting task for most on its own, but in the final year of her biomedical engineering ph.d. program, midori wasielewski's mornings began when her daughter woke up and ended in the late hours of the evening, with a full day's work at the lab in between. 
 while the challenges of being a new mom and the interruption of a pandemic may have presented obstacles, wasielewski never wavered on her path to graduation. reflecting on a piece of advice that stuck with her throughout her time on campus, she chose actor and author sean patrick flanery's message to ""do something today that your future self will thank you for."" 
 when her daughter was born in 2021, wasielewski knew that the hard work was not only for her future self but also for her growing family. ""even though it was extremely hard working around the clock and not getting a lot of sleep, i was very driven to complete the program at that point and also to set a good example for my baby,"" she said. 
 unlike her research in engineering a dna-based biomaterial to aid doctors and clinicians in identifying patients at high risk for autoimmune diseases, raising a child is not an exact science. along with the support of her husband, andrew, there is a place on campus that will forever hold a special place in wasielewski's heart -  the children's campus at georgia tech . 
 ""none of this could have happened without the children's campus. i was very lucky that they opened their doors to me and my daughter. without day care being a five-minute walk from my lab, this would not have happened. georgia tech was awesome in supporting me as a mom and as a ph.d. student,"" she said. 
 wasielewski arrived at tech in 2017 alongside her advisor 
 shuichi takayama , whose lab she joined after earning her master's in macromolecular engineering at the university of michigan. having become a father while earning his ph.d., takayama - professor, gra eminent scholar, and price gilbert jr. chair in the 
 wallace h. coulter department of biomedical engineering 
 - served as an inspiration to wasielewski as she navigated the early days of parenthood. 
 ""when i was exhausted and delirious, i would just think to myself, ‘tomorrow, i'll be thankful if i just write for 30 minutes or if i just plan this experiment.' when i did sit down and do that, it usually turned into one or two hours. all those small efforts built into this huge thing, and looking back, i can't believe i actually finished,"" she said. 
 the only thing that could keep wasielewski away from her research was covid-19. out of the lab for two months, she dealt with the uncertainty by pouring all of her efforts into her dissertation, which has now been successfully defended after a full-on sprint to the finish line. 
 ""one of the affirmations you learn during pregnancy and as a mom is that you can do anything for five minutes or for a short amount of time, and i applied that to me,"" she said. ""it was a period of sacrifice - completely unsustainable - but we knew we could do this."" 
 next, wasielewski intends to pursue research and development opportunities in the biotech industry, but not before taking some well-earned time off to spend with her family.

banning-words-instagram-doesnt-help-it-makes-it-worse.txt,"banning words on instagram doesn't help - it makes it worse 
 the pro-eating disorder community outsmarted instagram censors in order to continue sharing content. 
 mar 09, 2016 
 - atlanta, ga 
 a new georgia tech study finds that instagram's decision to ban certain words commonly used by pro-eating disorder (pro-ed) communities has produced an unintended effect. the use of those terms decreased when they were censored in 2012. but users adapted by simply making up new, almost identical words, driving up participation and support within pro-ed groups by as much as 30 percent. the georgia tech researchers found that these communities are still very active and thriving despite instagram's efforts to moderate discussion of the dangerous lifestyle. people in pro-ed communities share content, and provide advice and support for those who choose eating disorders, such as anorexia or bulimia, as acceptable and reasonable ways of living. they use specific hashtags to form very connected groups, often using anonymous names to keep their lifestyle choice a secret from the families and friends. instagram banned some of the most common pro-ed tags four years ago. people can still post these censored terms, but the words no longer show up in search results. banned examples include ""thighgap,"" ""thinspiration"" and ""secretsociety."" other pro-ed words received advisories. they can be searched, but notifications about graphic content were added, along with public service links for people looking for help. the georgia tech researchers looked at 2.5 million pro-ed posts from 2011 to 2014 to study how the community reacted to instagram's content moderation. ""people pretty much stopped using the banned terms, but they gamed the system to stay in touch,"" said stevie chancellor, a doctoral student who led the study. ""'thinspiration' was replaced by ‘thynspiration' and ‘thynspo.' ‘thighgap' became ‘thightgap' and ‘thygap.'"" the 17 moderated terms morphed into hundreds of similar, new words. each had an average of 40 variables. some had more: the researchers found 107 variables of ""thighgap."" instagram's censorship polarized the pro-ed community. ""likes and comments on these new tags were 15 to 30 percent higher compared to the originals,"" said munmun de choudhury, assistant professor in georgia tech's school of interactive computing. ""before the ban, a person searching for hashtags would only find their intended word. now a search produces dozens of similar, non-censored pro-ed terms. that means more content to view and engage with."" the team also found that the content on these so-called lexical variants discussed self-harm, isolation and thoughts of suicide more often than the larger community of sufferers of eating disorders. instagram has also blacklisted words related to sex, racism and self-harm. what is more effective than banning tags? the georgia tech team suggests a few alternatives. ""allow them to be searchable. but once they're selected, the landing page could include links for help organizations,"" said chancellor. ""maybe the search algorithms could be tweaked. instead of similar terms being displayed, instagram could introduce recovery-related terms in the search box."" the study, 
 "" # thyghgapp: instagram content moderation and lexical variation in pro-eating disorder communities ,"" was presented at the 
 acm conference on computer-supported cooperative work and social computing 
 on march 1 in san francisco.

bathroom-scale-could-monitor-millions-heart-failure.txt,"bathroom scale could monitor millions with heart failure 
 this scale could help keep heart failure patients out of the hospital. 
 purchased getty images photo of a bathroom scale. not for reuse or redistribution outside of georgia tech. 
 sep 20, 2019 
 - atlanta, ga 
 ""good morning. bill. please. step onto the scale. touch the metal pads."" the device records an electrocardiogram from bill's fingers and - more importantly - circulation pulsing that makes his body subtly bob up and down on the scale. machine learning tools compute that bill's heart failure symptoms have worsened. 
 this is how researchers at the georgia institute of technology envision their experimental device reaching patients someday, and  in a new study , they reported proof-of-concept success in recording and processing data from 43 patients with heart failure. a future marketable version of the medical monitoring scale would ideally notify a doctor, who would call bill to adjust his medication at home, hopefully sparing him a long hospital stay and needless suffering. 
 the pulsing and bobbing signal is called a  ballistocardiogram  (bcg), a measurement researchers took more commonly about 100 years ago but gave up on as imaging technology far surpassed it. the researchers are making it useful again with modern computation. 
 ""our work is the first time that bcgs have been used to classify the status of heart failure patients,"" said omer inan, the study's principal investigator and  an associate professor in georgia tech's school of electrical and computer engineering . 
 healthcare crisis 
 heart failure  affects 6.5 million americans and is a slow-progressing disease, in which the heart works less and less effectively. many people know it as congestive heart failure because a major symptom is fluid buildup, which can overwhelm the lungs, impeding breathing and possibly causing death. 
 patients endure repeat hospitalizations to adjust medications when their condition dips, or ""decompensates,"" making heart failure a major driver of hospital admissions and healthcare costs. home monitoring reduces hospitalizations but currently requires an invasive procedure. 
 georgia tech research was behind the launch  of such an implantable  heart failure home monitoring device  in 2011. but this new solution would potentially dispense with the procedure, cost much less, and be much simpler to use - lowering patients' resistance to home monitoring. 
 given its early stage, the study's bcg-ekg scale performed well in hospital tests but also in in-home tests, which was promising, since the solution principally targets eventual home use. 
 the research team, which included collaborators from the university of california, san francisco, and northwestern university,  published their results in august 2019, in the journal  ieee transactions on biomedical engineering . the research was funded by the national heart, lung and blood institute at the national institutes of health. 
 ballisto scribble 
 the ekg part of the experimental scale is not new nor its great diagnostic information, but it alone does not say enough about heart failure. the bcg part is mostly new, and it appears valuable to heart failure monitoring but also challenging to record and interpret. 
 ""the ecg (ekg) has characteristic waves that clinicians have understood for 100 years, and now, computers read it a lot of the time,"" inan said. ""elements of the bcg signal aren't really known well yet, and they haven't been measured in patients with heart failure very much at all."" 
 the ekg is electrical; the body conducts its signals well, and the recordings are clear. 
 the bcg is a mechanical signal; body fat dampens it, and it faces a lot of interference in the body like tissue variations and muscle movement. bcgs are also noisier in people with cardiovascular disease. 
 patients with heart failure tend to be feebler, and initially, the researchers worried they would wobble on scales during home tests, adding even more noise to the bcgs. but the recordings were very productive. 
 though a bcg read-out is scribble compared to an ekg's near-uniform etchings, bcgs have some patterns that parallel an ekg's. for example, the big upward spike in an ekg is followed by the bcg's big ""j-wave."" 
 inconsistent throbbing 
 the researchers processed bcgs with three machine learning algorithms, revealing patterns that differ when a patient's heart failure is compensated, that is, healthier, from when it is decompensated. 
 ""in someone with decompensated heart failure, the cardiovascular system can no longer  compensate for the reduced heart function , and then the flow of blood through the arteries is more disorderly, and we see it in the mechanical signal of the bcg,"" inan said. ""that difference does not show up in the ecg because it's an electrical signal."" 
 ""the most important characteristic was the degree to which the bcg is variable, which would mean inconsistent blood flow. if you chop up the recording into 20-second intervals and the individual segments differ from each other a lot, that's a good marker of decompensation,"" inan said.

 the postapocalyptic story of the scarlet plague (told with hideous detail) that decimated the planet is narrated by james smith, a classical scholar and one of the few people who remembers pre-plague times. traveling with his grandsons, who live as hunters, he shares his memory of the plague but realizes he cannot share his knowledge of a lost culture with his primitive and largely illiterate grandsons. 
 i recommend london's novella to people who like horror but also to people who want to reflect on what will happen in a post-covid-19 world. smith observes that the survivors in his world ‘have forgotten everything.' we have not, so we have much on which to rebuild.""

 ""in the not-too-spooky but persistently popular horror subgenre of paranormal romance, where vampire-werewolf-human teen love triangles rule the roost, kanaka maoli (native hawaiian) author lehua parker draws on maoli folklore to create this sparky meet-cute between justin, a newly rejected groom from the u.s. continent, and pua, the rebellious daughter of ocean god kanaloa, in the fictional seaside town of lauele, hawaii. blending ""the little mermaid"" with hawaiian spiritual storytelling, this breezy comic novel starts when the restless pua, a shapeshifting shark who hangs out on the beautiful white beaches of lauele (site of parker's other book series such as the niuhu shark saga), is discovered by depressed writer-artist justin while in her human form, whom he finds sleeping on the sand. soon the two share a deep connection despite their different origins (and pua's natural desire to devour people), as parker deftly deploys both paranormal romance beats (especially unresolved sexual tension or ust) and her indigenous sociocultural knowledge to feed this modern ya fairytale. even grown humans can enjoyably surf the hormonal (but pg-rated) ust wave to the end of the couple's story - as well as ride other imaginatively romantic entries in parker's ""kiss"" series of lauele fractured folktales including

behind-iron-curtain-how-methane-making-microbes-kept-early-earth-warm.txt,"behind the iron curtain: how methane-making microbes kept the early earth warm 
 a new study shows how methane may have warmed the early earth. 
 tiny incubators were used to simulate early earth conditions, tracking microbial diversity and methane emissions over a period of 500 days. (credit: rob felt, georgia tech) 
 apr 17, 2017 
 - atlanta, ga 
 for much of its first two billion years, earth was a very different place: oxygen was scarce, microbial life ruled, and the sun was significantly dimmer than it is today. yet the rock record shows that vast seas covered much of the early earth under the faint young sun. 
 scientists have long debated what kept those seas from freezing. a popular theory is that potent gases such as methane - with many times more warming power than carbon dioxide - created a thicker greenhouse atmosphere than required to keep water liquid today. 
 in the absence of oxygen, iron built up in ancient oceans. under the right chemical and biological processes, this iron rusted out of seawater and cycled many times through a complex loop, or ""ferrous wheel."" some microbes could ""breathe"" this rust in order to outcompete others, such as those that made methane. when rust was plentiful, an ""iron curtain"" may have suppressed methane emissions. 
 ""the ancestors of modern methane-making and rust-breathing microbes may have long battled for dominance in habitats largely governed by iron chemistry,"" said marcus bray, a biology ph.d. candidate in the laboratory of 
 jennifer glass , assistant professor in the georgia institute of technology's 
 school of earth and atmospheric sciences 
 and principal investigator of the study funded by nasa's exobiology and evolutionary biology program. the research was reported in the journal 
 geobiology 
 on april 17, 2017. 
 using mud pulled from the bottom of a tropical lake, researchers at georgia tech gained a new grasp of how ancient microbes made methane despite this ""iron curtain."" 
 collaborator sean crowe, an assistant professor at the university of british columbia, collected mud from the depths of indonesia's lake matano, an anoxic iron-rich ecosystem that uniquely mimics early oceans. bray placed the mud into tiny incubators simulating early earth conditions, and tracked microbial diversity and methane emissions over a period of 500 days. minimal methane was formed when rust was added; without rust, microbes kept making methane through multiple dilutions. 
 extrapolating these findings to the past, the team concluded that methane production could have persisted in rust-free patches of ancient seas. unlike the situation in today's well-aerated oceans, where most natural gas produced on the seafloor is consumed before it can reach the surface, most of this ancient methane would have escaped to the atmosphere to trap heat from the early sun.

bernard-f-schutz-elected-fellow-royal-society.txt,"bernard f. schutz elected as fellow of the royal society 
 schutz is honored for seminal contributions to relativistic astrophysics, including the analytical foundation in gravitational wave detection. the center for relativistic astrophysics member helped spark tech's cra, as well as the max planck institute. 
 may 07, 2021 
 - atlanta, ga 
 a 
 school of physics 
 adjunct professor who served as a founding director of the 
 max planck institute for gravitational physics (albert einstein institute - aei) , helped spark the creation of the 
 center for relativistic astrophysics 
 (cra) at georgia tech, and laid the analytical foundation in the search for gravitational waves is now the recipient of top honors from the world's oldest independent scientific academy. 
 bernard f. schutz , also a professor in the 
 school of physics and astronomy at cardiff university , has been elected as a fellow to the 
 royal society , the united kingdom's national academy of sciences. schutz joins a number of distinguished individuals in his scientific discipline - isaac newton, albert einstein, and michael faraday, to name a few - as a royal society fellow. 
 schutz is honored and elected for seminal contributions to relativistic astrophysics, including driving the field for gravitational waves detection - ripples in time and space caused by violent and energetic celestial events, such as colliding black holes - research that helped lead to 
 their direct detection in 2015 . georgia tech played a direct and pivotal role in the analysis of the observed signal, and gravitational wave confirmations earned the 
 2017 nobel prize in physics . 
 ""my general reaction is one of pleasure and humility,"" schutz shares with the college of sciences. ""it is wonderful to be recognized for work that started 35 years ago and still continues, and it is humbling to be joining an academy that has such a distinguished membership."" 
 ""it is a great honor to have professor schutz as adjunct faculty to the cra,"" says laura cadonati, school of physics professor, cra director, and past deputy spokesperson for the laser interferometer gravitational-wave observatory (ligo). ""his vision and advocacy have brought ligo and gravitational waves to georgia tech, and made it possible for georgia tech to play a role in the discovery of gravitational waves and the exploration of the mysteries of the universe with this new messenger."" 
 honoring a groundbreaking career in astrophysics research 
 schutz says he feels the same way he did when, in 2019, he was elected to the 
 u.s. national academy of sciences . with his election to the royal society, schutz is now one of the few full members of both of these two leading scientific academies, ""a privileged position enabled by my having dual citizenship in the two nations."" 
 every year, a maximum of 52 fellows may be elected to the royal society. fellows are elected for life through a peer review process based on their excellence in science. 
 in schutz's case, his election stems from his 1980s work that laid the analytical foundation for data interpretation of gravitational waves. he accomplished this despite the fact that gravitational waves were still in the realm of theory at the time, and that the detectors needed to find them weren't yet invented. 
 schutz's research then helped with what ""the big detectors like ligo and virgo (then just proposals on the drawing board) would gather 30 years later,"" 
 notes the max planck institute (aei) . ""he showed how to use gravitational waves to measure distances across the universe, and how to go from that to measuring the expansion rate of the universe, one of the most fundamental numbers in all astronomy. he then showed how to extract the very weak expected signals from the data, developing methods used to this day. this work continued when schutz came to potsdam, where his department brought into the field a good fraction of the data analysts and supercomputer simulation specialists working in the gravitational-wave science today."" 
 in 2015, ligo scientists would use schutz's work in what would become that 2017 nobel prize-winning research for the first observation of gravitational waves - a collaborative effort that involved a team of school of physics researchers in the cra at georgia tech, who joined hundreds of other scientists around the world in assisting ligo in gathering and analyzing data. 
 cadonati credits schutz for helping to grow the cra. ""in the years preceding discovery, he advocated for stronger ties between the gravitational wave community and the astronomy community, which seeded multi-messenger astrophysics as we know it,"" cadonati notes, referring to astronomical observation that uses signals delivered by different ""messengers"" such as electromagnetic radiation, gravitational waves, neutrinos, and cosmic rays. ""i think it is fair to say professor schutz is one of the founding fathers of multi-messenger astronomy - and the cra is now part of that vision."" 
 investing in the future of relativistic - and multi-messenger - astrophysics 
 schutz put georgia tech on that path in 2011, when he made his first trip to the institute to seek out more ligo partners. cadonati, along with former georgia tech physics colleagues 
 pablo laguna 
 and 
 deirdre shoemaker , recall that during a chat over lunch, schutz urged then-college of sciences dean 
 paul houston , now an emeritus professor in the 
 school of chemistry and biochemistry , to invest in multi-messenger astrophysics. 
 ""it was a time when we needed to get more universities involved in the ligo project so that we could be at full strength when the data started to come in again,"" schutz explains. ""in particular, the numerical simulations of black holes that pablo laguna and deirdre shoemaker were performing at the time were providing essential input to our ability to interpret signals when we eventually began to detect them - starting, of course, in 2015."" 
 under cadonati's leadership, schutz adds, ""the cra will continue to play a very important role in that collaboration. seeing this gives me a lot of pleasure."" 
 schutz's career, spanning five decades, has seen him working with some of the most notable names in science. when he received his ph.d. in 1971 from the california institute of technology, his supervisor was future nobel prize-winning physicist kip thorne. he then moved on to cambridge university, where he worked with the late stephen hawking. 
 schutz started at university college cardiff, now cardiff university, in 1974. it was there that schutz developed the theories that would later become the standard search tools for finding signs of gravitational waves within data. 
 in 1995, schutz moved to germany to join jürgen ehlers as one of two founding directors of the max planck institute for gravitational physics (albert einstein institute - aei), which stands as the largest research institute in the world devoted to gravitational science, covering the entire spectrum of gravitational physics, ""from the giant dimensions of the universe to the tiny scales of strings."" 
 retiring from that post in 2014, he returned to cardiff university as a professor in physics and astronomy and as the first director of the university's data innovation research institute. 
 in addition to his election to the royal society and the u.s. national academy of sciences, schutz is a fellow of the 
 american physical society , the 
 institute of physics , and the 
 learned society of wales , and has most recently been awarded the eddington medal from the 
 royal astronomical society , and the 2020 isaacson prize in gravitational wave science from the american physical society.

biomaterial-particles-educate-immune-system-accept-transplanted-islets.txt,"biomaterial particles educate immune system to accept transplanted islets 
 researchers have opened a potentially new pathway for treating type 1 diabetes.

 - atlanta, ga 
 by instructing key immune system cells to accept transplanted insulin-producing islets, researchers have opened a potentially new pathway for treating type 1 diabetes. if the approach is ultimately successful in humans, it could allow type 1 diabetes to be treated without the long-term complications of immune system suppression. 
 the technique, reported june 4 in the journal 
 nature materials , uses synthetic hydrogel particles (microgels) to present a protein known as the fas ligand (fasl) to immune system t-effector cells along with the pancreatic islets being transplanted. the fasl protein ""educates"" the effector cells - which serve as immune system watchdogs - causing them to accept the graft without rejection for at least 200 days in an animal model. 
 the fasl-presenting particles are simply mixed with the living islets before being transplanted into the mice, which suffer from chemically-induced diabetes. the researchers believe the fasl-presenting hydrogels would not need to be personalized, potentially allowing an ""off-the-shelf"" therapy for the transplanted islets. 
 researchers from the georgia institute of technology, university of louisville and university of michigan collaborated on the work, which was supported by the 
 juvenile diabetes research foundation 
 and the 
 national institutes of health . a follow up study testing the approach in non-human primates has already begun. 
 ""we have been able to demonstrate that we can create a biomaterial that interrupts the body's desire to reject the transplant, while not requiring the recipient to remain on continuous standard immunosuppression,"" said 
 haval shirwan , the dr. michael and joan hamilton endowed chair in autoimmune disease at the 
 university of louisville school of medicine 
 and director of the molecular immunomodulation program at the institute for cellular therapeutics at the university. ""we anticipate that further study will demonstrate potential use for many transplant types, including bone marrow and solid organs."" 
 in the united states, some 1.25 million persons have type 1 diabetes, which is different from the more common type 2 diabetes. type 1 diabetes is caused by immune system destruction of the pancreatic islet cells that produce insulin in response to blood glucose levels. treatment involves frequent injection of insulin to replace what the islets no longer produce. there is no long-term cure for the disease, though persons with type 1 diabetes have been treated experimentally with islet cell transplants - which almost always fail after a few years even with strong suppression of the immune system. 
 ""drugs that allow the transplantation of the islet cells are toxic to them,"" said 
 andrés garcía , the rae s. and frank h. neely chair and regents' professor in georgia tech's 
 george w. woodruff school of mechanical engineering . ""clinical trials with transplantation of islets showed effectiveness, but after a few years, the grafts were rejected. there is a lot of hope for this treatment, but we just can't get consistent improvement."" 
 among the problems, garcía said, is toxicity to the islet cells from the immune system suppression, which also makes patients more susceptible to other adverse effects such as infections and tumors. other researchers are exploring techniques to protect the islets from attack, but have so far not been successful. 
 the research reported in 
 nature materials 
 takes a totally different approach. by presenting the fasl protein - which is a central regulator of immune system cells - the researchers can prevent the immune system from attacking the cells. once they are educated at the time of transplantation, the cells appear to retain their acceptance of the transplanted islet cells long after the fasl has disappeared. 
 ""at the time of transplantation, we take the islets that are harvested from cadavers and simply mix them with our particles in the operating room and deliver them to the animal,"" garcía explained. ""we do not have to modify the islets or suppress the immune system. after treatment, the animals can function normally and are cured from the diabetes while retaining their full immune system operation."" 
 the hydrogels can be prepared up to two weeks ahead of the transplant, and can be used with any islet cells. ""the key technical advance is the ability to make this material that induces immune acceptance that can simply be mixed with the islets and delivered. we can make the biomaterial in our lab and ship them to where the transplantation will be done, potentially making it an off-the-shelf therapeutic."" 
 in the experimental mice, the islets were implanted into the kidneys and into an abdominal fat pad. if the treatment is ultimately used in humans, the islets and biomaterial would likely be placed laparoscopically into the omentum, a tissue with significant vasculature that is similar to the fat pad in mice. garcia's lab has previously shown that it can stimulate blood vessel growth into islet cells transplanted into this tissue in mice. 
 in future work, the researchers want to see if the graft acceptance can be retained in more complex immune systems, and for longer periods of time. by reducing damage to the cadaver islets, the new technique may be able to expand the number of patients that can treated with available donor cells. 
 garcía's lab uses polymer hydrogel particles that are about 150 microns in diameter, about the same size as the islet cells. they engineer the particles to capture the fasl - a novel recombinant protein developed by shirwan and esma s. yolcu, associate professor of microbiology and immunology at the university of louisville - on the particle surface, where it can be seen by the effector cells. 
 in addition to those already mentioned, the research team included devon m. headen, maria m. coronel, jessica weaver, michael d. hunckler and christopher t. johnson from georgia tech; kyle b. woodward, pradeep shrestha, hong zhao, min tan, william s. bowen and esma s. yolcu from the university of louisville, and lonnie shea from the university of michigan.

 a new type of biomolecular tweezers could help researchers study how mechanical forces affect the biochemical activity of cells and proteins.

 - atlanta, ga 
 a new type of biomolecular tweezers could help researchers study how mechanical forces affect the biochemical activity of cells and proteins. the devices - too small to see without a microscope - use opposing magnetic and electrophoretic forces to precisely stretch the cells and molecules, holding them in position so that the activity of receptors and other biochemical activity can be studied. arrays of the tweezers could be combined to study multiple molecules and cells simultaneously, providing a high-throughput capability for assessing the effects of mechanical forces on a broad scale. details of the devices, which were developed by researchers at the georgia institute of technology and emory university in atlanta, were published february 19, 2014, in the journal 
 technology . ""our lab has been very interested in mechanical-chemical switches in the extracellular matrix, but we currently have a difficult time interrogating these mechanisms and discovering how they work in vivo,"" said 
 thomas barker , an associate professor in the 
 wallace h. coulter department of biomedical engineering at georgia tech and emory university . ""this device could help biologists and biomedical engineers answer questions that cannot be answered right now."" for example, a cell that's binding the extracellular matrix may bind with one receptor while the matrix is being stretched, and a different receptor when it's not under stress. those binding differences could drive changes in cell phenotype and affect processes such as cell differentiation. but they are now difficult to study. ""having a device like this will allow us to interrogate what the specific binding sites are and what the specific binding triggers are,"" barker explained. ""right now, we know very little about this area when it comes to protein biochemistry."" scientists have been able to study how single cells or proteins are affected by mechanical forces, but their activity can vary considerably from cell-to-cell and among molecules. the new tweezers, which are built using nanolithography, can facilitate studying thousands or more cells and proteins in aggregate. the researchers are currently testing prototype 15 by 15 arrays which they believe could be scaled up. ""for me, it's not sufficient to pull and hold onto a single protein,"" said barker. ""i have to pull and hold onto tens of thousands of proteins to really use the technologies we have to develop molecular probes."" at the center of the tweezers are 2.8- micron polystyrene microbeads that contain superparamagnetic nanoparticles. the tiny beads are engineered to adhere to a sample being studied. that sample is attached to a bead on one side, and to a magnetic pad on the other. the magnet draws the bead toward it, while an electrophoretic force created by current flowing through a gold wiring pattern pushes the bead away. ""the device simultaneously pushes and pulls on the same particle,"" barker explained. ""this allows us to hold the sample at a very specific position above the magnet."" because the forces can be varied, the tweezers can be used to study structures of widely different size scales, from protein molecules to cells - a size difference of approximately a thousand times, noted 
 wilbur lam , an assistant professor in the coulter department. absolute forces in the nano-newton range applied by the two sources overcome the much smaller effects of brownian motion and thermal energy, allowing the tweezers to hold the cells or molecules without constant adjustment. ""we are basically leveraging microchip technology that has been developed by electrical and mechanical engineers,"" lam noted. ""we are able to leverage these very tiny features that enable us to create a very sharp electrical field on one end against an opposing short magnetic field. because there are two ways of controlling it, we have tight resolution and can get to many different scales."" as a proof of principle for the system, the researchers demonstrated its ability to distinguish between antigen binding to loaded magnetic beads coated with different antibodies. when a sufficient upward force is applied, non-specific antibody coated beads are displaced from the antigen-coated device surface, while beads coated with the specific antibody are more strongly attracted to the surface and retained on it. barker and lam began working together on the tweezers three years ago when they realized they had similar interests in studying the effects of mechanical action on different biological systems. ""we shouldn't be surprised that biology can be dictated by physical parameters,"" lam explained. ""everything has to obey the laws of physics, and mechanics gets to the heart of that."" lam's interest is at the cellular scale, specifically in blood cells. ""blood cells also respond differently, biologically, when you squeeze them and when you stretch them,"" he said. ""for instance, we have learned that mechanics has a lot to do with atherosclerosis, but the systems we currently have for studying this mechanism can only look at single-cell events. if you can look at many cells at once, you get a much better statistical view of what's happening."" barker's interests, however, are at the molecular level. ""we are primarily interested in evolving antibodies that are capable of distinguishing different force-mediated conformations of proteins,"" he explained. ""we have a specific protein that we are interested in, but this technique could be applied to any proteins that are suspected to have these force-activated changes in their biochemical activity."" while the tweezers meet the specific experimental needs of lam and barker, the researchers hope to find other applications. the tweezers were developed in collaboration with graduate student lizhi cao and post-doctoral fellow zhengchun peng. ""because of the scale we are able to examine - both molecular and cellular - i think this will have a lot of applications both in protein molecular engineering and biotechnology,"" lam said. ""this could be a useful way for people to screen relevant molecules because there currently aren't good ways to do that."" beyond biological systems, the device could be used in materials development, microelectronics and even sensing. ""this ability to detect discrete binding and unbinding events between molecular species is of high interest right now,"" barker added. ""biosensor applications come out of this naturally."" citation : lizhi cao, et al., ""a combined magnetophoresis / dielectrophoresis based microbead array as a high-throughput biomolecular tweezers,"" (technology 2014).

birth-massive-black-holes-early-universe-revealed.txt,"birth of massive black holes in the early universe revealed 
 new research shows that when galaxies assemble extremely rapidly - and sometimes violently - that can lead to the formation of very massive black holes.

 - atlanta, ga 
 the light released from around the first massive black holes in the universe is so intense that it is able to reach telescopes across the entire expanse of the universe. incredibly, the light from the most distant black holes (or quasars) has been traveling to us for more than 13 billion light years. however, we do not know how these monster black holes formed. 
 new research led by researchers from georgia institute of technology, 
 dublin city university , 
 michigan state university , the 
 university of california at san diego , the 
 san diego supercomputer center 
 and ibm provides a new and extremely promising avenue for solving this cosmic riddle. the team showed that when galaxies assemble extremely rapidly - and sometimes violently - that can lead to the formation of very massive black holes. in these rare galaxies, normal star formation is disrupted and black hole formation takes over. 
 the new study finds that massive black holes form in dense starless regions that are growing rapidly, turning upside down the long-accepted belief that massive black hole formation was limited to regions bombarded by the powerful radiation of nearby galaxies. conclusions of the simulation-based study, reported january 23 in the journal 
 nature 
 and supported by funding from the national science foundation, the european union and nasa, also finds that massive black holes are much more common in the universe than previously thought. 
 the key criteria for determining where massive black holes formed during the universe's infancy relates to the rapid growth of pre-galactic gas clouds that are the forerunners of all present-day galaxies, meaning that most supermassive black holes have a common origin forming in this newly discovered scenario, said 
 john wise , an associate professor in the 
 center for relativistic astrophysics 
 in georgia tech's school of physics and the paper's corresponding author. dark matter collapses into halos that are the gravitational glue for all galaxies. early rapid growth of these halos prevented the formation of stars that would have competed with black holes for gaseous matter flowing into the area. 
 ""in this study, we have uncovered a totally new mechanism that sparks the formation of massive black holes in particular dark matter halos,"" wise said. ""instead of just considering radiation, we need to look at how quickly the halos grow. we don't need that much physics to understand it - just how the dark matter is distributed and how gravity will affect that. forming a massive black hole requires being in a rare region with an intense convergence of matter."" 
 when the research team found these black hole formation sites in the simulation they were at first stumped, said john regan, research fellow in the centre for astrophysics and relativity in dublin city university. the previously accepted paradigm was that massive black holes could only form when exposed to high levels of nearby radiation. 
 ""previous theories suggested this should only happen when the sites were exposed to high levels of star-formation killing radiation,"" he said. ""as we delved deeper, we saw that these sites were undergoing a period of extremely rapid growth. that was the key. the violent and turbulent nature of the rapid assembly, the violent crashing together of the galaxy's foundations during the galaxy's birth prevented normal star formation and led to perfect conditions for black hole formation instead. this research shifts the previous paradigm and opens up a whole new area of research."" 
 the earlier theory relied on intense ultraviolet radiation from a nearby galaxy to inhibit the formation of stars in the black hole-forming halo, said michael norman, director of the san diego supercomputer center at uc san diego and one of the work's authors. ""while uv radiation is still a factor, our work has shown that it is not the dominant factor, at least in our simulations,"" he explained. 
 the research was based on the renaissance simulation suite, a 70-terabyte data set created on the blue waters supercomputer between 2011 and 2014 to help scientists understand how the universe evolved during its early years. to learn more about specific regions where massive black holes were likely to develop, the researchers examined the simulation data and found ten specific dark matter halos that should have formed stars given their masses but only contained a dense gas cloud. using the stampede2 supercomputer, they then re-simulated two of those halos - each about 2,400 light-years across - at much higher resolution to understand details of what was happening in them 270 million years after the big bang. 
 ""it was only in these overly-dense regions of the universe that we saw these black holes forming,"" wise said. ""the dark matter creates most of the gravity, and then the gas falls into that gravitational potential, where it can form stars or a massive black hole."" 
 the renaissance simulations are the most comprehensive simulations of the earliest stages of the gravitational assembly of the pristine gas composed of hydrogen and helium and cold dark matter leading to the formation of the first stars and galaxies. they use a technique known as adaptive mesh refinement to zoom in on dense clumps forming stars or black holes. in addition, they cover a large enough region of the early universe to form thousands of objects-a requirement if one is interested in rare objects, as is the case here. ""the high resolution, rich physics and large sample of collapsing halos were all needed to achieve this result,"" said norman. 
 the improved resolution of the simulation done for two candidate regions allowed the scientists to see turbulence and the inflow of gas and clumps of matter forming as the black hole precursors began to condense and spin. their growth rate was dramatic. 
 ""astronomers observe supermassive black holes that have grown to a billion solar masses in 800 million years,"" wise said. ""doing that required an intense convergence of mass in that region. you would expect that in regions where galaxies were forming at very early times."" 
 another aspect of the research is that the halos that give birth to black holes may be more common than previously believed. 
 ""an exciting component of this work is the discovery that these types of halos, though rare, may be common enough,"" said brian o'shea, a professor at michigan state university.  ""we predict that this scenario would happen enough to be the origin of the most massive black holes that are observed, both early in the universe and in galaxies at the present day."" 
 future work with these simulations will look at the lifecycle of these massive black hole formation galaxies, studying the formation, growth and evolution of the first massive black holes across time. ""our next goal is to probe the further evolution of these exotic objects. where are these black holes today? can we detect evidence of them in the local universe or with gravitational waves?"" regan asked. 
 for these new answers, the research team - and others - may return to the simulations. 
 ""the renaissance simulations are sufficiently rich that other discoveries can be made using data already computed,"" said norman. ""for this reason we have created a public archive at sdsc containing called the renaissance simulations laboratory where others can pursue questions of their own.""

 during georgia tech's black history month lecture on february 11, presented by institute diversity and aasu, benjamin crump delivered a keynote speech on ""the criminal justice system, # blacklivesmatter, and college student activism today."" 
 during georgia tech's third annual black history month lecture on february 11, presented by institute diversity and the african-american student union (aasu), benjamin crump, partner of parks && crump law firm, delivered a keynote speech on ""the criminal justice system, # blacklivesmatter, and college student activism today."" crump is known for his cases with civil rights implications. 
 feb 22, 2016 
 - atlanta, ga 
 the popularity of the social media hashtag # blacklivesmatter can be traced to 2012, when george zimmerman was acquitted in the murder of trayvon martin. the impact of # blacklivesmatter was felt again last fall, when higher education institutions received public demands from students about addressing culture and climate on college campuses and renewing dialogue on the ways society is falling short in its pledge of ""liberty and justice for all."" during georgia tech's third annual black history month lecture on february 11, presented by institute diversity and the african-american student union (aasu), benjamin crump, partner of parks & crump law firm, delivered a keynote speech on ""the criminal justice system, # blacklivesmatter, and college student activism today."" crump is known for his cases with civil rights implications. ""diversity is a community value - a value that georgia tech has prioritized in its strategic plan. we were honored that benjamin crump spoke at this year's black history month lecture - as we are finding social justice through social media movements in the 21 st 
 century,"" said archie ervin, vice president of institute diversity. during crump's keynote address, one question was asked repeatedly: ""georgia tech, where do you stand?"" he remarked, ""georgia tech is one of the finest institutions in the world. how can you use your influence - your technical and entrepreneurial knowledge - to take a stand? we need to take a position because it is the right thing to do."" crump represented trayvon martin's family at the start of the # blacklivesmatter social movement as the case was catapulted into the national spotlight. even though crump never had the chance to meet trayvon, he recalled the sound of hopelessness from trayvon's father, tracy martin, after his son was shot. ""my son was walking home from the 7-eleven when the neighborhood watch volunteer shot and killed him, and they're not going to arrest him. travyon was unarmed, holding a bag of skittles and an iced tea,"" recounted crump from martin. under florida's stand your ground statute, police were prohibited from arresting zimmerman, so according to crump, ""people found justice through social media. the major media outlets could not ignore the case because # blacklivesmatter was omnipresent on social media."" ""we need laws that tell people your life matters,"" concluded crump. ""by standing up for the trayvon martins and michael browns of the world, it makes america a great beacon of hope for the rest of the world to marvel. we all have a role to play. figure out what role you play to make lives better for all our children."" raianna brown, president of aasu, echoed crump's sentiments, commenting on students' role. ""we enjoyed hearing how the criminal justice system contributed to the recent # blacklivesmatter and college student activism movements,"" she said. ""it is important to learn how we, as students, can help make the criminal justice system more equitable."" to learn more about the black history month lecture, visit

 updated may 27, 2022 
 the sunset date planned for georgia tech's use of the bluejeans videoconferencing platform has been extended to june 14. any recordings that are still present in bluejeans after the new june 14   deadline will be 
 permanently 
 deleted. in order to provide additional support and training, the office of information technology will offer office hours: 
 ·         wednesday, june 1, from 10 a.m - 2 p.m. 
 ·         thursday, june 2, from 1 - 4 p.m. 
 ·         tuesday, june 7, from 10 a.m. - 2 p.m. 
 ·         thursday, june 9, from 1 - 4 p.m. 
 ·         monday, june 13, from 10 a.m. - 4 p.m. 
 original story: 
 georgia tech will sunset the bluejeans videoconferencing solution on monday, may 30. campus users are encouraged to migrate stored recordings before then. 
 the bluejeans decommission is a culmination of a review by the 
 video collaboration review  (vcr) committee. the group was established to evaluate new videoconferencing solutions for academic course delivery and collaboration against existing services. driven by georgia tech professional education (gtpe) and the office of information technology (oit), the committee brought in student, faculty, and staff voices from across the institute to identify video collaboration service offerings. ultimately, plans to sunset bluejeans and webex (except for the georgia tech research institute*) were formalized. 
 the vcr committee also announced a soft launch of the  zoom  video collaboration platform. 
 ""not only did zoom, to a large extent, meet our committee's criteria, but it is also one of the most widely used video collaboration tools,"" yakut gazi, ph.d., associate dean for learning systems at gtpe, 
 said 
 earlier this year. ""many of our students, faculty, and staff have participated in zoom meetings during and even before the pandemic, which we anticipate will facilitate adoption at georgia tech."" since the soft launch, the platform has facilitated over 2,700 meetings and webinars by tech users. 
 in preparation for the transition from bluejeans, students, faculty, and staff are encouraged to migrate stored lecture, meeting, and event recordings to 
 kaltura mediaspace 
 via the 
 bluejeans video exporter 
 tool. the exporter will move a maximum of five videos simultaneously, with each video typically taking a few minutes to upload. archived videos can take up to five hours, depending on the video's length. 
 oit has published an 
 11-step illustrated knowledge article 
 to guide campus users during the recording transfer process. campus users who need further assistance can also submit a help request via the services and support site at 
 gatech.service-now.com / home . 
 in addition to zoom, georgia tech will continue to offer and support 
 microsoft teams , which offers videoconferencing, secure file storage, chat, meeting, calling, and file-sharing capabilities. 
 oit will work with the georgia tech community throughout the rest of the spring semester to prepare for the transition from bluejeans. upcoming communications will share additional information.

 they came with their gadgets, their gizmos, and devices. they used algorithms, calculations, and scientific exercises. 
 more than 200 teams from a dozen schools in three colleges showcased their projects at the 2018 spring capstone design expo, and while they all hoped to take home an award, the fact that they made it that far was an accomplishment in itself. senior design is a required course for many majors, and capstone represents the culmination of months of work for the seniors who participated. for some students the projects could turn into stepping stones for launching startups. several teams were presented with golden tickets, granting them entry into georgia tech's create-x startup program. others students used their projects to wow sponsors, earning them jobs, continued funding to follow up on their work, or in the very least, an important industry collaboration to put on their resume. 
 bme team 
 kit cath  took home capstone's best overall project award and are hoping it opens some doors for them as they approach graduation and look for jobs. the team is made up of biomedical engineering majors kathleen jordan, lemou tieyam, diana yunda, and alexa schlein developed an adaptable catheter for their sponsors in the interventional radiology department at emory university hospital midtown. inspired by a slinky, the catheter tip can bend and adjust to the curves in a patient's vascular system, resulting in a snug fit and greatly reducing the amount of time radiologists have to spend adjusting catheters. it will also reduce the number of catheter exchanges, wasted product, procedure lengths, costs, and patient discomfort. everyone on the team is interested in pursing careers in the medical device field. 
 for all teams, the night was a reminder of what georgia tech students can accomplish when they put their minds to something. 
 for example, the winning isye team worked with fedex to optimize their linehaul truck fleet. by the team's calculations, adopting their plan will save fedex more than $200,000 per week. the award-winning civil engineering team discovered that by changing the lane striping at the i-285 and i-20 junction on the west side of atlanta, bottlenecks can be eliminated and flow improved for miles in every direction, shaving up to 10 minutes off of commute times. team pham, from materials science and engineering, developed a filter that reduces the acidity of coffee, thereby negating some of the negative effects of drinking it, such as acid reflux and enamel damage. the un-sponsored squad took home the people's choice award at this year's inventure prize competition and is working on commercializing their product.

 the first floor of the student center is home to one of the only on-campus bowling alleys in the southeast. along with eight bowling lanes, tech rec is home to billiards tables, table tennis, air hockey, and foosball. the entire facility is a resource for students on campus who need a break from coursework and classes, and is conveniently located in the center of campus. however, with over 50,000 visitors in the past year, repairs were necessary. due to the amount of traffic that the bowling alley gets, the lanes and gutters were beginning to show signs of wear and tear. 
 the tech rec team presented a proposal for renovation to the georgia tech student government association, who agreed that a makeover was needed in order for tech rec to continue to serve students and faculty alike. the student government association helped direct the student activity funds to restoring tech rec to its former glory. 
 ""the old tech rec gutters were falling apart as they were the original gutters from 1970,"" said teresa weimann, associate program director and tech rec supervisor. ""with the increased usage of the bowling lanes in tech rec, it was important to update these as soon as possible. i was excited to have the funding from sga to install new gutters. these new gutters are made to be sturdy and long-lasting and will look great for many, many years to come."" 
 thanks to the student government association's assistance, tech rec now has newly installed lanes, gutters, and ball returns ready for students to use. it's a great chance for students to visit to try them out and embody tech rec's motto: ""study hard, play harder!""

 the four materials science and engineering majors gathered one august morning for their senior design class. it was 8am and they all sipped coffee. 
 tyler quill joked that his dentist would kill him for drinking coffee, knowing how the beverage's acidity contributes to tooth and enamel erosion. 
 ""then we started talking about why that happens and how great it would be if we could find a way to fix the problem,"" said quill, who is from grayson, ga. 
 together the team designed pham, a filter to reduce coffee's acidity. they incorporated a mineral blend into the structure of the filter paper, which reduces the acidity of the brewed coffee without negatively affecting the taste. 
 the creation is one of six competing for georgia tech's annual invention competition, the 
 inventure prize . the 2018 winner will be picked march 14. 
 the filter wasn't the team's original idea. first, they designed a thermos that would change the ph of coffee once it was poured. but they realized there was an easier method that could be used earlier in the process. 
 ""coffee is brewed with a filter so we realized why not change the ph level during the process of making the coffee,"" said birmingham native aaron stansell. ""we're the basic solution to your acidity problem."" 
 the challenge then became how to put the acidity-reducing mineral blend into the filter paper. fortunately, team member michele lauto, who is from santa monica, worked at the institute of paper and science technology (now called the 
 renewable bioproducts institute ) during freshman year and had ideas about adding another layer to the filter. 
 the pham filter fits in standard coffee makers and the grounds brew in a normal manner. the team ran tests proving their mineral blend neutralizes the acidity. it doesn't change the taste, although some people say the coffee tastes smoother and more rounded, said lucas votaw, from herndon, va. 
 the team hopes to get pham into coffee shops and restaurants around the country. 
 inventure won't be the last time pham is on display. it is also their project for the spring 
 capstone design expo .

 - atlanta, ga 
 when anushk mittal was a freshman he turned to memes to relax after a stressful day of classes. he soon realized that in addition to being fun, memes offered a positive way for people to interact with one another. 
 mittal, a second-year computer science major, later paired up with joshua wang, a third-year computer science major, and together they created an all-meme platform. the platform, 
 memeois , crawls the internet for memes and uses machine learning to curate a personalized feed. think of instagram, but for memes. 
 the invention is one of six competing for the 
 inventure prize , georgia tech's annual invention competition. the winner will be announced march 14. 
 ""we've created an accessible network where people can discover and experience the magic of memes and share it with everyone,"" said mittal, who is from new delhi, india. ""there's so much negativity in the world and we're all under so much stress that it's nice to give people a way to step back, relax and realize how wonderful life is. memes help us do that."" 
 wang said inventure provides an opportunity for memeois to attract more attention and resources. 
 they launched memeois on ios in september and it has already attracted more than 50,000 active users in 86 different countries. more than 4 million memes interactions have been conducted through the platform. 
 the platform is free and without advertisements. the plan is to earn money through business-to-business solutions, mittal said, noting that memes lead to high user engagement. 
 memeois uses machine learning and will recommend memes. the platform also offers share and search features, which allow for meme-filled conversations, mittal said. 
 ""we help people be creative and innovative with memes,"" said wang, who is from seoul, south korea. ""i've always wanted to help connect people's lives through modern technology. it's like what we learned in our introduction to programming classes -- technologies do impact the world and computers can help connect people.""

brook-byers-professor-weissburg-wins-3m-grant-bring-biologically-inspired-design.txt,"brook byers professor weissburg wins $3m grant to bring biologically inspired design to high schools 
 four-year project will bring teachers into georgia tech labs and create new curriculum materials for them to use in class. 
 engineers and scientists study nature to find new ideas for designs and processes. for example, how a ladybug folds its wings can inspire new designs for compact satellites. with a new grant, georgia tech researchers will help high school teachers bring those kinds of engineering concepts into their classrooms. 
 aug 09, 2019 
 - atlanta, ga 
 the way a ladybug folds its wings can help aerospace engineers design more compact satellites. studying how ants dig tunnels could help us create our own tunnels more efficiently. 
 the idea of using nature's examples to develop products and designs that benefit society is the cornerstone of a new project at georgia tech that aims to get more high school students interested in engineering. 
 funded by the national science foundation (nsf) , the $3 million effort will put high school engineering teachers in research labs at georgia tech for five weeks. the teachers will be embedded with engineers and scientists, working at the forefront of what's called biologically inspired design, and creating a curriculum for the teachers to use in their classrooms. 
 ""lots of people think animals and what they do is insanely cool  - and the internet agrees - which means we can engage interest in engineering by making a link to biology as a way to solve engineering challenges,"" said 
 marc weissburg , project leader and professor in the school of biological sciences. ""the act of trying to see how an animal might help find a solution to a problem is a very creative process. it challenges the notion that engineering is boring. high school engineering experiences vary widely, but they generally do not include the most cutting-edge topics, like bio-inspired design, which gets people really excited,"" he said. 
 for the next four years, weissburg will collaborate with researchers meltem alemdar, michael helms, roxanne moore and michael ryan at 
 georgia tech's center for education integrating science, mathematics and computing . they'll create and assess units for 10th, 11th and 12th graders that explore bio-inspired design in the context of problems that are relatable to teenagers. 
 in particular, the researchers see their approach as a way to reach girls, who may not have considered engineering as a potential career. weissburg pointed to data from the center for digital education that showed 24% of male high school students expressed interest in engineering. for young women, the number was just 11%. 
 ""too often, engineering is depicted as applied math and science, which completely neglects how human-centered engineering is,"" said weissburg, who also co-directs the center for biologically inspired design at georgia tech and is a brook byers professor. 
 the project will generate a curriculum with design and build exercises, background materials for teachers, examples to spark discussion, tests, and other resources that can be used by teachers across the country. researchers will examine how well the curriculum engages students, particularly those from groups underrepresented in engineering. 
 ""states have different standards, and teacher goals and classes have to be responsive to their unique student audience,"" weissburg said. ""our series of resources, all of which will be online, will allow teachers to easily slot in material that fits for them. it will allow them to talk to us and each other about best practices."" 
 the research team has partnered with gwinnett county public schools to identify the first group of teachers they'll invite to participate. weissburg said that will happen in late spring 2020. 
 ""bio-inspired engineering is a unique way of thinking, and so we have to help the teachers understand how to encourage this in their students.""

building-gas-pipeline-halfway-across-world.txt,"building a gas pipeline halfway across the world 
 decie autin, che 80, helped lead exxonmobil's $19 billion project in papua new guinea. 
 jan 14, 2015 
 - atlanta, ga 
 at georgia tech, decie autin studied and trained to be an engineer, not a community relations expert. but when exxonmobil selected her in 2008 to be the supervising project executive for the construction of a major new liquid natural gas pipeline, autin knew that to be successful, she'd have to work closely with local families and landowners. it's one of the many skills autin has had to learn while moving up from front-line engineering to management. however, this project wasn't situated in any community close to autin's home in houston. the pipeline was to be built halfway around the world in papua new guinea.this location presented extraordinary challenges for autin and her team-and not just due to the distance. for one, the papua new guinea liquid natural gas (pnglng) pipeline proved to be intimidating simply because of the path it traces. ""the line travels 700 kilometers to carry natural gas from the country's highlands across terrain that's very rugged, with lots of mountains and volcanoes, down to the coast near port moseby to be processed into lng,"" autin says. culturally, the country is also very different than the united states. ""papua new guinea has more than 800 languages,"" autin says. ""and its people are spread out, 85 percent of them living in rural settings, living in little pockets."" to complicate matters even more, most of the country's roughly 7 million citizens had little-to-no experience seeing a woman in such a leadership position. all of these added up to make the pnglng project the most challenging one she's ever worked on in her 30-plus years with exxonmobil. the logistical hurdles of building the pipeline from mountaintop to shore were trickier than she could have imagined. ""when you face problems, you need to work through the logic to solve them,"" autin says. on the pnglng project, we faced so many issues: ‘how do you move this, how do you get these people to agree, how do you work with the government?'"" the pipeline's remote point of origin demonstrated just one of several difficult problems that autin and her team faced. there was a single 800-kilometer highway into the hides area where the natural gas was drilled and produced-the last 200 kilometers of which were unpaved. faced with either building an airport or driving supplies all the way up that road, autin loaded up in a truck and surveyed the road for herself. what she found was a major infrastructure project: there were not just 200 kilometers of road to pave, but also 98 bridges to cross, many of which required upgrades to use. ""we ran the economics, and the airport won out,"" autin says. building the airport, the pipeline itself and other related work, the pnglng project employed up to 22,000 people at its peak. in total, more than 55,000 individuals from across the globe were somehow involved in the pipeline's construction. after an estimated $19 billion in construction costs, the pipeline today produces 1 billion cubic feet of liquid natural gas each day. and it was autin who stood in charge of making sure everything went as planned. ""my commitment was to deliver on the entire project,"" she says. not only did autin fulfill her commitment, she did so ahead of expectations. the pnglng project shipped its first cargo load of natural gas in may 2014, five months ahead of schedule. the liquid natural gas pipeline will meet rising natural gas demands in asia-particularly japan, hong kong and china. as happy as autin is with the pnglng's technical successes, she also found tremendous fulfillment in her role working directly with the people of papua new guinea. exxonmobil sponsored numerous community efforts throughout the duration of the pipeline construction and, during her free time, autin became very involved in developing programs to help empower and train the country's women. ""one of exxonmobil's core efforts across the globe is to help educate women,"" autin says. ""anytime you educate the women in a community, you expand the limits of what they can do."" in the end, autin left a strong imprint on the nation-so strong that a papua new guinea firm, hides gas development company (hgdc), now sponsors the decie autin engineering scholarship for women. hgdc chairman libe parindali says autin was chosen as the scholarship's namesake to honor the pipeline as an impressive feat of engineering, as well as to tribute her humble and capable leadership. autin's reaction fit the chairman's description. ""at first i was embarrassed … then i was proud,"" autin says. ""i'm very fortunate and very blessed. there were plenty of women on our project team. of all people, i thought it was interesting that they wanted to honor me."" this originally appeared in vol. 90, no. 4 of the  georgia tech alumni magazine .

 biomedical engineering at georgia tech has risen from a handful of projects to national prominence in just two decades. today, more than half of all incoming freshman pursue a degree in biomedical engineering, biochemistry, or biology. these students want to both understand living systems and make things that improve people's lives. now, more than ever, those opportunities are plentiful in biosciences at georgia tech, where researchers are creating medical devices for children, understanding how diseases occur, improving vaccines, and building better biomaterials for drug delivery. georgia tech's unique blend of engineering, biology, chemistry, and computing - along with partnerships with world-class medical facilities in atlanta, such as emory university and children's healthcare of atlanta - has transformed the institute's campus into a magnet for bio-minded scientists. ""what we bring to the table is a new perspective in the biological sciences that is data driven, that is quantitative, that focuses on devices and techniques and on being unafraid to ask fundamental questions,"" said ravi bellamkonda, the chair and professor of the wallace h. coulter department of biomedical engineering at georgia tech and emory university. ""it's a different approach to biology as an engineer."" the rise of biomedical engineering at georgia tech has created a ripple effect across the biosciences on campus. biologists studying genetics, ecology, and personalized medicine are collaborating with engineers to solve challenging medical problems. the bio quad, home to the parker h. petit institute for bioengineering and bioscience (ibb); the u.a. whitaker biomedical engineering building; the ford environmental science and technology (es&t) building; and the molecular science and engineering (m) building, already forms a hub of interdisciplinary research. soon, other collaboration-oriented buildings will be added, solidifying the institute's commitment to developing its bioscience portfolio, which touches everything from mechanical engineering, to electrical engineering, to materials science and engineering. bioscience the georgia tech way has attracted high-profile faculty, such as m.g. finn, pioneer of click chemistry and rumored nobel prize candidate. also flocking to campus are fresh young minds, such as susan n. thomas, an assistant professor in the new field of immunoengineering. these researchers and others, who might not have come to georgia tech even 10 years ago, say that the institute is already making a dent in some of the world's biggest medical challenges, and is poised to do more. nascent fields of research, such as immunoengineering, systems biology, pediatric bioengineering, chemical biology, and biomanufacturing, are emerging strengths on campus, positioning georgia tech to help define what these fields become. georgia tech is already recognized as a leader in regenerative medicine, cardiovascular engineering, neuroengineering, and mechanobiology. ""considering what had been done in the past 10 years, i thought the next 10 years at georgia tech would be pretty exciting,"" said finn, the interim chair and professor of the school of chemistry and biochemistry. ""very few places in the world - if anywhere - will embed fundamental science in with applications science and technology better than we do here."" read more of this article from georgia tech's  research horizons  magazine .

cabrera-delivers-institute-address.txt,"cabrera delivers institute address 
 another record year for georgia tech 
 sep 02, 2022 
 - atlanta, ga 
 president ángel cabrera delivered the annual institute address on thursday, sept. 1, to an audience in the clough undergraduate learning commons and to another 550 viewers on youtube. 
 he talked about the institute as a high return on investment for academic degrees, a research powerhouse, and a driver of growth. he said that work done over the past decade to strengthen the student experience has paid off. 
 ""our six-year graduation rates, an industry standard, are now among the country's best."" they are also key to a strong return on investment for students. because of the institute's graduation rates, relatively low tuition, and great career outcomes, independent ratings of student roi consistently place tech near the top in the nation. 
 ""i am delighted that over the last three years not only haven't we increased tuition, but, thanks to state investments, enrollment growth, and fiscal prudence, we have been able to reduce it."" 
 with these outcomes, demand for a georgia tech education is at an all-time high. amid a national decline in college enrollment, this year tech broke a new record with more than 50,000 students applying for first-year admission. 
 ""this year we just welcomed nearly 3,700 new first-year students. with another 1,400 students transferring in from other universities, this is our 
 largest incoming class ever . add to this the continuing expansion of our online graduate programs, and our overall enrollment now sits at more than 46,000 students. that is the largest number of students we have ever served,"" he said. 
 on the research side, cabrera said faculty have continued to deliver impressive growth in research awards and expenditures. 
 ""in the latest 
 higher education research and development survey , georgia tech was one of only 21 universities in the country with research expenditures exceeding $1 billion - and the only one among them without a medical school. since 2020, new research awards have kept growing, reaching nearly $1.3 billion this past fiscal year."" 
 more resources, cabrera said, mean more scientific breakthroughs and technological advances, deeper influence on the thinking and decisions of policymakers and business leaders, and more innovative solutions to complex human problems. ""they also allow us to attract some of the best researchers in the world and provide them with the facilities and equipment they need. in the innovation business, talent and ideas breed talent and ideas."" 
 cabrera spent time this summer traveling through europe and seeing firsthand the impact georgia tech has in other parts of the world. after returning to the u.s., he hit the road for the georgia summer tour, visiting eight towns and attending more than 20 events. at each stop, he met current and incoming students and their families, as well as friends and alumni. he also visited with local lawmakers and businesses leaders to learn how georgia tech can support their local economies and drive innovation. 
 according to the annual report produced by the university of georgia for the board of regents, last year georgia tech had an immediate statewide impact of nearly $4.2 billion, the highest in the state and about 22% of all public universities in georgia. 
 ""nowhere is our impact more visible than right here in our neighborhood,"" he said. ""we are all very familiar with the work we've done with our affiliate organizations and other public and private organizations to transform our neighborhood into a thriving innovation hub appealing to both big companies and startups, and to a growing number of young professionals who choose to live here."" 
 tech square, west midtown, and surrounding areas have become a destination for corporations like microsoft, google, cisco, micron, airbnb, norfolk southern, nike, and others who want to be close to the talent and research emerging from georgia tech. the announcements, one after another, show how this has become one of the hottest tech neighborhoods in america, and more work is underway. 
 ""we are planning a two-tower complex in the heart of the neighborhood that will house the scheller college of business, the h. milton stewart school of industrial and systems engineering, gtri, and several other programs in support of the startup ecosystem,"" cabrera said. ""on the south side, construction is underway for our new biomedical innovation district - 
 science square . it will become a global biomedical research and technology hub. just like tech square, we want science square to be an example of how a research university can support innovation and help transform its city."" 
 cabrera concluded by highlighting the new fundraising effort that launched this summer - 
 transforming tomorrow: the campaign for georgia tech . ""this comprehensive campaign will raise more than $2 billion through various funding priorities centered around transforming lives, ideas, learning, our community, and our world. it will be the institute's biggest fundraising effort to date to support student access. more than one-quarter of the funds are expected to be earmarked toward student financial aid,"" he said. 
 ""we are currently building a strong campaign steering committee and will be hitting the road this fall to share the campaign goals with alumni and friends around the nation and beyond."" 
 the address was followed by a question and answer session. the event was recorded and is available

 georgia tech's 
 robert c. williams museum of papermaking 
 is presenting 
 a community of artists: african american works on paper from the cochran collection , from aug. 5 to dec. 2. the exhibit showcases 51 black artists whose works are a testament to the social conversations and artistic movements of 20th-century american art. 
 it is different from the museum's usual exhibit content, but it has relevance and connection to the state. jerushia graham, museum coordinator and curator of many of the museum's shows, selected the pieces. ""the exhibit has three central themes - georgia artists and how they fit into the broader story, women artists, and black master print makers,"" graham said. ""featured artists include jacob lawrence, emma amos, hale woodruff, dox thrash, and benny andrews."" 
 the pieces are on loan from the cochran collection, courtesy of wes and missy cochran from lagrange, georgia. the cochrans have been collecting for almost 50 years. their focus on african american artists began in 1988 when they attended an atlanta exhibition of works by five black women artists, including howardena pindell. in less than a week, the cochrans visited pindell at her new york studio, and she introduced them to other black artists. 
 ""missy and i went around with these lists of artists and phone numbers in new york, and that's how we began collecting,"" said wes cochran in an interview for 
 colliding with history , a catalog produced by georgia state university in 2021. 
 ""it was unusual at the time for a young white couple from a small town in georgia to be in new york buying black art,"" he said. ""this was so different from the big name artists we had collected. we were spending the same hard-earned money, but it was not on artists we were seeing in museums. the black artists had the same education, and they'd been making art for as many years. they had collided with history, but it was just a silent history."" 
 the 
 paper museum 
 will host an in-person reception and artist talk on oct. 3 from 6:30 to 8:30 p.m. artists jim alexander, radcliffe bailey, kevin cole, and tina dunkley, who are also featured in the exhibit, will discuss their work. to attend, register 
 here . 
 the museum will also host a three-part virtual lecture series: 
 sept. 6, 7 - 8 p.m.: jamaal barber will discuss ""black master printers and their impact."" 
 sept. 20, 7 - 8 p.m.: anne collins smith will discuss ""the power of women's voices in the cochran collection and spelman museum collection."" 
 nov. 1, 7 - 8 p.m.: kimberly diana jacobs will talk about ""telling the broader story of art history through the cochran collection and clark atlanta museum collection."" 
 to register for virtual lectures, see 
 upcoming programs . 
 the paper museum, located at 500 10th street nw, is open monday through friday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. the museum is free to the public for self-guided visits during operating hours. groups of 10 or more must schedule their visit in advance.

 ligo researchers are developing early-warning software to nab neutron-star mergers faster 
 ligo researchers surabhi sachdev, ryan magee, and shreya anand. 
 mar 18, 2023 
 this story by whitney clavin, california institute of technology, was first published in the 
 caltech newsroom . 
 on august 17, 2017, around 70 telescopes collectively turned their gaze to a fiery collision between two dead stars that took place millions of light-years away. the telescopes watched the event unfold in a rainbow of wavelengths, from radio waves to visible light to the highest-energy gamma rays. as the pair of ultra-dense neutron stars crashed into each other, they flung debris outward that glowed for days, weeks, and months. some of the onlooking telescopes spotted gold, platinum, and uranium in the searing blast, confirming that most heavy elements in our universe are forged in this type of cosmic collision. 
 were that the end of the story, this cosmic event would have been remarkable in itself, but three other detectors were present for astronomical gathering that day-two belonging to the national science foundation-funded 
 ligo 
 (laser interferometer gravitational-wave observatory) and one belonging to europe's 
 virgo . ligo and virgo observe not light waves but gravitational waves, or shivers in space and time produced by massive accelerating objects. as neutron stars spiral together, they generate gravitational waves before they merge and explode with light. it was the ligo-virgo gravitational-wave network that 
 alerted the dozens of telescopes around the world 
 that something astonishing was taking place in the skies above. without ligo and virgo, august 17, 2017, would have been a typical day in astronomy. 
 since that time, the ligo-virgo network has detected only one other neutron star merger; in that case, which occurred in 2019, light-based telescopes were not able to observe the event. (ligo-virgo has also detected dozens of binary black hole mergers, but those are not expected to produce light in most instances.) with ligo-virgo scheduled to turn back on this may, astronomers are excitedly preparing for more explosive neutron star mergers. one pressing question on the minds of some ligo team members is: can they detect these events sooner-perhaps even 
 before 
 the dead stars collide? 
 to that end, the researchers are developing early-warning software to alert astronomers to neutron star mergers up to seconds or even a full minute before the impact. 
 ""it's a race against time,"" says ryan magee, a caltech postdoctoral scholar who is co-leading the development of early-warning software along with surabhi sachdev (ms '17, phd '19), a professor at georgia tech. ""we are missing precious time to understand what happens before and right after these mergers,"" he says. 
 eleven hours later, the source is found 
 once ligo detects a likely neutron star collision, the race begins for telescopes on the ground and in space to follow up and pinpoint its location. the ligo-virgo network, which consists of three gravitational-wave detectors, helps narrow in on the approximate location where the fireworks are happening while light-based telescopes are required to identify the exact galaxy in which the neutron stars reside. 
 for the august 17 event, known as gw170817, most of the light-based telescopes were not able to start searching for the source of the gravitational-wave event until nine hours later. the ligo-virgo team sent its first alert to the astronomical community 40 minutes after the neutron star collision and the first sky maps, outlining the event's rough location, 4.5 hours after the event. but by that time, the region of interest in the southern skies had dipped below the horizon and out of view of the southern telescopes capable of seeing it. astronomers would have to anxiously wait until nine hours after the event to begin combing the skies. by about 11 hours after the neutron star collision, several ground-based optical telescopes had at last pinned down the location of the source of the waves: a galaxy called ngc 4993, which lies about 130 million light-years away. 
 gearing up for the next run 
 with 11 hours missing from the story of how neutron stars slam into each other and seed the universe with heavy elements, astronomers are eagerly awaiting more neutron star smashups. for ligo-virgo's upcoming run, which will also include observations made by 
 japan's kagra , the detectors have been undergoing a series of upgrades to make them even better at catching gravitational-wave events and thus neutron star mergers. the team expects to detect four to 10 neutron star mergers in next run and as many as 100 in the fifth observing run of the current advanced detector network, planned to begin in 2027. future runs with more advanced detectors are planned for the 2030s. 
 one new feature to be employed at the next run is the early-warning alert system. the specialized software will complement the main software that has been routinely used to detect all the gravitational-wave events so far. 
 the main software, also called a search pipeline, looks for weak gravitational-wave signals buried in noisy ligo data by matching the data to a library of known signals, or waveforms, that represent different types of events, such as black hole and neutron star mergers. if a match is found and confirmed, an alert is sent to the astronomical community. the early-warning software works in the same way but uses only truncated versions of the waveforms so that it can work faster. 
 ""the detectors are constantly taking new data in an observing run, and we are comparing our waveforms to the data as they come in. if we use truncated waveforms, we don't have to wait for as much data to be collected to do our comparison,"" magee says. ""the trade-off is that the signal needs to be loud enough to be detected using truncated waveforms. it's important to still run the main pipelines alongside the early-warning pipeline to pick up the weaker signals and get the best final localizations."" magee, sachdev, and their colleagues are working on an early-warning pipeline called gstlal; additional early-warning pipelines for ligo-virgo are also in the works. 
 before the fireworks 
 as neutron stars spiral around each other like a pair of ice dancers, they orbit faster and faster and give off gravitational waves of increasingly higher frequencies. the final dance between neutron stars lasts longer than those between black holes, up to several minutes in the frequency bands ligo is most sensitive to , 
 and this gives ligo and virgo more time to catch the lead-up to the stars' dramatic finale. in the case of gw170817, the pair of mingling neutron stars spent six minutes at the frequency ranges detectable by ligo-virgo before the two bodies ultimately coalesced. 
 the ligo early-warning software's truncated waveforms are designed to catch snippets of this last dance; in fact, the researchers think the software will eventually catch a neutron star merger up to one minute before the collision. if so, that will give telescopes around the world more time to find and study the explosions. 
 ""in the next run, we might be able to catch one of the neutron star mergers 10 seconds ahead of time,"" says sachdev. ""by the fifth run, we believe we can catch one with a full minute of warning."" 
 for astronomers, one minute is a lot of time. caltech professor of astronomy gregg hallinan, the director of caltech's owens valley radio observatory, says that early warnings of imminent neutron star mergers will be particularly important for gamma-ray, x-ray, and radio telescopes because the collisions may burst at these wavelengths right at the very start. ""radio telescope arrays like the long wavelength array at the owens valley radio observatory (ovro-lwa) and caltech's future 2,000-antenna deep synoptic array (dsa-2000) might be able to detect a radio flash that is theorized to occur at the time the neutron stars merge and in some models during the final inspiral before the merger,"" says hallinan. ""that will teach us about the immediate environments of these massively destructive events. what's more, seeing a radio flash could also help us quickly pin down the location of the mergers."" 
 shreya anand, a caltech graduate student, says that early optical and ultraviolet observations of the mergers can reveal new information about their evolution, such as how elements are formed in the fast-moving material ejected from the collisions. 
 anand, who works in the group of caltech professor of astronomy 
 mansi kasliwal 
 (ms '07, phd '11), is busy developing software herself, not for early-warning systems but to search the skies for neutron star mergers and other cosmic events once an alert from ligo is received. kasliwal's group is currently developing software for the zwicky transient facility (ztf) and the upcoming wide-field infrared transient explorer (winter), two survey instruments based at caltech's palomar observatory. ztf and winter can follow up on a ligo alert to find and observe a neutron star merger. anand is developing software that would speed up this search. 
 ""our algorithms figure out how to best cover different patches of sky and for how long to ensure the maximum chance of finding the target,"" she says. ""we are missing interesting physics in the early phases of the mergers. the early-warning software from the ligo team and the software for our telescope searches will speed up our chances of finding an event early. this will ultimately give us a more complete picture of what is going on.""

can-solar-geoengineering-save-world.txt,"can solar geoengineering save the world? 
 as the idea of solar geoengineering picks up steam, harding invites everyone to join the conversation, starting with learning about what it is, how it works, and whether or not this once-niche proposition really can save the world. 
 jan 30, 2024 
 the concept of solar geoengineering - blocking the sun's radiation to slow earth's warming - is no longer just the realm of science fiction. in 2023, the 
 u.s. government 
 and the 
 un 
 released reports on the topic. whether or not solar geoengineering can save the world is up for debate, and 
 tony harding , an assistant professor in the school of public policy, is contributing to the conversation. 
 harding is an alumnus of the school of economics and returned to georgia tech after a postdoc at harvard university. he studies the impact of innovative technology on climate change policy and governance, focusing on solar geoengineering. in the eight years he's been researching it, harding said it's the scale of the conversation that's changed the most: not what the researchers are speaking about, but who they're speaking to. 
 ""a lot of people in the climate policy and academic realms were hesitant to talk about solar geoengineering, and i think that's starting to change,"" harding said. ""there's definitely wider acceptance of at least talking about it, and in that way, pathways to having spaces to talk about it and research funds are opening up."" 
 as the idea of solar geoengineering picks up steam, harding invites everyone to join the conversation, starting with learning about what it is, how it works, and whether or not this once-niche proposition really can save the world. 
 what is solar geoengineering? 
 the most commonly proposed method of solar geoengineering, which also goes by names such as solar radiation modification or climate intervention, uses sulfate aerosols. when injected into the earth's stratosphere, they reflect a small amount of the sun's radiation - less than 1% - and reduce earth's surface temperature. this option is the most popular, and the one harding studies, because we have natural examples, he explained. volcanoes release sulfates when they erupt, and the largest ones are strong enough to push them into the stratosphere. 
 ""so we have evidence from the past that if sulfate aerosols make it up to the stratosphere, there's a cooling effect,"" he said. ""this natural analog gives us a bit more belief that it's going to work at least in some of the ways we expect it to in the real world and not just on a computer."" 
 the other two types of solar geoengineering researchers consider most seriously are marine cloud brightening to reflect incoming sunlight and cirrus cloud thinning to let light escape more easily. each one has pros and cons. for example, marine cloud brightening would only occur over the deepest and darkest parts of the ocean, harding said, ""which would have a non-uniform cooling effect and could lead to certain adverse outcomes. "" 
 stratospheric aerosol injection has a more uniform distribution and cooling effect that better mimics the warming we're experiencing. however, it comes with its own concerns, one of which is that the cooling isn't permanent. 
 ""if something happened to stop the deployment of the aerosols, whether it was for political or technological reasons, we would bounce right back and experience a rapid heating that we've never experienced before, and could have catastrophic impacts,"" harding said. 
 what are the costs and benefits of solar geoengineering? 
 this question is where harding's research makes the most impact. as an economist, he examines the costs and benefits of solar geoengineering to highlight the tradeoffs involved. harding has published articles on how solar geoengineering could 
 impact other climate change mitigation policies , how it 
 affects income inequality , and the 
 value of reducing uncertainty around solar geoengineering . 
 ""making it clear what the different tradeoffs are around climate policies is super important for informing decision-making,"" he said. ""on one side, we have these really, at their core, basic scientific questions around whether solar geoengineering will work and if it can scale up. but it's also an interesting question from a governance and economics perspective. solar geoengineering has global repercussions, the decision will affect the entire world. how do we develop governance structures, conversations, and inclusivity to ensure we're making a choice for the collective good?"" 
 for example, one of the downsides of using sulfate aerosols for solar geoengineering is negative health effects. but it also has the benefit of preventing temperature-related deaths. so, how do they compare? harding's recently submitted paper, which is not yet peer-reviewed, finds that the benefits of reduced deaths outweigh the adverse health effects of solar geoengineering ""by at least an order of magnitude - if not two orders of magnitude,"" he said. 
 harding notes that a more comprehensive comparison of risks and benefits is still required, but in the context of the two health impacts he examined, ""yes, it's a concern, and something we should consider, but we need to put it in perspective that the benefits are significantly greater than that negative effect."" 
 why is solar geoengineering controversial? 
 uncertain health outcomes? check. what else makes solar geoengineering so controversial that 
 some academics want a ban 
 on public funding, experiments, patents, deployment, and support for the technology in international institutions? 
 there is a running theme in climate conversations that discussing adaptation policies reduces the focus on cutting emissions, harding said, and the concerns around solar geoengineering are the same: not just that it will pull research funds from mitigation efforts, but that it will pull attention from dealing with the source of the warming as well. (his 2023 paper 
 examines this problem. ) 
 although he disagrees, others believe that researching solar geoengineering also makes it more likely that we deploy it, harding explained. so, for those against the technology, disrupting research efforts to prevent the idea from moving further makes sense. 
 what's next? 
 as with any unfamiliar and emerging technology, questions arise, such as, will this go horribly wrong and destroy the planet? or, will it be the solution to all of our problems? 
 ""putting my realistic hat on, it's probably somewhere in between,"" harding said. ""it's always hard to predict the future, but i can propose what i think is a realistic hope for where it can go."" 
 harding anticipates more research and is hopeful for continued discourse between academics and the public. 
 ""the first and most important thing to do is make people aware of this technology and educate them about it,"" harding said. ""we have to understand how general people, outside of policymakers, feel about it - because that matters a lot."" 
 he also wants to see more serious international policy discussions around governing solar geoengineering to prevent a situation where one person or country deploys it independently. whether it's a moratorium on its use or another agreement, international guidelines would help legitimize research without fears of a rogue actor, he explained. 
 final takeaway 
 to package it all up into a neat little tagline, ""solar geoengineering is a really new technology that could alleviate a lot of suffering in the case of climate change. but there's a lot of uncertainty, and it needs a lot more attention to quell any concerns about catastrophe,"" harding said. 
 ""the most salient concern is that we put a lot of faith in solar geoengineering, invest a lot of resources, and slow down emissions cuts because we think we have a silver bullet. and then we get to 2080 and realize it doesn't work as expected. that's a very real concern. but the one that receives less attention is if we put solar geoengineering aside and don't spend the resources investigating it. then we get to 2080 and realize, 'wow, this technology could have worked and relieved a lot of suffering.' i think it's important to understand the flip side of that.""

 margaret o'neal grew up in marietta, georgia, and often went to georgia tech basketball games. and although her uncle is an alumnus who spoke highly of the institute, she didn't see herself attending tech initially. now she's graduating with a bachelor's degree in industrial and systems engineering. 
 ""i think i was overlooking it just because it's close to home,"" o'neal said. ""but when i visited, i thought, ‘this campus is awesome.' the students i met were cool and doing really great things. then i realized i could see myself wanting to be like that one day."" 
 her uncle, vernon o'neal, graduated in 1979 with a degree in economics. over the years he has been active on the advisory boards of the school of economics and the ivan allen college of liberal arts. margaret took a different path. 
 ""i chose industrial engineering because it's very versatile and you can go into any direction career wise. it teaches you how to think critically and logically and how to solve problems,"" said o'neal, whose concentration is economics and financial systems. she studied supply chains and logistics and finds it interesting that supply chains are now a popular topic of conversation. 
 ""i don't think people really thought about supply chains until the store shelves were empty or they couldn't get their package at their door in two days,"" she said. ""but after they were inconvenienced, they became curious about the factors that go into product delivery. i think it will boost awareness of the field."" 
 the day before graduation, o'neal is commissioning into the army as a second lieutenant in the first brigade combat team in the 82nd airborne division at fort bragg, north carolina. ""my job is supply chain / logistics oriented, so i'll be using my major. and i'll get to jump out of airplanes."" 
 what she will miss most about georgia tech includes football games, proximity to friends, and her sorority, alpha delta pi, where she was on the executive board for a year. 
 ""i joined the sorority in my first year and it was nice to be immediately surrounded by a bunch of girls who were like-minded and wanted to do well at georgia tech,"" she said. 
 her advice to current students is, ""do not compare yourself to others. do the best you can. and find out how to do what you love every day."" 
 joining her to celebrate commencement will be her parents, grandmother, two older brothers, and her sister-in-law.

 in the past two years, the price of solar panels has dropped about 80 percent. yet electricity from solar panels is still too expensive to compete with power from fossil fuels because the cost of all the other components and activities involved in installation- hardware, labor, permitting and inspection - hasn't seen a comparable decline. this problem is among those being addressed at the recently-opened carbon-neutral energy solutions (cnes) laboratory at the georgia institute of technology. all these items involved in solar installations are collectively known as the ""balance of systems"" in industry terminology. in 2011, georgia tech and georgia tech research institute (gtri) were awarded a department of energy grant to achieve extreme cost reduction in balance of systems. a handful of industry partners are collaborating with students and faculty. the goal is to slash the cost of solar to $1 per watt on a utility scale, which would make the price of solar power-generated electricity competitive with the cost of electricity from coal or fossil fuels. step onto the roof of cnes and you'll see that the building is a demonstration project of solar power. the roof is covered with a crystalline photovoltaic array that will generate 388,000 kilowatt-hours per year of electricity, helping offset the building's energy needs. ""the idea for cnes was to have a building bringing together people working on low carbon energy. added on top of that was to make the building itself a demonstrator for low carbon,"" said tim lieuwen, director of georgia tech's strategic energy institute. the building was funded by a grant from the national institutes of standards and technology (nist). the cnes ribbon cutting and dedication ceremony was held on oct. 17. the lab is the latest addition to the north avenue research area (nara) complex, on the southwestern edge of campus. the mission of cnes is to bring together a diverse mix of experts to solve some of the big technological problems in clean energy and partner with industry to bring these solutions to the market. so far, solar research at cnes, with numerous projects, patents and industry partnerships, is a shining example of things to come. ""solar is one of the areas where georgia tech has really differentiated itself nationally,"" lieuwen said. ""whether it's converting solar energy directly into electricity, into heat, or into fuels, georgia tech is actively working in all of these facets of solar energy."" but solar research is just one area of expertise at cnes. the building also houses research on hydrocarbons, alternative fuels, including fuels derived from algae or using solar energy to split water, carbon capture and clean combustion, among other programs, which require large scale (high-bay) and intermediate scale (mid-bay) capabilities. ""cnes is a hub for the applied energy research on campus,"" said kevin caravati, a senior research scientist at (gtri), which is leading the balance of systems work with researchers from the college of architecture and the college of engineering. the building itself is somewhat of a living lab with an innovative ""no frills"" design and net-zero carbon emissions. the 42,000-square-foot facility is intended to set a new standard for sustainable design for buildings of its type by optimizing passive energy technologies, reducing electricity loads and maximizing the use of renewable energy. the building's office space has large windows to reduce the need for internal lighting. crystalline photovoltaic panels are on the roof (140 kw), exterior building walls (49 kw) and atop the parking canopy (107 kw). inside the high bay are two huge fans that circulate air in the building. the pavement in the parking lot is permeable to rainwater, and a bio-retention basin and cistern onsite help conserve water.  inside the labs at cnes, the mission is to bring clean energy technologies to a 90-percent commercialization level. then industries can license the technologies and bring them to the market. ""we can take ideas at the design stage and push them all the way through the prototyping and testing stages."" caravati said. ""i think that's a great win for all of us."" for example, the balance of systems project, led by gtri principal investigator joseph goodman, started with more than 100 concept designs that researchers have narrowed to a ""final four"" that are moving to the patent application stage. industry partners involved include the rocky mountain institute, intertek, florida international university, silicon energy, and georgia companies radiance solar, suniva, and jamestown properties, developers of the ponce city market mixed-use development along the atlanta beltline. research at cnes is not just focused on the energy sources of the future, but also on cleaning up pollution from the fossil fuels of the past and present. in the laboratory of chris jones, new-vision professor of chemical and biomolecular engineering and the new associate vice president for research at georgia tech, researchers are developing materials and technologies to efficiently and cheaply separate carbon dioxide from power plants' emissions, or from ambient air, and lock away the greenhouse gas underground. ""one of my favorite aspects of this building is that my students and post-doctoral researchers, who are working in our laboratory, are able to work alongside mechanical engineers, aerospace engineers and other people, cross-pollinating ideas and developing more effective collaborations,"" jones said. the building's open floor plan encourages collaboration between faculty and students from a mix of disciplines including the college of sciences, the college of architecture, the george w. woodruff school of mechanical engineering, the school of aerospace engineering and the school of civil and environmental engineering. industry experts regularly advise on projects. ""we have a good mix of diverse thinking combined with industry expertise and faculty members from gtri and georgia tech,"" caravati said. jones agreed, saying, ""this building has been a great advance for georgia tech in that it allows researchers in different programs on campus to be housed together working on strategic energy related issues."" the carbon-neutral energy solutions lab was supported by the national institutes of standards and technology (nist). any conclusions or opinions are those of the authors and do not necessarily represent the official views of the sponsoring agencies. research news georgia institute of technology 177 north avenue atlanta, georgia 30332-0181 usa media relations contacts : brett israel (404-385-1933) ( brett.israel@comm.gatech.edu ) or john toon (404-894-6986) ( jtoon@gatech.edu ) writer : brett israel

 - atlanta, ga 
 the  global center for medical innovation (gcmi) , an affiliate of georgia tech, hosted a special ceremony early in july in which trisha purvis, a veterinary surgical technician, re-enlisted in the united states army reserve. making the event more personal and unusual, purvis's coworker, ken zielmanski, director of quality assurance for gcmi's t3 labs and a retired army lieutenant colonel, performed the re-enlistment ceremony. 
 purvis has worked at gcmi off and on since 2006. gcmi accelerates the development, testing, training, and commercialization of innovative medical products to improve quality-based outcomes and delivery of healthcare for patients. 
 ""my re-enlistment with ken was so special because it was not only a retired officer who swore me in, he is a friend and mentor,"" purvis said, explaining she first enlisted in the army reserve in 2007. this re-enlistment will take her into retirement. 
 zielmanski was delighted to be asked to perform the ceremony. ""she could go into any enlistment office and get that done,"" he said. ""i felt honored and privileged that she asked me."" 
 purvis's work for the army is similar in scope to her duties at gcmi. ""my mos - military occupational specialty - in the army is a 68t or animal care specialist,"" she said. ""it's the equivalent of a veterinary technician on the civilian side. the main mission as a 68t in the army is caring for the military working dogs."" 
 her specialty is a rare one as the army is the only branch of the military that has veterinarians and veterinary technicians. purvis will also work with ceremonial animals, including horses, and participate in missions overseas to help manage animal herds. 
 ""i know how she performs here as a vet tech,"" zielmanski said, ""and she's a very, very good vet tech. i think very highly of her. the only way you make the service good is to have good people in it. and she's one of the best people that we have. i know she's a benefit to the service."" 
 her success both in the army reserve and at gcmi, is a testament to her character, said sherry n. farrugia, gcmi ceo. 
 ""trisha is held in high regard by her teammates, and embodies the army's values in everything she does,"" farrugia said. ""she always fulfills her obligations, has respect for others, and does everything with honor, integrity, and courage.""

 - atlanta, ga 
 in february 2016, astronomers shook the scientific world with the announcement that they had observed gravitational waves from a cataclysmic event in the distant universe - the collision of two massive black holes, celestial objects so dense that not even light can escape from them. 
 gravitational waves, hard-to-see ripples in the fabric of space-time, had been predicted by albert einstein's 
 general theory of relativity 
 in 1915. these gravitational waves carry information about their origins, potentially offering a new way to observe the cosmos. three years ago, however, researchers didn't know if this first observation was merely an anomaly or part of a widespread phenomenon that could teach us about the population of black holes in the universe. 
 a dozen georgia tech faculty members, postdoctoral researchers, and students participated with hundreds of other researchers in the national science foundation-sponsored 
 ligo 
 (laser interferometer gravitational-wave observatory) scientific collaboration that reported the first gravitational waves. after the announcement, the work continued, and scientists from around the world have now observed 10 black hole collisions and a merger of two binary neutron stars using ligo and the european-based virgo gravitational wave detector. 
 catalog of coalescing cosmic objects 
 the records of these cataclysmic cosmic events, including four black hole observations disclosed for the first time, have been collected into a catalog released december 1 at the gravitational wave physics and astronomy workshop held in college park, maryland. production of the catalog suggests that gravitational wave astronomy will indeed offer astronomers a new way to view the secrets of the universe. 
 ""the individual black hole detections previously announced allow us to confirm, after many years of searching, that gravitational wave astronomy is a feasible endeavor,"" said james alexander clark, a research scientist in georgia tech's 
 center for relativistic astrophysics 
 (cra) in the 
 school of physics 
 and a member of the ligo collaboration. ""we now know that pairs of massive black holes exist and collide frequently enough for us to detect gravitational waves within a human lifetime. we also know that the instruments and analysis procedures we use are capable of detecting and characterizing gravitational wave sources and we have been able to start probing some basic features of the theory of general relativity."" 
 astronomers do not have the luxury of repeating laboratory experiments to build confidence in their findings, clark pointed out. ""instead, we rely on observing large samples of objects and phenomena spread throughout the universe. by building a ‘census' of this population, we are rapidly learning more about how common these objects are, what their general properties are like, and about the diversity of black holes in the universe."" 
 expanding the observations 
 that census should expand more rapidly starting in april 2019 when ligo begins its next observing run. the two instruments, one in livingston, louisiana, and the other in hanford, washington, are shut down periodically for upgrades to improve sensitivity. ""by observing a larger sample of binary black hole sources, we are more likely to find systems with more extreme configurations that allow more stringent tests of our models - and of general relativity,"" clark added. 
 the new gravitational wave catalog shows that gravitational waves from powerful cosmic phenomena arrive at the earth almost once every 15 days of observation, noted karan jani, a postdoctoral fellow in the cra and also a member of the ligo collaboration. ""future releases will provide much stronger tests of einstein's theory of gravity, and help provide a better understanding of how black holes are formed in the universe."" 
 data collected on the 10 black hole mergers describe objects that are as much as 100 times more massive than our own sun. among the reports is a july 29, 2017, signal that represents the most distant, most energetic, and most massive black hole collision detected so far. that collision happened about five billion years ago - even before the birth of our sun - and released an amount of energy equivalent to converting almost five solar masses to gravitational radiation. 
 what we learn from black hole observations 
 black holes are among the few objects in the universe massive and dense enough to produce gravitational waves that can be measured, said sudarshan ghonge, a cra graduate student and also a member of the collaboration. but those measurements can be quite worthwhile. 
 ""these waves have signatures that depend on the properties of the black holes from which they originated,"" he said. ""by measuring these waves, we can infer the masses, spin, sky location, and distance from us. it's similar to how you can listen to a sound and roughly figure out where it's coming from, how far away it is, and what's causing it."" 
 ligo works by observing infinitesimally small changes caused by gravitational waves passing through the earth. the changes affect laser beams traveling through twin four-kilometer arms of the l-shaped observatories. the hanford and livingston facilities, separated by 1,865 miles, confirm the observations, as both facilities should detect the waves. additional information comes from the virgo facility in italy. 
 observing runs produce new records 
 from september 12, 2015, to january 19, 2016, during the first ligo observing run since undergoing upgrades in a program called advanced ligo, gravitational waves from three binary black hole mergers were detected. the second observing run, which lasted from november 30, 2016, to august 25, 2017, yielded one binary neutron star merger and seven additional binary black hole mergers, including the four new gravitational wave events reported december 1. the new events are known as gw170729, gw170809, gw170818 and gw170823, in reference to the dates they were detected. 
 gw170814 was the first binary black hole merger measured by the three-detector network made possible by collaboration between ligo and virgo, and allowed for the first tests of gravitational wave polarization, which is analogous to light polarization. 
 one of the new events, gw170818, detected by the global network formed by the ligo and virgo observatories, was very precisely pinpointed in the sky. the position of the binary black holes, located 2.5 billion light-years from earth, was identified in the sky with a precision of 39 square degrees. that makes it the next-best localized gravitational wave source after the gw170817 neutron star merger. 
 the event gw170817, detected three days after gw170814, represented the first time that gravitational waves were observed from the merger of a binary neutron star system. what's more, this collision was seen in gravitational waves and light, marking an exciting new chapter in multi-messenger astronomy, in which cosmic objects are observed simultaneously in different forms of radiation. 
 advancing gravitational wave observation 
 ""the release of four additional binary black hole mergers further informs us of the nature of the population of these binary systems in the universe and better constrains the event rate for these types of events,"" said caltech's albert lazzarini, deputy director of the ligo laboratory. 
 ""in just one year, ligo and virgo working together have dramatically advanced gravitational wave science, and the rate of discovery suggests the most spectacular findings are yet to come,"" said denise caldwell, director of nsf's division of physics. ""the accomplishments of nsf's ligo and its international partners are a source of pride for the agency, and we expect even greater advances as ligo's sensitivity becomes better and better in the coming year."" 
 ""the next observing run, starting in spring 2019, should yield many more gravitational wave candidates, and the science the community can accomplish will grow accordingly,"" said david shoemaker, spokesperson for the ligo scientific collaboration and senior research scientist in mit's kavli institute for astrophysics and space research. ""it's an incredibly exciting time."" 
 ""it is gratifying to see the new capabilities that become available through the addition of advanced virgo to the global network,"" said jo van den brand of nikhef (the dutch national institute for subatomic physics) and vu university amsterdam, who is the spokesperson for the virgo collaboration. ""our greatly improved pointing precision will allow astronomers to rapidly find any other cosmic messengers emitted by the gravitational wave sources."" the enhanced pointing capability of the ligo-virgo network is made possible by exploiting the time delays of the signal arrival at the different sites and the so-called antenna patterns of the interferometers. 
 the scientific papers describing these new findings, which are being initially published on the arxiv repository of electronic preprints, present detailed information in the form of a catalog of all the gravitational wave detections and candidate events of the two observing runs as well as describing the characteristics of the merging black hole population. most notably, we find that almost all black holes formed from stars are lighter than 45 times the mass of the sun. thanks to more advanced data processing and better calibration of the instruments, the accuracy of the astrophysical parameters of the previously announced events increased considerably. 
 added georgia tech professor 
 laura cadonati , deputy spokesperson for the ligo scientific collaboration, ""these new discoveries were only made possible through the tireless and carefully coordinated work of the detector commissioners at all three observatories, and the scientists around the world responsible for data quality and cleaning, searching for buried signals, and parameter estimation for each candidate - each a scientific specialty requiring enormous expertise and experience."" 
 about ligo and virgo 
 ligo is funded by nsf and operated by caltech and mit, which conceived and built the project. financial support for the advanced ligo project was led by the nsf with germany (max planck society), the united kingdom (science and technology facilities council) and australia (australian research council-ozgrav) making significant commitments and contributions to the project. more than 1,200 scientists from around the world participate in the effort through the ligo scientific collaboration. a list of additional partners is available at

 emory university school of medicine has been awarded a three-year, $2.2 million grant from the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc), making emory a new member of its prevention epicenters program. the program, which began in 1997, focuses on infection control and prevention research in health care facilities. emory will collaborate with the georgia institute of technology (georgia tech) and georgia state university on the grant, creating the prevention epicenter of emory and atlanta consortium hospitals or peach. emory and five other u.s. academic medical centers join five existing centers to accelerate health care innovations by discovering new methods to protect patients and health care workers from highly infectious diseases. the new centers will focus on the prevention of ebola and more common infections that are transmitted like ebola. ""the goal of peach is to translate microbiological, epidemiological and technological discoveries into new strategies to better protect the health and safety of physicians, nurses and patients from high-risk pathogens and communicable diseases,"" said jesse t. jacob, md, associate professor of medicine in the division of infectious diseases, department of medicine, emory university school of medicine, and lead principal investigator (pi) of this grant. ""their work will include rapid prototyping in simulation labs, quantifying and visualizing spatial metrics using special analytic tools, and using novel technology to implement programs to enhance hand hygiene compliance."" peach investigators will focus on three projects: emory investigators will work with georgia state microbiologists to assess the transfer of a marker for ebola and other pathogens when removing personal protective equipment (ppe) and look at steps in the process where errors could occur. the group will visit georgia's five state-designated ebola treatment centers and work with healthcare workers at those sites to assess opportunities to improve safety for healthcare workers. the georgia state pi is lisa casanova, phd. emory leads are colleen kraft, md; susan ray, md; and andi shane, md. emory and georgia tech researchers will study how the physical environment can make it safer for healthcare workers to don (put on) and doff (take off) ppe required for working with patients infected by ebola virus disease and other pathogens with transmission mechanisms similar to ebola. they will use realistic simulations to understand how health care workers use ppe at the simtigrate design lab in georgia tech's college of architecture. also, georgia tech's human factors group from the school of psychology will focus on behavioral interactions with ppe to identify high-risk components of the suits or of the process used to don or doff them. georgia tech pis are craig zimring, phd, and frank durso, phd. jacob is the emory lead. emory researchers will install a new electronic hand hygiene monitoring system at two of its hospitals to look at ways to improve hand hygiene, long considered the cornerstone of preventing infections in hospitalized patients. the system will be used to compare the effectiveness of different methods of providing feedback to health care workers on hand hygiene compliance. emory pis are james p. steinberg, md, and bonnie jennings, phd, rn. john boyce, md, an internationally renowned expert on hand hygiene, who recently retired from yale university, will serve as a consultant. ""we know that hospital-acquired infections are a serious public health problem for patients in the hospital but healthcare professionals are also at risk for getting infections while doing their jobs,"" said casanova, an assistant professor of environmental health at georgia state university. ""our research is focused on a crucial need in public health preparedness - the need to protect our health care workforce from occupational infection."" zimring, a professor in the college of architecture at georgia tech, said, ""putting on protective equipment requires a minimum of 21 steps, depending on the type of equipment, while also using the ‘buddy system.' mistakes due to poorly organized physical settings and processes can lead to transmission of deadly diseases to the environment, health care workers or patients. in a project to be co-led by megan denham, a research associate in simtigrate, we hope to better define the design of space needed for safely donning and doffing ppe in our full-scale simulation lab."" as with much of today's technology, proper use depends on human factors. ""mistakes made by health care providers when working with protective suits result not only from the person and technology, but also from the environment, organization, and culture in which the providers operate,"" durso said. ""we'll be looking at behavioral interactions with protective equipment to identify the high-risk components of the suit or of the processes used to doff (or don) the suit."" cdc has tasked the prevention epicenters members with developing cutting-edge science that is needed to stay ahead of the germs, for both the patients and health care providers. ""to help protect americans from infections spread in hospitals, cdc supports the prevention epicenter program to look for better ways to stop these preventable infections,"" said cdc director tom frieden, md, mph. ""emory will play an important role in discovering how we can make hospitals and health care facilities even safer."" besides emory, the five other newly added academic medical centers that will identify infectious disease-related innovations from 2015 to 2018 are: the johns hopkins university university of illinois, chicago university of iowa university of maryland, baltimore university of utah cdc's existing prevention epicenters are at the following institutions: cook county health & hospital system and rush university; duke university; harvard pilgrim health care and university of california, irvine; university of pennsylvania and washington university. media relations contacts : georgia tech - john toon ( jtoon@gatech.edu ) (404-894-6986); emory university - janet christenbury ( jmchris@emory.edu ) (404-727-8599).

 mar 27, 2024 
 pulitzer prize-winning poet edna st. vincent millay once wrote that april ""comes like an idiot, babbling and strewing flowers."" 
 as true as that may be, the month has something else going for it, as well: it's national poetry month. and we're here for it. 
 all month long, poetry@tech, a unit of the 
 school of literature, media, and communication , and the 
 ivan allen college of liberal arts 
 will be celebrating verse in all its forms with exhibitions, poetry readings, and more. 
 ""poetry has been around for thousands of years and there's a reason why,"" said victoria chang, the margaret t. and henry c. bourne jr. chair in poetry, and director of poetry@tech. ""poems can get at our emotions in different ways from other art forms. plus, poetry writing is really fun - sometimes it feels like solving a puzzle that is ultimately unsolvable, but fun to try solving."" 
 in addition to teaching poetry to students across campus, 
 chang 
 and her colleagues at poetry@tech put on poetry readings, publish the 
 terminus 
 literary magazine, and promote the value of poetry to the community. poetry@tech was founded in 2001 by luminary poet 
 thomas lux . 
 this month's celebration begins with something you've probably already noticed, if you've been out and about on campus: yard signs bearing snippets of poems and quotes from writers such as ada limón, audre lorde, lucille clifton, and 
 chang . 
 starting monday, you can also swing by the library to check out readings of poems by some of poetry@tech's guest readers this year - chang, jessica tanck, sam sax, james davis may, sasha stiles, and others - on the 
 media bridge . the library also will display a curated selection of poetry books near the library's popular reading area on the first floor of price gilbert. 
 we'll also celebrate throughout the month on 
 x 
 (formerly twitter), 
 instagram , and other social media channels with posts featuring students discussing some of their favorite poems and what poetry means. 
 on thursday evening, you can attend ""poetry@tech: then and now,"" hosted by former georgia tech president g. wayne clough and bruce mcever, a businessperson and poet whose generous donations to poetry@tech have helped the program thrive over its 24 years of existence. 
 we round out the celebration on april 18 with two events. first, join sax for a 
 poetry performance workshop , part of the arts@tech festival, from 11 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. in the lobby of the fest center for the arts. 
 that evening, sax, tanck, and pulitzer prize-winning poet carl philips will read selections from their work during our national poetry month poetry reading. the 
 event 
 starts at 6 p.m. with a reception featuring light snacks and drinks, followed by the reading at 7 p.m. the event is free and open to the public. 
 ""i hope our students walking around campus will see the yard signs with these lines of verse, and it gives them a moment to pause, not thinking about this test or that project, and reflect on their own creative impulse,"" said travis denton, associate director of poetry@tech. 
 ""we hope, too, that celebrating national poetry month at georgia tech will raise awareness of poetry@tech across campus and let students, faculty, and staff know a world-class poetry reading series is available to them, as well as poetry and poetry writing classes, and that everyone is welcome to take part,"" 
 denton 
 said. 
 you can find details on these happenings and more on the

 researchers are borrowing cellphone technology to track living cells on microfluidic chips.

 apr 20, 2016 
 - atlanta, ga 
 phone calls and text messages reach you wherever you are because your phone has a unique identifying number that sets you apart from everybody else on the network. researchers at the georgia institute of technology are using a similar principle to track cells being sorted on microfluidic chips. the technique uses a simple circuit pattern with just three electrodes to assign a unique seven-bit digital identification number to each cell passing through the channels on the microfluidic chip. the new technique also captures information about the sizes of the cells, and how fast they are moving. that identification and information could allow automated counting and analysis of the cells being sorted. the research, reported in the journal 
 lab on a chip , could provide the electronic intelligence that might one day allow inexpensive labs on a chip to conduct sophisticated medical testing outside the confines of hospitals and clinics. the technology can track cells with better than 90 percent accuracy in a four-channel chip. ""we are digitizing information about the sorting done on a microfluidic chip,"" explained fatih sarioglu, an assistant professor in georgia tech's school of electrical and computer engineering. ""by combining microfluidics, electronics and telecommunications principles, we believe this will help address a significant challenge on the output side of lab-on-a-chip technology."" microfluidic chips use the unique biophysical or biochemical properties of cells and viruses to separate them. for instance, antigens can be used to select bacteria or cancer cells and route them into separate channels. but to obtain information about the results of the sorting, those cells must now be counted using optical methods. the new technique, dubbed microfluidic codes, adds a grid of micron-scale electrical circuitry beneath the microfluidic chip. current flowing through the circuitry creates an electrical field in the microfluidic channels above the grid. when a cell passes through one of the microfluidic channels, it creates an impedance change in the circuitry that signals the cell's passage and provides information about the cell's location, size and the speed at which it is moving through the channel. this impedance change has been used for many years to detect the presence of cells in a fluid, and is the basis for the coulter counter which allowed blood counts to be done quickly and reliably. but the microfluidic codes technique goes beyond counting. the positive and negative charges from the intermingled electrical circuits create a unique identifying digital signal as each cell passes by, and that sequence of ones and zeroes is attached to information about the impedance change. the unique identifying signals from multiple cells can be separated and read by a computer, allowing scientists to track not only the properties of the cells, but also how many cells have passed through each channel. ""by judiciously aligning the grid pattern, we can generate the codes at the locations we choose when the cells pass by,"" sarioglu explained. ""by measuring the current conduction in the whole system, we can identify when a cell passes by each location."" because the cells sorted into each channel of a microfluidic chip have certain characteristics in common, the technique would allow the automated detection of cancer cells, bacteria or even viruses in a fluid sample. sarioglu and his students have demonstrated that they can track more than a thousand ovarian cancer cells with an accuracy rate of better than 90 percent. the underlying principle for the cell identification is called code division multiple access (cdma), and it's essential for helping cellular networks separate the signals from each user. the microfluidic channels are fabricated from a plastic material using soft lithographic techniques. the electrical pattern is fabricated separately on a glass substrate, then aligned with the plastic chip ""we have created an electronic sensor without any active components,"" sarioglu said. ""it's just a layer of metal, cleverly patterned. the cells and the metallic layer work together to generate digital signals in the same way that cellular telephone networks keep track of each caller's identity. we are creating the equivalent of a cellphone network on a microfluidic chip."" the next step in the research will be to combine the electronic sensor with a microfluidic chip able to actively sort cells. beyond cancer cells, bacteria and viruses, such a system could also sort and analyze inorganic particles. the computing requirements of the system would be minimal, requiring no more than the processor power of smartphones that already handle decoding of cdma signals. the proof-of-principle device contains just four channels, but sarioglu believes the design could easily be scaled up to include many more channels. ""this is like putting a usb port on a microfluidic chip,"" he explained. ""our technique could turn all of the microfluidic manipulations that are happening on the chip into quantitative data related to diagnostic measurements. ultimately, the researchers hope to create inexpensive chips that could be used for sophisticated diagnostic testing in physician offices or remote locations. chips might be contained on cartridges that would automate the testing process. ""it will be very exciting to scale this up, and i think that will open up the possibility for many different assays to become accessible electronically,"" sarioglu said. ""decentralizing health care is an important trend, and our technology might one day allow many kinds of diagnostic tests to be done beyond hospitals and large medical facilities."" other co-authors of the paper included ruxiu liu, ningquan wang, and farhan kamili, all georgia tech graduate students. citation : ruxiu liu, ningquan wang, farhan kamili and a. fatih sarioglu, ""microfluidic codes: a scalable multiplexed electronic sensor for orthogonal detection of particles in microfluidic channels,"" (lab on a chip, 2016).

 researchers from the georgia institute of technology have developed a novel cellular sensing platform that promises to expand the use of semiconductor technology in the development of next-generation bioscience and biotech applications. the research proposes and demonstrates the world's first multi-modality cellular sensor arranged in a standard low-cost cmos process. each sensor pixel can concurrently monitor multiple different physiological parameters of the same cell and tissue samples to achieve holistic and real-time physiological characterizations. ""our research is intended to fundamentally revolutionize how biologists and bioengineers can interface with living cells and tissues and obtain useful information,"" said 
 hua wang , an assistant professor in the 
 school of electrical and computer engineering 
 at georgia tech. ""fully understanding the physiological behaviors of living cells or tissues is a prerequisite to further advance the frontiers of bioscience and biotechnology."" the research is part of the semiconductor synthetic biology (ssb) program sponsored and managed by semiconductor research corporation (src). launched in 2013, the ssb program concentrates on synergies between synthetic biology and semiconductor technology that can foster exploratory, multi-disciplinary, longer-term university research leading to novel, breakthrough solutions for a wide range of industries. wang said the research can have positive impact on semiconductors being used in the development of health care applications, including the more cost-effective development of pharmaceuticals and point-of-care devices and low-cost home-based diagnostics and drug testing systems. the research could also benefit defense and environmental monitoring applications for low-cost field-deployable sensors for hazard detections. specifically, in the case of the more cost-effective development of pharmaceuticals, the increasing cost of new medicine is largely due to the high risks involved in drug development. on average, only one out of every ten thousand tested chemical compounds eventually become an approved drug product. in the early phases of drug development (when thousands of chemical candidates are screened), 
 in vitro 
 cultured cells and tissues are widely used to identify and quantify the efficacy and potency of drug candidates by recording their cellular physiology responses to the tested compounds. moreover, patient-to-patient variations often exist even under the administration of the same type of drugs at the same dosage. if the cell samples are derived from a particular patient, patient-specific drug responses then can be tested, which opens the door to future personalized medicine. ""therefore, there is a tremendous need for low-cost sensing platforms to perform fast, efficient and massively parallel screening of 
 in vitro 
 cells and tissues, so that the promising chemical candidates can be selected efficiently,"" said wang, who also holds the demetrius t. paris junior professorship in the school of electrical and computer engineering. ""this existing need can be addressed directly by our cmos multi-modality cellular sensor array research."" among the benefits enabled by the cmos sensor array chips are that they provide built-in computation circuits for in-situ signal processing and sensor fusion on multi-modality sensor data. the chips also eliminate the need of external electronic equipment and allow their use in general biology labs without dedicated electronic or optical setups. additionally, thousands of sensor array chips can operate in parallel to achieve high-throughput scanning of chemicals or drug candidates and real-time monitoring of their efficacy and toxicity. compared with sequential scanning through limited fluorescent scanners, this parallel scanning approach can achieve more than one-thousand times throughput enhancement. the georgia tech research team just wrapped its first year of research under the 3-year project, with the sensor array being demonstrated at the close of 2014 and presented at the ieee international solid-state circuits conference (isscc) in february 2015. in the next year, the team plans to further increase the sensor array pixel density while helping improve packaging solutions compatible with existing drug testing solutions. ""georgia tech's research combines semiconductor integrated circuits and living cells to create an electronics-biology hybrid platform, which has tremendous societal and technological implications that can potentially lead to better and cheaper health care solutions,"" said victor zhirnov, director of cross-disciplinary research and special projects at src. research news georgia institute of technology 177 north avenue atlanta, georgia 30332-0181 usa media contacts : georgia tech - john toon (404-894-6986) ( jtoon@gatech.edu ) or semiconductor research corporation - dan francisco (916-812-8814) ( dan@integrityglobal.biz ). written by semiconductor research corporation.

 ceramic-based mechanical pump operates at record temperature to move liquid tin.

 - atlanta, ga 
 a ceramic-based mechanical pump able to operate at record temperatures of more than 1,400 degrees celsius (1,673 kelvin) can transfer high temperature liquids such as molten tin, enabling a new generation of energy conversion and storage systems. 
 the new pump could facilitate high efficiency, low-cost thermal storage, providing a new way to store renewable energy generated by wind and solar power, and facilitate an improved process for generating hydrogen directly from fuels such as methane - without producing carbon dioxide. use of ceramic components, normally considered too brittle for mechanical systems, was made possible by precision machining - and seals made from another high-temperature material: graphite. 
 the research was supported by the advanced research projects agency - energy (arpa-e) and reported in the october 12 issue of the journal 
 nature . the pump was developed by researchers from the georgia institute of technology with collaborators from purdue university and stanford university. 
 ""until now, we've had a ceiling for the highest temperatures at which we could move heat and store it, so this demonstration really enables energy advances, especially in renewables,"" said 
 asegun henry , an assistant professor in georgia tech's 
 woodruff school of mechanical engineering . ""the hotter we can operate, the more efficiently we can store and utilize thermal energy. this work will provide a step change in the infrastructure because now we can use some of the highest temperature materials to transfer heat. these materials are also the hardest materials on earth."" 
 thermal energy, fundamental to power generation and many industrial processes, is most valuable at high temperatures because entropy - which makes thermal energy unavailable for conversion - declines at higher temperatures. liquid metals such as molten tin and molten silicon could be useful in thermal storage and transfer, but until now, engineers didn't have pumps and pipes that could withstand such extreme temperatures. 
 ""the hotter you can operate, the more you can convert thermal energy to mechanical energy or electrical energy,"" henry explained. ""but when containment materials like metals get hot, they become soft and that limits the whole infrastructure."" 
 ceramic materials can withstand the heat, but they are brittle - and many researchers felt they couldn't be used in mechanical applications like pumps. but henry and graduate student caleb amy - the paper's first author - decided to challenge that assumption by trying to make a ceramic pump. ""we weren't certain that it wouldn't work, and for the first four times, it didn't,"" henry said. 
 the researchers used an external gear pump, which uses rotating gear teeth to suck in the liquid tin and push it out of an outlet. that technology differs from centrifugal and other pump technologies, but henry chose it for its simplicity and ability to operate at relatively low speeds. the gears were custom-manufactured by a commercial supplier and modified in henry's lab in the 
 carbon neutral energy solutions 
 (cnes) laboratory at georgia tech. 
 ""what is new in the past few decades is our ability to fabricate different ceramic materials into large chunks of material that can be machined,"" henry explained. ""the material is still brittle and you have to be careful with the engineering, but we've now shown that it can work."" 
 addressing another challenge, the researchers used another high-temperature material - graphite - to form the seals in the pump, piping and joints. seals are normally made from flexible polymers, but they cannot withstand high temperatures. henry and amy used the special properties of graphite - flexibility and strength - to make the seals. the pump operates in a nitrogen environment to prevent oxidation at the extreme temperatures. 
 the pump operated for 72 hours continuously at a few hundred revolutions per minute at an average temperature of 1,473 kelvin - with brief operation up to 1,773 kelvin in other experimental runs. because the researchers used a relatively soft ceramic known as shapal for ease of machining, the pump sustained wear. but henry says other ceramics with greater hardness will overcome that issue, and the team is already working on a new pump made with silicon carbide. 
 among the most interesting applications for the high-temperature pump would be low-cost grid storage for surplus energy produced by renewables - one of the greatest challenges to the penetration of renewables on the grid. electricity produced by solar or wind sources could be used to heat molten silicon, creating thermal storage that could be used when needed to produce electricity. 
 ""it appears likely that storing energy in the form of heat could be cheaper than any other form of energy storage that exists,"" henry said. ""this would allow us to create a new type of battery. you would put electricity in when you have an excess, and get electricity back out when you need it."" 
 the georgia tech researchers are also looking at their molten metal pump as part of a system to produce hydrogen from methane without generating carbon dioxide. because liquid tin doesn't react with hydrocarbons, bubbling methane into liquid tin would crack the molecule to produce hydrogen and solid carbon - without generating carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas. 
 the pump could also be used to allow higher temperature operation in concentrated solar power applications, where molten salts are now used. the combination of liquid tin and ceramics would have an advantage in being able to operate at higher temperatures without corrosion, enabling higher efficiency and lower cost. 
 the ceramic pump uses gears just 36 millimeters in diameter, but henry says scaling it up for industrial processing wouldn't require dramatically larger components. for example, by increasing the pump dimensions by only four or five times and operating the pump near its maximum rated speed, the total heat that could be transferred would increase by a factor of a thousand, from 10 kw to 100 mw, which would be consistent with utility-scale power plants. 
 for storage, molten silicon - with still higher temperatures - may be more useful because of its lower cost. the pump could operate at much higher temperatures than those demonstrated so far, even past 2,000 degrees celsius, henry said.

challenges-regulating-artificial-intelligence-cloned.txt,"the challenges of regulating artificial intelligence - cloned 
 as innovation surrounding artificial intelligence continues, georgia tech experts offer their thoughts on the scope of the recent executive order and the challenges ahead in regulating ai. 
 jan 11, 2024 
 in 1950, alan turing asked, ""can machines think?"" more than 70 years later, advancements in artificial intelligence are creating exciting possibilities and questions about its potential pitfalls.   a recent executive order issued by president joe biden seeks to establish ""new standards for ai safety and security"" while addressing consumer privacy concerns and promoting innovation. georgia tech experts have examined the key elements of the order and offer their thoughts on its scope and what comes next.   a precautionary tale  the order calls for the development of standards, tools, and tests to ensure the safe use of ai. from voice scams and phishing campaigns to larger-scale threats, the technology's potential dangers have been widely documented. but 
 margaret kosal , associate professor in the ivan allen college of liberal arts, says that additional context is often needed to dispel hysteria.  ""no one is going to be hooking up ai to launch nuclear weapons, but ai capabilities may enable targeting, or enable the command and control and the decision-making time to be compressed,"" she said.     the order will create an ai safety and security board tasked with addressing critical threats. companies developing foundation models that ""pose a serious risk to national security, national economic security, or national public health and safety"" will be required to notify the federal government when training the model and required to share the results of all red-team safety tests - a simulated cyberattack to test a system's defenses.   since the launch of chatgpt in 2022, 
 a cnbc report 
 details a 1,267% rise in phishing emails. 
 srijan kumar , assistant professor in the college of computing, attributes the increase to the technology's availability and an inability to rein in ""bad actors.""   he says these scams will only continue to get more sophisticated and personalized. they ""can be created by knowing what you might be willing to fall prey to versus what i might fall prey to,"" said kumar, whose systems have influenced misinformation detection on sites like x (formerly twitter) and wikipedia. ""ai is not going to autonomously do all of those bad things, but this order can ensure there are consequences for people who misuse it.""   a delicate balance  building an ai platform requires large amounts of data regardless of its intended application. two primary goals of the executive order are protecting privacy and advancing equity.   to protect personal data, the order tasks congress with evaluating how agencies collect and use commercially available information and address algorithmic discrimination.   acknowledging that everyone should be allowed to have their voice represented in the outputs of ai data sets, 
 deven desai, 
 associate professor in the scheller college of business, noted, ""there are people who don't want to be part of data sets, which is their right, but this means their voices won't be reflected in the outputs.""    the order also includes sections to address intellectual property concerns among inventors and creators, though legal challenges will likely set new precedents in the years ahead.   when that time comes, kosal says that 
 defining ""theft"" in the context of ai becomes the true challenge 
 and that, ultimately, money will play a significant role. ""if you spit out a harry potter book and read it yourself, nobody will care. it's when you start selling it to make money, and you don't share proceeds with the original people, then it becomes an issue,"" she said.    what does ai-generated mean?  the order instructs the department of commerce to develop guidelines for content authentication and watermarking to label ai-generated content. desai questions what it means for something to be truly created by ai.   an important distinction lies between using ai to assist a writer in organizing their thoughts and using the technology to generate content. he likens the trend to the music industry in the 1980s.   ""synthesizers really changed people's ability to generate music and, for a while, people thought that was horrible. they can just program the music. they're not. i am still the human responsible for that music, or that article in this case, so what is the point of the label?"" he asks.  as ai assistance becomes commonplace in content creation, trusting the source of information is increasingly important. recently, articles published on sports illustrated's website 
 featured ai-generated content 
 provided by a third-party company that had used a machine to write the content and create fake bylines. sports illustrated, which may not have known of the problem, ran the material without disclosure to readers. ceo ross levinsohn was ousted shortly after the story broke.   ""perhaps if the third party had disclosed its use of ai software, si would have been able to assess how much ai was used and then chosen not to run the material, or to run it with a disclaimer that ai helped write the material,"" desai said. ""of course, even if they label the content as ai-generated, a reader still won't know exactly how much of the content came from ai or a human.""  ai and the workforce  as ai systems and models become more sophisticated, workers may become more concerned about being replaced. to counteract these concerns, the order calls for a study to examine ai's potential impact on labor markets and investments in workforce training efforts.   kumar compares the rise of ai to similar technological innovations throughout history and sees it as an opportunity for workers and industries to adapt. ""it's less a matter of ai replacing workers and more of reskilling people to use the new technology. it's no different from when assembly lines in the auto industry were created.""   promoting innovation and competition  the power to harness the full potential of ai has initiated a race to the top. desai believes that part of the executive order providing resources to smaller developers can help level the playing field.    ""there is a possibility here for markets to open up. current players using models that weren't built with transparency in mind might struggle, but maybe that's ok.""  the issue of reliability and transparency comes into focus for desai, especially as it relates to government usage of ai. the order calls on agencies to ""acquire specified ai products and services faster, more cheaply, and more effectively through more rapid and efficient contracting.""   when taxpayer dollars are at stake, government can't afford to trust a technology it doesn't fully understand - a topic desai 
 has explored elsewhere . ""you can't just say, ‘we don't know how it works, but we trust it.' that's not going to work. so that's where there may be a slowdown in the government's ability to use private sector software if they can't explain how the thing works and to show that it doesn't have discriminatory issues.""  what's next  promoting and policing the safe use of ai cannot be done independently. georgia tech experts agree that participation on a global scale is necessary. to that end, the european union will unveil its comprehensive eu ai act, which includes a similar framework to the president's executive order.   due to the evolving nature of ai, the executive order or the eu's actions will not be all-encompassing. law often lags behind technology, but kosal points out that it's crucial to think beyond what currently exists when crafting policy.   experts also agree that ai cannot be regulated or governed through a single document and that this order is likely the first in a series of policymaking moves. kosal sees tremendous opportunity with the innovation surrounding ai but hopes the growing fear of its rise does not usher in another ai winter, in which interest and research funding fade.

changing-conversation-georgia-tech-researchers-provide-new-approach-automated-story.txt,"changing the conversation: georgia tech researchers provide new approach to automated story generation 
 research from georgia tech's school of interactive computing provides a novel approach that improves the combination of automated story generation with natural language. 
 feb 04, 2020 
 - atlanta, ga 
 it's a situation familiar to anyone who's ever communicated with a voice assistant on a smart device. you pose a request: ""hey voice assistant, tell me a story about georgia tech."" more often than not, you get a related response - ""georgia tech is located in atlanta, georgia. would you like me to provide you with directions?"" - but one with slightly unnatural language and only limited information. 
 despite the enormous strides made in artificial intelligence to develop systems that can answer simple questions and requests, the kinds of natural conversational language humans have with each other when giving more complex directions or telling stories has thus far been out of reach. 
 research from 
 georgia tech 's 
 school of interactive computing , however, provides a novel approach that improves the combination of automated story generation with natural language. the development is an important step in providing ai assistants the capability to more naturally converse with humans. 
 ""let's think of a future version of siri or alexa, where you have a complex task that's not just ‘look this thing up on the internet,' or ‘tell me what the weather is outside,'"" said mark riedl, an associate professor at georgia tech and the faculty lead on the research. ""maybe you want to plan your day or a birthday party. think of the response like a little story, a narrative that conveys the requested information. 
 ""it's a missing capability in ai - they just don't understand us or communicate with us in the same ways that we understand each other."" 
 riedl and his team approached the challenge by viewing the exchange of information as stories - a series of events, one after the other, that leads to some conclusion. past research on the topic identified patterns in language to identify how stories are constructed - namely that a verb generally changes the action and conveys a new event in a story. 
 ""by boiling down these stories drawn from the internet to essential verbs and actions, we can extract patterns from stories better,"" riedl said. ""there are a lot of ways to talk about marriage, but at the end of the day someone is marrying someone else."" 
 this paper, the third in the series, took the next step: if you take away all the words to identify the patterns in a story, you need to be able to put them back in naturally and intelligently in a way that humans are accustomed to. put simply, it's like building an outline and then filling in the details. 
 the system works by building the outline through a neural network trained on sequencing events. with the help of story examples drawn from the internet, it applies machine learning to produce a series of events, one leading to the most likely next outcome. that outline guides a second neural network that applies natural language - grammar, syntax, spelling, everything else you need to make the story intelligible - to produce more elaborate sentences. 
 ""if you're asking for directions for how a birthday party should go, you don't want just ‘jill eats cake; jill opens presents,'"" riedl said. ""you want something more akin to the stories we share as humans. it's actually more difficult for us to process information when it's delivered in a way we're not accustomed to."" 
 the researchers found that an ensemble approach works the best. they use a series of five algorithms, each with different capabilities in accuracy and natural language generation, produces the best stories. because one algorithm isn't uniformly better at all aspects of the task, it will be run through all five to find the highest confidence level of the sentence. 
 ""one technique might provide bland sentences, but is accurate with the actual content,"" riedl said. ""another might be very good at putting in a narrative flourish, but they fail more often. you want that nicer sentence, but you also want it to be able to catch mistakes in the content."" 
 the ensemble approach scored significantly higher in human studies than the individual algorithms alone. human trust in their ai and robot assistants, riedl said, was key to adoption in the future. 
 ""the key is that you want to place that trust in your machine counterpart, but it has to earn that trust on correctness and accuracy,"" he said. 
 the paper is titled 
 story realization: expanding plot events into sentences , and will be presented at the 
 34 th 
 aaai conference on artificial intelligence 
 on feb. 7-12 in new york city. the research is funded under a grant from

 researchers have released a new version of the chemical companion decision support system (ccdss), a software system that assists first responders. 
 a member of the queensland fire and rescue service in australia uses chemical companion as part of a demonstration of hazardous material response. 
 feb 19, 2014 
 - atlanta, ga 
 researchers have released a new version of the chemical companion decision support system (ccdss), a software system that provides first responders with detailed and easy-to-access information about chemicals that may be associated with hazmat incidents. the update enhances the software, which now features more than a dozen tools and information about more than 550 chemicals and 3,838 chemical synonyms. what's more, the new version will enable apple ios and google android mobile devices to run the software. previously, the software worked only on windows-based desktop and laptop computers. the chemical companion decision support system can be downloaded at ( www.chemicalcompanion.org ). although chemical companion originally targeted first responders in fire and rescue departments, today forensic teams and bomb squads also use it. funded by the u.s. federal government's technical support working group, u.s. marine corps systems command and australia's department of the prime minister and cabinet (now managed by the country's defence science and technology organisation), the software is free to the military, law enforcement and fire departments. more than 1,200 active accounts are registered at chemicalcompanion.org, with users in the united states, australia, canada, the united kingdom, the netherlands and israel. whether the hazmat scene is due to a gas explosion, chemical spill, terrorist incident or bomb threat, the chemical companion helps mitigate risk. for example, a bomb squad can use it to determine potential scene blast, fragmentation and personnel standoff distances. it helps first responders decide how to decontaminate the scene and provide medical aid to victims. it also helps them determine what kind of protective equipment they need to wear and how long they can stay in a hot zone. from e-reader to integrated toolkit ""when we first introduced the chemical companion, it functioned as an information portal with basic e-reader functionality that enabled first responders to access information without lugging a dozen or more books around with them,"" said gisele bennett, director of the 
 georgia tech research institute's 
 (gtri) electro-optical systems lab and chemical companion's principal investigator. by entering details about a substance's physical appearance or victims' medical symptoms, the software allowed users to identify unknown chemicals at a hazmat scene and obtain information about their effects. ""today, however, chemical companion is more than just an information resource,"" she said. ""it has become a sophisticated decision-support system."" indeed, in the last two years, gtri researchers have been developing a series of unique tools to enhance the chemical companion's capabilities. these include, for example: the respiratory protection tool 
 - released in august 2012, the respiratory protection tool takes users through a series of questions about environmental conditions and hazardous materials that may be present at a hazmat scene. the final screen delivers a recommendation on what type of respiratory protection is required. respiratory protection comes in many forms, ranging from a half-face mask to a self-contained breathing apparatus (scba). ""selection of the right equipment for a given environment can be confusing, so most first responders default to an scba which is heavy and restrictive,"" explained heyward adams, a gtri research scientist who serves as technical lead on the project. ""the chemical companion's respiratory protection tool allows users to determine the appropriate equipment to wear - providing full protection from the airborne threats with the minimum amount of equipment."" the detection tool 
 - first responders carry a variety of detector devices to help determine what chemical, biological and radiological threats may be present at a hazmat scene. the chemical companion's detection tool augments the performance of these detectors by: determining which detectors to use - and in what order. aggregating the results of multiple detectors and performing checks for cross-sensitivities. providing an easy-to-read output of what threats are present. (it also establishes what isn't present, and what first responders may not be able to detect but shouldn't rule out.) giving recommendations on how to react, such as what kind of standoff zones to establish or what kind of protective equipment to wear - critical to getting on the scene faster and being able to remain longer. taking measurements at a hazmat scene is no easy task, adams said, noting that different detectors deliver readouts in different formats, such as a series of bars, parts per million or a color. ""unless you're an expert in chemistry, these readouts are not easy to decipher,"" he observed. ""the chemical companion's detection tool helps you know how to interpret the results and what to do with that information."" currently the chemical companion has more than 19 tools that have either launched or are being tested. many of these tools complement each other, prompting researchers to investigate their integration. ""the output of one tool could be the input for another,"" adams said. ""yet users might not realize that, so we're creating links to make overlaps more intuitive."" users drive new features working closely with users has been critical to the chemical companion's success. in addition to rigorous testing and user trials before any new release, gtri researchers host an annual workshop for users. this week-long event is instrumental in collecting feedback about the software's structure and usability - whether it's for developing a brand new tool or improving an existing feature. ""the workshops allow us to go through calculations of situations with different user groups,"" said bennett. ""a forensics officer will approach a scene very differently than a first-responder or a firefighter."" with that in mind, gtri researchers have developed user preferences for three different audiences, along with country preferences that automatically populate national standards and units of measurement for the united states and australia. another recent development sparked by the annual workshops is a tool for generating reports. introduced in 2012, chemical companion's report builder exports a pdf file that includes situational information, calculations and outputs performed by the software - even custom notes. ""in some cases, this file becomes the actual after-action report that users turn in to their departments,"" said adams. beyond the hazmat scene because the chemical companion's tools comprise multiple screens posing various questions and considerations, it has become an important training tool, points out michael logan, chief superintendent and scientific branch director of the queensland fire and rescue service in brisbane, australia.

chick-fil-opens-innovation-center-tech-square.txt,"chick-fil-a opens innovation center in tech square 
 the center is among the more than 20 that have opened in and around tech square to tap into georgia tech's innovation ecosystem. 
 chick-fil-a will open an innovation satellite office in georgia tech's tech square at the historic biltmore. 
 jan 25, 2018 
 - atlanta, ga 
 chick-fil-a invented the chicken sandwich and now the company is continuing to innovate through a new center in georgia tech's technology square. 
 the company opened a technology innovation satellite office wednesday at the historic biltmore. the technology innovation center, part of the company's long-standing partnership with the institute, emphasizes chick-fil-a's commitment to innovation. 
 ""this new facility will provide a dedicated space for chick-fil-a to collaborate with the bright minds of georgia tech and develop technology solutions that will benefit our customers,"" said chick-fil-a's chief information officer mike erbrick. ""our founder truett cathy was a true innovator, and the technology innovation center is one of the ways we're continuing his legacy."" 
 the 6,000-square-foot space focuses on digital technology, complementing work already taking place at chick-fil-a's three existing innovation centers, and is a testament to the company's desire to enhance the customer experience. some of the new center's projects are being tested in restaurants, including the location in colony square. 
 chick-fil-a will work with faculty and students to explore design, innovation and development projects among various majors and disciplines. 
 ""we are very excited that chick-fil-a is one of our corporate partners in the innovation ecosystem that we are building at georgia tech and nearby,"" georgia tech president g.p. ""bud"" peterson said.

 as a kid growing up on a farm, nathan wilmoth spent his days building things and tinkering with machines, to see not only what made them work, but also how he could improve them in design and function. ""my story is that of an enthusiastic youth that had always dreamed of creating, designing, and being an engineer,"" said wilmoth, who earned a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering from georgia tech in 2005. ""i wanted art to follow function."" today, as vice president of operations at peachtree city-based m.a. industries, wilmoth still gets to live out his childhood love of creating and designing products for the company. m.a. industries manufactures products designed for the precast concrete, porous plastic, and pulp and paper marketplaces. wilmoth is the georgia manufacturing extension partnership's (gamep) september face of manufacturing. the manufacturing industry is vital to the success of the georgia economy. through the individual stories of wilmoth and others profiled in the series, the faces of manufacturing showcases how each of them - like the 365,000 georgians who work in the industry - help their communities remain strong and economically viable. ""i owe a lot to manufacturing, and manufacturing does a lot for people,"" wilmoth said. his chosen profession as a mechanical engineer has given him a fun and challenge-rich career with lots of opportunities and personal fulfillment. ""manufacturing has provided me with a sense of purpose, strengthened my character, enhanced my integrity, and given me a strong sense of community,"" he said. but it wasn't necessarily an easy path for wilmoth, who graduated from georgia tech with a 4.0 grade point average and holds six u.s. patents as an inventor. though he had a natural ability and interest in engineering and dreamed of making his professional career in that field, he wasn't always so focused. a talented pole vaulter in high school who took his athletic prowess to college at troy state university in troy, alabama, wilmoth's focus on sports drew his attention away from his studies and his grades suffered. ultimately, he dropped out of college after his father lost his job and the family could no longer afford it. ""i spent the next 10 years working various jobs in the printing industry and haphazardly attending junior college. my primary focus was on athletics, music, and social interactions,"" wilmoth said. ""but something was missing in my life.  as i gained maturity, i began to realize that my life lacked substance and meaning. the change only came through the realization that my ultimate goal in life was one of learning.""  he decided to enroll in drafting school, and while in school he obtained a job at m.a. industries. ""one of the first realizations i had was the limitless need for improvements in the manufacturing environment,"" he said. ""as i worked at m.a., my need to design and create was satisfied with an ever-increasing responsibility for design, development, and the improvement of manufacturing efficiencies."" soon, he was doing the work of an engineer, which propelled him toward going back to school for a mechanical engineering degree at tech. it took two attempts - his first application was rejected because of his earlier academic record.  but he reapplied for acceptance and included recommendation letters from key instructors in junior college and superiors at m.a. industries. he also submitted copies of a patent assigned to m.a. industries for which he was the primary inventor. the second application was accepted. in his 19 years at m.a. industries, wilmoth has gone from draftsman to junior engineer to director of engineering to his current position as vice president of operations. his chosen field is just as rewarding now as were the successes he had building things as a child, such as the parasail he constructed and attempted to get airborne using a tractor. ""every day, i get to bring my childhood interests of building and experimentation to my job,"" wilmoth said. ""one of the great things about engineering is that - every day - i get the opportunity to try to solve real-world problems."" by péralte c. paul

 researchers have demonstrated an optical metamaterial whose chiroptical properties in the nonlinear regime produce a significant spectral shift.

 mar 01, 2017 
 - atlanta, ga 
 georgia institute of technology researchers have demonstrated an optical metamaterial whose chiroptical properties in the nonlinear regime produce a significant spectral shift with power levels in the milliwatt range. 
 the researchers recently demonstrated properties of their chiral metamaterial, in which they spectrally modified two absorptive resonances by incrementally exposing the material to power intensities beyond its linear optical regime. with a 15 milliwatt change in excitation power, they measured a 10-nanometer spectral shift in the material's transmission resonances and a 14-degree polarization rotation. 
 the researchers believe that may be the strongest nonlinear optical rotation ever reported for a chiral metamaterial, and is about a hundred thousand times larger than the current record measurement for this type of structure. the research, supported by the national science foundation and the air force research laboratory, was reported february 27 in the journal 
 nature communications . 
 ""nanoscale chiral structures offer an approach to modulating optical signals with relatively small variations in input power,"" said sean rodrigues, a ph.d. candidate who led the research in the laboratory of associate professor 
 wenshan cai 
 in georgia tech's 
 school of electrical and computer engineering . ""to see this kind of change in such a thin material makes chiroptical metamaterials an interesting new platform for optical signal modulation."" 
 this modulation of chiroptical responses from metamaterials by manipulating input power offers the potential for new types of active optics such as all-optical switching and light modulation. the technologies could have applications in such areas as data processing, sensing and communications. 
 chiral materials exhibit optical properties that differ depending on their opposing circular polarizations. the differences between these responses, which are created by the nanoscale patterning of absorptive materials, can be utilized to create large chiroptical resonances. to be useful in applications such as all-optical switching, these resonances would need to be induced by external tuning - such as variations in power input. 
 ""when you increase the power, you shift the spectrum,"" rodrigues said. ""in effect, you change the transmission at certain wavelengths, meaning you're changing the amount of light passing through the sample by simply modifying input power."" for optical engineers, that could be the basis for a switch. 
 the material demonstrated by cai's lab are made by nano-patterning layers of silver - approximately 33 nanometers thick - onto glass substrates. between the carefully-designed silver layers is a 45-nanometer layer of dielectric material. an elliptical pattern is created using electron beam lithography, then the entire structure is encapsulated within a dielectric material to prevent oxidation. 
 ""it is the engineering of these structures that gives us these chiral optical properties,"" rodrigues explained. ""the goal is really to take advantage of the discrepancy between one circular polarization versus the other to create the broadband resonances we need."" 
 the material operates in the visible to near-infrared spectrum, at approximately 740 to 1,000 nanometers. the optical rotation and circular dichroism measurements were taken with the beam entering the material at a normal incident angle. 
 the researchers induced the change in circular dichroism by increasing the optical power applied to the material from 0.5 milliwatts up to 15 milliwatts. while that is comparatively low power for a laser system, it has a high enough energy flux (energy transfer in time) to instigate change. 
 ""the beam size is roughly 40 microns, so it is really focused,"" said rodrigues. ""we are putting a lot of energy into a small area, which causes the effect to be fairly intense."" 
 the researchers don't yet know what prompts the change, but suspect that thermal processes may be involved in altering the material's properties to boost the circular dichroism. tests show that the power applications do not damage the metamaterial. 
 cai's laboratory has been studying chiral materials of different kinds for a variety of optical applications. in june 2015, they 
 reported the realization 
 of one of the long-standing theoretical predictions in nonlinear optical metamaterials: creation of a nonlinear material that has opposite refractive indices at the fundamental and harmonic frequencies of light. such a material, which doesn't exist naturally, had been predicted for nearly a decade. 
 in addition to those already mentioned, the research included shoufeng lan, lei kang, yonghao cui, patrick panuski, shengxiang wang and augustine m. urbas. urbas is associated with the air force research laboratory at wright-patterson air force base; wang is associated with wuhan textile university in china. the others are associated with georgia tech.

 through an innovative collaboration with cisco, the global leader in networking for the internet, the georgia institute of technology is pursuing 30 quick-turn research projects that touch on key priority areas such as internet for the future, capabilities at the edge, and optimized application experiences. 
 the master research agreement builds on more than two decades of close collaboration between the two organizations. begun last year, the funded projects are by design short term, lasting an average of 12 to 14 months ― enough time to assess the technology and its potential for cisco to warrant further investment. 
 each project undergoes quarterly reviews by cisco, with a georgia tech faculty member serving as the principal investigator, and ph.d. or postdoc students occasionally leading a team of students. 
 ""cisco research conducts and fosters research in emerging areas of technology that are of strategic interest to cisco. georgia tech is one of the first universities to have signed a longer-term master research agreement through which we have funded several projects over the past year. the vast breadth of research activities within gt makes it an ideal partner for us to collaborate and fund research longer-term"" said ramana kompella, head of research at cisco. ""we have already achieved quite a bit of success through these collaborations over the last year, and we have started renewing some of these projects for the next phase of research based on the results and impact already achieved."" 
 ""as an r1 research facility, our job is to engage in research and train the next researchers coming up. partnerships like cisco are critical to our mission,"" said jeffrey davis, director of corporate relations at georgia tech, who oversees the cisco partnership. ""cisco's program supports our students, our faculty, and the institute overall. a lot of this research could benefit not only georgia, but also people worldwide."" 
 davis said cisco evaluators challenge georgia tech students on their findings, with some of the brightest students recruited to join cisco upon graduation. 
 pitching projects: cisco's version of ‘shark tank' 
 being selected for a research project is akin to pitching investors on the popular reality show, ""shark tank."" according to davis, professors have 15 minutes to present their research project to cisco. a cisco tech leader evaluates each proposal to determine which ideas will move on to a ""deep dive,"" or one-hour detailed presentation to include a q&a discussion between the professor and subject-matter experts at cisco, and a decision quickly follows. 
 the funded projects support one of cisco's strategic pillars that include secure, agile networks; hybrid work; optimized application experiences; end-to-end security; internet for the future; and capabilities at the edge. 
 georgia tech's 
 institute of people and technology 
 (ipat), an early funding recipient, was awarded projects to develop augmented reality (ar) tools to improve healthcare worker productivity, research technologies that reduce workplace stress, and develop contact-less inventory management solutions that could lead to more efficient contactless supply chains, noted a recent georgia tech 
 story . 
 ""as the world is grappling to deal with the one-in-a-century pandemic, a key aspect of remote work that was particularly of grave concern is remote worker wellness and productivity, (and) one of the key themes along with georgia tech researchers we are conducting cutting edge research in,"" kompella added. 
 health-monitoring wearables 
 omer inan, associate professor in 
 electrical and computer engineering (ece) , is six months into a project to test how well his knee brace, a wearable with sensors that measure arthritis inflammation inside joints, works in patients with arthritis. his 2020 
 research paper 
 on the topic was recently named the runner-up best paper by 
 ieee sensors journal . 
 ""we are taking the hardware that we previously developed in our group and understanding how well it performs in a clinical population,"" said inan, who is collaborating with a team of clinicians at emory school of medicine led by sampath prahalad, that will assess the wearable joint monitoring technology in as many as 30 patients. 
 ""cisco is very interested in telehealth and iot-related research, and our project encompasses both,"" said inan. 
 he noted that arthritis sufferers today must go to a doctor's office and undergo blood tests and imaging to monitor their condition, which is both cumbersome and too infrequent given how rapidly the disease changes. ""only being able to get data at the doctor's office makes it hard to really understand what's going on and to manage the condition properly,"" he said. 
 inan anticipates that his wearable sensor could one day help remotely manage rheumatoid arthritis, especially in rural areas that are medically underserved.  cisco, he added, could be a key partner in making that happen. 
 ""cisco understands connectivity and the overall ecosystem of telehealth so well that they could be a great partner to help us understand how to move this technology toward translation to start benefitting patients,"" said inan, noting that cisco also brings invaluable expertise in the internet of things,, privacy and security of interconnected devices. 
 ""while health is top-of-mind for everyone in the world, we at cisco research are exploring how technology can improve healthcare outcomes for everyone by leveraging cisco's core tech prowess in areas such as iot and cybersecurity,"" said kompella. 
 computing at the edge 
 another cisco-funded project focuses on the next wave of computing ""at the edge."" the increasing presence of cameras in our environment, coupled with advances in computer vision and machine learning, has enabled several novel applications, including space-time tracking of suspicious vehicles and smart traffic lights. 
 ""edge (computing) is an emerging disruptive technology, and more and more applications require it. companies like cisco, microsoft, and google are already starting to pay attention to edge computing, and it could be a huge opportunity for academia,"" said umakishore ramachandran, professor in georgia tech's 
 school of computer science . ""we are seeing a perfect storm of technology and applications coming together at the edge to support multiple camera applications."" 
 one reality of moving to edge computing, explained ramachandran, is its resource limitation compared to a cloud data center owing to the smaller footprint of the edge. his team has developed techniques to allocate the scarce resources intelligently. specifically, they are looking at how to dynamically assign resources using multiple, nearby edge sites, while meeting the latency requirements of the services. 
 ""cisco is a pioneer in edge computing. now they are seeing that there's an opportunity to look at it from a sensor processing in a geo-distributed fashion,"" he said. 
 partnering with cisco gives ramachandran's team assurance that they are on the pulse of what's next in tech. 
 ""we can vet the new technology and ensure our research is not already happening in the industry. we want to be sure that what we're developing is not just used for publishing papers but also can be applied in the commercial world. that's where the cisco partnership is so important,"" he said. 
 ""edge computing is the next generation paradigm that's still in its infancy, and there are a lot of things that need to be researched to shape the future of edge computing. this area is super exciting and important for cisco, and we had an exciting collaboration with prof. ramachandran's research group on some of the key technological advances required to make edge computing a success,"" said kompella.

 a couple of georgia tech courses are in pursuit of happiness. the newest course was inspired by a 
 new york times 
 story in spring 2018 about yale university's most popular class - a class on happiness. 
 ""after reading the article i thought, ‘this is something our school needs,'"" said irene daboin, coordinator of georgia tech counseling center's peer coaching program and the instructor for psyc 2803: psychology and the pursuit of happiness. ""working in the counseling center, i get to see first-hand the things that students are struggling with and the stress on campus."" 
 daboin had been looking for a way to promote a healthy campus culture through a wider lens. so, she talked to john stein, vice president of student life and the brandt-fritz dean of students, who had read the same article and was also thinking about a happiness course at tech. he suggested that daboin collaborate with the school of psychology to figure out how to make it work. 
 ""it took us a little while,"" daboin said, referring to a couple of failed attempts to offer the class. ""we were hoping for a certain number of students to enroll and didn't get enough. this year we decided to focus less on the number of students, and instead just get the class going."" 
 the class, offered for the first time this summer, has 10 students. 
 ""it's a very intimate class, which is great,"" said daboin, who has a ph.d. in clinical and community psychology from georgia state university and is a licensed psychologist. ""it lends itself to discussion and a more in-depth way of talking about issues and applying it on a personal level. the class is sort of our pilot to see if this is something the students like and if we can do it on a larger scale in fall and spring."" 
 the class is designed to teach students scientifically-validated strategies for living a healthier, happier, and more satisfying life at georgia tech and beyond. students explore psychological concepts related to mental health and well-being and learn to apply the concepts to better manage their own stress and improve their habits, which will lead to more fulfilling lives. 
 the class begins and ends by measuring the students' happiness. it also measures the students' psychological wealth, including their satisfaction with life and their emotional wellbeing. students also must envision their best possible self, identify their personal strengths and values, do acts of kindness, and keep a gratitude journal. 
 daboin wants students who have taken the class to become wellness ambassadors by sharing strategies they have learned, and promoting a healthier campus culture. 
 ""it's exciting to see students immediately connecting the lessons learned in class to their personal lives,"" said daboin, who thought she would have to sell the class every step of the way. 
 ""but it's hitting home,"" she said. ""if these students can walk out of this class leading healthier lives and their psychological well-being improves, then hopefully it will be a little contagious."" 
 more happiness 
 chris martin, a postdoctoral fellow in the wallace h. coulter department of biomedical engineering, taught a happiness course at emory university and brought it with him to tech in 2018. 
 he teaches bme 2803 special topics: happiness. the class was created by emory sociology professor corey keyes, and martin taught it for three sessions while earning a ph.d. in sociology at emory. martin taught the course at tech last fall and spring, and his third session will be this fall. 
 the class covers three big themes: maximizing pleasure and minimizing pain; the meaning of life; and coping with suffering. 
 the course explores various theories of happiness, such as how money does or does not help one's level of happiness. 
 ""in the modern world, we have too many choices and that tends to inhibit happiness,"" he said. ""making the choice is burdensome. you think about all of the things you didn't choose. and, you feel like you lost out on all of the things you didn't choose because of what you chose."" 
 martin said there is an underlying idea that one's circumstances are the result of their choices. and part of a person's level of happiness is tied to expectations. 
 ""happiness can sometimes be elusive because we think a possession or purchase will make us happy for months, but it only makes us happy for a few days,"" he said. ""this is called the hedonic treadmill; you experience some pleasure and some pain, but you end up pretty much in the same place."" 
 the two things that seem to help sustain happiness are variety and appreciation. if there is variety in what you purchase, that will help. also, take time to consciously appreciate what you bought. 
 ""otherwise, once you purchase something ‘nice' your aspiration level goes up,"" martin said. ""so, you have to keep purchasing things that are significantly more expensive than the last thing you purchased, which is impossible."" 
 this fall, there will be two sections of martin's happiness course: a regular section and one for the  honors program. the regular class is housed in bme but is open to all undergraduates. most students who take the class are engineering majors who have an interest in the humanities. about 25 students usually enroll. 
 the curriculum covers a discussion of happiness, the hedonic treadmill and if it is realistic (for the students) to increase happiness, and students' idea of a good relationship. the final paper is on what they have learned from the class and also what they have learned about life overall. the class also talks about character strengths, careers, and relationships. 
 ""the students enjoy having discussions,"" martin said. ""the assignments are reflections, so i get to know each student's unique personality. i get to hear stories about their lives, and it's quite an honor."" 
 note: students may register for bme 2803 special topics: happiness. students interested in psyc 2803: psychology and the pursuit of happiness should check the course catalog to see if the course will be offered this fall.

 chilmonczyk is the ceo / co-founder of andson biotech and a current cleanroom user 
 may 25, 2022 
 - atlanta, ga 
 mason a. chilmonczyk is the ceo and co-founder of andson biotech, a startup that develops new sensors to discover the next groundbreaking cell and gene therapies. in the following q&a, chilmonczyk briefly discusses his work in the ien cleanroom and gives advice to current and future users. 
 how long have you been using the ien cleanroom? 
 i began using the ien cleanroom eight years ago when i started my ph.d. program at georgia tech and i am still using it today. 
 what tools have / do you use when you are in the cleanroom? 
 hitachi 4700 fe sem 
 scs g3p8 spinners 
 tystar mini 
 vision rie 
 unaxis rie 
 plasmatherm rie 
 plasmatherm icp 
 sts icp 
 obducat nanoimprinter 
 adt dicing saw 
 what is / has been your favorite project you have worked on in the ien cleanroom? 
 my ph.d. project, ""the dynamic sampling platform for real-time bioreactor monitoring,"" has been the most satisfying project i have worked on in the ien cleanroom. i collaborated with my advisor, mechanical engineering professor 
 andrei fedorov , and we utilized the 
 nanoscribe 
 to make micro-3d printed parts. this allowed me to take interesting sem images using the field emissions scanning electron microscopes. my ph.d. project was probably the most satisfying to ""complete,"" but i am still working on it to this day. 
 at the core of my work was a microfluidic mass exchanger that i built in the ien cleanrooms at georgia tech. as a result of this project, professor fedorov and i co-founded the startup 
 andson biotech . the company is growing, and we recently licensed the technology to enable better biopharmaceutical workflows. 
 what advice would you give to other researchers thinking about using a tool in the ien cleanroom? 
 i would say to only use the cleanroom for your research if you have a burning desire to learn about mems / microfabrication or you have to do so for your project. there are very rarely ""quick"" projects inside cleanrooms. in general, i think if you have the opportunity to learn about anything new you should take that chance. 
 what is your favorite thing about the ien cleanroom? 
 my favorite thing about the ien cleanroom is the people i've met. some of my best and longest-term friends have been made in these cleanrooms. i really miss working in the cleanroom as often as i used to, because i don't get to interact with all my best friends. unfortunately, many of my original friends [from the cleanroom] have moved on to other things. while i miss seeing them, i love to see them succeed!

climbing-stairs-just-got-easier-energy-recycling-steps.txt,"climbing stairs just got easier with energy-recycling steps 
 energy-recycling stairs developed to store a user's energy during descent and return energy to the climber during ascent. 
 when going up, the stairs give people a boost by releasing stored energy, making it 37 percent easier on the knee than using conventional stairs. 
 jul 12, 2017 
 - atlanta, ga 
 researchers at georgia tech and emory university have created a device that makes walking up and down stairs easier. 
 they've built energy-recycling stairs 
 that store a user's energy during descent and return energy to the user during ascent. 
 the spring-loaded stairs compress when someone comes down the stairs, saving energy otherwise dissipated through impact and braking forces at the ankle by 26 percent. when going up, the stairs give people a boost by releasing the stored energy, making it 37 percent easier on the knee than using conventional stairs. the low-power device can be placed on existing staircases and doesn't have to be permanently installed. 
 each stair is tethered by springs and equipped with pressure sensors. when a person walks downstairs, each step slowly sinks until it locks into place and is level with the next step, storing energy generated by the user. it stays that way until someone walks upstairs. when a person ascending the stairs steps on the sensor on the next tread up, the latch on the lower step releases. the stored energy in the spring is also released, lifting up the back leg. 
 the paper is currently published in the journal public library of science plos one. the authors say the initial idea was to use energy-recycling prosthetic shoes to help people going up stairs. 
 ""unlike normal walking where each heel-strike dissipates energy that can be potentially restored, stair ascent is actually very energy efficient; most energy you put in goes into potential energy to lift you up,"" said 
 karen liu , an associate professor in georgia tech's 
 school of interactive computing . ""but then i realized that going downstairs is quite wasteful. you dissipate energy to stop yourself from falling, and i thought it would be great if we could store the energy wasted during descent and return it to the user during ascent."" 
 liu is a co-author of the paper with colleague 
 lena ting , a professor of biomedical engineering in the 
 wallace h. coulter department of biomedical engineering at emory and georgia tech . 
 walking down stairs is like tapping the breaks of your car while revving the engine,"" said ting. ""your legs use a lot of energy bracing each steop to avoid falling too fast. our stairs store that energy rather than wasting it."" 
 the researchers didn't expect, prior to designing the device, that the stairs would actually ease the impact of going downstairs. 
 ""the spring in the stairs, instead of the ankle, acts as a cushion and brake,"" said 
 yun seong song , who built the device as a postdoctoral researcher at georgia tech. he's currently an assistant professor at missouri university of science and technology. ""the gentle downward movement alleviates work by the trailing ankle, which is what keeps you balanced and prevents you from falling too fast on normal stairs."" 
 liu initially got the idea for the project when she attended a conference and saw an ankle brace that stored and released energy. her 72-year-old mother has no problems walking but has difficulty climbing steps, and liu knew she wouldn't wear special sneakers just for stairs. so she decided to make smart stairs that act like the shoe. 
 ""current solutions for people who need help aren't very affordable. elevators and stair-lifts are often impractical to install at home,"" liu said. ""low-cost, easily installed assistive stairs could be a way to allow people to retain their ability to use stairs and not move out of their homes."" 
 ""maintaining mobility is very much a use-it-or-lose-it thing. it's important to keep people walking and independent through injury and aging to maximize quality of life,"" said ting. 
 the researchers think the temporary stairs could also be helpful for those recovering from surgery or pregnant women - people who only need help for short periods of time and don't need to permanently alter their homes. 
 the researchers are looking for partners to extend the project, which currently runs on a staircase with only two steps and can be used by just one person at a time. it was supported by the national science foundation (efri-1137229). 
 the paper, "" stair negotiation made easier using novel interactive energy-recycling assistive stairs ,"" was published on july 12.

cmdi-mighty-microbial-dynamics-healthier-people-and-planet.txt,"cmdi: mighty microbial dynamics for a healthier people and planet 
 cmdi merges disciplines, aggressively recruiting microbiologist ‘superstars' to take back the high ground from antibiotic-resistant pathogens and emerging diseases - and to harness microbes for new medicines, cleaner environments, and climate solutions. 
 aug 05, 2021 
 shaping the shared future of microbes and human health is the mission for georgia tech's 
 center for microbial dynamics and infection (cmdi) . 
 yes, there are similar academic-based centers studying infectious diseases and the microbes that cause them, but to understand what makes georgia tech's center different, 
 sam brown , cmdi co-director and a professor in the 
 school of biological sciences , says to concentrate on that third letter in the center's name. 
 ""focus on dynamics,"" says brown. ""that's basically how microbes are changing over time and space as well as how they're changing 
 systems 
 in time. this notion of dynamics operates on different scales. it operates, as i see it, on a behavioral scale - individual bugs making decisions and changing their behavior in time."" 
 ecological dynamics are ""how populations are changing with time, and how they're interacting with other communities - for example in biofilms,"" brown adds, referring to the name for communities of microorganisms that stick to surfaces and create their own ""neighborhoods."" 
 there are also evolutionary dynamics, which are worrying to brown and other researchers, as they can mean bacteria increase resistance to antibiotics. and then there are epidemiological dynamics. 
 ""we're all glued to our screens watching the epidemiological dynamics of covid-19 play out in real time,"" he explains. 
 all of this involves the study of some of the natural world's tiniest troublemakers - and helpers. humans are pathetically outnumbered by microbes. they live in, on, and around all of us. they are at both ends of the human food chain, helping farmers grow food, and then assisting us in digesting our meals. 
 ""you have trillions of bacteria in your gut,"" points out 
 marvin whiteley , cmdi's founding co-director who serves as a professor in the school of biological sciences, georgia tech bennie h. and nelson d. abell chair in molecular and cellular biology, georgia research alliance eminent scholar and co-director for emory-children's cf center. so, in the spectrum of these tiny communities, there are helpful and harmful microbes alike - and the latter can often make us very sick. that's where cmdi experts step in. 
 ""cmdi is working to transform how we study microbes in an environmental context, and ultimately find new microbial strategies to improve human and environmental health,"" brown says. 
 cmdi's science is conducted in an interdisciplinary manner, like many other research centers at georgia tech, with research that reaches into a number of other disciplines - microbial ecology, microbiome dynamics, biogeochemistry, microbial biophysics, socio-microbiology, infection dynamics, host-pathogen interactions, marine and aquatic microbiology, microbial evolution, viral ecology, spatial imaging, and math / computational modeling. 
 the center is fairly new, beginning operations in 2018. yet it's already closing in on 100 researchers - faculty, graduate students, and postdoctoral students - and is aggressively recruiting early career scientists from around the world to research at cmdi. 
 ""we are a unique interdisciplinary research center since our expertise spans such broad subjects from coral reef ecosystems, to antibiotic resistant bacteria, to new infectious diseases therapies,"" explains 
 maria avdonina , cmdi manager. 
 building cmdi's foundation, and using it to attack 
 p. aeruginosa 
 ""how does a pathogen do what it does at the molecular level?"" marvin whiteley asks. 
 it is a question that he began asking at the university of texas at austin, where he founded another center to study infectious disease before coming to georgia tech in 2017. back then, whiteley was looking for the kind of interdisciplinary mix of researchers that can be found widely across the institute, so he moved to atlanta and built that into the cmdi's mission as its founding co-director. 
 ""it's the idea of not just working with pure microbiologists, but working with those interested in how things change, and their dynamic aspects, even daily changes in the microbiome,"" he says, referring to the term used to describe all the microorganisms that live in a particular environment, whether it's a human body or a body of land or water. ""it requires modelers - people used to looking at big data sets - and people who think about evolutionary biology. it's a unique kind of expertise that i don't have in my lab, but the folks who work for me in the lab can take advantage of it within cmdi."" 
 whiteley's research interests include the study of cystic fibrosis (cf), a genetic disease that results in bacteria chronically attacking the lungs of its patients. to combat disease, whiteley is focusing research on pseudomonas aeruginosa ( p. aeruginosa ), a particularly dangerous bacteria that's often found in cf patients' lungs. he notes that the 
 centers for disease control 
 (cdc) lists it as one of the primary pathogens that is cause for clinical concern. 
 ""it lives in nature, but we published a paper showing it's not everywhere. it's located near human activity, so wherever we are, it seems to grow and do really well. it's in a lot of different diseases - and cf is one of them."" 
 p. aeruginosa 
 is also ""a really important cause of wound infections,"" whiteley adds, citing a cdc estimate that by 2050, about 20 percent of the entire u.s. healthcare budget could be spent treating chronic wound infections. 
 ""the biggest problem in environments where it's problematic is hospitals,"" he says. ""it's very tolerant of antimicrobials, and it acquires resistance fairly quickly. that causes it to enrich in its environment."" 
 taking on covid-19 
 joshua weitz , who is a cmdi faculty member, professor and tom and marie patton chair in biological sciences, and founding director of the interdisciplinary ph.d. in quantitative biosciences program, is a key scientist behind georgia tech's covid-19 surveillance testing efforts, along with covid-19 event risk and population immunity modeling research around nation and beyond. 
 weitz has led a series of concurrent efforts to estimate epidemiological characteristics of sars-cov-2, develop novel approaches to use large-scale testing as an intervention, and leverage mathematical models and real-time datasets to inform the public of ongoing transmission risk. 
 weitz recently received a best paper award 
 from the georgia tech chapter of sigma xi 
 for his work on the 
 covid-19 event risk assessment planning tool , which calculates the odds of being exposed to an infected individual in groups of different sizes; it has received more than 8 million unique visitors who have generated more than 40 million risk estimates since the planning tool's launch in july 2020. 
 weitz also joined fellow faculty and staff in sharing an 
 institute research award 
 and institute service award in recognition of collective efforts to design, develop, implement, deploy an asymptomatic sars-cov-2 saliva-based testing program to address the coronavirus pandemic across campus. ""we're very proud of what joshua has done,"" sam brown says, ""both in the context of covid-19 and also in exploring new therapeutic angles for bacterial infections, by harnessing the viral natural enemies of bacteria: phages."" 
 the search for new antibiotics - and how best to use them 
 while covid-19 is a virus that has dominated headlines since early 2020, bacterial resistance to antibiotics 
 has been a problem 
 for decades. penicillin was first available as an antibiotic in 1941. 
 staphylococcus aureus 
 was found to be resistant to it as early as 1942. 
 cmdi faculty member 
 julia kubanek , a professor of in the school of biological sciences and school of chemistry and biochemistry, former associate dean for research in the college of sciences and newly appointed 
 vice president for interdisciplinary research (vpir) 
 for all of georgia tech, has spent the past 17 years diving into the waters near fiji and the solomon islands, looking for natural marine products that could fill that widening gap in resistance-free drugs. 
 ""it's been a long time since entirely new classes of antibiotics were brought to market,"" kubanek explains. ""pharmaceutical companies have reduced their investments in antibiotic drug discovery, despite the continuing rise of antimicrobial resistance among existing drugs. more resistant strains of infectious bacteria and fungi are evolving constantly and present severe threats to public health."" 
 the covid-19 pandemic is a related example. it has revealed that science's arsenal of antiviral drugs is inadequate, she notes. 
 kubanek and cmdi faculty colleague 
 mark hay , regents professor and harry and linda teasley chair in the school of biological sciences, are both part of georgia tech's drug discovery program, which looks at small molecule natural products from marine organisms as sources for potential future medicines against infectious diseases. 
 a partnership with 
 emory university school of medicine 
 helps researchers screen georgia tech's natural product library - what kubanek and her research team found on those south pacific trips - for potential drug candidates has resulted in encouraging news for viruses like sars-cov-2, the specific coronavirus that causes covid-19. 
 ""we're currently following three promising classes of natural products from marine algae and sponges that show preliminary activity against this coronavirus,"" kubanek says. those molecules are distinct from currently marketed antivirals and antibiotics, and that could mean more weapons in science's arsenal for fighting infectious diseases. 
 cmdi researchers also approach the antibiotic resistance crisis through an epidemiological and evolutionary lens. for example, recent work from the brown lab has identified new strategies to slow or even reverse the increase in drug-resistant strains, by changing how doctors dose their drugs, and how they make use of diagnostic information. 
 microbes, climate, and environmental health 
 beyond human infections and pathogen control, cmdi also focuses on the significant impacts that microbes have on human and environmental health. cmdi faculty member 
 joel kostka , professor and associate chair of research in the school of biological sciences who also serves as a professor in the school of earth and atmospheric sciences, is a leading researcher in environmental microbiology, bringing the power of ""omics"" technologies to discover the role of environmental microbes in shaping key aspects of our shared world, from bioremediation to climate change. 
 kostka's work 
 led to the discovery of key marine microbes 
 that played an important role in cleaning up the oil spilled during the 2010 deepwater horizon disaster - microbes that turned out to be abundant in oil-contaminated soils around the world. 
 kostka's work in this space ""revealed a natural capacity for rare microbes in the gulf of mexico to catalyze the bioremediation, or natural cleanup, of petroleum hydrocarbons,"" he explains. ""these microbes show promise as biological indicators to direct emergency response efforts, as well as to elucidate the 
 impacts of oil exposure on ecosystem health during oil spills 
 and other environmental disasters,"" he adds. 
 the kostka lab has also long characterized the role of the environment in shaping microbial communities that limit the release of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane into the atmosphere. 
 in a large scale climate change experiment that's being conducted in northern minnesota with funding by the u.s. department of energy, kostka's research recently 
 showed that warming accelerates the production of greenhouse gases from soil microbial respiration 
 - and that microbial activity ""was fueled by the release of plant metabolites, suggesting that enhanced greenhouse gas production is likely to persist and result in amplified climate feedbacks."" 
 ""joel is our key player in this space,"" brown says. ""he's done incredible research on how the environment can dictate microbial species abundance and their behavioral contributions to the functioning of earth's ecosystems. he's shown that different ‘taxa', or groups of organisms, become metabolically active or ‘switched on' depending on environmental factors like temperature. his research contributes to building better climate models as well as to develop new geoengineering strategies to adapt to climate change. he's doing beautiful work."" 
 cmdi's global call to early career microbiologists 
 cmdi's research is funded by grants from agencies like the 
 national science foundation 
 and 
 national institutes of health 
 to individual labs run by faculty - and by money distributed directly to the center from across georgia tech, including the college of sciences and its office of the dean and 
 sutherland dean's chair . 
 these sources ""are getting healthier by the minute, and that's a testament to the scientists at the center,"" brown points out - so much so that two new positions have recently been created: a senior research scientist who will assist postdoctoral and graduate students with grant and fellowship applications, and a cmdi early career award fellowship that seeks out ""superstars, people who are going to go on to be faculty success stories."" 
 ""we want to get them early,"" brown says. ""we're interviewing some great candidates just out of their ph.d.s. we'll give them maximum independence, their own space, their own office, their own pot of money. they'll be sitting at the intersection of our research interests but can run their own lab and their own research program."" 
 this allows postdoctoral students to focus on research projects, julia kubanek says. ""because postdocs generally don't enroll in formal courses, nor are they generally expected to teach in the classroom, they get to immerse themselves in research in collaboration with faculty, students, and other postdocs. the cmdi is rapidly growing as a collaborative environment, where postdocs can try out their best ideas and learn from others how to tackle the most pressing scientific questions in microbial dynamics, microbial communication, ecosystem health, and infectious disease."" kubanek adds that a related fellowship program ""will augment postdoctoral salaries to attract the very best candidates, enabling grant dollars to stretch further, leading to new discoveries."" 
 the center is also ratcheting up outreach, including what it calls its ""research envoys program."" the intitiative features graduate students giving seminars at local institutions throughout the atlanta area, including at historically black colleges and universities (hbcus). although it's mostly on pause right now due to the pandemic, two ph.d. students and a postdoctoral student working with cmdi faculty member 
 brian hammer 
 - a professor in the school of biological sciences who is also chair of the institute undergraduate curriculum committee, and co-director of the aquatic chemical ecology research experiences for undergraduates (reu) program - recently gave remote seminars at spelman college and kennesaw state university. 
 ""our trainees get practice in speaking, and it opens doors to folks seeing georgia tech as an option,"" brown explains. the cmdi is also working with georgia tech's 
 institute diversity, equity, and inclusion 
 and the 
 southern regional education board 
 to continue to increase the number of underrepresented minorities at all levels of recruitment. 
 ""we're really interested in educating the next generation of scientists in biology,"" whiteley adds. ""everybody says that - but we're actually developing programs to recruit the best talent in the world.""

cognitive-empowerment-program-opens-doors-first-members.txt,"cognitive empowerment program opens doors to first members 
 the new georgia tech-emory university cognitive empowerment program provides new hope. 
 cognitive empowerment program participants lyn reagan and steve baltz with (left) cep researcher matt doiron. (credit: rob felt, georgia tech) 
 apr 01, 2020 
 - atlanta, ga 
 stepping off of the elevator on the first floor at 6 executive park in atlanta, the first thing you notice about the space is its serenity. it's light-filled, with lots of plants, a flowing water feature, and a neutral color palette - shades of soft blue, grey, beige, and sage green. it's relaxed and welcoming, and that's by design. 
 the center, which opened in january, is the home of the cognitive empowerment program, a joint effort between emory university's brain health center and the georgia institute of technology to empower people living with mild cognitive impairment (mci), a distinct decline in thinking. the condition is often a precursor of alzheimer's disease and impacts up to 20% of americans over age 64, an age group that's expected to double by the year 2050. 
 twice a week, people with mci (called program members) and their care partners, usually spouses or adult children, visit executive park to participate in art and nutrition classes, physical therapy, gentle yoga, and brain exercises. there's also a ""tech bar"" for help operating or troubleshooting mobile devices. the goal is to empower participants to take charge of their lives through education and independent living. dr. allan levey, director of the emory university alzheimer's disease research center, says members and care partners have already praised the program. 
 ""by design, program benefits are wide-ranging and personalized, providing individuals with tools to take control over risk factors and behaviors that we hope will promote their cognition, emotional, physical, and spiritual well-being,"" said levey, who is also professor and chairman of emory's department of neurology. ""the program also provides hope and the personal reward that they are contributing to the fight against alzheimer's disease."" 
 steve baltz and his wife lyn reagan started the year-long program in january with the inaugural group. baltz had a stroke in 2003, which affected ""the memory part of his brain,"" reagan said. he recovered and continued working for the next 10 years. after retiring, baltz became less active and more isolated at home. then, his memory began to decline. he forgets whether he fed the dog and misplaces things. 
 reagan says she and her husband are ""incredibly grateful"" for the program; it helps him to get out of the house and socialize. ""he loves it. he just can't wait to go."" 
 baltz, a retired physician, believes ""this is an opportunity for us to give back [to the medical and research communities] because we're right here at the forefront of mci research."" 
 as members of the first group of participants, the atlanta couple now serve as mentors to newer members and their care partners - couples like fred and marsha rueff, who joined the program in february. 
 doctors diagnosed fred with mci six years ago, and over the past year, his memory has worsened. he has trouble with language and remembering names but is still excellent at problem-solving and math. 
 ""fred's great to take when you're shopping sales because he can figure out the percentage off,"" marsha said. 
 activities at the cognitive empowerment program help to keep fred's brain sharp. he enjoys yoga classes and maintains a daily journal of his activities. ""this program has given us a whole new level of hope."" 
 unique research opportunity 
 while the cognitive empowerment program serves as therapy for members, it's also a living laboratory, providing a unique research opportunity for georgia tech and emory. 
 the program's innovation accelerator, led by georgia tech's jennifer dubose, advances research by breaking down barriers to collaboration. researchers and students, some supported by 
 annual seed grants , work in the heart of the executive park space where they can easily observe and interact with program members. 
 ""they can watch while people are having physical therapy and yoga and see them hanging out on the sofas. i didn't want people to have a one-off experience with the members,"" said dubose, a principal research associate in the 
 college of design 
 and associate director of 
 simtigrate design lab . 
 dubose often has lunch at the center with program participants and leads sessions where she works one-on-one with them. during one recent session, members placed emoticon stickers on printed ""journey maps"" from their homes to the center to express how their feelings changed over the course of the day. it's a simple and effective way for researchers to learn about members' anxieties, routines, and limitations related to memory loss. 
 craig zimring, a professor in the school of architecture and director of simtigrate design lab, is directing the program's built environment core, researching how design can improve cognition, mood, and functioning for people with mci. his team worked alongside the executive park center's architect to inform the space design and will develop solutions for other therapeutic and home settings. 
 zimring also leads talks at the center on topics like how sound and light affects mood and sleep patterns. he shows how the facility's advanced lighting system automatically adjusts throughout the day. participants are engaged, asking questions and chiming in with their personal experiences. 
 outside of the center, georgia tech researchers are developing a tablet application for members and their care partners, which provides curated information about mci. 
 ""we're able to foster a continuum of care by providing useable and useful information even when members aren't at the program facility,"" said beth mynatt, executive director of the 
 institute for people and technology 
 and co-director of the cognitive empowerment program technology core. 
 mynatt modeled the mci application on her previous work on the 
 mypath 
 application for breast cancer patients. 
 gari clifford, professor of biomedical informatics at emory, co-leads the technology core, directing sensing and analytics research to discover new patterns that best depict progress or decline in people with mci. drawing on expertise from georgia tech's 
 aware home 
 and 
 home lab , technology core researchers are also creating 
 smart home technologies 
 to monitor members' activity, guide overall mci care, and provide personalized support for everyday activities and concerns. 
 the cognitive empowerment program will recruit a total of 90 participants in the first year, whom researchers will follow for one year. program participants have already bonded with researchers, staff, and each other over a shared experience, carpooling to the center and forming friendships and support networks outside of the program. 
 ""we're embedded in people's lives,"" dubose said. ""i'm hopeful that they'll become engaged and trust us, and that they see themselves as collaborators in research."" 
 editor's note : the cognitive empowerment program suspended in-person programming on march 17 in light of the covid-19 pandemic. the technology core research team immediately provided the mycep tablet application to support virtual programming by the therapeutic team. this rapid research initiative will explore how to support empowerment for people with mci using online and interactive content. in-person programming will resume as soon as it's safe for members.

cold-suns-warm-exoplanets-and-methane-blankets.txt,"cold suns, warm exoplanets and methane blankets 
 early earth probably would have frozen solid, if not for greenhouse gasses, and a new model shows how they could have feasibly arisen. 
 famed late nasa astronomer carl sagan first hypothesized that the reason early earth stayed warm although the sun shone dimly had to do with a greenhouse effect involving a gas mixture different from that in earth's atmosphere today. he suspected high ammonia levels, which proved chemically less feasible. today, many scientists suspect the warming gas was methane. credit: nasa-jpl 
 dec 11, 2017 
 - atlanta, ga 
 somewhere in our galaxy, an exoplanet is probably orbiting a star that's colder than our sun, but instead of freezing solid, the planet might be cozy warm thanks to a greenhouse effect caused by methane in its atmosphere. 
 nasa astrobiologists from the georgia institute of technology have developed a comprehensive new model that shows how planetary chemistry could make that happen. the model, published in a  new study in the journal  nature geoscience , was based on a likely scenario on earth three billion years ago and was actually built around its possible geological and biological chemistry. 
 the sun produced a quarter less light and heat then, but earth remained temperate, and methane may have saved our planet from an eon-long deep-freeze, scientists hypothesize. had it not, we and most other complex life probably wouldn't be here today. 
 the new model combined multiple microbial metabolic processes with volcanic, oceanic and atmospheric activities, which may make it the most comprehensive of its kind to date. but while studying earth's distant past, the georgia tech researchers aimed their model light-years away, wanting it to someday help interpret conditions on recently discovered exoplanets. 
 the researchers set the model's parameters broadly so that they could apply not only to our own planet but potentially also to its siblings with their varying sizes, geologies, and lifeforms. 
 earth and its siblings 
 ""we really had an eye to future use with exoplanets for a reason,"" said  chris reinhard, the study's principal investigator  and an assistant professor in georgia tech's school of earth and atmospheric sciences. ""it's possible that the atmospheric methane models that we are exploring for the early earth represent conditions common to biospheres throughout our galaxy because they don't require such an advanced stage of evolution like we have here on earth now."" 
 reinhard and first author kazumi ozaki  published their  nature geoscience  paper on december 11, 2017 . the research was supported by the nasa postdoctoral program, the japan society for the promotion of science, the nasa astrobiology institute and the alfred p. sloan foundation. 
 previous models have examined the mix of atmospheric gases needed to keep earth warm in spite of the sun's former faintness, or studied isolated microbial metabolisms that could have made the needed methane. ""in isolation, each metabolism hasn't made for productive models that accounted well for that much methane,"" reinhard said. 
 the georgia tech researchers synergized those isolated microbial metabolisms, including ancient photosynthesis, with geological chemistry to create a model reflective of the complexity of an entire living planet. and the model's methane production ballooned. 
 ""it's important to think about the mechanisms controlling the atmospheric levels of greenhouse gases in the framework of all biogeochemical cycles in the ocean and atmosphere,"" said first author ozaki, a postdoctoral assistant.

 the georgia tech model strengthens a leading hypothesis that attempts to explain a mystery called  the ""faint young sun paradox""  pointed out by  iconic late astronomer carl sagan  and his cornell university colleague george mullen in 1972. 
 astronomers noticed long ago that stars burned  brighter as they matured and weaker in their youths . they calculated that about two billion years ago, our sun must have shone about 25 percent fainter than it does today. 
 that would have been too cold for any liquid water to exist on earth, but paradoxically, strong evidence says that liquid water did exist. ""based on the observation of the geological record, we know that there must have been liquid water,"" reinhard said, ""and in some cases, we know that temperatures were similar to how they are today, if not a little warmer."" 
 sagan and mullen postulated that earth's atmosphere must have  created a greenhouse effect  that saved it. back then, they suspected ammonia was at work, but chemically, that idea proved less feasible. 
 ""methane  has taken a lead role  in this hypothesis,"" reinhard said. ""when oxygen and methane enter the atmosphere, they chemically cancel each other out over time in a complex chain of chemical reactions. because there was extremely little oxygen in the air back then, it would have allowed for methane to build up much higher levels than today."" 
 iron, and rust photosynthesis 
 at the core of the model are two different types of photosynthesis. but three billion years ago, the dominant type of  photosynthesis we know today  that pumps out oxygen may not have even existed yet. 
 instead, two other very primitive bacterial photosynthetic processes likely were essential to earth's ancient biosphere. one transformed iron in the ocean into rust, and the other photosynthesized hydrogen into formaldehyde. 
 ""the model relied on lots of volcanic activity spewing out hydrogen,"" ozaki said. other bacteria fermented the formaldehyde, and other bacteria, still, turned the fermented product into methane. 
 the two photosynthetic processes served as the watch spring of the model's clockwork, which pulled in 359 previously established biogeochemical reactions spanning land, sea and air. 
 3,000,000 runs and raging methane 
 the model was not the type of simulation that produces a video animation of earth's ancient biogeochemistry. instead, the model mathematically analyzed the processes, and the output was numbers and graphs. 
 ozaki ran the model more than 3 million times, varying parameters, and found that if the model contained both forms of photosynthesis operating in tandem, that 24 percent of the runs produced enough methane to create the balance needed in the atmosphere to maintain the greenhouse effect and keep ancient earth, or possibly an exoplanet, temperate. 
 ""that translates into about a 24 percent probability that this model would produce a stable, warm climate on the ancient earth with a faint sun or on an earth-like exoplanet around a dimmer star,"" reinhard said. ""other models that looked at these photosynthetic metabolisms in isolation have much lower probabilities of producing enough methane to keep the climate warm."" 
 ""we're confident that this rather unique statistical approach means that you can take the basic insights of this new model to the bank,"" he said. 
 other explanations for the ""faint young sun paradox"" have been more cataclysmic and perhaps less regular in their dynamics. they include ideas about routine asteroid strikes stirring up seismic activity thus resulting in more methane production, or about  the sun consistently firing coronal mass ejections  at earth, heating it up.

 researchers from the georgia tech research institute have been working with cnn to investigate the use of uavs in newsgathering. 
 the georgia tech research institute (gtri) and cnn have been working together to study the issues affecting the use of unmanned aerial vehicles for newsgathering. shown in cnn's world headquarters are (left) greg agvent, senior director of news operations for cnn, and cliff eckert, a gtri senior research associate who's working on the project. they are shown with an airrobot ar 180, one of the devices that may be suitable for newsgathering.

 nov 10, 2015 
 - atlanta, ga 
 in june 2014, the georgia tech research institute (gtri) and cnn launched a joint research initiative to study the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (uavs) for newsgathering. in january 2015, cnn signed an agreement with the federal aviation administration (faa) to share the results of the research. the project is now gaining momentum as researchers shift their focus from evaluating uav equipment to developing potential protocols for safe operations. the issue: hobbyists can fly drones without faa oversight as long as the aircraft weighs 55 pounds or less, flies in unpopulated areas, and remains within line of sight of the operator. yet flying drones for commercial purposes requires review and approval by the faa. the only way to get a thumbs-up from the faa is to pursue airworthiness certification (an expensive and complicated process that can take up to a year), or secure a ""section 333 exemption."" a section 333 exemption allows the faa to waive the airworthiness requirement as long as the commercial uav flights are conducted under a number of restrictions. among these restrictions: drone operators must notify local aviation authorities two or three days prior to flight - and operations over people or near airports are off-limits. ""securing a 333 exemption is doable for the movie industry since obtaining aerial footage can be planned far in advance,"" observed mike heiges, a 
 gtri 
 principal research engineer who leads the cnn project. ""yet journalists can't operate under these rules for breaking news and chaotic situations where there may be emergency responders, police helicopters, or the national guard."" granted, drones aren't needed for every news story, but they provide a unique perspective in many situations, said greg agvent, senior director of news operations for cnn / us. ""being able to fly over an area after an earthquake or tornado hits would provide a deeper understanding of how widespread the devastation is,"" agvent explained and pointed to the may 12 amtrak train derailment in philadelphia. ""part of the issue with the accident was the speed going into the curve. the ability to get footage from 200 feet in the air would have presented a better sense of the curve - context that you simply couldn't get from the ground."" safety of news personnel is another benefit of drone journalism, agvent added. ""in many cases, such as a flood, safety would trump context. we could capture footage of an event without putting our people in harm's way."" some of the research that comes out of the project will be helpful beyond newsgathering, observed dave price, a gtri senior research technologist working on the project. ""commercial drones are of interest for crop monitoring and inspection of bridges and railroad tracks,"" he explained. ""railroads and agriculture agencies will be able see the results of cnn's camera selection and stabilization systems and take advantage of this for their own applications."" the right stuff during the past year, the researchers, including gtri and cnn staff, have been investigating different uavs that could carry the type of camera systems journalists need to shoot and transmit aerial footage. that's easier said than done. for one thing, the commercial drone industry is in its infancy. manufacturers come and go, and there aren't a great number with a long track record. another challenge is finding the right equipment - airframes and payloads that match up. ""it's a trade-off,"" heiges explained. ""you have to factor in size, weight, and power of what you want to put on the aircraft with what the aircraft can carry."" flight times for many commercial drones aren't long enough for cnn's purposes, nor is video quality high enough. ""to install a better camera, you need a bigger vehicle for endurance,"" heiges said. ""and that means stepping up to uavs that were developed for the military, which dramatically increases price."" gtri has been testing drones since 2006 through the faa's certificate of authorization process, which enables public institutions to operate drones in national airspace for research purposes. currently, gtri holds 28 certificates of authorization for specific locations in five states. for the project with cnn, gtri provides pilots to fly the drones in approved areas, plans the flight tests with cnn's participation, collects data, and prepares reports with recommendations. one of cnn's takeaways from the flight tests: drone journalism is no one-person show. ""in most cases, especially for live video, you need three people,"" agvent said. this includes a pilot to guide the actions of the uav and an operator for the camera, which is usually suspended under the drone and sits on gimbals for stabilization. ""the third person, a spotter, is particularly important in urban areas,"" agvent continued. ""the spotter focuses solely on situational awareness and communicates to the pilot about people and other aircraft that may be in the area. in some cases, you could get by with a two- person team - a pilot / cameraman and a spotter - but a trio is best to ensure both high quality and safety."" advancing to operational protocols ""we've hit a lot of milestones in the past year,"" agvent said. ""now, we begin to work on the finer points of flight operations and coordinating with air traffic control."" one of the faa's chief concerns with drones is getting the word out to manned aircraft about a uav's presence in the area. the current practice is to file a ""notice to airmen"" two or three days in advance. a new technology known as automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ads-b) could provide a just-in-time alternative to the notice to airmen. developed by the faa, this technology enables aircraft to broadcast their gps coordinates to anyone in the local air space that has ads-b, and vice-versa, so the drone operator would be able to see other aircraft. ""it's like having an air traffic radar map inside your cockpit,"" heiges said. ""even better, unlike conventional radar, ads-b works all the way to the ground."" that's important, because, in some situations, journalists may need to cooperate with police helicopters or medical aircraft flying at low altitudes to pick up patients. geo-fencing technologies, which prevent uavs from entering airport and other restricted areas, could add another layer of safety, heiges added. because faa rules prohibit drones from flying over people, crowd-control issues must also be resolved. for example, are journalists responsible for blocking off the area where they wish to fly drones - or do they communicate with on-scene commanders to find out where they can operate? over the next few months, gtri and cnn will meet with regional emergency responders and other stakeholders to address these questions and develop an operational framework. then gtri will work with law enforcement agencies to test the procedures at remote locations. ""we'll hold mock trials and simulate circumstances that would happen in a breaking news situation,"" heiges explained. creating appropriate regulations for various types of uav flights is important, as the flight landscape has changed dramatically in recent years. ""when people built radio-controlled airplanes out of balsa wood, they learned the rules for flying and flew aircraft at sanctioned sites,"" heiges said. ""yet in the past few years, we now have multi-rotors and quad-rotors with automatic stabilization that don't require the same skills. people are flying them out of the box without knowing the rules. that can be dangerous if flown beyond visual range. any significant accident will set back the industry, punishing those who do follow the rules."" even small drones could cause a helicopter or aircraft to go down if it gets caught in a propeller or pulled into an engine. indeed, drones have been in the news this past summer for interfering with firefighting efforts in california, including a san bernadino wildfire where drones operated by curious hobbyists caused fire pilots to pull out of the fray for 30 minutes, allowing the fire to spread. ""the one thing that doesn't get talked about enough is the differentiation between hobbyists and commercial drone users - and that most of the problems are caused by laymen,"" said agvent. ""our goal is to create a framework that allows for safe integration of commercial drones for newsgathering. it's about having trusted vendors, trusted aircraft, and trusted procedures in place to act in a safe manner."" research news georgia institute of technology 177 north avenue atlanta, georgia 30332-0181 usa media relations contact : john toon (404-894-6986) ( jtoon@gatech.edu ) writer : t.j. becker

 how a georgia tech professor turned his research into a startup company that could revolutionize electronics. 
 jun 02, 2022 
 - atlanta, ga 
 professor baratunde cola says he's a discoverer at his core. 
 as a researcher in the george w. woodruff school of mechanical engineering, cola has become one of the preeminent experts in the fields of heat transfer and nanomaterials. he's worked longer than most other scientists on the planet to understand carbon nanotubes (cnts). 
 ""cnts are nature's perfect conductor of heat,"" he explained. ""carbon atoms are the lightest and carbon-carbon bonds are the strongest, and these two features combine fundamentally to make heat flow through solids with little resistance."" 
 as cola's research at georgia tech developed, so did the idea behind his company, carbice. 
 using recycled aluminum and waste carbon gas, cola and his team made what is the world's leading heat-conducting material. with this material they have made a tiny filament only a few atoms in width that helps remove the heat from the products it is assembled with. 
 while conducting his research at tech, he realized he had a product that could be extremely successful. ""everything that does work has a byproduct of heat due to innate inefficiency,"" he explained. 
 that's particularly true for electronic devices, where added heat can lead to malfunctions or even fires. and, as electronics have become smaller and denser, they produce even more heat. carbice carbon helps dissipate that heat. 
 carbice can be used to manufacture everything from smartphones to satellites. according to cola, satellite makers can save as much as $500 per square inch of thermal filler interface by using carbice space pad. 
 ""i often say that carbice is a second law of thermodynamics business,"" cola said. 
 along his journey - from starting fullback for vanderbilt's football team, to georgia tech professor and researcher, and now to successful entrepreneur - cola has found support in many different forms. 
 his first research grant was given by the u.s. air force. as the carbice technology grew, cola was backed by georgia tech's advanced technology development center (atdc) and the georgia research alliance. 
 ""that, frankly, was key to me coming to georgia tech,"" he recalled. ""they would give grants to help professors explore commercialization opportunities. that sold me for this ecosystem."" 
 in the past two years, cola and carbice received $15 million dollars from venture firms and investors to expand the technology into new markets. 
 the company has just moved out of a georgia tech incubator space and into a 23,000-square-foot facility in atlanta's west end neighborhood. 
 ""it's important for me to be close to georgia tech and the atlanta community, because i've learned so much from both,"" said cola. ""there's a lot you can learn in silicon valley, but my authentic environment has been this georgia tech-tech square-atlanta environment."" 
 the new facility is located near the western portion of the beltline, one of the largest urban redevelopment programs in the country that consists of multiuse trails redeveloped from former railroad corridors encircling the city of atlanta. ""i'm so excited for carbice to be so centrally located,"" cola said. 
 the next step is ramping up this facility to start making more of the carbice material. cola and his team are hiring more staff and planning for a grand opening later this year. they plan to take ""big steps toward being in more and more technologies,"" from smartphones to electric vehicles. 
 and cola's journey as researcher, professor, and entrepreneur continues. ""i came here seeing in georgia tech a place that would allow me to achieve what i wanted to achieve."" so far, so good.

college-sciences-professor-appointed-top-role-search-gravitational-waves.txt,"college of sciences professor appointed to top role in search for gravitational waves 
 laura cadonati is elected as the first-ever deputy spokesperson of the ligo scientific collaboration. 
 laura cadonati is a professor in the school of physics and one of the world's top experts studying gravitational waves. 
 apr 20, 2017 
 - atlanta, ga 
 now that scientists have observed and confirmed the existence of gravitational waves, the community is preparing for what it calls a ""new dawn"" of exploration. this next step will enable a better understanding of the universe and create the directions for the development of future generations of instruments. 
 to help guide them into this new chapter of discovery, members of the laser interferometer gravitational-wave observatory (ligo) have appointed georgia tech professor laura cadonati as their first-ever deputy spokesperson of the ligo scientific collaboration (lsc). together with the spokesperson, she will speak on behalf of ligo when new detections are announced and oversee the management of a number of divisions, including data analysis and astrophysics. 
 ""i am proud and honored to be a member of the lsc. we've already done something great by detecting two black hole collisions from billions of years ago,"" said cadonati, a professor in the the college of sciences and school of physics. ""i'm eager to work with the astronomy and astrophysics community to create this new dawn of gravitational wave astrophysics that will continue to decode the mysteries of the universe."" 
 cadonati will collaborate closely with mit's david shoemaker, ligo's newly elected spokesperson, as they restructure the 1,000-member organization. 
 ""dr. cadonati has extensive expertise in data analysis, as well as experience in creating and leading a national science foundation-supported ligo group as a single investigator,"" said shoemaker, a senior research scientist at the mit kavli institute for astrophysics and space research. ""she covers both the research and the leadership sides of the house, which are integral for our continued success in cultivating the scientific advances from the lsc."" 
 cadonati previously served as chair of the ligo data analysis council. she coordinated and guided the activities of hundreds of scientists around the world who work together to analyze the data coming out of the ligo detectors in louisiana and washington. 
 ligo detected the first-ever gravitational wave in september of 2015, the result of two black holes crashing into each other nearly 1.5 billion years ago. the waves, ripples in the fabric of spacetime, were originally predicted in 1915 by albert einstein in his general theory of relativity. ligo captured a second wave in december of 2015, again from colliding back holes. 
 ""those were huge milestones. these initial detections opened a new window of the universe and gave us our first glimpse,"" said cadonati. ""this new chapter will allow us to create a path that will bring our field to its full potential."" 
 it includes preparing for two things that excite cadonati. the first would be the discovery of gravitational waves from binary coalescences that include neutron stars. scientists believe a collision of neutron stars would result in the production of electromagnetic waves (or light), absent when black holes come together. 
 ""detecting that type of event would allow us to combine the information encoded in gravitational and electromagnetic waves,"" she said. ""it would also reveal more clues about the properties of neutron stars, which are related to nuclear matter here on earth."" 
 the second signature on cadonati's wish list is a core-collapse supernova explosion in our galaxy, an event that marks the final moments of a star's life. these explosions, which are expected to occur every 20-30 years, leave behind a black hole or neutron star and emit gravitational waves, electromagnetic waves and neutrinos. 
 witnessing either of these events would give scientists a better understanding of the early universe. 
 ligo is roughly halfway through its second advanced science run. it will continue to monitor the universe until the end of august. the group will then take a year off to upgrade and increase the sensitivity of the detectors and begin again in late summer 2018. 
 cadonati is part of georgia tech's 
 center for relativistic astrophysics . she and professors deirdre shoemaker and pablo laguna are the institute's ligo faculty members. they are joined by more than a dozen georgia tech undergraduates, graduate students and postdoctoral fellows in the worldwide collaboration.

 the collegiate inventors competition has selected a team of two georgia tech and emory graduate students as finalists in its 2016 annual competition. 
 aaron blanchard and khalid salaita, associate professor of chemistry at emory. 
 oct 03, 2016 
 - atlanta, ga 
 the collegiate inventors competition has selected a team of two georgia tech and emory graduate students as finalists in its 2016 annual competition. aaron blanchard and kevin yehl are students in the wallace h. coulter department of biomedical engineering at georgia tech and emory university and in emory's laney graduate school. their advisor, khalid salaita, ph.d., is associate professor of chemistry in emory college. the team is one of only six graduate teams and five undergraduate teams selected nationally. 
 the emory-georgia tech team invented rolosense, a dna-powered diagnostic machine that turns chemical energy into rolling motion. this molecular vehicle carries a bead just five microns in diameter at speeds 1,000 times faster than previous motors. the speed of the bead through a sample can indicate the presence of a single gene variation or detect a variety of molecules such as lead using a smartphone application. this could make advanced testing for diseases and contaminants more efficient in remote areas when it's needed most. 
 founded in 1990, the collegiate inventors competition recognizes and rewards the nation's top collegiate inventors. in partnership with the united states patent and trademark office (uspto), the collegiate inventors competition is the nation's foremost competition encouraging innovation, entrepreneurship, and creativity in students who are working on cutting-edge inventions at their colleges and universities. the competition is a program of the national inventors hall of fame and is sponsored by the united states patent and trademark office (uspto) and abbvie foundation, with additional support from arrow electronics. 
 each year, individuals representing a broad cross-section of technological fields serve as first round judges, evaluating entries based on originality of the idea, process (or technology used), level of student initiative, and potential value and usefulness to society. 
 the finalists will travel to alexandria, va., to present their inventions to an esteemed panel of final round judges, comprising the most influential inventors and invention experts in the nation - national inventors hall of fame inductees, united states patent and trademark office (uspto) experts, and abbvie scientists. the top three entries in the undergraduate and graduate divisions will receive cash prizes. 
 the awards ceremony will take place on nov. 4, 2016, at the uspto madison building in alexandria, va. before the ceremony, from 11 a.m.-noon, competition finalists will showcase their inventions and interact with thousands of uspto patent and trademark examiners, sponsors, media, and the public at the collegiate inventors competition expo, which is free and open to all in the community. 
 ""the uspto is proud to host the 2016 collegiate inventors competition,"" says michelle k. lee, under secretary of commerce for intellectual property and director of the uspto. ""each year, these students bring innovation to the forefront, developing unique solutions to real world problems. as we continue to promote innovation, we are inspired by the young entrepreneurs who provide us with a glimpse into the future of american technological advancement."" 
 the 2016 collegiate inventors competition final round judges include 10 inductees from the national inventors hall of fame: eric r. fossum (cmos active pixel image sensor camera-on-a-chip), marcian ""ted"" hoff (microprocessor), don keck (optical fiber), alois langer (implantable defibrillator), victor lawrence (signal processing in telecommunications), radia perlman (robust network routing and bridging), steve sasson (digital camera), gary sharp (polarization-control technology), and jim west (electret microphone). additional expert judges include elizabeth l. dougherty and george elliott representing the uspto, and jeffrey y. pan, and david chang-yen representing abbvie, inc.

 the institute for information security and privacy at georgia tech examines emerging cyber threats for 2017. 
 sep 28, 2016 
 - atlanta, ga 
 georgia tech's 2017 
 emerging cyber threats, trends and technologies 
 report highlights concerns about global manipulation of information, health care fraud, data encryption and other issues likely to affect society in the year ahead. the report, produced annually, is an expert-driven review of recent cybersecurity trends, developing research and threat considerations. 
 among the findings: 
 global information manipulation by nation-states is now widespread, causing western nations to curtail free speech and news consumers to view information cautiously. 
 health care fraud is taking off in the absence of good defenses, as the value of personal data far surpasses that of stolen credit cards. 
 cultural differences and unresolved approaches to data encryption continue to mire companies and business leaders with uncertainty and risk in north america and europe. 
 crowdsourced and open-source solutions hold promise for addressing insecure, aging electronic voting systems. 
 public proof of who is behind cyberattacks remains elusive. 
 interest is growing in computer science education, suggesting a changing tide in the nation's shortfall of information technology workers. 
 ""cyberattacks today are flourishing because almost every organization conducts some portion of its business online - putting even digitally cautious consumers at risk when it is not sufficiently protected,"" said wenke lee, co-director of the institute for information security and privacy (iisp) and professor of computer science at georgia tech. ""there is widespread reluctance to share threat information, and there's a lack of public attribution about who is responsible, making it nearly impossible for the public to defend themselves."" 
 georgia tech's broad understanding of cybersecurity issues can be used to develop strategies to address a range of threats, noted bo rotoloni, co-director of iisp. 
 ""under this unique combination, georgia tech can help foretell how the ‘white hats' should prepare because we continually witness how the ‘black hats' adapt,"" said rotoloni, director of the information and cyber sciences directorate at the georgia tech research institute, the university's applied research arm. 
 georgia tech issues the threat report each fall in conjunction with its annual 
 cyber security summit , which is taking place today in tech square. the summit brings together government, industry and academia for objective conversation about the challenges of securing information and cyber-connected systems.

 - atlanta, ga 
 a new vulnerability affecting android mobile devices results not from a traditional bug, but from the malicious combination of two legitimate permissions that power desirable and commonly-used features in popular apps. the combination could result in a new class of attacks, which has been dubbed ""cloak and dagger."" 
 the vulnerability, which was identified and tested in closed environments by computer scientists at the georgia institute of technology, would allow attackers to silently take control of a mobile device, overlaying the graphical interface with false information to hide malicious activities being performed underneath - such as capturing passwords or extracting the user's contacts. a successful attack would require the user to first install a type of malware that could be hidden in a pirated game or other app. 
 georgia tech researchers have disclosed the potential attack to google, maker of the android system, and details of the vulnerability will be presented may 24 at the 38th ieee symposium on security and privacy in san jose, california. but because it involves two common features that can be misused even when they behave as intended, the issue could be more difficult to resolve than ordinary operating system bugs. 
 ""in cloak and dagger, we identified two different android features that when combined, allow an attacker to read, change or capture the data entered into popular mobile apps,"" said 
 wenke lee , a professor in georgia tech's 
 school of computer science 
 and co-director of the 
 institute for information security & privacy . ""the two features involved are very useful in mapping, chat or password manager apps, so preventing their misuse will require users to trade convenience for security. this is as dangerous an attack as we could possibly describe."" 
 the research was sponsored by the national science foundation (nsf), office of naval research (onr) and the defense advanced research projects agency (darpa). 
 the first permission feature involved in the attack, known as ""bind_accessibility_service,"" supports the use of devices by disabled persons, allowing inputs such as user name and password to be made by voice command, and allowing outputs such as a screen reader to help the disabled view content. the second permission, known as ""system_alert_window,"" is an overlay or ""draw on top"" feature that produces a window on top of the device's usual screen to display bubbles for a chat program or maps for a ride-sharing app. 
 when combined in a malicious way, ""system_alert_window"" acts as a cloak, while ""bind_accessibility_service"" serves as the dagger. the two could allow attackers to draw a window that fools users into believing they are interacting with legitimate features of the app. the malicious program, operating as the overlay, would then capture the user's credentials for the malware author, while the accessibility permission would enter the credentials into the real app hidden beneath, allowing it to operate as expected, leaving the user with no clue that anything is awry. 
 the researchers tested a simulated attack on 20 users of android mobile devices and found that none of them noticed the attack. 
 of most concern to georgia tech's researchers is that these permissions may be automatically included in legitimate apps from the google play store, meaning users do not need to explicitly grant permissions for the attack to succeed. 
 ""this is a design flaw that some might say allows the app functionality to work as intended, but our research shows that it can be misused,"" said yanick fratantonio, the paper's first author and a georgia tech ph.d. summer intern from the university of california santa barbara. ""once the phone is compromised, there may be no way for the user to understand what has happened."" 
 nearly 10 percent of the top 5,000 android apps use the overlay feature, noted fratantonio, and many are downloaded with the accessibility feature enabled. 
 while both permissions have been used separately as user-interface redressing attacks and ""a11y attacks,"" previous research did not examine what happens when they are combined, noted simon p. chung, a research scientist at georgia tech's school of computer science and one of the study's co-authors. 
 creating vulnerabilities when permissions are combined may be a reality that system developers will have to consider more seriously in the future, fratantonio said. ""changing a feature is not like fixing a bug,"" he explained. ""system designers will now have to think more about how seemingly unrelated features could interact. features do not operate separately on the device."" 
 android versions up to and including the current 7.1.2 are vulnerable to this attack. the researchers caution that it may be difficult to determine the status of the settings required for the attack. 
 there are two key precautions, lee and fratantonio agree. one is to avoid downloading apps from providers other than branded outlets such as the google play store. a second step is to check the permission requests that apps make before allowing them to operate. 
 ""users need to be careful about the permissions that new apps request,"" said lee. ""if there are very broad permissions, or the permissions don't seem to match what the app is promising to do, you need to be sure you really need that app."" 
 the researchers have produced a video that shows the attack and how to check these permissions, which are in different locations depending on the mobile operating system version. 
 ""apps from name-brand sources such as facebook, uber and skype should be okay,"" said lee. ""but with a random game or free versions of paid apps that you might download, you should be very careful. these features are very powerful and can be abused to do anything you could do as a user - without you knowing."" 
 in addition to the researchers already mentioned, the project also included chenxiong qian from georgia tech. 
 this research was supported by the nsf awards cns-1017265, cns-0831300, cns-1149051 and dge-1500084, by the onr under grants n000140911042 and n000141512162, and by the darpa transparent computing program under contract darpa-15-15-tc-fp-006. any opinions, findings, conclusions or recommendations expressed in this material are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of the nsf, onr or darpa.

combining-language-and-math-greater-good.txt,"combining language and math for the greater good 
 georgia tech computer science students and brothers, christopher and stephen linder have been using the russian language to tutor ukrainian refugees in math. 
 jan 11, 2024 
 georgia tech computer science students and brothers, christopher and stephen linder have been using their math skills and passion for the russian language to teach ukrainian refugees through the tutoring without borders program. 
 tutoring without borders 
 is an independent platform helping to connect ukrainian citizens in need of academic help with potential instructors or tutors. 
 ""the opportunity to work with tutoring without borders has been amazing. it's been a great way to combine language and math, which are two completely different things, into something very meaningful,"" stephen said. 
 the first-year students grew up in marietta, georgia, and say that georgia tech was always their dream school - even though both of their parents went to uga, 
 which makes for a bit of lighthearted controversy in the family. 
 christopher and stephen both came to tech as math majors but quickly gravitated toward computer science, finding in that discipline an appealing way to use math to solve tangible problems. 
 the computer science majors first became interested in russian in high school. both brothers were learning the violin, and their instructor was russian. ""he would always say little phrases in russian, and one day our dad jokes and says, ‘hey, why don't you study russian so you can be taught in russian by your teacher?'"" christopher recalled. 
 what began as a joke inspired the brothers to enroll in russian language courses in their first year of high school. they are now thinking about adding a russian major to their resumes. 
 the linders' love of the russian language has only deepened, and with the war in ukraine, they felt compelled to help. ""we felt a responsibility to help in some way because of our ability to communicate in russian,"" stephen said. 
 sharing their concerns with their russian language teacher, they discovered  that math tutors are needed in ukraine. their teacher introduced them to tutoring without borders, an independent platform connecting ukrainian citizens with potential tutors. 
 since june 2022, christopher has been tutoring a young woman whose family was forced to move to hungary. stephen tutors two siblings who have been displaced to england. regardless of where students are located, the brothers find time to assist them with their math - and even with their english. 
 christopher and stephen both note the challenges of teaching something technical in a different language, in addition to the emotional toll it can take working with students whose lives have been uprooted. both continue to be passionate about helping and have no plans to stop anytime soon. 
 ""i think just knowing that we can be there to provide some stability is very rewarding. and for me, personally, just getting to learn about my students and learn about their lives is something not many people are able to experience,"" christopher said.

combosquatting-attack-hides-plain-sight-trick-computer-users.txt,"""combosquatting"" attack hides in plain sight to trick computer users 
 attackers are tricking computer users with urls that are similar to those of real companies. 
 chart shows the number of combosquatted domains identified in each domain group studied. 
 oct 30, 2017 
 - atlanta, ga 
 to guard against unknowingly visiting malicious websites, computer users have been taught to double-check website urls before they click on a link. but attackers are now taking advantage of that practice to trick users into visiting website domains that contain familiar trademarks - but with additional words that change the destination to an attack site. 
 for example, attackers might register www.familiarbankname-security[.]com or www.security-familiarbankname[.]com. unwary users see the familiar bank name in the url, but the additional hyphenated word means the destination is very different from what was expected. the result could be counterfeit merchandise, stolen credentials, a malware infection - or another computer conscripted into a botnet attack. 
 the attack strategy, known as combosquatting, is a growing threat, with millions of such domains set up for malicious purposes, according to a new study scheduled to be presented october 31 at the 2017 acm conference on computer and communications security (ccs). 
 ""this is a tactic that the adversaries are using more and more because they have seen that it works,"" said 
 manos antonakakis , an assistant professor in the 
 school of electrical and computer engineering 
 at the georgia institute of technology. ""this attack is hiding in plain sight, but many people aren't computer-savvy enough to notice the difference in the urls containing familiar trademarked names."" 
 researchers from georgia tech and stony brook university conducted the study, which is believed to be the first large-scale, empirical study of combosquatting. the work was supported by u.s. department of defense agencies, the national science foundation and the u.s. department of commerce. 
 combosquatting differs from its better-known relative, typosquatting, in which adversaries register variations of urls that users are likely to type incorrectly. combosquatting domains don't depend on victims making typing errors, but instead provide malicious links embedded in emails, web advertising or the results of web searches. combosquatting attackers often combine the trademarked name with a term designed to convey a sense of urgency to encourage victims to click on what appears at first glance to be a legitimate link. 
 ""we have seen combosquatting used in virtually every kind of cyberattack that we know of, from drive-by downloads to phishing attacks by nation-states,"" said panagiotis kintis, a georgia tech graduate research assistant who is the first author of the study. ""these attacks can even fool security people who may be looking at network traffic for malicious activity. when they see a familiar trademark, they may feel a false sense of comfort with it."" 
 for their study, the researchers began with the 500 most popular trademarked domain names in the united states, and excluded certain combinations made up of common words. they separated the domains into 20 categories, then added two additional domains: one for for politics - the study was done before the 2016 election - and another for energy. 
 with the resulting 268 trademark-containing urls, they set out to find domain names that incorporated the trademarked name with additional words added at the start or end. they searched through six years of active and passive domain name system (dns) requests - more than 468 billion records - provided by one of the largest internet service providers in north america. 
 ""the result was mind-blowing,"" said kintis. ""we found orders of magnitude more combosquatting domains than typosquatting domains, for instance. the space for combosquatting is almost infinite because attackers can register as many domains as they want with any variation that they want. in some cases, registering a domain can cost less than a dollar."" 
 in the six-year data set, the researchers found 2.7 million combosquatting domains for the 268 popular trademarks alone, and the combosquatting domains were 100 times more prevalent than typosquatting domains. the combosquatting attacks appear to be challenging to combat, with nearly 60 percent of the abusive domains in operation for more than 1,000 days - almost three years. and the number of combosquatting domains registered grew every year between 2011 and 2016. 
 among the malicious domains, the researchers discovered some that had previously been registered by legitimate companies which had combined words with their trademarks. for some reason, those companies permitted the registrations to lapse, allowing the trademark-containing domain names - which once led to legitimate sites - to be taken over by combosquatting attackers. 
 in many cases, malicious domains were re-registered multiple times after they had expired, suggesting an improvement in ""internet hygiene"" may be needed to address this threat. 
 ""imagine what happens in a city when the garbage isn't picked up regularly,"" antonakakis said. ""the garbage builds up and you have diseases develop. nobody collects the garbage domains on the internet, because it's nobody's job. but there should be an organization that would collect these malicious domains so they cannot be reused to infect people."" 
 more stringent anti-fraud screening of persons registering domains would also help, he added. ""we don't want to prevent legitimate users from getting onto the internet, but there are warning signs of potential fraud that registrars could detect."" 
 what can be done by ordinary computer users and the organizations where they work? 
 ""users unfortunately have to be better educated than they are now,"" antonakakis said. ""organizations can provide training in the on-boarding process that takes place for new employees, and they can protect their network perimeters to prevent users from being exposed to known combosquatting domains. more needs to be done to address this growing cybersecurity problem."" 
 in addition to those already mentioned, the research included najmeh miramirkhani and nick nikiforakis from stony brook university; charles lever, yizheng chen and rosa romero-gómez from georgia tech, and nikolaos pitropakis from london south bank university.

 the global center for medical innovation (gcmi) recently hosted u.s. department of commerce officials, who visited the facility for a better understanding of its best practices in iatric commercialization. gcmi, which launched in 2012, is the southeast's first comprehensive medical device innovation center. an affiliate of georgia tech, gcmi's core mission is to accelerate the development and commercialization of next-generation medical devices and technology. the commerce department's economic development administration arm awarded a $1 million i6 challenge grant to gcmi in 2010 toward its launch. ""i want to come see what it is the federal government is investing in and how it's impacting people,"" said julie lenzer kirk, director of the commerce department's office of innovation and entrepreneurship. ""being one of our original i6 winners, gcmi also offers some insight as we continue to evolve the program."" while touring the facility with georgia tech president g.p. ""bud"" peterson and gcmi executive director tiffany wilson karp, kirk saw its design, engineering, and prototyping capabilities as well as its cleanroom space. she also learned about gcmi's relationships with children's healthcare of atlanta and west tennessee healthcare, as well as a number of medical device-related organizations. ""we have been working to bring together the rich medical device ecosystem in the southeast around our prototyping expertise and infrastructure to help medtech startups accelerate commercialization,"" karp said. ""our mission is to help these early-stage companies bring those solutions to market and make a difference in the quality of patients' lives."" gcmi's focus on that core mission and doing so from an entrepreneurial viewpoint is impressive, kirk said, adding that she will be looking at its best practices and lessons learned in formulating criteria for future i6 challenges. ""it's just been really great to see the impact that they're having at the university, in the technology community, and ultimately right to the patient - and that's why we do what we do,"" kirk said following the jan. 15 tour. ""it is a place for entrepreneurs and innovation, and that's part of the message: that it takes an entrepreneurial mindset to get this kind of thing done.""

common-probiotic-bacteria-could-help-boost-protection-against-influenza.txt,"common probiotic bacteria could help boost protection against influenza 
 a newly funded research project might one day lead to the development of a pill or capsule able to boost the effectiveness of traditional vaccines against influenza

 sep 06, 2023 
 researchers at the georgia institute of technology (georgia tech) have received funding to study the concept of using modified strains of probiotic bacteria - that are already part of the human gut microbiome - to stimulate the formation of antibodies against the flu virus in the body's mucosal membranes. respiratory viruses like influenza infect the body through mucosal membranes, and the proof-of-concept project will help evaluate whether snippets of influenza proteins - tiny fragments of the virus - could be added to two common bacterial strains to create the antibody response. antibodies in the mucosal membranes might then complement those created by traditional intramuscular injections to head off flu infection. 
 the research, supported by the 
 air force research laboratory 
 (afrl), will study whether or not the harmless bacteria can be successfully modified to carry snippets of a viral coat protein that could stimulate the desired response in mucosal membranes lining the gut. beyond reducing influenza infection in the general population, improved protection against the flu could have a significant impact on the u.s. military, which wants to provide the best possible protection for its warfighters to reduce possible impacts on readiness and training from influenza outbreaks. 
 at georgia tech, the project is a collaboration between researchers at the georgia tech research institute (gtri) and the georgia tech 
 school of biological sciences . all of the research at georgia tech will be done using bsl-2 facilities designed for this type of study. the award does not include research on animals or humans. 
 ""ultimately, this could one day make vaccination programs much more effective,"" said michael farrell, a gtri principal research scientist. ""this isn't going to be a replacement for flu vaccines as they currently exist, but it could act as an adjuvant - something that's done in addition to vaccination to increase the overall immune response. to benefit from it, you might take a pill like you do with probiotics now."" 
 using common probiotic bacteria as vehicles 
 the project will focus on two common probiotic bacteria: 
 escherichia coli 
 - a gram-negative bacterium better known as 
 e. coli 
 - and 
 lactococcus lactis , a gram-positive bacterium found in cheese, buttermilk, and other dairy food items. the researchers will attempt to coax the bacteria to express the influenza virus' hemagglutinin (ha) receptor protein on their outer cell surface. there, the protein would stimulate an antibody response in the gut mucosal membrane as it passes through the body's gastrointestinal tract. 
 ""we're using some well-established probiotic bacteria that have been utilized for dozens of years, are well vetted and safe for humans,"" said 
 brian hammer , an associate professor in the school of biological sciences who specializes in bacterial genetics. ""ultimately, the idea is to use these bacteria as a chassis to create living vaccines, since the body already tolerates them both well."" 
 researchers at afrl and georgia tech envision that a single pill or capsule would carry the bacteria into the gastrointestinal tract to provide the necessary antibody stimulation. the bacteria would be modified so they could not reproduce, preventing them from becoming part of the body's gut microbiome - a diverse collection of bacteria that live in the body and help carry out specific functions, including metabolizing food and modulating the immune system. 
 ""we know the human microbiome is intimately involved in human health and disease, influencing processes in ways that have both positive and negative outcomes for us,"" said richard agans, senior research biological scientist at the u.s. air force school of aerospace medicine (usafsam). ""recently, we have started to better understand how the microbiome communicates with our bodies and how we can identify, target, and promote the beneficial aspects. currently, we are working to determine how to utilize these microbial communities to better protect our warfighters as well as the general public."" 
 overcoming challenges of manipulating bacteria 
 hammer's lab specializes in manipulating proteins of organisms such as bacteria and viruses to create novel fusions. among the techniques available is the new crispr-cas, the gene-editing technology that was the subject of a nobel prize in 2020, but other more traditional techniques may also be used to get the influenza surface protein where the researchers want it to be. 
 among the challenges ahead is that adding a new component to bacterial organisms can be difficult. 
 ""in general, bacteria have evolved with the genetic components they need to survive,"" farrell explained. ""if you add something else, they may just kick it out. it's very hard to find a neutral location in the bacterial genome where we can stably add new functionality. this is especially true for this effort, in which there will be no cointroduction of antimicrobial resistance markers."" 
 in addition, the probiotic bacteria strains that are widely used in research as model organisms, or ""lab rats,"" are adapted to living in laboratory conditions. this project, however, will use natural commensal strains that co-exist in humans. that approach may make it even more challenging to add the appropriate material for expressing the viral proteins on the bacteria cell surfaces, hammer said. 
 ""we used to perceive that genes could be shuffled around in the bacteria without much effect on them, but we're learning now that location really matters,"" he said. ""one of the concerns is that tools that work on the ‘lab rat' versions of these bacteria will not be as readily accepted by these commensals."" 
 as part of the project, the researchers will have to show that the addition of the protein doesn't cause instability in the bacteria, and that the modified bacteria generate the correct response when exposed to human immune cells in culture. 
 proof of concept could lead to broader vaccine therapies 
 beyond its importance to the military, influenza was chosen to study this adjuvant approach because a number of vaccines exist for this virus, and they have been well studied over the years. if this approach works with influenza, the combination of pill and injection might be useful for vaccines against other respiratory viruses. 
 ""if this is ultimately successful, it could be the first foray into showing that these vehicles, these probiotics, could potentially be scaled up for lots of different therapeutic uses,"" said hammer. ""by customizing the cargo, this approach could be rapidly adapted to address new and emerging threats that may arise in the future."" 
 project provides student opportunity 
 the two-year project life was chosen because of the expected difficulty - and because another of its goals is to train a master's degree student in the bacterial modification techniques being utilized. 
 the georgia tech researchers have chosen an underrepresented minority student who holds an undergraduate degree in biology from kennesaw state university and has worked in a commercial dna laboratory. katrina lancaster will begin work on this project during fall semester, collaborating with both hammer and farrell - and the students and other researchers in their labs. 
 ""this student will have excellent opportunities, not only to learn the skills in the lab and take the coursework, but also to develop a rich network of connections, both in the school of biological sciences and at gtri, that will be helpful in moving forward and advancing their career,"" hammer said. ""it's a really beautiful combination of components for this project."" 
 the project is funded through the afrl's minority leaders research collaboration program (ml-rcp). 
 ""partnering with academic institutions, such as gtri, presents great opportunities for our team to interact and work with top minds in these fields to develop better outcomes for everyone,"" agans said. ""we are especially grateful for the opportunity to mentor and provide opportunities for underrepresented students with stem aspirations. we are excited to work with gtri in this endeavor and envision this being just the first step."" 
 usafsam is part of the air force research laboratory's 711th human performance wing.

 new research may guide selection of nanoparticles for transporting therapeutic molecules into cells.

 the first direct comparison of 
 in vitro 
 and 
 in vivo 
 screening techniques for identifying nanoparticles that may be used to transport therapeutic molecules into cells shows that testing in lab dishes isn't much help in predicting which nanoparticles will successfully enter the cells of living animals. 
 the new study demonstrated the advantages of an 
 in vivo 
 dna barcoding technique, which attaches small snippets of dna to different lipid-based nanoparticles that are then injected into living animals; more than a hundred nanoparticles can be tested in a single animal. dna sequencing techniques are then used to identify which nanoparticles enter the cells of specific organs, making the particles candidates for transporting gene therapies to treat such killers as heart disease, cancer and parkinson's disease. 
 the traditional technique for identifying promising nanoparticles examines how the particles enter living cells kept in lab dishes. to compare the new and old screening techniques, the researchers added barcoded nanoparticles to living cells in lab dishes, and injected identical barcoded nanoparticles into living animal models. they found almost no correlation between the nanoparticles identified as promising in the lab dish tests and those that actually performed well in the mice. 
 ""dna barcoding has the potential to advance the science of selecting nanoparticles for delivering gene therapies,"" said 
 james dahlman , an assistant professor in the 
 wallace h. coulter department of biomedical engineering at georgia tech and emory university 
 and the study's principal investigator. ""using this technique, companies and academic labs could pick out promising nanoparticles much more efficiently. that could accelerate the rate at which nanoparticle-based therapies move into the clinic, while reducing the amount of animal testing required."" 
 the research, which is supported by the national institutes of health, the cancer research institute, cystic fibrosis foundation and parkinson's disease foundation, was reported february 28 in the journal 
 acs nano letters . the research was conducted by scientists from the georgia institute of technology and emory university. 
 genetic therapies, such as those made from dna or rna, face challenges because of the difficulty in delivering the nucleic acid to the right cells. for the past two decades, scientists have been developing nanoparticles made from a broad range of materials and adding compounds such as cholesterol to help carry these therapeutic agents into cells. but the development of nanoparticle carriers has been slowed by the challenges of testing them, first in cell culture to identify promising nanoparticles, and later in animals. with millions of possible combinations, identifying the optimal nanoparticles to target each organ has been overwhelming. 
 using dna strands just 58 nucleotides long to uniquely identify each particle allows researchers to skip the cell culture screening altogether - and test a hundred or more different types of nanoparticles simultaneously in just a handful of animals. 
 ""if you wanted to test 200 nanoparticles in the traditional way, you would need 600 mice - three for each type of nanoparticle,"" said dahlman. ""using the dna barcoding technique, which we call joint rapid dna analysis of nanoparticles (jordan), we are able to do the testing in just three animals."" 
 the study examined nanoparticle entry into endothelial cells and macrophages for the 
 in vitro 
 study, and the same type of cells from the lung, heart and bone marrow for the 
 in vivo 
 component. the two cell types are important to a broad range of organ systems in the body and play active roles in diseases that could be targets for nucleic acid therapies. the study compared how the same 281 lipid nanoparticles delivered the barcodes in lab dishes and living animals. 
 ""there was no predictive capability between the lab dish tests and the animal tests,"" dahlman said. ""if the 
 in vitro 
 tests had been good predictors, then particles that did well in the dish would also have done well in the animals, and particles that did poorly in the dish would also have done poorly in the animals. we did not see that at all."" 
 the research team, led by co-first authors kalina paunovska and cory d. sago, also studied how nanoparticle delivery changes with the microenvironment of specific tissue types. for that, they quantified how 85 nanoparticles delivered dna barcodes to eight cell populations in the spleen, and found that cell types derived from myeloid progenitors tended to be targeted by similar nanoparticles. 
 researchers are interested not only in which nanoparticles deliver the therapeutics most effectively, but also which can deliver them selectively to specific organs. therapeutics targeted to tumors, for example, should be delivered only to the tumor and not to surrounding tissues. therapeutics for heart disease likewise should selectively accumulate in the heart. 
 the single-strand dna barcode sequences use in the technique are about the same size as antisense oligonucleotides, microrna and sirna being developed for possible therapeutic uses. other gene-based therapeutics are larger, and additional research would be needed to determine if the technique could be used with them. 
 once the promising nanoparticles are identified with the screening, they would be subjected to additional testing to verify their ability to deliver therapeutics. to avoid the possibility of nanoparticles merging, only structures that are stable in aqueous environments can be tested with this technique. only nontoxic nanoparticles can be screened, and researchers must control for potential inflammation generated by the inserted dna. 
 ""nucleic acid therapies hold considerable promise for treating a range of serious diseases,"" said dahlman. ""we hope this technique will be used widely in the field, and that it will ultimately bring more clarity to how these drugs affect cells - and how we can get them to the right locations in the body."" 
 in addition to those already mentioned, the research team included christopher m. monaco, marielena gamboa castro, tobi g. rudoltz, sujay kalathoor, daryll a. vanover and professor philip j. santangelo of the coulter department; william h. hudson and rafi ahmed of the emory vaccine center and department of microbiology and immunology at emory university, and anton v. bryksin of the parker h. petit institute for bioengineering and bioscience at georgia tech.

 a new project will provide computational tools designed to help identify and characterize the gene diversity of the residents of microbial communities. 
 diagram shows the major steps taken in research conducted on communities of microbes in lake water by the laboratory of kostas konstantinidis at georgia tech. the focus of the nsf-supported project will be to develop the bioinformatics tools that will enable genomic and meta-genomic research.

 microbes of interest to clinicians and environmental scientists rarely exist in isolation. organisms essential to breaking down pollutants or causing illness live in complex communities, and separating one microbe from hundreds of companion species can be challenging for researchers seeking to understand environmental issues or disease processes.  a new national science foundation-supported project will provide computational tools designed to help identify and characterize the gene diversity of the residents of these microbial communities. the project, being done by researchers at the georgia institute of technology and michigan state university, will allow clinicians and scientists to compare the genomic information of organisms they encounter against the growing volumes of data provided by the world's scientific community. the tools will be hosted on a web server designed to be used by researchers who may not have training in the latest bioinformatics techniques. a prototype system containing a limited number of computational tools is already available at 
 http: / / enve-omics.ce.gatech.edu 
 and is attracting more than 500 users each month. ""across many areas of science, we are dealing with communities of microorganisms, and one challenge we've had is to identify them because we haven't had good tools to tell apart individual microbes from the mixtures,"" said 
 kostas konstantinidis , an associate professor in the 
 school of civil and environmental engineering 
 at georgia tech and the project's principal investigator. ""our tools will be designed to deal with the genomes of whole communities of organisms."" current techniques identify individual microbes by examining their small subunit ribosomal rna (ssu rrna) genes, but the new tools will allow scientists to analyze entire genomes and meta-genomes. ""with the dawn of the genomic era, we can now get the whole genome of these organisms to see not only the ribosomal rna, but also all the genes in the genome to get a better understanding of what the each organism's potential might be,"" said konstantinidis. ""there will be many advantages for looking at all the genes instead of just one, the ssu rrna, such as to identify which organisms encode toxins or the enzymes for breaking down pollutants."" collaborators on the three-year project include scientists who operate the ribosomal database project at michigan state university: jim tiedje, director of michigan state university's center for microbial ecology and james cole, a michigan state university research assistant professor and director of the ribosomal database project. the ability to identify and enumerate the organisms in complex communities using culture-independent, genomic technologies and associated bioinformatics algorithms is becoming more important as scientists study organisms that can't be grown in the lab. the majority of the world's organisms resist traditional lab culture, meaning they have to be studied in the field and identified through genetic information. konstantinidis and his research group are studying such communities in the water of lakes in chattahoochee river system in georgia and elsewhere. they are examining how these communities respond to perturbations, such as oil or pesticide spills, and the role that different members of the community play in breaking down pollutants. ""these tools actually come from our research practice,"" said konstantinidis. ""we came to the point where we couldn't process the data to answer the questions we wanted to ask. that led us to this new project to develop the tools we and others need to interrogate the data and get the information we are looking for."" a single liter of lake water may contain as many as 500 different species, and together, their genomic information can total tens of billions of gene-coding letters. from lake lanier alone, the team has generated 200 gigabytes of genomic data. ""we want to figure out what organisms are there, and what genes they encode,"" konstantinidis explained. ""the tools we are developing will allow us to do this."" the tools developed in the project will be useful to both clinical microbiologists and environmental researchers. ""this will not be specific to any one discipline,"" he said. ""as long as people are working with microbes, this will be helpful to them because some of the questions are universal."" the system will also be built to provide user-friendly help to scientists who may not have training in the latest genomic and bioinformatics techniques. ""there is a big need for big data analysis, and there are not many trained people right now,"" konstantinidis said. ""these tools will make the lives of researchers easier."" among the challenges ahead is building an infrastructure able to handle the growing amounts of genomic information produced worldwide. ""we will have to develop some computational solutions for the problems of keeping up with all the new data becoming available,"" said konstantinidis. ""we need to make tools that have high throughput to keep up with data volumes that are increasing geometrically."" the system will initially operate on servers at georgia tech and michigan state university, but if demand and data grow, additional resources may be sought, such as the national science foundation's xsede supercomputer. this research is supported by the national science foundation under award dbi-1356288. the opinions expressed in this article are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the official views of the national science foundation. kostas konstantinidis is the carlton s. wilder junior faculty professor in the georgia tech school of civil and environmental engineering. research news georgia institute of technology 177 north avenue atlanta, georgia  30332-0181  usa   media relations contacts : john toon (404-894-6986) ( jtoon@gatech.edu ) or brett israel (404-385-1933) ( brett.israel@comm.gatech.edu ). write r: john toon

 an idea that originated in a residence hall won big at the 2023 georgia tech 
 inventure prize . jeff mao and tyler ma, both second-year computer science students, have developed a web-based platform that could help millions of online sellers save time and money. 
 team sellraze's idea won a $20,000 check and earned mao and ma a coveted spot in tech's 
 startup launch 
 program, which will give them access to 
 coaching from experienced entrepreneurs, access to venture capital possibilities, and a path to fast-track their idea into a viable startup. 
 during the presentation, the pair demonstrated the process of taking a single product listing on amazon and adding it to ebay, which took 11 minutes and multiple steps. with sellraze, mao and ma say sellers can accomplish the same task in seconds and a couple of clicks. 
 ""list once, sell everywhere,"" mao explained. 
 one inventure prize judge, the board director of intercontinental hotels group and intercontinental exchange, asked the team how they planned to make money. 
 mao said they would offer a ""fremium"" model, giving users some free listings and the option to pay for increasing tiers of multiple listings. he also explained that their web platform offered a wealth of data about which products sell the best and the times and locations they are in highest demand - data that sellers and retailers would pay for. 
 after winning inventure, the team now plans to expand their platform to a wider variety of online retailing sites like depop, goat, mercari, and poshmark. ""walmart has been scaling their online presence. we also want to add them,"" ma said. 
 sellraze will also receive a free u.s. patent filing from georgia tech's office of technology licensing. well worth the hard work they have put into developing the platform, mao and ma say half the code was written between 2 and 7 a.m. 
 second place and $10,000 went to team spoileralert, three biomedical engineering students who invented an antibody test for insulin degradation allowing diabetic patients to evaluate the effectiveness of the drugs they take daily. 
 ""we believe all people with diabetes deserve to trust their medication,"" said grady lee, team member and a former georgia tech football player. 
 the $5,000 people's choice award, selected by the television viewing audience, went to julia pina and her novela lamp, which allows children to tell stories using wooden cutouts of shapes, characters, and scenes. 
 pina, an industrial design major, has already been in talks with toy retailers. she says her lamp promotes imaginative play and communication skills through creative expression and helps children and families reduce screen time. 
 after taking first place in the 15th edition of the inventure prize, team sellraze hoisted the trophy and thanked the fans in the ferst center. ""it's a major milestone in our journey as entrepreneurs.""

computer-simulations-shed-light-milky-ways-missing-red-giants.txt,"computer simulations shed light on the milky way's missing red giants 
 simulations provide test of why the center of the milky way has no visible older stars. 
 a sequence of snap shots based on a simulation of a red giant entering and exiting a clump in a fragmenting accretion disk. in this case, it takes 4 days for the star to travel through the clump (each .1 unit of time is approximately 1 hour). 
 jun 07, 2016 
 - atlanta, ga 
 new computer simulations from the georgia institute of technology provide a conclusive test for a hypothesis of why the center of the milky way appears to be filled with young stars but has very few old ones. according to the theory, the remnants of older, red giant stars are still there - they just aren't bright enough to be detected with telescopes. the 
 georgia tech simulations 
 investigate the possibility that these red giants were dimmed after they were stripped of 10s of percent of their mass millions of years ago during repeated collisions with an accretion disk at the galactic center. the very existence of the young stars, seen in astronomical observations today, is an indication that such a gaseous accretion disk was present in the galactic center because the young stars are thought to have formed from it as recently as a few million years ago. the study is published in the june edition of 
 the astrophysical journal . it is the first to run computer simulations on the theory, which was introduced in 2014. astrophysicists in georgia tech's college of sciences created models of red giants similar to those that are supposedly missing from the galactic center - stars that are more than a billion years old and 10s of times larger in size than the sun. they put them through a computerized version of a wind tunnel to simulate collisions with the gaseous disk that once occupied much of the space within .5 parsecs of the galactic center. they varied orbital velocities and the disk's density to find the conditions required to cause significant damage to the red giant stars. ""red giants could have lost a significant portion of their mass only if the disk was very massive and dense,"" said tamara bogdanovic, the georgia tech assistant professor who co-led the study. ""so dense, that gravity would have already fragmented the disk on its own, helping to form massive clumps that became the building blocks of a new generation of stars."" the simulations suggest that each of the red giant stars orbited its way into and through the disk as many as dozens of times, sometimes taking as long as days to weeks to complete a single pass-through. mass was stripped away with each collision as the star blistered the fragmenting disk's surface. according to former georgia tech undergraduate student thomas forrest kieffer, the first author on the paper, it's a process that would have taken place 4 to 8 million years ago, which is the same age as the young stars seen in the center of the milky way today. ""the only way for this scenario to take place within that relatively short time frame,"" kieffer said, ""was if, back then, the disk that fragmented had a much larger mass than all the young stars that eventually formed from it - at least 100 to 1,000 times more mass."" the impacts also likely lowered the kinetic energy of the red giant stars by at least 20 to 30 percent, shrinking their orbits and pulling them closer to the milky way's black hole. at the same time, the collisions may have torqued the surface and spun up the red giants, which are otherwise known to rotate relatively slowly in isolation. ""we don't know very much about the conditions that led to the most recent episode of star formation in the galactic center or whether this region of the galaxy could have contained so much gas,"" bogdanovic said. ""if it did, we expect that it would presently house under-luminous red giants with smaller orbits, spinning more rapidly than expected. if such population of red giants is observed, among a small number that are still above the detection threshold, it would provide direct support for the star-disk collision hypothesis and allow us to learn more about the origins of the milky way."" the paper, "" can star-disk collisions explain the missing red giants problem in the galactic center ,"" was published on june 1. this research was funded, in part, by the alfred p. sloan foundation (grant # br2013-016) and the national science foundation (ast-1333360).

 tech parkway to the john lewis student center at state street. 
 tech parkway to the john lewis student center loading dock. 
 access to tech parkway from north avenue (past cherry street) will be unavailable. traffic will be directed further down north avenue and access to tech parkway will be available at state street. see the detour plan 
 here . 
 in this section of campus, ferst drive is currently a low- traffic interior road that parallels tech parkway, creating a redundant route. future campus plans anticipate the removal of this redundancy, allowing for development or additional green space depending upon campus programmatic needs. 
 this phase of construction work will necessitate the removal of approximately 25 trees. in accordance with the campus landscape master plan and the tree care replacement policy, trees will be planted elsewhere on campus, or funds equivalent will be added to the campus tree bank. locations for replacement trees will be identified and the trees planted in the appropriate season. 
 this is the first of several phases of the campus connectivity plan, and it is expected to last until march 2024, as the campus begins to increase connectivity south and west of campus as outlined in the recently released 
 comprehensive campus plan . developments such as science square and arts square will require multimodal and pedestrian connectivity to the core of campus, and these connections will be implemented incrementally. 
 subsequent phases of construction will move west along ferst drive with updates provided as they become available.

control-system-helps-several-drones-team-deliver-heavy-packages.txt,"control system helps several drones team up to deliver heavy packages 
 researchers have developed a control system that will enable teams of drones to carry heavy packages. 
 researchers have developed a modular solution for handling larger packages without the need for a complex fleet of drones of varying sizes. by allowing teams of small drones to collaboratively lift objects using an adaptive control algorithm, the strategy could allow a wide range of packages to be delivered using a combination of several standard-sized vehicles. (credit: john toon, georgia tech) 
 mar 22, 2021 
 - atlanta, ga 
 many parcel delivery drones of the future are expected to handle packages weighing five pounds or less, a restriction that would allow small, standardized uavs to handle a large percentage of the deliveries now done by ground vehicles. but will that relegate heavier packages to slower delivery by conventional trucks and vans? 
 a research team at the georgia institute of technology has developed a modular solution for handling larger packages without the need for a complex fleet of drones of varying sizes. by allowing teams of small drones to collaboratively lift objects using an adaptive control algorithm, the strategy could allow a wide range of packages to be delivered using a combination of several standard-sized vehicles. 
 beyond simplifying the drone fleet, the work could provide more robust drone operations and reduce the noise and safety concerns involved in operating large autonomous uavs in populated areas. in addition to commercial package delivery, the system might also be used by the military to resupply small groups of soldiers in the field. 
 ""a delivery truck could carry a dozen drones in the back, and depending on how heavy a particular package is, it might use as many as six drones to carry the package,"" said 
 jonathan rogers , the lockheed martin associate professor of avionics integration in georgia tech's 
 daniel guggenheim school of aerospace engineering . ""that would allow flexibility in the weight of the packages that could be delivered and eliminate the need to build and maintain several different sizes of delivery drones."" 
 the research was supported, in part, by a national science foundation graduate student fellowship and by the hives independent research and development program of the georgia tech research institute. a paper on the research has been submitted to the 
 journal of aircraft . 
 a centralized computer system developed by graduate student kevin webb would monitor each of the drones lifting a package, sharing information about their location and the thrust being provided by their motors. the control system would coordinate the issuance of commands for navigation and delivery of the package. 
 ""the idea is to make multi-uav cooperative flight easy from the user perspective,"" rogers said. ""we take care of the difficult issues using the onboard intelligence, rather than expecting a human to precisely measure the package weight, center of gravity, and drone relative positions. we want to make this easy enough so that a package delivery driver could operate the system consistently."" 
 the challenges of controlling a group of robots connected together to lift a package is more complex in many ways than controlling a swarm of robots that fly independently. 
 ""most swarm work involves vehicles that are not connected, but flying in formations,"" rogers said. ""in that case, the individual dynamics of a specific vehicle are not constrained by what the other vehicles are doing. for us, the challenge is that the vehicles are being pulled in different directions by what the other vehicles connected to the package are doing."" 
 the team of drones would autonomously connect to a docking structure attached to a package, using an infrared guidance system that eliminates the need for humans to attach the vehicles. that could come in handy for drones sent to retrieve packages that a customer is returning. by knowing how much thrust they are producing and the altitude they are maintaining, the drone teams could even estimate the weight of the package they're picking up. 
 webb and rogers have built a demonstration in which four small quadrotor drones work together to lift a box that's 2 feet by 2 feet by 2 feet and weighs 12 pounds. the control algorithm isn't limited to four vehicles and could manage ""as many vehicles as you could put around the package,"" rogers said. 
 for the military, the modular cargo system could allow squads of soldiers at remote locations to be resupplied without the cost or risk of operating a large autonomous helicopter. a military uav package retrieval team could be made up of individual vehicles carried by each soldier. 
 ""that would distribute a big lifting capability in smaller packages, which equates to small drones that could be used to team up,"" rogers said. ""putting small drones together would allow them to do bigger things than they could do individually."" 
 bringing multiple vehicles together creates a more difficult control challenge, but rogers argues the benefits are worth the complexity. ""the idea of having multiple machines working together provides better scalability than building a larger device every time you have a larger task,"" he said. ""we think this is the right way to fill that gap."" 
 using multiple drones to carry a heavy package could also allow more redundancy in the delivery system. should one of the drones fail, the others should be able to pick up the load - an issue managed by the central control system. that part of the control strategy hasn't yet been tested, but it is part of rogers' plan for future development of the system. 
 more research is also needed on the docking system that connects the drones to packages. the structures will have to be made strong and rigid enough to connect to and lift the packages, while being inexpensive enough to be disposable. 
 ""i think the major technologies are already here, and given an adequate investment, a system could be fielded within five years to deliver packages with multiple drones,"" rogers said. ""it's not a technical challenge as much as it is a regulatory issue and a question of societal acceptance.""

control-system-simulator-helps-operators-learn-fight-hackers.txt,"control system simulator helps operators learn to fight hackers 
 a control system simulator for a chemical processing plant could help train operators on security measures. 
 screen capture shows a chemical processing plant in which critical parameters are rising due to false process data and control commands injected by an attacker. 
 aug 23, 2018 
 - atlanta, ga 
 a simulator that comes complete with a virtual explosion could help the operators of chemical processing plants - and other industrial facilities - learn to detect attacks by hackers bent on causing mayhem. the simulator will also help students and researchers understand better the security issues of industrial control systems. 
 facilities such as electric power networks, manufacturing operations and water purification plants are among the potential targets for malicious actors because they use programmable logic controllers (plcs) to open and close valves, redirect electricity flows and manage large pieces of machinery. efforts are underway to secure these facilities, and helping operators become more skilled at detecting potential attacks is a key part of improving security. 
 ""the goal is to give operators, researchers and students experience with attacking systems, detecting attacks and also seeing the consequences of manipulating the physical processes in these systems,"" said 
 raheem beyah , the motorola foundation professor in the 
 school of electrical and computer engineering 
 at the georgia institute of technology. ""this system allows operators to learn what kinds of things will happen. our goal is to make sure the good guys get this experience so they can respond appropriately."" 
 details of the simulator were presented august 8 at black hat usa 2018, and august 13 at the 2018 usenix workshop on advances in security education. the simulator was developed in part by atlanta security startup company fortiphyd logic, and supported by the georgia research alliance. 
 the simulated chemical processing plant, known as the graphical realism framework for industrial control simulations (grfics), allows users to play the roles of both attackers and defenders - with separate views provided. the attackers might take control of valves in the plant to build up pressure in a reaction vessel to cause an explosion. the defenders have to watch for signs of attack and make sure security systems remain operational. 
 of great concern is the ""man-in-the-middle"" attack in which a bad actor breaks into the facility's control system - and also takes control of the sensors and instruments that provide feedback to the operators. by gaining control of sensors and valve position indicators, the attacker could send false readings that would reassure the operators - while the damage proceeded. 
 ""the pressure and reactant levels could be made to seem normal to the operators, while the pressure is building toward a dangerous point,"" beyah said. though the readings may appear normal, however, a knowledgeable operator might still detect clues that the system has been attacked. ""the more the operators know the process, the harder it will be to fool them,"" he said. 
 the grfics system was built using an existing chemical processing plant simulator, as well as a 3d video gaming engine running on linux virtual machines. at its heart is the software that runs plcs, which can be changed out to represent different types of controllers appropriate to a range of facilities. the human-machine interface can also be altered as needed to show a realistic operator control panel monitoring reaction parameters and valve controller positions. 
 ""this is a complete virtual network, so you can set up your own entry detection rules and play on the defensive side to see whether or not your defenses are detecting the attacks,"" said david formby, a georgia tech postdoctoral researcher who has launched fortiphyd logic with beyah to develop industrial control security products. ""we provide access to simulated physical systems that allow students and operators to repeatedly study different parameters and scenarios."" 
 grfics is currently available as an open source, free download for use by classes or individuals. it runs on a laptop, but because of heavy use of graphics, requires considerable processing power and memory. an online version is planned, and future versions will simulate the electric power grid, water and wastewater treatment facilities, manufacturing facilities and other users of plcs. 
 formby hopes grfics will expand the number of people who have experience with the security of industrial control systems. 
 ""we want to open this space up to more people,"" he said. ""it's very difficult now to find people who have the right experience. we haven't seen many attacks on these systems yet, but that's not because they are secure. the barrier for people who want to work in the cyber-physical security space is high right now, and we want to lower that."" 
 beyah and formby have been working for several years to increase awareness of the vulnerabilities inherent in industrial control systems. while the community still has more to do, beyah is encouraged. 
 ""several years ago, we talked to a lot of process control engineers as part of the nsf's i-corps program,"" he said. ""it was clear that for many of these folks then, security was not a major concern. but we've seen changes, and lots of people are now taking system security seriously.""

 system allows human to control robots with finger and beams of light. 
 a person taps the tablet to control where the beam of light appears on a floor. the swarm robots then roll toward the illumination, constantly communicating with each other and deciding how to evenly cover the lit area.

 - atlanta, ga 
 using a smart tablet and a red beam of light, georgia institute of technology researchers have created a system that allows people to control a fleet of robots with the swipe of a finger. a person taps the tablet to control where the beam of light appears on a floor. the swarm robots then roll toward the illumination, constantly communicating with each other and deciding how to evenly cover the lit area. when the person swipes the tablet to drag the light across the floor, the robots follow. if the operator puts two fingers in different locations on the tablet, the machines will split into teams and repeat the process. the new georgia tech algorithm that fuels this system demonstrates the potential of easily controlling large teams of robots, which is relevant in manufacturing, agriculture and disaster areas. ""it's not possible for a person to control a thousand or a million robots by individually programming each one where to go,"" said magnus egerstedt, schlumberger professor in georgia tech's school of electrical and computer engineering. ""instead, the operator controls an area that needs to be explored. then the robots work together to determine the best ways to accomplish the job."" egerstedt envisions a scenario in which an operator sends a large fleet of machines into a specific area of a tsunami-ravaged region. the robots could search for survivors, dividing themselves into equal sections. if some machines were suddenly needed in a new area, a single person could quickly redeploy them.  the georgia tech model is different from many other robotic coverage algorithms because it's not static. it's flexible enough to allow robots to ""change their minds"" effectively, rather than just performing the single job they're programmed to do. ""the field of swarm robotics gets difficult when you expect teams of robots to be as dynamic and adaptive as humans,"" egerstedt explained. ""people can quickly adapt to changing circumstances, make new decisions and act. robots typically can't. it's hard for them to talk and form plans when everything is changing around them."" in the georgia tech demonstration, each robot is constantly measuring how much light is in its local ""neighborhood."" it's also chatting with its neighbor. when there's too much light in its area, the robot moves away so that another can steal some of its light. ""the robots are working together to make sure that each one has the same amount of light in its own area,"" said egerstedt. the tablet-based control system has one final benefit: it was designed with everyone in mind. anyone can control the robots, even if they don't have a background in robotics. ""in the future, farmers could send machines into their fields to inspect the crops,"" said georgia tech ph.d. candidate yancy diaz-mercado. ""workers on manufacturing floors could direct robots to one side of the warehouse to collect items, then quickly direct them to another area if the need changes."" a paper about the control system, ""multi-robot control using time-varying density functions,"" was

coskun-gets-50000-pilot-grant-spore-study-cell-signaling-lung-cancer.txt,"coskun gets $50,000 pilot grant from spore to study cell signaling in lung cancer 
 petit institute researcher collaborating with emory clinicians to enable personalized precision medicine 
 cell signaling in action.   - photo provided by ahmet coskun 
 aug 25, 2021 
 - atlanta, ga 
 ahmet coskun is trying to solve a molecular mystery: he wants to know why some patients don't respond to a lung cancer drug that has shown otherwise promising results. he hopes understanding why will help his team develop tools that will enable personalized precision therapies in the future. 
 ""most patients are responding to this drug very well, but it fails in some patients, and why it fails is a mystery,"" said coskun, an assistant professor in the wallace h. coulter department of biomedical engineering at georgia tech and emory university and a researcher in the petit institute for bioengineering and bioscience at georgia tech. 
 coskun aims to take a detailed look at cellular communication and decision-making, to closely visualize cell signaling and develop a new metric to define how cells respond to drugs for lung cancer therapy. to help him get started, the emory lung cancer spore group is awarding him $50,000 over the next year. 
 ""our research will result in a molecular screening platform for imaging signaling proteins of human cell cultures and tissues,"" said coskun, who plans to decipher the role of cellular signals and explain how different cells coordinate signaling to achieve healthy or abnormal results, specifically in patients with non-small cell lung cancer. 
 this year, about 200,000 adults in the united states will be diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer, the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the world. about 15 percent of those people have an epidermal growth factor receptor mutation in their cancer. 
 epidermal growth factor receptor, or egfr, is a protein involved in cell signaling. when it works correctly, it helps control cell division. but when it becomes mutated, as it does in some lung cancer cells, it causes rapid cell growth, helping the cancer spread. 
 for lung cancer patients with the egfr mutation, there is a measure of hope thanks to a drug developed by emory university several years ago. in a 2017 clinical study led by emory researcher suresh ramalingam, patients experienced substantial improvement when treated with an egfr inhibitor called osimertinib, compared to those who received the standard of care. 
 the drug is designed to inhibit egfr's haywire signaling activity in cancer. as coskun noted, though, it doesn't work well for every patient. it's because no two patient tumors are exactly alike - each tumor microenvironment is unique. there are multiple biomarkers and multiple potential targets for cancer drugs to attack. so, inhibiting one protein like egfr won't always make a difference, coskun said. 
 ""the standard clinical techniques are limited to focusing on a single marker,"" said coskun, who is using multiplex cellular imaging, a technology that allows detection of multiple markers. ""recent advances in these systems allow visualization of a larger number of markers - up to 30 unique targets. we intend to develop automated, multiplexed platforms to detect numerous markers and to feed the information into an algorithm to diagnose patients and predict their response to therapies."" 
 clearly identifying other markers could pave the way for combination therapies with other inhibitor drugs to block other cancer signaling pathways - together, they're a more comprehensive approach to attacking the disease. the ability to look at 30 different proteins or markers - potential drug targets - at one time, in a single cell, wasn't possible before because the technology didn't exist. 
 ""the emerging technology that we have developed here at georgia tech and emory allow rapid and high-content signaling network studies in cells and tissues,"" coskun said. 
 essentially, researchers combine technologies to create a complete molecular profile of a patient's cancer at the single cell level. coskun's team uses microfluidic instruments to acquire microscopic images and then super computers are used to process and visualize complex cellular maps. 
 ""these maps will enable personalized precision therapies,"" coskun said. ""that is our goal."" 
 coskun and his team will work under the mentorship of ramalingam, executive director of the winship cancer institute at emory and co-lead of the lung cancer spore, a specialized program of research excellence created in 2019 with a $9.7 million national cancer institute grant. it's one of four spore grants in the u.s. focused on lung cancer.

coskun-receives-186-million-nih-mira-award-map-spatial-molecular-neighborhoods.txt,"coskun receives $1.86 million nih mira award to map spatial molecular neighborhoods 
 georgia tech researcher plans to probe subcellular and cellular organization, counting molecular neighborhoods and building to better understand the spatial organization of cells. 
 ahmet coşkun 
 nov 08, 2023 
 ahmet coskun has a saying on the homepage of his  lab's website : ""seeing is believing. quantifying is proving."" so, with that in mind, coskun and his team have developed multiplex imaging tools and combined them with machine learning techniques - for believing and quantifying. 
 now, to support coskun's research, the national institutes of health has granted him the prestigious  maximizing investigator's research award  (mira) from the national institute of general medical sciences. coskun and his team will use the five-year, $1.86 million award for a project entitled,  ""dissecting subcellular and cellular organization by spatial molecular neighborhood networks."" 
 they plan to probe subcellular and cellular organization, counting molecular neighborhoods and building maps to help researchers better understand the spatial organization of cells and molecules, insights that can open the door to game-changing personalized treatments for multiple diseases. 
 ""the spatial organization of these neighborhoods, of rna and protein molecules, is important for cellular function,"" said coskun, a bernie marcus early career professor in the coulter department of biomedical engineering at georgia tech and emory university. ""so, we're basically making maps of molecules within the cell."" 
 the maps can ultimately help researchers identify cell types that would best treat various diseases, while also explaining why some patients will respond to a particular treatment, and others won't. 
 the nih's mira program provides researchers with greater stability and flexibility in funding while enhancing their ability to creatively tackle ambitious scientific problems. and part of the aim, said coskun, ""is to address basic biology questions that have implications on multiple diseases in the future. this single cell work has that kind of potential."" 
 for coskun, the mira is the next phase of support in a flurry of awards that have come his way recently: it's the fifth nih grant his lab has received this year, with a total value of $3.6 million. 
 ""this year has been a great year for us,"" said coskun. ""it's encouraging to receive this kind of recognition and support for research and technology that we believe will play an important role in the lives of patients.""

cozier-better-bubbles-inside-powerful-volcanoes.txt,"the cozier the better for bubbles inside powerful volcanoes 
 study focues on how bubbles move through and accumulate in volcanoes before powerful eruptions. 
 apr 13, 2016 
 - atlanta, ga 
 how did the eruptions of katmai, taupo and santorini grow into a massive blast that spewed fine ash, sulfur and crystal-poor magma into the atmosphere? new research from georgia institute of technology and eidgenössische technische hochschule zurich (eth) suggests they occurred due in part to how light vapor bubbles migrate and accumulate in some parts of shallow volcanic chambers. 
 the findings are published online by nature . volcanic chambers are a maze of crystal-rich and crystal-poor regions, especially in the last place where magma stalls and builds before eruption. the georgia tech-eth team used lab experiments and computer models to focus on how bubbles move to and through these shallow reservoirs, which are typically about three to five miles below the surface. ""we know that bubbles control the style and power of eruptions, but we don't fully understand how they behave,"" said georgia tech assistant professor christian huber, a faculty member in the school of earth and atmospheric sciences. ""it's probably like opening a soda and watching the bubbles race to the top of the bottle."" according to their study, huber and his colleagues believe these bubbles maneuver their way through crystal filled magma until they settle in these open-spaced reservoirs ­- areas without many crystals ­- and build up the necessary energy for an impending eruption. ""when we started this project, we thought that the bubbles, as they moved through compact, crystal-rich areas, would be significantly slowed down on their way to the reservoirs,"" said huber. ""instead, these seem to be the best conditions for their ascent through the chamber."" the team's experiments indicate that bubbles squeeze through the narrow openings to create finger-like paths. these long paths allow the bubbles to merge and form connected pathways that transport low density vapor efficiently through the crystal-rich parts of magma chambers. ""once they reach the end of this crystal-rich area and get more space, the water vapor fingers transform back into their usual, spherical bubble shape,"" said andrea parmigiani, who led the study during his postdoctoral work in huber's group at georgia tech and in olivier bachmann's group at eth. ""once vapor forms these bubbles, the ascent of the light vapor bubbles is slow and bubbles accumulate."" the team says the bubbles, once free to move around in their natural, spherical shape, settle into crystal-poor areas of the reservoir. that's where their accumulation provides additional potential energy that can drive large volcanic eruptions that release large amounts of sulfur to the atmosphere and result in voluminous crystal-poor deposits. the georgia tech team also included salah faroughi and yanqing su, who are both co-authors on the paper and ph.d. candidates in huber's group. faroughi's lab experiments demonstrated the accumulation of bubbles in the crystal-poor areas. su's calculations measured sulfur releases. the paper, ""bubble accumulation and its role in the evolution of magma reservoirs in the upper crust,"" was published online on april 13, 2016.

create-x-will-build-students-entrepreneurial-confidence.txt,"create-x will build students' entrepreneurial confidence 
 create-x is a collective of programs designed to boost students' entrepreneurial confidence and give them the tools they need to establish startups. 
 apr 01, 2015 
 - atlanta, ga 
 georgia tech offers students plenty of chances to design their own inventions and build their own startups. but a unifying thread was missing -- something to link the entrepreneurial lessons in these experiences. now, a major gift from alumnus chris klaus is giving tech a new way to do just that. on april 1, the institute and the college of engineering will formally launch create-x, a collective of programs designed to boost students' entrepreneurial confidence and give them the tools they need to establish startups. many of the programs under the create-x umbrella, such as the startup lab course, have already begun to be offered. but create-x will unite them with a common goal: equipping undergraduate students with the knowledge, skills, abilities, and experiences to be entrepreneurially confident. ""these programs have always been part of a larger vision,"" says professor raghupathy sivakumar, the wayne j. holman chair in electrical engineering. he is the director of create-x and one of the architects behind it. professor emeritus ray vito, a longtime champion of georgia tech's student innovation ecosystem, is another architect behind the effort and serves as a special advisor for create-x. open to all undergraduates across campus, create-x is based on three simple principles: learn, make, launch. the idea is that students who participate in create-x will choose from an assortment of programs that correspond with each of these principles. the signature offerings of create-x that correspond to each of the three principles will be, respectively, the startup lab course, the idea to prototype undergraduate research experience, and the startup summer program. eventually, students will advance through all three concepts, and they'll graduate georgia tech equipped with the entrepreneurial skills to succeed in both startup settings and larger, well-established companies. one of create-x's defining features is startup summer, part of the program's launch portion. this summer, 20 teams are expected to participate. klaus, the namesake of the institute's klaus advanced computing building, has discussed his own experiences in entrepreneurship with students in the startup lab course. he is the founder of kaneva, a social gaming company, and he sees startup summer as a transformational opportunity for georgia tech students. by keeping students in school while they build their businesses, klaus says, create-x will occupy a unique position among startup accelerators. and, of course, students will get the business acumen and real-world experience they need to succeed with their companies. ""create-x will be a revolutionary program for georgia tech, and i'm thrilled to help the institute's efforts in getting students excited about innovation and entrepreneurship,"" he says. other elements that will distinguish create-x from similar programs at peer institutions will be its singular focus on undergraduate students, emphasis on the learn, make, launch pathway that will cater to students throughout their undergraduate careers, and a strong reliance on the cross-disciplinary maker mindset that defines georgia tech. another part of what makes the program unique, though, is that participation requirements are somewhat flexible: no one will have to complete a strict regimen of courses to be involved. that's because organizers want to make it easy as possible for students to dive in to create-x. all majors are invited to participate, but the program itself will be housed in the college of engineering. ""we've built a reputation for innovation, and i'm excited to see how create-x builds on that by focusing on entrepreneurial skills,"" says gary may, the college of engineering dean. may is a member of the program's executive team. that team also includes professor ravi bellamkonda, the wallace h. coulter department of biomedical engineering chair; professor steve mclaughlin, the steve chaddick school chair of the school of electrical and computer engineering; and professor bill wepfer, the eugene c. gwaltney, jr. school chair of the george w. woodruff school of mechanical engineering. ""the ‘x' in create-x is based on the notion that our students can create anything they want through their ideas - be it their own jobs, exciting startups, a new world, or their very future,"" says bellamkonda. eventually, organizers foresee the program reaching thousands of students across georgia tech. other campus programs that create-x will coordinate with in achieving its vision include venturelab, the inventure prize competition, startup exchange, and georgia tech's co-op program. ""many of these opportunities focus on interdisciplinary work, a hallmark of georgia tech's curriculum,"" says mclaughlin. with klaus' gift to create-x, more students will be able to polish their skills and prepare for the business world - whether they want to join a large company or make a startup from scratch. ""we are finally,"" says sivakumar, ""going to provide a platform for entrepreneurial students.""  -- written by lyndsey lewis

 what if you could strum a guitar, tap a piano, bow a violin and loop a beat all on just one instrument? if you're in the mood for a hypnotic surround sound, try playing the yaybahar with its fretted strings, coiled springs and drum skins. maybe you're searching for a different type of harp. how about one made from a two-dimensional grid of laser beams. what about a 25-string harp that uses electromagnetic actuation modules to produce completely acoustic music. these are just a few of the 22 inventions in the annual margaret guthman musical instrument competition. the competition, hosted by the georgia institute of technology, showcases the best new ideas in design, engineering and musicianship. contestants compete for $10,000 in prizes. ""our semifinalists are all inventors, musicians, designers and engineers who bring their interdisciplinary skills and talents to create the next generation of musical instruments,"" said gil weinberg, director of the georgia tech center for music technology. the center - along with the school of music, the college of architecture and the office of the arts - sponsors the competition. inventors use technology and scientific discovery to create nontraditional sounds and musical interactions that enhance the way society plays and thinks about musical instruments.  some of the instruments resemble sleek, modern sculptures that belong in museums. others look like they were assembled in the land of misfit toys. judging the semifinalists are: allan kozinn, a music critic and teacher; pat metheny, a grammy award-winning jazz guitarist and composer; and marcelo wanderly, professor of music technology at mcgill university in montreal. prior to the competition, the school of music will host the first moog hackathon, a 48-hour competition that runs from february 26-28. contestants will design and build musical instruments using moog platforms and other software and hardware prototyping tools provided by georgia tech. participants will compete for $5,000 in prizes and the top winner advances as a semifinalist in the guthman competition. the guthman competition will be held march 2 and 3 at georgia tech's ferst center for the arts.  the finals, which will be held at 7:00 pm on march 3, are free and open to the public. john biggs, an editor with techcrunch, will host the finale. more information about the contest can be found at http: / / guthman.gatech.edu.

 jeffrey mcmichael worried about his mother-in-law. she recently had a double replacement knee surgery and depended on a cane chair to get around. 
 her walking cane came with an attached folding seat, but mcmichael questioned its sturdiness. the seat was small and uncomfortable. the legs wobbled. 
 mcmichael, a student in the george w. woodruff school of mechanical engineering, thought he could design something better. enter the capable cane, a walking cane that unfolds into a portable, stable chair. 
 his invention is one of six competing for georgia tech's 2017 
 inventure prize .  the annual contest encourages and supports interest in innovation and entrepreneurship by rewarding students with cash prizes for inventions that have the potential to solve the world's problems. the finale takes place wednesday night at the ferst center for the arts. 
 ""the idea for the capable cane came to me about a year and a half ago, but it was the inventure prize that gave me some motivation to get it done,"" said mcmichael, who is from atlanta. 
 he set out to create a walking cane that included a full-sized, four-legged chair. he wanted the chair to include a seatback and armrests, knowing his mother-in-law didn't have much leg strength to get up and sit down. 
 his big challenge was how to design the seat so it could collapse into the cane. he struggled for months until a solution hit him in class. 
 ""someone in class had a large umbrella wrapped up and it inspired me,"" he said. ""i thought ‘why not wrap it?' after all, everyone knows how to use an umbrella."" 
 he made the seat and back from rip stop nylon that could wrap around the base of the cane when not in use. he worked on the device in the invention studio, using machines to cut and fasten the aluminum alloy parts, which makes the cane light and study. 
 about 6.5 million people in the united state use an assistive device, including canes. 
 mcmichael took the prototype to two senior citizen homes to gauge their interest. residents suggested he add a height adjustment to make the cane and chair taller and shorter, a design modification he plans to add eventually. the senior citizens also requested the ability to customize the seat fabric to match their personal style. 
 as for his mother-in-law, she's a fan. 
 ""she's given me feedback every step along the way,"" he said. ""she's ready to try it out.""

 scientists at the georgia institute of technology and max planck institute for intelligent systems in stuttgart have published a perspectives piece on the different tools used throughout the world aiding in the conservation of wildlife and biodiversity. 
 sep 06, 2023 
 the sixth mass extinction is currently happening on earth. rapid biodiversity loss is affecting every corner of the globe, as species of plants, mammals, fish, and reptiles disappear due to the changing climate. while much of the climate crisis and biodiversity loss looks grim, a group of researchers has recently highlighted some of the newest tools being used to address it. 
 scientists at the georgia institute of technology and max planck institute for intelligent systems in stuttgart have published a perspectives piece on the different tools used throughout the world that are aiding in the conservation of wildlife and biodiversity. 
 they highlight advances in technology, including both hardware and software, as well as frugal resources that are changing the way animals are protected. the research was published in the 
 journal of the royal society interface 
 in august. 
 ""we are experiencing technological advancements of low-cost hardware, open-source software, machine learning, and more that can help with global conservation efforts,"" said andrew schulz, postdoctoral researcher in the haptic intelligence department at max planck institute and recent ph.d. graduate from the 
 george w. woodruff school of mechanical engineering . "" for 
 researchers and people interested in learning about the ways conservation technology and tools are created, this piece serves as a starter guide to the field."" 
 in the article, the researchers presented five case studies of conservation tools, including open-source innovation, environmental dna, computer vision, game theory and optimization, and frugal technology. researchers also highlighted the importance of indigenous design in these conservation tool interventions and warned not to employ toxic practices, such as colonization of conservation or parasitic conservation. these practices take advantage of native lands, where conservationists refuse to work with local or indigenous populations and often do not cite or credit their help or expertise. 
 one 
 case study looked at 
 audiomoth , a device that allows low-cost access to bioacoustics research. recently, an audiomoth was paired with an animal observation tower to track bird migrations over georgia tech's campus. audiomoth can also monitor aquatic environments, like coral colonies, to assist with species identification and habitat restoration. it's used in a wide range of fields to monitor the biodiversity of a habitat or even help with the 
 early detection of poachers to prevent wildlife decline. 
 ""one of the best parts about this project was working with so many excellent researchers,"" schulz said. they included suzanne stathatos from caltech and the project's co-leaders, cassie shriver and benjamin seleb, from georgia tech's 
 quantitative biosciences ph.d. program . ""as early-career researchers working together, it is great to see that the conversations about conservation tool construction are growing and being led by outstanding ph.d. students."" 
 at georgia tech, conservation tools are constantly being built and implemented. the tech4wildlife student organization is working to implement conservation tech solutions, including a 
 rabies dispenser for our campus foxes, bird monitors in the ecocommons, 
 and 
 forage feeders for zoo atlanta's gorillas . 
 ""i'm proud to see cassie, ben, and andrew collaborating across fields and institutions to move conservation technology forward, and it inspires me about the future of conservation science,"" said william ratcliff, associate professor in the 
 school of biological sciences 
 and director of the quantitative biosciences program.

creative-destruction-williams-lab-probes-evolution-proteins.txt,"creative destruction: williams lab probes the evolution of proteins 
 georgia tech researchers apply an economics theory to study the building blocks of biological evolution 
 mar 06, 2023 
 proteins have been around a lot longer than we have - as building blocks of biological evolution, our existence depends on them. and now, researchers at the georgia institute of technology are applying a 20 th -century theoretical concept to study how proteins evolve, and it might lead to the answer of one of humanity's oldest questions: how did we become us? 
 inside a typical human cell are tens of thousands of proteins. we need so many because proteins are the skilled laborers of the cell with each one performing a specific job. some lend firmness to muscle cells or neurons. others bind to specific, targeted molecules, ferrying them to new locations. and there are others that activate the process of cell division and growth. 
 a protein's specific function depends on its shape, and to achieve its functional shape - it's native state - a protein folds.  a protein begins its life as a long chain of amino acids, called a polypeptide. the sequence of amino acids determines how the protein chain will fold and form a complex, 3d structure that allow the protein to perform an intended task. 
 in the 
 lab of loren williams , researchers are using ""creative destruction"" as a model for protein fold evolution and innovation. the term, coined by austrian economist and political scientist joseph schumpeter in the 1940s, describes the deliberate dismantling of an established thing, like the wired telephone, to develop a new thing, like the smart phone. 
 ""we have protein structures that have evolved over almost four billion years, and we don't really understand where they came from or how they came to be what they are,"" said claudia alvarez-carreño, a postdoctoral researcher in the williams lab, which is called the 
 center for the origin of life, or cool. 
 ""it's a very complex process forming these structures, and there are many hypotheses on how they could have emerged in early evolution."" 
 out with the old, in with the new 
 alvarez-carreño is the lead author of the paper, 
 ""creative destruction: new protein folds from old,"" 
 published recently in the journal 
 proceedings of the national academy of sciences , or 
 pnas . she and her co-authors (williams, rohan gupta, and anton petrov) excavated the deepest evolutionary history found within the translation machinery - which resides within all cells in the ribosome and is the birthplace of all proteins. 
 the researchers provide evidence supporting the common origins of some of the simplest, oldest, and most common protein folds. it suggests a form of creative destruction at work, explaining how simple protein folds spawn more complex folds. 
 they discovered that once a protein can fold and achieve its 3d structure, when it is combined with another protein which has folded into a different 3d structure, that combination can easily become a new structure. ""so maybe it's not as difficult as we thought to go from one structure to another,"" said williams, professor in the 
 school of chemistry and biochemistry . ""and maybe this can explain the diversity of protein structures that we see today."" 
 in schumpter's creative destruction model, developing ""daughter products"" involves the destruction of ancestral products. ""daughter products can inherit features of ancestors but can in essence be different from them,"" they write in the paper. in the smart phone example ancestral wired phones, computers, cameras, global positioning, and other technologies that are merged to create a daughter, i.e. the smart phone. 
 the daughter inherits many features of the ancestors. these features, which interact in specific ways in the daughter, create new functional niches that were not accessible, or even possible, in the ancestors. 
 ""so, the creative destruction of protein folds might account for a lot of the diversity we see,"" williams said. 
 molecular mergers 
 ever since the simplest and most ancient protein folds emerged on earth billions of years ago, the number of folds has expanded to form the universe of protein function we see in modern biology. 
 but the origins of protein folds and the evolutionary mechanisms at play pose central questions in biology that williams and his team considered. for instance, how did protein folds arise, and what led to the diverse set of protein folds in contemporary biological systems, and why did nearly four billion years of fold evolution produce fewer than 2,000 distinct folds? 
 the researchers believe that creative destruction can be generalized to explain a lot of this. 
 in creative destruction, they explain, one open reading frame - the span of dna sequence that encodes a protein  - merges with another to produce a fused polypeptide. the merger forces these two ancestors into a new structure. the resulting polypeptide can achieve a form that was inaccessible to either of the independent ancestors, before the merger. but these new folds are not totally independent of the old. that is, a daughter fold inherits some things from the ancestral fold. 
 this, broadly speaking, is what williams and his team observed, and they think their creative destruction model has some application in studying disease - proteins that fold improperly can impact the health of the cells and the human comprised of those cells. 
 ""for example, we think this process is important in the biology of cancer - there are many, many proteins that have fused and, we believe have refolded, in cancers,"" said williams. ""and there's the world of protein aggregation diseases, like parkinson's or alzheimers, and proteins that have not folded correctly, or have refolded."" 
 but right now, williams and his team are most interested in how their creative destruction model helps them understand some of the deepest questions of our evolution. 
 ""like, where did we come from,"" williams said. ""creative destruction could help us understand where the proteins in our body came and how we came to be what we are.""

 - atlanta, ga 
 with more than 10 million service points, india's rural drinking water system provides a real monitoring headache for public health officials. to help address the challenge, a three-continent research consortium is evaluating a novel environmental crowdsourcing technique that relies on 53-cent test kits and the nation's ubiquitous mobile phone service. studied in eight villages this summer and scheduled for more widespread evaluation in 2015, the technique could empower residents to check their own water quality and address the problems they find. if successful, this environmental crowdsourcing could be expanded to other nations and other large-scale environmental monitoring needs. ""it would be impossible to pay somebody to go out and take all these samples, bring them back to a central lab and process them under controlled conditions,"" said joe brown, an assistant professor in georgia tech's school of civil and environmental engineering who is leading the project. ""but we think there are a lot of promising methods for testing water safety that don't involve expensive laboratories and highly-trained personnel."" the research is being sponsored by the u.s. institute of international education. partner agencies include the national environmental engineering research institute (neeri) in india, and the london school of hygiene and tropical medicine in the united kingdom. in wealthy nations, water supplies are routinely tested by utilities under locally applicable regulatory guidelines that specify strict laboratory procedures. but with its distributed system of village water points and limited number of testing labs, that's not practical for india. yet routine water testing is critical to ensuring safe water supplies for india's 1.2 billion people. the technique works like this: volunteers are given the test kits, which include a test tube containing a material that changes color in the presence of e. coli, a bacterium often present in contaminated water. in their homes, the volunteers fill the tubes with water, either from a tap or from a home water storage container. they allow the water to incubate in the test tube overnight, then use a mobile phone to text a series of numbers indicating whether the test material remained yellow - indicating safe water - or turned purple to indicate contamination. a programmed smartphone receives and analyzes the texts, automatically calculating overall water quality by village. the program accounts for errors in reporting by looking for trends in the overall results. ""the key to this is aggregating many, many samples that each indicate the presence or absence of bacteria,"" brown explained. ""individually, the tests don't tell us much, but if you take a thousand of them, you can compute an estimate of what the microbial counts will be in a typical drinking water source."" in an evaluation done this summer in eight villages near the city of nagpur, the research team - three undergraduate students and two graduate students, in addition to brown - received results from a quarter of the 1,800 people who were given the kits. and when they returned to the villages for follow-up meetings, 60 percent of the kits they distributed were returned for study. but the testing required some changes of direction. in the first village to receive the kits, the researchers passed out instruction sheets with detailed explanations and flow charts showing the required steps. but even they got confused about the sequence of numbers to be reported. ""it became painfully clear that this was not going to work,"" said brown. ""over the course of the time we were there, the instructions got simpler and simpler and we wound up putting information on the side of the kit. we got better responses the simpler it got."" follow up visits allowed the researchers to share the results with village residents, who offered interpretations of the results and suggested solutions. in one village, for instance, positive test results led to a cracked pipe that was allowing contamination of the water supply. the researchers found that in most cases, the quality of water coming from the tap was better than the quality of water that had been stored in homes. likely reasons included a failure to cover the home containers and the use of contaminated cups or bowls to dip water from the containers. ""the two weeks we spent in india gave us a better understanding of the conditions under which these kits will be used, and an appreciation for how important it is to have clean water,"" said andy loo, one of the students who was part of the project team. the test kits distributed in the eight villages were assembled by students based on materials commercially available in india. the kit was designed in brown's lab. ""we think this may be a scalable model for large-scale environmental monitoring for settings in addition to india,"" brown said. ""the tests themselves worked well and there was a clear color change to indicate the presence of the bacteria."" the team expects to return to india in 2015 for larger-scale evaluation of the technique. the goal will be to compare the results produced by crowdsourcing against conventional sampling done by scientists at neeri. based on what they learned this year, the researchers plan to evaluate the use of other village groups, including schoolchildren and women's self-help groups, to conduct the water testing. beyond improving water quality, brown believes the testing program will empower rural citizens of india to take responsibility for their drinking water. ""this could be a disruptive technology because it's giving people the power to evaluate the safety of their own drinking water,"" he said. ""the test turning purple provides a dramatic way to communicate water quality issues, and opens up conversations that would never have occurred otherwise."" research news georgia institute of technology 177 north avenue atlanta, georgia  30332-0181  usa media relations contacts : john toon ( jtoon@gatech.edu ) (404-894-6986) or brett israel ( brett.israel@comm.gatech.edu ) (404-385-1933). writer : john toon

 - atlanta, ga 
 ph.d. student chandana kolluru is a finalist in an international dance competition - a competition with a scientific twist. she's dancing her thesis. 
 in the 
 video submission , kolluru performs an indian classical dance to demonstrate her work to help create an 
 effective, safe microneedle patch for polio vaccination . 
 the ""dance your ph.d."" competition is hosted annually by science and the american association for the advancement of science (aaas). 
 ""i have always loved to dance,"" said kolluru, who learned kuchipudi dance as a child in southern india. ""now i'm learning it again with my daughter, who is also in the video. the competition is a perfect opportunity for me to combine two things that i am passionate about: my research and dance."" 
 polio is a highly contagious disease that can cause lifelong disability. it primarily affects children and is still endemic to three countries: pakistan, afghanistan and nigeria. 
 ""as part of the polio elimination strategy, my ph.d. thesis involves optimization of formulations to develop a polio vaccine microneedle patch that is safe and stable. we are creating something that doesn't need to be refrigerated, dissolves quickly upon administration and doesn't leave behind dangerous, sharp needles."" 
 the six-and-a-half-minute dance is based on a simple concept: no children should be dancing only in their dreams. it begins with two kids happily playing and dancing, only to be later attacked and paralyzed by polio. the remainder of the performance explains the research and concludes with vaccinated children fighting off the disease. 
 ""i dream of a polio-free world,"" kolluru said. 
 kolluru is in mark prausnitz's lab in the school of chemical and biomolecular engineering. the group garnered headlines around the world earlier this year after a 
 phase i clinical trial, conducted by emory university and georgia tech , tested a flu vaccination using band-aid-like microneedle patches. 
 the public can vote until 11:59 p.m. on monday, october 30 . a panel of scientists will judge the entries on their artistic and scientific merits. the overall winner will screen their dance at the annual aaas meeting in austin, texas, in february 2018.

daydreaming-good-it-means-youre-smart.txt,"daydreaming is good. it means you're smart 
 people with efficient brains may have too much brain capacity to stop their minds from wandering.

 - atlanta, ga 
 a new study from the georgia institute of technology suggests that daydreaming during meetings isn't necessarily a bad thing. it might be a sign that you're really smart and creative. 
 ""people with efficient brains may have too much brain capacity to stop their minds from wandering,"" said eric schumacher, the georgia tech associate psychology professor who co-authored the study. 
 schumacher and his students and colleagues, including lead co-author christine godwin, measured the brain patterns of more than 100 people while they lay in an mri machine. participants were instructed to focus on a stationary fixation point for five minutes. the georgia tech team used the data to identify which parts of the brain worked in unison. 
 ""the correlated brain regions gave us insight about which areas of the brain work together during an awake, resting state,"" said godwin, a georgia tech psychology ph.d. candidate. 
 ""interestingly, research has suggested that these same brain patterns measured during these states are related to different cognitive abilities."" 
 once they figured out how the brain works together at rest, the team compared the data with tests the participants that measured their intellectual and creative ability. participants also filled out a questionnaire about how much their mind wandered in daily life. 
 those who reported more frequent daydreaming scored higher on intellectual and creative ability and had more efficient brain systems measured in the mri machine. 
 ""people tend to think of mind wandering as something that is bad. you try to pay attention and you can't,"" said schumacher. ""our data are consistent with the idea that this isn't always true. some people have more efficient brains."" 
 schumacher says higher efficiency means more capacity to think, and the brain may mind wander when performing easy tasks. 
 how can you tell if your brain is efficient? one clue is that you can zone in and out of conversations or tasks when appropriate, then naturally tune back in without missing important points or steps. 
 ""our findings remind me of the absent-minded professor - someone who's brilliant, but off in his or her own world, sometimes oblivious to their own surroundings,"" said schumacher. ""or school children who are too intellectually advanced for their classes. while it may take five minutes for their friends to learn something new, they figure it out in a minute, then check out and start daydreaming."" 
 godwin and schumacher think the findings open the door for follow-up research to further understand when mind wandering is harmful, and when it may actually be helpful. 
 ""there are important individual differences to consider as well, such as a person's motivation or intent to stay focused on a particular task,"" said godwin. 
 the paper, "" functional connectivity within and between intrinsic brain networks correlates with trait mind wandering ,"" is published in the journal neuropsychologia.

delivering-antibodies-mrna-could-prevent-rsv-infection.txt,"delivering antibodies via mrna could prevent rsv infection 
 getting antibodies directly to the lungs protected mice from the virus. 
 3d super-resolution microscopy cross-sectional image showing how the engineered antibody apali works: apali (green) is expressed on the cell surface and stops rsv particles (pink) from entering the cell. 
 nov 05, 2018 
 - atlanta, ga 
 almost every child gets respiratory syncytial virus (rsv), which causes cold-like symptoms. it's usually not a big deal if they're healthy, but every year in the u.s. some 57,000 children under the age of five are hospitalized with the infection. to make matters worse, there's no vaccine and a medication sometimes used to prevent rsv in high-risk children isn't always effective. now researchers at the georgia institute of technology have developed a promising method of delivering antibodies directly to the lungs, improving their efficacy in warding off rsv. 
 it was a natural outgrowth of research in his lab, said 
 philip santangelo , associate professor in the 
 wallace h. coulter department of biomedical engineering 
 at georgia tech and emory university. that research focused on using rna to deliver therapeutic antibodies, as well as with the basic virology of rsv. combining the two was ""a logical choice,"" said santangelo. 
 one of the medications used to treat or prevent rsv, the monoclonal antibody palivizumab, is given monthly via intramuscular (im) injection. only a small amount of the antibody gets into the airways. ""rsv tends to infect airway epithelial cells, as does flu,"" said santangelo. ""we really didn't see palivizumab there in large quantities. so we thought that was an opportunity."" 
 in a 
 study published october 1 in nature communications , santangelo's team reported using synthetic messenger rna (mrna) to deliver antibodies directly to the lungs of mice via aerosol, which the study showed protected them from rsv infection.  two forms of palivizumab were used, the whole secreted form (spali) and one that was engineered with a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (gpi) membrane anchor or linker (apali), which should allow it to stay on the epithelial surface longer. 
 another group of mice were treated with a different antibody - a vhh camelid antibody, also in secreted and anchored forms - that was previously shown to be more potent than palivizumab but is not currently used to treat rsv. 
 ""with palivizumab, that may or may not be as critical - we noticed that even with the secreted version we were able to block the virus reasonably well,"" said santangelo. ""but single-chain antibodies, which are very small, have short half-lives. you have to give them frequently, which doesn't seem practical. when we put this linker on the smaller antibody, we were able to see it on the epithelial cells 28 days later. that was really exciting to us."" 
 in fact, santangelo suspects that using the linker could cause smaller antibodies to persist for a few months, reducing the need for frequent treatments. ""you could see administering this right after a child is born, when they are most vulnerable,"" he said. 
 using mrna is an effective and safe delivery option, especially crucial in a pediatric population. ""using a transient, nucleic acid-based method that doesn't end up in the cell nucleus is really important,"" said santangelo, whose study was funded by a defense advanced research projects agency (darpa) grant and children's healthcare of atlanta. ""we do want this to be transient, so if it lasted even a month that would protect newborns in the hospital where they may be exposed to rsv. and if you could protect kids for a few months at a time, that's really all you would need to do."" 
 the study found that most of the mrna-expressed antibodies did not change baseline levels of cytokines, indicating that the approach was minimally inflammatory and suggesting that repeat dosing could be considered. 
 it's also possible that the antibodies used in this study could potentially neutralize the virus in cells, so even if a child was infected the severity of symptoms might be lessened. and rsv isn't the only potential virus this method could target - santangelo is currently working on a project that targets flu via dry powder delivery of mrna. that project is supported by the bill & melinda gates foundation. 
 with the promising results from the rsv study, santangelo hopes to move from a mouse model to additional testing. ""there's more work to be done,"" he said. ""the use of antibodies for preventing infection is a huge deal right now. but even if you found this potent antibody, if you can't deliver it where it needs to go then the efficacy may not be where you want it to be. at least with the lung, we know where we want to go, and iv or im administration isn't really ideal for the cell types that are most critical for rsv."" 
 the study was co-authored by these researchers: pooja munnilal tiwari, daryll vanover, kevin e. lindsay, swapnil subhash bawage, jonathan l. kirschman, sushma bhosle, aaron w. lifland, chiara zurla and philip j. santangelo. the research was funded by darpa grant w911nf-15-0609. the views, opinions, and / or findings expressed are those of the authors and should not be interpreted as representing the official views or policies of the department of defense or the u.s. government.

 simulations of microgel suspensions show the surprising behavior of these materials when they are compressed.

 - atlanta, ga 
 microgel suspensions made up of microscopic liquid-filled polymer particles occupy a curious physical state somewhere between liquid and solid, giving them unique properties and potential uses in self-healing structures, optically active materials, microreactors, drug-delivery systems, and templates for regenerating living structures such as bone and muscle. 
 using large-scale computer simulations, researchers at the georgia institute of technology have now mapped out the surprising behavior and mechanics of these complex particle-solvent systems, learning how the ""soft and squishy"" particles deform, swell, de-swell, and penetrate each other as they respond to compression. the findings could help guide the design of microgel-based applications with unique and useful properties. 
 ""we wanted to understand broadly what happens to these particles if you put them together and start compressing them,"" said 
 alexander alexeev , professor and anderer faculty fellow in georgia tech's 
 george w. woodruff school of mechanical engineering . ""unlike rigid particles that fill the available space and then stop compressing, these particles have multiple processes that can work in parallel inside the suspension. microgels can change shape, shrink, and penetrate one another. we found that these processes play a varying role when you increase the particle number density and compress them enough."" 
 findings of the study were reported october 19 in the journal 
 proceedings of the national academy of sciences . the research was supported by the national science foundation (nsf) and the mciu / aei / feder eu, and simulations utilized the nsf's extreme science and engineering discovery environment. 
 using mesoscale computer simulations, the researchers studied the behavior of compressed suspensions consisting of shape-shifting microgels with different architectures at a variety of packing fractions and solvent conditions. they found that under compression, the ""fluffy"" microgels - which resemble microscopic sponges with polymer threads extending from them - change shape and shrink, with limited interpenetration among particles. 
 ""you can use their softness and the fact that they change shape to pack them even more,"" said 
 alberto fernandez-nieves , icrea professor in the department of condensed matter physics at the university of barcelona and adjunct professor in georgia tech's 
 school of physics . ""there are a variety of mechanisms to pack them into an available volume, and these mechanisms may play a different role depending on the situation. until this study, we didn't quite know how the microgels could be packed together beyond random close packing."" 
 their ability to release solvent allows the microgels to shrink and deform, unlike hard particles in regular colloidal suspensions. in addition, the polymer threads allow them to interpenetrate and overlap to pack more particles into a given space. the microgel particles range in size from 50 nanometers up to as much as 10 microns in diameter. in their simulations, alexeev, fernandez-nieves, and recent ph.d. graduate svetoslav nikolov studied suspensions containing about a hundred microgel particles. 
 ""their compressibility is a new ingredient that is not present in other soft particles, and it can bring about the fascinating and unique aspects of these microgel systems,"" said fernandez-nieves. ""this study gives us information we need to exploit this softness to achieve things we wouldn't be able to do otherwise."" 
 the simulations provided information about the effects of variables such as solvent type and degree of compression on the mechanical properties of the microgels in the suspension. 
 ""if you look at the mechanical properties of the suspension in different solvents, you see the curves are very different,"" alexeev said. ""if they are swollen, they are fluffy and can move around in the suspension. if they expel solvent, they can become almost dry, so the mechanical properties can change dramatically. what we found is surprising and not at all what people expected."" 
 among the key fundamental findings is that the mechanical properties of the suspension can be quantified in terms of the single microgel bulk modulus. ""it is how these particles compress that determines the material properties of the whole suspension when it is sufficiently concentrated,"" fernandez-nieves said. 
 ""you can have many different kinds of behavior, but when you scale all the behaviors by the actual compressibility of one microgel, all the behaviors come together,"" he added. ""that means this quantity seems to be the important one to consider to understand the macroscopic properties of the suspension."" 
 the researchers used the nsf's 
 extreme science and engineering discovery environment 
 to simulate the microgel systems. while the behavior of ordinary particle-based systems might seem straightforward to study, the compressibility of the microgels coupled with the complexity of the polymer crosslinking made the simulation quite large, alexeev noted. 
 ""a single particle is already a quite complicated system,"" he said. ""the computational complexity provided findings that we hope will encourage experimentalists to further explore what these unique systems can do.""

 - atlanta, ga 
 vastly different than conventional military weapons and aircraft, hypersonics systems are game-changing for national security, providing unprecedented speed and maneuverability. operating at more than five times the speed of sound, these systems can alter course after takeoff, making them hard to intercept. the u.s. government's proposed fiscal year 2022 budget for hypersonics research and development is $3.8 billion, representing a nearly 20% increase from the previous year. 
 developing vehicles capable of traveling at over a mile per second - speeds that cause vehicle surface temperatures to heat up to 2,200 degrees celsius - presents daunting engineering challenges for hypersonics materials and systems. 
 to address these hurdles and enhance u.s. hypersonics capabilities, the 
 university consortium for applied hypersonics 
 (ucah) has tapped the georgia institute of technology and key academic partners for four grants valued at $6 million over the next three years. the awards draw on georgia tech and the 
 georgia tech research institute 
 (gtri) expertise across advanced, high-temperature materials science and aerospace and mechanical engineering research - areas critical for future advances of these vehicles. 
 ""hypersonics research is a big area of focus for georgia tech. it's an area where the college of engineering and gtri can really collaborate and build upon gtri's strong foundation to be a real force in hypersonics,"" said devesh ranjan, ring family chair and associate chair for research in the george w. woodruff school of mechanical engineering, who also serves as co-director of ucah. 
 building a future workforce 
 ranjan, who also co-chairs the hypersonics taskforce at georgia tech, considers the ucah grants a huge win for georgia tech on three fronts: 
 helping build the future workforce of highly skilled researchers in hypersonics. 
 enabling technology transfer of key research into industry. 
 applying high-temperature material advances in new fields, whether it be better power plant materials, higher efficiency sensors, or new propulsion systems that could enable commercial planes to fly from los angeles to new york city in only 15 minutes. 
 georgia tech expects to engage a broad community of undergraduate, master's, and ph.d. students to tackle these projects. the continuity of a three-year research program opens the door for both gtri and the engineering schools to co-advise graduate students. 
 ""the ucah workforce development goal to attract the next generation of scientists and engineers is important and a high priority for us,"" said kenneth allen, chief scientist for gtri's advanced concepts laboratory. 
 ""workforce development is one of the key reasons we are doing this consortium,"" noted gillian bussey, director of the department of defense's joint hypersonics transition office (jhto), which funded the awards. 
 jhto's mission includes engaging with the science & technology (s&t) community to develop hypersonics technologies and transition them to operational capabilities. 
 ""we're focused on applied hypersonics, which is why we ask proposers to team with industry or national labs to help make their proposed projects more relevant and transitionable,"" bussey said, noting that a key challenge with s&t is connecting the university research community to warfighter needs. ""our goal for this consortium is not only more relevant s&t that can be better inserted into our programs, but also a university ecosystem that better understands our problems."" 
 according to bussey, georgia tech researchers excelled at showing they understood the applied research questions posed by ucah, which restricted the number of white papers from universities to three in the initial phase. 
 ""georgia tech's three papers got picked for the project proposal phase, and then for three proposal projects. so, they batted a thousand. no one else did that and i think it's a testament to the legacy and experience that georgia tech has, particularly with gtri, in working in the applied area,"" bussey said. 
 the awarded grants address several emerging areas of hypersonics, from testing advanced control system strategies to materials and composites capable of withstanding extreme temperatures. 
 contrasting hypersonics versus conventional systems 
 hypersonic vehicles differ dramatically from conventional vehicles, according to allen. to illustrate, he pointed out that intercontinental ballistic missiles (icbms) travel at roughly 15,000 miles an hour, or over mach 15, but follow a parabolic trajectory with 80% of their flight time spent in space. 
 ""hypersonic vehicles, on the other hand, do not have simple parabolic trajectories and they navigate within the atmosphere. both facts introduce a host of interesting research problems,"" he said. 
 the first problem ― maneuverable low-altitude flight ― introduces challenges in tracking for ground-based systems since the earth's curvature can block the line of sight. allen said this maneuverability also eliminates the ability to predict simple trajectories. 
 the second problem concerns vehicle velocities beyond mach 5 within the atmosphere, which  allen explained causes ""a violently disruptive process for the vehicle."" 
 ""imagine at speeds on the order of one mile per second, these vehicles must be able to withstand ripping through this sea of gases, which are disruptive enough to tear away electrons and break apart molecules. this has adverse effects on the materials, such as the disintegration of the materials exposed to the vehicle's hottest surfaces,"" he said. 
 planning better vehicle simulation paths 
 one of the ucah grants will optimize and validate multimodal control strategies for future vehicles. a key challenge facing these aircraft is that they nominally fly on the border of where they are structurally sound, explained jonathan rogers, principal investigator for the grant. 
 ""while most aircraft have buffers designed into the system to handle unexpected loads or heating, hypersonic vehicles have little margin against heating or other aerodynamic loads,"" he said. rogers serves as the lockheed martin associate professor of avionics integration in the daniel guggenheim school of aerospace engineering. ""it's hard to design margin into the system when we don't know a lot about what the system will experience."" 
 to combat that uncertainty, rogers' research team will design trajectory models so that vehicle operators can plan the path the vehicle will take. these paths will be used in simulations to ""make sure the vehicle actually flies them."" 
 rogers and his co-pis anirban mazumdar and mark costello will build on previous research collaborations with sandia national labs autonomy for hypersonic program, as well as collaborate with researchers at texas a&m university. 
 what most excites rogers is the prospect of georgia tech's research being applied and adopted by the hypersonics community. he points to the historical challenge of academic research getting published but not adopted. 
 ""with the funding agency being jhto, there's definitely an emphasis on transitioning the technology to use,"" he said. 
 building a thermal-tolerant window prototype 
 another grant involves work with three other universities to validate a prototype window design that can tolerate thermal strains, or be able to withstand the full mach 5 - 10 service temperature cycle and remain joined and sealed to the frame of the vehicle. 
 aaron stebner, associate professor in the woodruff school, is working closely with researchers at ohio state university, texas a&m, and north carolina a&t state university, as well as aerospace designers and fabricators at spirit aerosystems. 
 according to stebner, high-temperature alloys and ceramic coatings used on hypersonic vehicles prevent the electronics from communicating through them. ""the metals interfere with the electronics communications,"" he explained. 
 to overcome this problem, hypersonic vehicle builders install a small communications window made from a single crystal version of alumina with low enough density to not interfere with the electronics. however, when the window along with the rest of the vehicle heats up to 900 degrees celsius, ""in a couple seconds, the airframe metal expands much more than the ceramic,"" stebner explained, adding that the phenomenon, called thermal expansion, either causes the ceramic to crack at a cooler temperature or a gap to form between the ceramic and the metal at mach 5 and above. 
 ""our project is about making sealing and joining technologies that are sufficient for solving this problem,"" he said. 
 testing new radome and window materials 
 a third ucah grant brings together experts from gtri and professors ellen yi chen mazumdar and surya kalidindi from the woodruff school to test new high-temperature radio frequency (rf) radomes and develop infrared (ir) window materials. 
 many current hypersonic vehicles lack onboard rf and ir sensors because of the lack of high- temperature window and radome materials. windows and radomes need to simultaneously be transparent to rf or ir wavelengths and handle similar forces and temperatures as the vehicle surface. to make sensors a reality, new methods for developing and characterizing materials is needed. innovations in these areas will enable next-generation vehicle designs, which ""will help the vehicles achieve active decision-making in flight,"" said ellen yi chen mazumdar, the principal investigator and assistant professor in mechanical engineering and aerospace engineering. 
 ""to enable either radar or optical sensing in hypersonic vehicles, we need to study and develop radome and window materials. temperature handling is always a challenge, so we are pushing the boundaries of what we can do with existing materials,"" she said. 
 part of this research includes developing infrared materials that can self-calibrate. mazumdar explained that as these vehicles heat up, so will the window. an unfortunate effect is that the window itself will start to heat up and begin to emit brighter in the infrared than the objects the vehicle is looking at. ""to eliminate that effect, you have to calibrate out the window emission and wavefront distortion contributions,"" she said. 
 another big focus of the project is testing smaller radome samples at higher temperatures. developing new materials is expensive and building smaller, 1- to 4-inch-diameter samples instead of 12-inch samples could lead to smaller test facilities that are easier and less expensive to build. this can create faster material development cycles. by subjecting the material samples to extremely high temperatures, investigators will recreate, as closely as possible, the conditions that would be experienced during flight. 
 gtri's allen said their work on the radome and window materials ""is an extension of our existing core competencies in sensors and systems engineering, including materials science for high-temperature composites, material measurements with relevant temperature profiles, sensor development integration, modeling, simulation, and analysis of hypersonics systems."" 
 using ultrasound to identify defects in hypersonics materials 
 stebner is driving a fourth ucah grant that will leverage machine-learning-enhanced ultrasound inspection to better characterize manufacturing defects in hypersonics materials. he said that this research will find application in many industries beyond national defense, from nuclear energy to aerospace. 
 he noted that companies that process nuclear fuels need the same high-temperature materials used in hypersonics to contain the fuels while they are being processed. 
 ""we have proposed a big nasa program manufacturing high-temperature materials for  nuclear engines,"" stebner said. ""we also have active projects through the boeing georgia tech alliance on the manufacturing of these materials. in all cases, across many industries, non-destructive evaluation of internal manufacturing defects is critical to achieve qualification. i really see these ucah projects not only solving the short-term critical research needs of the government in this particular domain, but also seeding a broader field of study for decades.""

 today's cyber attacks aren't just a threat to computer networks. those with malicious intent can disrupt important infrastructure systems such as utilities and power grids. the trick is to identify when such attacks are underway. the department of energy has awarded the 
 georgia tech research institute 
 (gtri) $1.7 million to help detect cyber attacks on our nation's utility companies. by partnering with the georgia tech 
 school of electrical and computer engineering's 
 national electric energy testing, research and applications center 
 (neetrac) and the 
 strategic energy institute 
 (sei), gtri will work together with experts in smart grid technology to develop protocols and tools to detect such attacks. ""utilities and energy delivery systems are unique in several ways,"" said gtri researcher seth walters, one of the principal investigators on the project. ""they provide distribution over a large geographic area and are composed of disparate components which must work together as the system's operating state evolves. relevant security technologies need to work within the bandwidth limitations of these systems in order to see broad adoption and they need to account for the varying security profiles of the components within these power systems."" to detect adversarial manipulation of the power grid, the cyber security tool suite will consist of advanced modeling and simulation technologies and a network of advanced security sensors capable of acting to protect the power system in real-time on the basis of this modeling and simulation. rather than attempting to identify the source of an attack, the system will evaluate the content of information sent to the power system. ""it is impossible to predict what a clever cyber attacker can devise in the future,"" said a.p. ""sakis"" meliopoulos, a georgia power distinguished professor in the school of electrical and computer engineering (ece), who is part of the team. ""a command to the control and operation infrastructure of the system can be evaluated on the basis of its content and the effect on the power system."" the system will build on past georgia tech research into the monitoring, protection, control and operation of electric power utilities and their automation infrastructure, as well as work on information security. georgia tech's power system control and automation laboratory will be used to develop methods to detect intrusion and malicious commands before the system is field demonstrated in an actual utility environment. ""this project is particularly exciting as it integrates gtri's cyber security expertise, with the expertise in grid and electrical power of neetrac and ece,"" said sei executive director tim lieuwen. ""a key piece of our energy strategy is promoting certain signature energy areas where georgia tech combines unique breadth and depth into best of class capabilities - the area of electrical power is one of those, and this project further demonstrates georgia tech's commitment to this space."" the project will consist of three phases, which include research and development, test and validation at georgia tech, and technology demonstration at operational utility sites with the assistance of multiple utility company partners. ""gtri's expertise in systems engineering and cyber security will be a great advantage for execution on this award,"" walters said. ""we also have the singular advantage in being able to collaborate with professors from georgia tech. the school of electrical and computer engineering was instrumental in bringing emerging research ideas to the proposal narrative."" gtri worked with meliopoulos, ece associate professor santiago grijalva and neetrac engineer carson day, who are experts in power grid and smart grid technology, and raheem beyah, an ece associate professor and an expert in cyber security. ""my group, the communications assurance and performance [cap] group, will work with gtri researchers to develop, test and deploy a context-aware network-based intrusion detection system [nids],"" beyah said. ""working with a power grid simulator, the nids will have the ability to prevent network packets containing application-layer commands that render the power grid unstable from entering the network."" a georgia power distinguished professor and sei associate director, grijalva will integrate a cyber-power co-simulator where numerous cyber-attack mechanisms can be simulated, including their effects in the physical power infrastructure. he will also develop real-time decision-making algorithms that evaluate the impact of potential cyber-induced power infrastructure malfunction. ""the proposed cybersecurity system is complex, so a disciplined approach to delivering a system of systems which embodies this complexity will be required,"" walters said. ""furthermore, as part of research and development, we will be working to ensure that the tool suite, as conceptualized by the team, remains relevant to current and emerging industry needs."" andrew howard, who heads gtri's research on emerging threats and countermeasures, noted that this is a unique part of this proposal.

 energy, policy, and innovation center leads effort to develop new energy planning models for metro atlanta 
 joseph hagerman, director of the energy, policy, and innovation institute (epicenter). 
 dec 07, 2022 
 - atlanta, ga 
 for decades, the u.s. energy generation, transmission, and distribution model has been developed and planned around large-scale power plants that combust fossil fuels to create power that is then transferred to population centers via a network of powerlines. 
 with the recent and rapid growth of distributed renewable technologies - wind, solar, and hydropower, and storage assets like batteries - a team of researchers at the georgia institute of technology is reimagining the planning paradigm for electric power infrastructure. the hope is to help shape new models that are better suited to community needs and include input and decision-making at the local level. 
 as envisioned, the georgia energyshed (g-shed) will analyze the benefits, costs, and effects of various electricity generation, distribution, and usage-and-demand scenarios via use-case tests and modeling. that data will then be used to inform policy decisions at the local level and the implementation of new ideas for the  11-county metro atlanta area  as defined by the  atlanta regional commission (arc) . 
 ""what's unique about this proposal is we're using this funding to explore a new planning mechanism that would really listen to the voices of these communities around their energy matrix,"" said richard simmons, director of research and studies at georgia tech's strategic energy institute. simmons is the project's principal investigator. 
 the u.s. department of energy award, announced on november 2, is part of the federal agency's push to encourage a regional approach to understanding local energy demands and needs - and the best solutions to solve them tailored to those communities. through its office of energy efficiency & renewable energy, the doe funding is part of a wider strategy to help communities understand the impacts and benefits of consuming energy that they generate locally. 
 ""the idea is not only to better include these communities in the conversation, but demonstrate that they can realize more local benefits from their and input and decisions."" 
 leading the initiative is the  energy, policy, and innovation center (epicenter) . an arm of the  strategic energy institute , epicenter is tasked with marrying innovation with energy technology and policy; contributing to sound recommendations for the southeast through unbiased research and analysis. 
 ""this grant is ideally suited for the mission of the epicenter, which really tries to take leading energy technology and apply it in a local context that is mindful of the economic and social implications,"" simmons said. 
 the georgia tech team also includes researchers from the  school of public policy , the  school of city and regional planning , and the  college of engineering . 
 to conduct the work, georgia tech is collaborating with key partners: the atlanta regional commission (arc), which has engaged in similar planning and modeling processes for regional water and transportation usage and trends; and the  southface institute , a sustainability non-profit with extensive experience in outreach, and community engagement research. another nonprofit, the  partnership for southern equity , which advocates for sustainable practices and equity across the metro area, has also provided a letter endorsing the initiative. 
 a new approach to resource management 
 the g-shed idea is modeled after the watershed concept, which takes a regional, solutions-based approach to address water demand and usage at the community level. much like watersheds, where water collection, processing, distribution, use, and discharge is determined at the community level, simmons said the idea is to explore how a similar approach can be valid for planning and infrastructure related to energy systems, such as electricity. 
 ""there do appear to be some critical advantages by looking at local generation, consumption and even storage of renewable energy,"" said simmons. ""that might help not only meet the needs of the local populace, but it could have conversion efficiency benefits and have more direct impact on both the economic and environmental wellness of the area."" 
 while individual people and organizations already make energy-related decisions - consumers buying electric vehicles or developers erecting green or sustainable office buildings, for example - there's greater impact when broadened to the community or regional level, said joe hagerman, epicenter director. 
 ""so, when decisions are made, they are being made at a community level and capture a more representative local understanding. that information can be shared both upstream and downstream to the utilities, planners, and policymakers,"" hagerman said. ""we're hoping to create a tool that will help people make those decisions in a more holistic way, rather than making it all individually."" 
 ensuring all voices are heard 
 a key component of the g-shed effort is to prioritize diversity, equity, and inclusion by ensuring that underserved communities are included in the regional energy planning and decision-making processes. 
 marilyn brown, regents' professor and brook byers professor of sustainable systems in the school of public policy, has conducted pioneering work on energy burdens in the southeast, and contributed substantially to the proposal's diversity, equity, and inclusion vision. 
 ""the goal is balanced growth and shared prosperity in the atlanta metropolitan area by helping local communities and neighborhoods,"" brown said. 
 the southface institute and arc will leverage novel socio-technical tools developed by georgia tech to assess ways metro atlanta can ensure all residents benefit from the transition to a cleaner and more sustainable energy economy. the team will survey underrepresented groups about energy use and service options, access to rate plans, ease of understanding electric bills, and familiarity with community energy options. then, they will build an online toolkit to address these needs and help them learn how to use it. 
 ""focusing on that aspect is critical to the overall project's success because rising energy and utility costs fall disproportionately on those who can least afford them and yet have limited influence in the decision making,"" said chandra farley, the city of atlanta's chief sustainability officer. 
 nationally, atlanta is 4 th  highest in median energy burden levels (behind memphis, new orleans, and birmingham, respectively) and 3 rd  highest among low-income household populations. 
 ""evaluating energy needs at the local and metro area level with direct input from the communities who have typically had no voice in energy decision making is an important tool in ensuring equity in energy planning,"" farley said. ""the work that georgia tech is leading on energysheds will support community-informed energy planning and reinforce our efforts in the city of atlanta to address energy affordability and advance equitable access to the benefits of renewable energy projects leading to healthier communities and economic empowerment.""

 aerospace manufacturers relied heavily on composite materials for this latest generation of passenger jets. while composite parts have been used for decades, today as much as half of all airplane components can be made of composites, including major structures such as wings and the fuselage. 
 for airlines, the shift to composites creates an opportunity to rethink the repair and maintenance operations needed to keep jets in top form. although the first of delta's new jets won't enter service until fall 2017, the airline is already searching for better ways to maintain and repair composite aircraft parts - which are very different from the metal parts it has been maintaining for years 
 the airline is partnering with georgia tech to take a close look at current methods used to repair composite parts and identify ways to increase efficiency and bring down costs. 
 ""airlines want to create their own know-how on how to fix these structures because it's cheaper and probably faster,"" said chuck zhang, a professor in the stewart school of industrial and systems engineering. ""but improved technologies are needed to help in the repair of composite parts. much of it today is done by hand.""

 - atlanta, ga 
 devesh ranjan, associate chair for research, ring family chair, and professor in the george w. woodruff school of mechanical engineering, was recently named a 2021 governor's teaching fellow for the summer symposium program. 
 ranjan, whose research disciplines include propulsion and combustion and aerodynamics and fluid mechanics, is the fifth faculty member from georgia tech to be named a governor's teaching fellow. established by former gov. zell miller in 1995, the program is offered through the institute of higher education at the university of georgia to provide opportunities, skills, and networking with the goal of improving the quality of instruction in higher education. 
 ""i'm looking forward to learning from other educators from different georgia campuses and different disciplines,"" 
 ranjan 
 said. ""i see the program as a great opportunity to enhance my teaching expertise and affect the learning experiences of our students."" 
 ranjan said he is particularly interested in using the program to inform the delivery of instruction as it concerns the well-being of students, which he describes as a crisis - one that has only been exacerbated by the pandemic. 
 long before covid-19, administrators and researchers in higher education reported concerns about the mental health of students, with one national study of 155,000 students from nearly 200 campuses showing that seven out of 10 were struggling with emotional or mental difficulties that affected academic performance. ranjan is optimistic that these concerns can be addressed through choices faculty make about classroom culture, course design, and assignments. 
 in fact, the 13 members in the current governor's teaching fellows program who come from universities and technical colleges across the state have focused intently on the concept of how to foster student well-being in the wake of a worldwide health crisis. 
 ""i strongly believe that the 21st-century challenge in higher education is to meet our students where they are,"" said ranjan, who recently completed a stint as interim vice president for interdisciplinary research. he expects that student feedback and performance ""will ultimately guide the way."" 
 ranjan's participation in the program aligns well with georgia tech's strategic focus on strengthening the institute's culture of well-being and creating an environment of holistic learning where all members of the campus community can grow and learn to lead healthy, purposeful lives. 
 ranjan was selected as a fellow as part of the summer 2020 cohort before the coronavirus pandemic hit, postponing the program. he was nominated by tech president ángel cabrera. in a highly competitive process, each year the institute selects a limited number of fellows for an academic year program and a separate summer program. 
 participants are selected based on their interest in continuing instructional and professional development, their ability to make a positive impact on their own campus, and a strong commitment by their home institution for release time and other forms of support for the duration of their participation in the program. 
 ""devesh ranjan exemplifies georgia tech's commitment to educational innovation and academic well-being,"" cabrera said in nominating him. ""whether using high-tech or low-tech teaching methods, his commitment to enhance the learning experiences of his students drives him to continuously refine his approach to teaching."" 
 as a provost teaching and learning fellow at tech, ranjan also coordinated a group of engineering faculty working to integrate augmented and virtual reality platforms into select courses, all part of his commitment to both the governor's teaching fellows program and to his long-range goals as an educator. 
 ""this a continuous, ongoing process to engage students and enhance their well-being,"" he said. ""and the symposium was an excellent opportunity to have a dedicated time and space to think about innovation in teaching and education, and to meet and learn from other educators."" 
 he is also a georgia tech diversity and inclusion fellow, a program in which he aims to help, for example, first-generation and other students beyond the classroom by enhancing faculty connections with students through mentoring and by spending a few hours in residence halls to support students and their coursework. 
 georgia state rep. jasmine clark, senior instructor of nursing at emory university, who was part of the cohort of teaching fellows along with ranjan, said, ""the program challenged my entire way of thinking about how i teach in the classroom. every facet of my teaching experience was called to the carpet in the most meaningful way."" 
 ""it was unlike anything i have experienced before,"" clark said. ""it was fun, educational, and challenging. i also left feeling like i made some amazing connections with faculty members that i may not have ever had the opportunity to meet in any other instance."" 
 since its inception, more than 675 fellows from about 80 disciplines have participated in the program. this year's summer cohort includes faculty who are experts in a diverse range of areas, including psychology, dental hygiene, chemistry, nursing, political science, women's studies, classical languages, theater, and mechanical engineering.

 ph.d. student devika singh, winner of inaugural borodovsky prize as the top bioinformatics graduate student of 2021, also completed her b.s. and m.s. at georgia tech. the award will help singh continue her genomics studies. 
 may 20, 2021 
 - atlanta, ga 
 this story first appeared in the 
 georgia tech bioinformatics news center . 
 the 
 bioinformatics interdisciplinary graduate program 
 is proud to announce 
 devika singh 
 as our winner for the inaugural "" mark borodovsky prize in the college of sciences "" for the top bioinformatics phd student, 2021.  the borodovsky prize is intended to recognize outstanding academic merit at georgia tech. 
 devika works with professor 
 soojin yi , in the 
 comparative genomics and epigenomics lab 
 at georgia tech.  devika completed both her bachelor's (biology) degree and her master's (bioinformatics) degrees at georgia tech.  she worked for one year at the 
 centers for disease control and prevention 
 before returning to georgia tech to pursue her doctoral studies in 2017. 
 devika's doctoral work integrates large ""-omics"" datasets to study broad questions around the organization and evolution of non-coding regulatory regions, particularly enhancers, in the human genome. this work includes investigating the underlying architecture of enhancer-gene regulatory networks utilizing multi-tissue, whole-genome chromatin state maps (results published in mbe). indicative of the breadth of research in the yi lab, devika also worked on projects which analyzed dna methylation signatures in non-human primates and non-model organisms. in collaboration with researchers at the university of nevada, reno, and the australia museum, she generated and explored the first tissue- and sex-inclusive, whole-genome ""dna methylome atlas"" for the modern koala. 
 so far in her studies, devika has published  eight papers , including five first-author papers.  in addition, devika gave a poster presentation at a cdc conference in 2017.  she also received a travel award to present her work at the allied genetics conference earlier this year. although the meeting was canceled at the last minute due to the pandemic, the fact that devika was granted a travel award and invited for a presentation speaks for the strength of her work. 
 yi notes, ""devika and i have several projects in the pipeline, and i expect she will have at least two additional papers as the lead author from her phd studies. she is one of the best students i have worked with during my 16 years as a faculty member at georgia tech."" 
 the borodovsky prize nominations were reviewed by an interdisciplinary committee of faculty members, including joe lachance (college of sciences), peng qiu (college of engineering), and xiuwei zhang (college of computing).  according to the committee, ""devika singh exhibited an impressive ability to both analyze complex bioinformatics datasets and frame her research within a larger biological context.  despite the pandemic, she was able to publish three high-profile first author papers in 2021.  topics covered in these papers ranged from the evolution of regulatory dna in humans to epigenetics in koalas."" 
 congratulations to devika!

digging-greenland-ice-unraveling-mysteries-earths-harshest-environments.txt,"digging into greenland ice: unraveling mysteries in earth's harshest environments 
 rachel moore spent nearly 50 days in one of the most remote places on earth, collecting ice cores; the research has implications for climate change predictions and searching for signs of life on icy worlds. 
 nov 09, 2023 
 ""you're in the middle of an ice sheet, and it's one of the most desolate places on earth. there are no living animals there. there are no plants there. the only animals you see are birds. they might be lost."" 
 that's how 
 rachel moore 
 describes the view from the top of the greenland ice sheet. ""it's a really challenging environment, but it was really, really interesting to be there. i was there for nearly 50 days."" 
 moore is an expert at collecting data in difficult research environments, traveling to some of the most extreme places on earth in order to research microbes, and what hints they might give regarding astrobiology. 
 ""it all started in grad school, when i joined a microbial ecology lab,"" moore recalls. ""i pretty quickly learned that i love to do really difficult, challenging projects. i got interested in working around fire, biomass burning and forests, and i started collecting bacteria from the air. that was a challenge in and of itself, just trying to collect these really tiny things while standing in the smoke from the forest fires. but from that i learned that i loved to go out into the environment and collect things and try to understand everything around me."" 
 ""i have a lot of different projects, but they all connect through astrobiology,"" moore says. ""i'm interested in anything that hasn't been answered yet."" moore is also leading a project called exo methane, which is investigating if different archaea could survive in martian and enceladus-like environments. she's also collaborating on a project that will send a probe to venus next year. 
 moore started her postdoctoral research at georgia tech, and is now continuing her work as a research scientist 
 in the same laboratory . ""the first project i started in this lab focused around how microbes can survive a really, really dry environment,"" she adds. to study this, moore traveled to the atacama desert in chile - the driest place on earth, and also one of the best analogs to the surface of mars. ""what we were interested in there is how organisms survive intense radiation and intense desiccation. and how does that change as you look at different sites in the atacama?"" 
 then, this past summer, moore traveled to another extreme environment - greenland. ""instead of being hot and dry, greenland is extremely cold and dry,"" moore explains. ""so it was similar in some aspects, but completely different in terms of logistics and sampling methods. because we were there in the summer, the sun never set. we were also at high elevation - 10,530 feet above sea level."" 
 beneath the ice 
 the project was started by 
 nathan chellman 
 and 
 joe mcconnell 
 from the 
 desert research institute (dri) , and moore's role this year was to investigate the microbiology component of the research. ""they had been seeing some anomalies in methane and carbon monoxide in ice samples,"" moore says. ""we were curious if microbes might be producing some of this, either in the ice core after it's been sampled, or while it's still in the glacier."" 
 ""the microbes would not be swimming around or anything"" in the ice cores, moore explains, ""but it's possible that their metabolism is still active, and they're potentially able to make some of the gases, like methane, in this frozen environment. our goal was to measure these things in the environment."" 
 gathering samples wasn't easy. ""we set up a lab on the glacier, and we set it up in a trench to try to keep any of the ice cores that we pulled out roughly at the same temperature as the glacier itself,"" moore says. because of that, ""weather was a huge, huge thing. anytime it would get stormy, the wind would blow all of the snow around, and it would fill the entrance to our trench. we had to dig ourselves out several times. people would put out flags so that you could see your way back to the main house or back to your dorms."" 
 the team hopes that this research will give a more defined record of the past from the greenland ice sheet, improving climate change predictions. moore also notes applications in astrobiology, adding that ""there are a lot of icy worlds like mars, enceladus, and europa, with either an icy crust over the ocean or glaciers on the northern and southern poles."" 
 moore was also able to test new technology in the field, using a tool built by georgia tech undergraduates alongside her advisor 
 christopher carr , assistant professor in the 
 school of earth and atmospheric sciences . an ice melter that can be used to take and clean ice samples, the tool is a miniaturized prototype that may be able to help take measurements on mars, or in similar remote environments in the future. 
 ""being able to take a tool that georgia tech undergraduates made to greenland and test it on 600-year-old ice in the field was a really cool experience,"" moore adds. ""we brought starlink with us, and so i was able to video call the undergraduate team while i was testing their tool, which was really special."" 
 the team is now lab-analyzing ice cores that they brought back from greenland, unraveling which microbes might be present and potentially active. ""it's really interesting to see: is this all chemistry? is it biology based? or is there some intersection of the two?"" moore says. ""maybe there's some chemistry or photochemistry happening, plus some biology happening. whatever it is, we'll have to wait and see.""

digital-inspection-portal-uses-ai-and-machine-vision-examine-moving-trains.txt,"digital inspection portal uses ai and machine vision to examine moving trains 
 norfolk southern corporation and the georgia tech research institute (gtri) have developed digital train inspection portals that use advanced machine vision and artificial intelligence to identify mechanical defects that may exist on moving trains. 
 jan 19, 2024 
 collaboration between norfolk southern corporation and the georgia tech research institute (gtri) has led to the development of digital train inspection portals that use advanced machine vision and artificial intelligence to examine trains moving at speeds of up to 60 miles per hour to identify mechanical defects that may exist. 
 machine vision technology in the portals produces images of key components located on the front and back, top, bottom, and sides of train cars, providing a 360-degree view of the complete train. images produced by the portal are analyzed within minutes of a train's passage, allowing any issues identified to be reported immediately. 
 two train portals are currently in operation on adjacent tracks in leetonia, ohio, and the company plans to have as many as a dozen in service by the end of 2024. among them will be a train portal already under construction near jackson, georgia, which is located south of atlanta. 
 ""norfolk southern is deploying digital train inspection portals to enhance rail safety across the company's 22-state network,"" said mabby amouie, chief data scientist for the company. ""the portals feature cutting-edge machine vision inspection technology developed in partnership with gtri, which engineered the hardware, and norfolk southern's data science / artificial intelligence and mechanical teams, which built the brains behind the program."" 
 the machine vision portion uses 38 high-resolution cameras consisting of a mix of area and line scan cameras to photograph critical components of each rail car moving through the portals. powerful lights comparable to those used in sports stadiums allow the cameras to take approximately a thousand photographs of each moving rail car. 
 ""being able to look at the train while it's moving at 60 miles per hour provides visibility into defects that would be difficult to see otherwise,"" said gary mcmurray, division chief of gtri's intelligent sustainable technologies division. ""you want to be able to look at a train while it's in motion because that's when components are stressed, and you can see other dynamic faults."" 
 to reduce the amount of data that must be analyzed, each camera is aimed at a specific area of the train and takes photographs only when components of interest are visible. ""the high-speed cameras are strategically placed at angles to capture things that are difficult to detect with the human eye during stationary inspections,"" said amouie. 
 sensors at each portal determine the speed of each train passing through and use that information to precisely control when the photographs are taken. 
 ""even with a train traveling 60 miles per hour, we are able to calculate in real time when to tell each camera to take a picture,"" said colin usher, a gtri senior research scientist who led development of the machine vision system. ""only images of critical components are taken and the other areas of the train that are inconsequential to identifying defects are not captured. that optimizes the image capture and saves space in the computer system."" 
 the images produced by the system are analyzed by artificial intelligence algorithms developed by norfolk southern. the algorithms were designed to provide a combination of high accuracy and very low rates of false positives. if defects are spotted, the ai systems reports them immediately. 
 ""the computer transmits the information to norfolk southern's network operations center, where the data is reviewed by subject-matter experts to identify and address issues to proactively ensure the safety of rail operations,"" amouie said. ""critical defects are flagged for immediate handling."" 
 the machine vision system uses image compression techniques to reduce the size of the photographs processed by computer servers located in the portals. for a single train, the data analyzed can amount to as much as 500 gigabytes. because the inspection needs to be done quickly, the image processing is done on-site. 
 the inspection portals must operate year-round in all kinds of weather conditions and in geographic locations that range from extreme heat to cold. the machine vision system therefore has to operate despite heavy vibration levels, temperature extremes, rain and snow - and to remain clean as trains pass over. 
 to protect the cameras, air blown over the camera lenses shields them, while air-conditioned enclosures prevent overheating of the equipment. the system operates in a tunnel structure that helps protect the equipment and control lighting, which must be consistent across the train being inspected. 
 the project, which began in 2021, involved approximately a dozen researchers in four gtri laboratories. the research built on imaging work done earlier for a variety of applications, including the food processing industry, which needed to monitor poultry on moving processing lines. 
 ""by partnering with gtri, norfolk southern is tapping into the best in machine vision technology in any market,"" amouie said. ""we chose gtri to be a partner because they develop advanced technology solutions and large-scale system prototypes to address the most difficult problems in national security, economic development and the overall human condition.""

digital-tool-helps-hospital-make-important-coronavirus-retest-decisions.txt,"digital tool helps hospital make important coronavirus retest decisions 
 the dearth of coronavirus tests and the many false negatives confront doctors with a difficult decision this new tool helps them make. 
 coping with covid 
 apr 13, 2020 
 - atlanta, ga 
 what-if questions can torment a doctor making coronavirus retest decisions: what if a patient's initial negative test was a false negative, and he or she needs a second test? what if they don't need it, and a retest would use up a scarce test kit and treatments that other patients need? 
 such challenges led piedmont healthcare in atlanta to establish a paper-based decision tree for ordering covid-19 retests, and researchers at the georgia institute of technology turned it into an automated digital tool. piedmont further developed the tool and has now built it into the hospital's electronic medical record, where it influences the ordering of retests. 
 a user can answer their ""ifs"" by clicking through questions, and the ""if-this-then-do-that"" algorithm makes recommendations for best courses of action, ranging from immediately treating a patient for covid-19 to retesting to consulting a specialist. the final decision remains with the physician. 
 the questions are deceptively simple, but the recommendations are not always obvious. that reflects the algorithm's usefulness to fill gaps in thinking about the new sickness, which can confront clinicians with surprises. 
 ""if a patient has not had close contact with positive patients and the first test came back negative, a physician may think the patient does not need to be retested. but actually, the patient may need a second test because they are in intensive care and also have suspicious chest x-rays,"" said georgia tech graduate research assistant april yu, who converted the decision tree into a digital tool. 
 ""one of our big worries in using a brand-new test like the coronavirus test is that it will miss real cases, and this tool helps prevent that,"" said dr. bronwen garner, who helped develop the original decision tree and is an infectious disease specialist at piedmont healthcare. ""it also helps reassure physicians when they get a negative result that it is probably a true negative."" 
 suspenseful decision-making 
 a physician's reaction to an initial negative test can mean life or death because the physician not only decides on follow-up testing but also on treatment pathways and quarantine. 
 ""if you make a misstep in the thought process, it can lead to cascading impacts not only for the patient but also for healthcare professionals and family members, who may be exposed to the patient,"" said pinar keskinocak, 
 william w. george chair and professor in georgia tech's stewart school of industrial and systems engineering . ""this tool is meant to help doctors easily stay on the decision tree path."" 
 michael o'toole, executive director of piedmont healthcare's quality improvement department, originally pictured doctors getting an automated version of the decision tree to use on their phones. o'toole called keskinocak, and she tapped yu, a member of her research group. 
 ""literally within four hours they had it ready for us. it was incredible,"" said o'toole, a georgia tech alumnus who studied industrial and systems engineering. 
 ""it was a very pleasant surprise,"" said dr. garner, who is also a georgia tech graduate. ""automated tools are better than a paper format because they're in the same format as orders in our electronic system. we get notifications in real time instead of having to remember to check a piece of paper."" 
 the tool is in place in the system where doctors order retests and is specific to piedmont's workflow. it may not be directly transferable to other health care systems. 
 piedmont healthcare simplified the logic even more, and the hospital built its own custom alerts to guide physicians on retesting. for cases that are more ambiguous, piedmont healthcare's final version of the tool also gives physicians inside the hospital guidance to consult with their in-house infectious disease specialists. 
 if-this-then-retest 
 in her original version, yu had turned the decision tree criteria into a short panel of questions with yes and no answers. it took her six iterations to arrive at her final version. 
 yu's version asked whether the patient: 
 has a relevant ailment 
 previously tested positive for coronavirus 
 is now in an intensive care unit 
 has worsening lung conditions 
 shows telltale lung damage in imaging 
 has been diagnosed with a different ailment 
 the patient has had contact with someone else who tested positive for coronavirus. 
 on the back end, the algorithm guided the user through risks of coronavirus presence based on the answers. 
 ""the steps were easy to follow, and the answers were color-coded for urgency with white, yellow, and red,"" said keskinocak, who also directs georgia tech's center for health and humanitarian systems. 
 one bright yellow answer read: ""this patient needs re-testing 24 hours after the initial test!"" and there were further recommendations on how to handle the case.

dima-nazzal-elected-chair-georgia-techs-faculty-executive-board.txt,"dima nazzal elected as chair of georgia tech's faculty executive board 
 nazzal's election follows years of service and leadership within the georgia tech community. 
 jan 31, 2024 
 dima nazzal, director of professional practice and principal academic professional in the h. milton stewart school of industrial and systems engineering, has been elected as the new chair of the 
 faculty executive board . 
 nazzal's election follows years of service and leadership within the georgia tech community. a distinguished alumna, she earned her ph.d. in industrial engineering from georgia tech in 2006. after nazzal's return to campus as faculty, she quickly became known for her instructional excellence and received the curriculum innovation award in 2021. in addition to her commitment to student success, nazzal is known as an advocate for faculty, as demonstrated by her work as part of the campus covid-19 taskforce. as chair of the faculty executive board, nazzal leads the faculty in governance of itself, the curriculum, and georgia tech students. 
 ""dima's election comes at a pivotal time for our academic community,"" said provost and executive vice president for academic affairs, steve mclaughlin. ""the charge of faculty governance is to represent the faculty's interests and to work hand-in-hand with our administration to make tech a better place for everyone. her wealth of experience and commitment to faculty and academic success positions her well to lead the faculty executive board as they seek to address the most pressing issues."" 
 georgia tech, as an institution of the university system of georgia, operates under the model of shared governance, as per board of regents policy. this model empowers the faculty with certain rights that enable them to fulfill responsibilities for their own governance, the governance of students, and the maintenance of high educational standards. this means that the faculty community has a governmental voice in processes and decisions that define the academic experience for all of georgia tech. 
 ""the academic experience looks different than it did even five years ago,"" said nazzal. ""with the many new challenges our faculty are facing both in the classroom and in their research, it is more important than ever that our perspective be present in campus decision making. my hope is that during my tenure as chair of the faculty executive board, georgia tech's faculty will be represented clearly in decisions that impact everything from the classroom to campus life and beyond."" 
 former chair of the faculty executive board and current executive chief of staff and associate provost, karie davis-nozemack, remarked, ""i am delighted to pass the torch to dima. her election is a testament to the strong and visionary leadership within the faculty. i have full confidence in her ability to guide the board and contribute significantly to the academic governance of our institution.""

dimitri-mavris-receives-1934-distinguished-professor-award.txt,"dimitri mavris receives 1934 distinguished professor award 
 aerospace engineering's mavris is awarded the highest honor given to a georgia tech professor. 
 dimitri mavris, regents' professor, boeing professor of advanced aerospace systems analysis, and langley distinguished professor in advanced aerospace systems architecture received the class of 1934 distinguished professor award for 2024. 
 apr 24, 2024 
 in 1980, dimitri mavris left his hometown of athens, greece, for atlanta, georgia, to pursue a bachelor's degree in aerospace engineering. he did not realize it at the time, but his first day of class at georgia tech would mark the beginning of a career that would span 44 years as a yellow jacket. 
 what dimitri did know was that he wanted to follow in his family's footsteps. 
 ""there was no aerospace program in greece when i graduated high school, so my grandfather encouraged me to leave home,"" said mavris. ""he was one of the original classes of greek army aviators, and he financed my studies in aerospace engineering. i wanted to follow in my sister and brother-in-law's footsteps and attend georgia tech."" 
 over time, plans to earn his bachelor's degree and return to greece turned into pursuit of a master's degree, then a ph.d., followed by a career as an engineering professor - all at georgia tech. 
 his experience as a student arriving in the u.s. from another country influences the way mavris thinks of his current students, particularly those also from another country or the first of their family to attend college. 
 ""these days, i do a lot of student interviews for our programs, and it really strikes me how many applicants are of the first generation to go to college or the first to go to grad school. and they are hoping to find someone who can provide advice and guidance,"" said mavris. ""i have always felt that the best you can give someone in that situation is your time, attention, and care."" 
 the georgia tech lab currently run by mavris, the 
 aerospace systems design laboratory 
 (asdl), was the brainchild of professor emeritus daniel schrage. just as mavris has become a mentor to so many, schrage was a mentor to mavris and introduced him to systems thinking, design, and engineering. in 1996, mavris became the asdl lab director and, under schrage's tutelage, sought to build something impactful that also maintained an environment that felt like family. asdl began with just five students, several of whom are still with the lab as research faculty. mavris sees this as a testament to the lab's supportive environment. 
 asdl maintains a ""family atmosphere"" even having grown today to a robust team of 50 full-time researchers and 300 graduate students. it has conferred degrees to almost 1,300 graduate students: 287 ph.d.s and 1,009 master's degrees. yet, no matter how large and successful his lab is, mavris' concerns are always with his students. 
 asdl community of faculty, staff, and students. 
 over the years, he has championed growth and changes (both curricular and institutional) to push the college of engineering and the school of aerospace engineering in ways that would produce and support some of the top minds entering the engineering workforce. 
 ""i think the school of aerospace engineering is very different today than it was back when i first came [to georgia tech]. we have always prided ourselves on producing the best engineers. i took that to heart and wanted to understand what that really looks like in industry,"" said mavris. ""so, i was fortunate to be selected by boeing to pilot their welliver faculty fellowship program. it became very apparent to me that a lot of the subjects we were teaching in universities at the time were viewed by industry as fundamental knowledge, but they were seeking new skills to keep them ahead of the competition. research fields such as systems architecture and systems engineering, multidisciplinary design optimization, integrated production and process development, and robust design (to name a few) were not present [in higher education] at the time."" 
 these were all fields that had to be developed and, throughout the three decades that followed, mavris set out to do so. with encouragement and support from colleagues and mentors like professors robert loewy and vigor yang, mavris was able to develop an impactful program in which the aerospace industry saw value. under his leadership, asdl developed into the largest lab of its kind and established a global reputation for excellence in both its rigorous educational program and substantial research. 
 over time, asdl became the go-to lab for u.s. government-contracted technology assessments and is now seen as a global leader in systems design, architecting, and optimization. asdl receives more than $20 million annually in research funding from both the government and american and european industry. since its launch, the lab has brought in $325 million in research funding. 
 ""asdl's success would not be possible without the support and leadership of j.l. chameau, steve mclaughlin, gary may, raheem beyah, chaouki abdallah, steve cross, larry jacobs, and the leadership of the school of aerospace engineering - past chairs robert loewy and vigor yang, as well as current chair mitchell walker,"" acknowledges mavris. ""in addition, our excellent research team and students have helped the lab grow and evolve over time."" 
 as the aerospace industry has become increasingly competitive - with advanced degrees often a requirement - mavris has worked to secure funding to support master's and ph.d. students to ensure that cost is not a barrier for them to start their careers. 
 mavris is flanked at the december 2023 asdl graduate recognition ceremony by the eight students who completed their ph.d.s and buzz. 
 ""my philosophy when i started, and this is with most young people, is that you're thinking about your own career, technology advancements, or the next contract, but as time progresses, you realize that there will always be another project,"" he said. ""there will always be another hill to climb. but really, the only thing that matters in the end is the journey and the people you met and helped along the way."" 
 from conducting hundreds of student interviews every year, to advising and mentoring, to hooding ph.d. graduates during commencement, mavris is proud to serve as a support for his students, sharing lessons learned across his four decades at georgia tech. 
 ""my career has been a journey of self-discovery, always looking for ways to become a more effective researcher and educator,"" says mavris. ""georgia tech's model of service teaches us to be unselfish in our time and share with students - not to see people and other entities as competitors. it is gratifying to me that many of the students i have taught become professors and help carry on the asdl legacy."" 
 quotes from colleagues 
 ""dr. mavris and i have worked together for the past 32 years, and he is one of the most knowledgeable professors in the areas of systems engineering, multidisciplinary design and optimization, aircraft design, and more. dr. mavris is amazingly dedicated to the aerospace systems design laboratory, especially to its research faculty and students. the success of asdl is largely due to his ability to understand our customers' needs and his ability to motivate the people who work for him. he is also one of the most compassionate professors i have ever met, and he directs asdl as if it is part of his family. i am very fortunate to be part of his asdl team / family!"" - jimmy tai, asdl associate director, aerospace systems design laboratory advanced configurations division chief, school of aerospace engineering 
 ""dimitri mavris always puts students first. he is not just an advisor, he is a mentor, and his research family now extends far and wide. his vision for a lab that could prepare students to be the industry leaders of tomorrow is here today! on a more personal note, he has been a mentor and friend since i came to georgia tech and a great role model in servant leadership. this award is well deserved!"" - elena garcia, senior research engineer, advanced methods division chief, export control coordinator, aerospace systems design laboratory, school of aerospace engineering 
 ""professor dimitri mavris has been a cornerstone of the school of aerospace engineering, fostering exceptional partnerships with leading industry and government sponsors. his leadership and vision have been pivotal in preparing hundreds of students for successful careers in the aerospace sector, significantly influencing the trajectory of the u.s. aerospace industry. under his guidance, the aerospace systems design laboratory has become a beacon of innovation, renowned nationally for its ability to tackle complex system design challenges. professor mavris does not just teach; he immerses his students in real-world engineering problems, equipping them with the skills and knowledge to excel. 
 beyond his academic contributions, professor mavris has dedicated himself to mentoring the aerospace community at georgia tech. he has been instrumental in guiding our sae design build fly teams, nurturing a new generation of engineers with a blend of practical skills and theoretical knowledge. his commitment extends beyond our campus. professor mavris' leadership in various committees within the american institute of aeronautics and astronautics demonstrates his dedication to advancing the field of aerospace engineering on a national level. 
 in every aspect, professor mavris exemplifies leadership, commitment, and a deep passion for aerospace education and research."" - mitchell walker, professor and chair, school of aerospace engineering

diversity-may-be-key-reducing-errors-quantum-computing.txt,"diversity may be key to reducing errors in quantum computing 
 in quantum computing, as in team building, a little diversity can help get the job done better, computer scientists have found. 
 in quantum computing, as in team building, a little diversity can help get the job done better, computer scientists have discovered. a new technique, known as ensemble of diverse mappings, depends on using different qubits to create diversity in errors to mitigate the errors. 
 oct 14, 2019 
 - atlanta, ga 
 in quantum computing, as in team building, a little diversity can help get the job done better, computer scientists have discovered. 
 unlike conventional computers, the processing in quantum-based machines is noisy, which produces error rates dramatically higher than those of silicon-based computers. so quantum operations are repeated thousands of times to make the correct answer stands out statistically from all the wrong ones. 
 but running the same operation over and over again on the same qubit set may just generate the same incorrect answers that can appear statistically to be the correct answer. the solution, according to researchers at the georgia institute of technology, is to repeat the operation on different qubit sets that have different error signatures - and therefore won't produce the same correlated errors. 
 ""the idea here is to generate a diversity of errors so you are not seeing the same error again and again,"" said 
 moinuddin qureshi, 
 a professor in georgia tech's 
 school of electrical and computer engineering , who worked out the technique with his senior ph.d. student, swamit tannu. ""different qubits tend to have different error signatures. when you combine the results from diverse sets, the right answer appears even though each of them individually did not get the right answer,"" said tannu. 
 tannu compares the technique, known as ensemble of diverse mappings (edm), to the game show who wants to be a millionaire. contestants who aren't sure of the answer to a multiple choice question can ask the studio audience for help. 
 ""it's not necessary that the majority of the people in the audience know the right answer,"" qureshi said. ""if even 20% know it, you can identify it. if the answers go equally in the four buckets from the people who don't know, the right answer will get 40% and you can select it even if only a relatively small number of people get it right."" 
 experiments with an existing noisy intermediate scale quantum (nisq) computer showed that edm improves the inference quality by 2.3 times compared to state-of-the-art mapping algorithms. by combining the output probability distributions of the diverse ensemble, edm amplifies the correct answer by suppressing the incorrect ones. 
 the edm technique, tannu admits, is counterintuitive. qubits can be ranked according to their error rate on specific types of problems, and the most logical course of action might be to use the set that's most accurate. but even the best qubits produce errors, and those errors are likely to be the same when the operation is done thousands of times. 
 choosing qubits with different error rates - and therefore different types of error - guards against that by ensuring that the one correct answer will rise above the diversity of errors. 
 ""the goal of the research is to create several different versions of the program, each of which can make a mistake, but they will not make identical mistakes,"" tannu explained. ""as long as they make diverse mistakes, when you average things out, the mistakes get canceled out and the right answer emerges."" 
 qureshi compares the edm technique to team-building techniques promoted by human resource consultants. 
 ""if you form a team of experts with identical backgrounds, all of them may have the same blind spot,"" he said, adding a human dimension. ""if you want to make a team resilient to blind spots, collect a group of people who have different blind spots. as a whole, the team will be guarded against specific blind spots."" 
 error rates in conventional silicon-based computers are practically negligible, about one in a thousand-trillion operations, but today's nisq quantum computers produce an error in a mere 100 operations. 
 ""these are really early-stage machines in which the devices have a lot of error,"" qureshi said. ""that will likely improve over time, but because we are dependent on matter that has extremely low energy and lacks stability, we will never get the reliability we have come to expect with silicon. quantum states are inherently about a single particle, but with silicon you are packing a lot of molecules together and averaging their activity. 
 ""if the hardware is inherently unreliable, we have to write software to make the most of it,"" he said. ""we have to take the hardware characteristics into account to make these unique machines useful."" 
 the notion of running a quantum operation thousands of times to get what's likely to be the right answer at first seems counterproductive. but quantum computing is so much faster than conventional computing that nobody would object to doing a few thousand duplicate runs. 
 ""the objective with quantum computers is not to take a current program and run it faster,"" qureshi said. ""using quantum, we can solve problems that are virtually impossible to solve with even the fastest supercomputers. with several hundred qubits, which is beyond the current state of the art, we could solve problems that would take a thousand years with the fastest supercomputer."" 
 added qureshi: ""you don't mind doing the computation a few thousand times to get an answer like that."" 
 the quantum error mitigation scheme is scheduled to be presented on oct. 14 at the 52nd annual ieee / acm international symposium on microarchitecture. the work was supported by a gift from microsoft.

do-it-yourself-medical-devices-and-protective-gear-fuel-battle-against-covid-19.txt,"do-it-yourself medical devices and protective gear fuel battle against covid-19 
 the georgia tech community is working together to help meet the needs for personal protection equipment for health care workers. 
 to help meet the need for personal protective equipment (ppe) for health care workers, georgia tech has designed and is producing face shields. shown is a laser cutting machine used to create frames for the shields. 
 mar 23, 2020 
 - atlanta, ga 
 it's a race against time that some participants liken to apollo 13, the stricken nasa spacecraft for which engineers improvised an air purification system from available parts to get three astronauts back from the moon. 
 in this case, however, the race is to improvise ventilators, face shields, respirators, surgical gowns, disinfectant wipes, and other healthcare gear to help the hundreds of thousands of people expected to swamp hospitals with waves of critical covid-19 illness over the next several weeks. the demand for ventilators alone could be four times more than already overwhelmed hospitals can provide. 
 using 3d-printed parts, plastic-lined tablecloths intended for birthday parties, laser-cut gears, and similar substitutions, a research team from universities on two continents is racing to develop ""do-it-yourself"" healthcare gear that can be assembled where it's needed from components available locally. team members figure they have about two weeks to get the designs right and share them with anyone who can help with the needs. 
 ""we're trying to figure out how to get these things to scale in the time we have,"" said shannon yee, an associate professor in georgia tech's george w. woodruff school of mechanical engineering who's working on the ventilator issue with a half-dozen colleagues at georgia tech and other universities. ""we are looking at producing things very quickly and this is where having contacts with mature manufacturing sources is going to help."" 
 georgia tech has established a 
 rapid response website 
 to identify needs for personal protective equipment and potential collaborations. 
 supplying face shields to the medical community 
 the wallace h. coulter department of biomedical engineering at emory and georgia tech serves as a bridge between healthcare needs and the broad technical know-how at georgia tech, and georgia tech researchers are talking regularly with hospital systems to discuss their needs. so far, hand sanitizer, disinfectant wipes, face shields, respirator masks, and ventilators have been identified as critical needs. using resources of the flowers invention studio - such as 3d printing - the group has already produced 1,000 face shields and is preparing to fabricate thousands more in the form of kits that hospitals can assemble. 
 ""with the significant challenges on our supply chain, we need strategies to provide personal protective equipment (ppe) for healthcare staff,"" said dr. charles brown, ceo of physician enterprise at piedmont healthcare. ""we have mechanisms in place to develop ideas and are working with georgia tech and the global center for medical innovation (gcmi) to advance them to what we can use."" 
 georgia tech faculty members, students and gcmi worked on multiple face shield designs, talking with clinicians at children's healthcare of atlanta, emory healthcare and piedmont to evaluate and iterate. the result was two different designs intended for specific uses in hospital facilities, where face shields protect clinicians from splashes and help extend the life of soft respirators intended to filter out virus particles. 
 ""the team has worked hard to identify materials suppliers and define simple and scalable solutions to meet this challenge,"" said sam graham, chair of the woodruff school of mechanical engineering. ""we are fortunate to have partners ready to team up with us to help address some of the shortfalls in medical equipment that hospitals are experiencing."" 
 to scale up fabrication beyond the georgia tech campus, the team focused on simple designs that could be shared with and produced by individuals with access to a makerspace - and major manufacturers with injection molding capabilities. the team plans to make the designs available for anyone with laser cutting or 3d printing capabilities. 
 ""initially we were just thinking about meeting the needs of atlanta, but cities everywhere need them,"" said saad bhamla, an assistant professor in the school of chemical and biomolecular engineering who specializes in ""frugal science"" - creating inexpensive lab devices. ""we have created great models that can be used to create a pipeline of instructions that others can use. the face shields will set the stage for other device models as they become available."" 
 the group is leveraging georgia tech contacts with companies to identify suppliers for alternative materials that can go into their ""apollo 13"" devices. team members, including christopher saldana, an associate professor in the woodruff school, are working with gcmi on those issues, using equipment in georgia tech's maker spaces and elsewhere. 
 ""the georgia tech mechanical engineering team is working to modify open source face shield designs so they can be manufactured in high volumes for the rapid response environment that covid-19 requires,"" said christopher saldana, an associate professor in the woodruff school. ""our team has modified these designs using a range of product and process optimization methods, including removing certain features and standardizing tool use. by working on cross-functional and cross-disciplinary teams and directly involving healthcare practitioners and high-volume manufacturers, we will be able to respond to this effort at the scale and speed required."" 
 bringing georgia tech's expertise together to address the challenges - and develop collaborations - has been done behind the scenes by people like sherry farrugia, chief operating and strategy officer for the children's healthcare of atlanta pediatric technology center. 
 ""serving as kind of a chief strategy officer, my work is to help bridge the gaps, focus the teams, rally the troops, and make critical connections,"" she said. ""doing this requires a deep knowledge of who's doing what on campus, as well as a strong network in the private sector."" 
 the supply chain challenge 
 the team is launching a website ( www.research.gatech.edu / rapid-response ) to both quantify the needs for face shields and solicit supplies of materials. because the world's supply chains are unable to ship conventional ppe components, they are looking for alternatives that may not now be part of that production. 
 the challenge is that everyone is scrambling to find equipment and materials in an international supply chain that has already been depleted by months-long demands from countries that dealt with the virus earlier: china, italy and south korea. as the healthcare demands ramp up in the united states, hospitals will have to be more creative in meeting the needs that their traditional sources may not be able to supply. 
 ""countries on the trailing end of the pandemic are facing supply chain issues that countries with earlier pandemics didn't have to face,"" said michael o'toole, executive director of quality improvement at piedmont and a georgia tech engineering graduate. ""we've got to get these supplies, and its a critical need already. if we can't get them from commercial or government sources, we're going to have to make them ourselves."" 
 with significant efforts going into design of locally sourced equipment, expertise on medical device prototyping and approval is needed. that is coming from a network of alumni and local companies and gcmi, a georgia tech-affiliated organization that works with device manufacturers around the world to translate designs into devices that can be manufactured quickly and cost effectively. 
 ""the goal right now is to develop solutions that can be sourced locally and that we can produce now,"" said tiffany wilson, gcmi's ceo. ""we are working with georgia tech and others on how we can suggest modifying the designs to optimize them for the current environment. we are helping make sure designs are clinically validated with an eye toward scalability."" 
 beyond its experience with medical devices, gcmi is also helping source materials and components, and working with regulators at the fda to help reduce risks in the responses. 
 ""there have been changes in some of the standards and new guidance from the fda to enable faster production to open up the supply chain to get more masks and respirators into the market,"" wilson said. ""there are still levels of control and risk mitigations strategies that we need to focus on. we're staying on top of those changes."" 
 research on possible solutions for other shortages 
 while the face shield is the most mature project the team is developing, researchers are also looking at other needs of the medical community. among them are ventilators, disinfecting wipes, and respirators. 
 an example of an apollo 13 project may be ventilators that are used to help critically ill patients breathe. traditional equipment makers are working as fast as they can, but that may not be fast enough. to achieve a globally scalable makeshift ventilator will require minimizing the number of parts and thinking about mechanical simplicity, yee said. 
 leon williams, head of the centre for competitive creative design at cranfield university, is working with georgia tech researchers to create a makeshift ventilator based on the bag-valve-mask (bvm) - also known as an ambu bag - a hand-held mechanical resuscitation device already available at hospitals. 
 through a system of laser-cut gears and other components, the preliminary concept would use a simple three-volt motor to compress the bag and push air into the lungs of a critically ill patient. among the challenges is extending the lifetime of the bags, which are not designed for long-term use. 
 ""we need to understand everything about the ventilators that are already in use,"" said susan margulies, chair of the wallace h. coulter department of biomedical engineering at georgia tech and emory university. ""by understanding how everything works, we can modify the design to use the components we can get."" 
 as with face shields, the group expects to make its plans widely available for other groups to iterate and produce. ""there is a lot of activity here that is going to move this forward,"" said devesh ranjan, associate chair for research in the woodruff school of mechanical engineering, who is coordinating several of the georgia tech rapid-response projects on campus. 
 another identified need is for disinfecting wipes, which seem like a simple enough product: a nonwoven material and a solution based on either alcohol or bleach. the material and solutions seem to be available; the problem is locating the industrial-sized containers to hold them. 
 ""we've been looking for containers for the wipes commercially,"" said graham. ""what we are finding is that the issue is the containers, but we are looking at other solutions."" he's working with david sholl, chair of the school of chemical and biomolecular engineering, to identify potential suppliers. 
 respirators, swabs and gowns 
 protecting healthcare workers from the coronavirus requires a special type of respirator, soft face masks that remove virus particles from the air. because the virus particles are so small, hundreds of nanometers in diameter, that protection requires high-efficiency filtration materials that until recently were mostly manufactured in china. 
 ""the filters are not being produced at the rates that are needed, so we have been thinking about what we can put together that approximates an n95 filter that's needed to protect healthcare workers,"" said ryan lively, an associate professor in the school of chemical and biomolecular engineering. ""we need to make something that can be produced out of homemade goods, then verify that it can do the filtering needed."" 
 lively has been experimenting with alternatives, such as high-efficiency filtration materials manufactured for hvac systems that could be sewn inside a fabric pouch. ""there are journal papers out there showing filtration materials that are not as good as n95 are still effective at increasing rejection of the virus particles,"" he said. 
 if these work as needed, lively could produce limited numbers in his lab. ""we have estimated that we can produce 700 masks per week using the pilot line that we have for research and repurposing it for cranking out hydrophobic fiber media,"" he said. ""that won't solve the problem, but it will help meet a very critical need."" 
 the swabs used for covid-19 testing are also in short supply, as are gowns designed to protect healthcare workers. carson meredith, director of the renewable bioproducts institute, is tracking down alternative sources from among the many manufacturers who are members of the georgia tech interdisciplinary research institute. 
 ""the idea is to take a basic material intended for a different function and transform it into the products that we need,"" he said. one example is a material manufactured for party tablecloths - plastic on one side to prevent spills from going through, and paper on the other for festive designs. ""we're looking at whether the machinery that produces those can be rapidly turned into making a temporary gown."" 
 the research team meets by phone daily to update each other on what's been done and to share ideas. they follow international slack channels to know what other similar groups are doing across the u.s. and the world. 
 they know their prototype production equipment can't meet the world's needs, so they're sharing plans with others who may have capabilities. ultimately, major manufacturers will catch up, but that could take months - perhaps too long for the expected covid-19 infection curve. 
 ""the best thing we can do is share that information broadly to try to come up with solutions that use parts that can be sourced locally,"" yee said, referring to the ventilator project. ""simple solutions using motors that people can get anywhere, structures that can be 3d-printed and materials that can be hand-cut with saws may get us through this.""

 georgia tech will celebrate its 25th annual earth day with a 4-day schedule of events this week.

 apr 18, 2022 
 - atlanta, ga 
 georgia tech will celebrate its 25th annual earth day 
 with a week of events . the celebration kicked off earlier today with a 
 keynote event 
 featuring vice president for infrastructure and sustainability maria cimilluca. she shared her inspiring vision for the future of sustainability at georgia tech. 
 ""the institute's 
 strategic plan 
 asks us to envision an institution that leverages its unmatched scale and resources to address the most crucial challenges of our time,"" cimilluca said. ""i see the institute's sustainability plan as one of the many pathways for collaboration, innovation, and action that will lead us toward transformations in research, applied technologies, culture, and ultimately a more sustainable future."" 
 georgia tech first celebrated earth day in 1997. for many years the celebration was a one-day, afternoon event. in 2020, it was expanded but held virtually due to the covid-19 pandemic. held in person last year, the event featured the kendeda building for innovative sustainable design's living building certification by the international living futures organization, and president cabrera cut the ribbon for the grand opening of the ecocommons. these two areas on campus represent georgia tech's commitment to sustainability and serve as living, learning laboratories for students, faculty, and staff. 
 event co-chairs anne rogers, associate director of the 
 office of campus sustainability , and emma brodzik, campus sustainability project manager, have planned a strong lineup of events for this 25th anniversary. from a bike ride with president cabrera, to a waste audit of the clough undergraduate learning commons, to a bird walk and tree planting, this year's ""down to earth"" event offers many opportunities to celebrate nature and learn about new and innovative ways to protect and preserve our planet. 
 as is the tradition, this year's theme and logo were chosen from a student design contest. the winner, abhinav thukral, is a graduate student in human and computer interaction. ""i think it's incredibly important to be aware of how our activities affect the planet and to learn sustainable ways to progress as a community,"" thukral said. ""earth day is essential to reflect on some of the environmental issues we face today and how we might work together to address them."" 
 students have often requested to work with campus operations to manifest positive environmental change by engaging with the staff of infrastructure and sustainability. this unit is responsible for providing sustainable, safe, and well-maintained campus facilities. for example, recent carbon reduction challenge winners aided in implementing the replacement of existing fluorescent lighting with led in a wing of the petit institute for bioengineering and bioscience building. by working with the building engineering and energy strategies department, this improvement will yield more than 250,000 pounds of carbon dioxide reduction per year. another area where students are proactive is recycling. when the need for acrylic shields lessened as the intensity of the pandemic waned, student volunteers from the office of minority education assisted campus staff in collecting 800 pounds of acrylic and pvc for recycling. 
 these types of student-led collaborative efforts are encouraged. if your organization or class would like to collaborate with infrastructure and sustainability, use 
 this form 
 to get started.

""it really created a passion for architecture in me, and i still enjoy going to open houses today,"" said davari, who grew up in sugar hill, georgia, near lake lanier. ""at one point, a lot of the realtors in my area knew me because of my frequent visits."" 
 davari's childhood interest turned into a professional goal, and now she is receiving a master's degree in architecture. she also earned a bachelor's in architecture from georgia tech in 2021. 
 highlights from her studies at tech include a residential internship in florida and a studio project in savannah, georgia, where the students worked on a 150-acre site and designed a building in detail. 
 outside of the classroom, she enjoys many creative endeavors, including photography, baking, fashion, and jewelry making. ""i love many types of design,"" she said. ""a good architect is creative, and i am always trying to work on and improve that skill - and have a lot of fun while doing it."" 
 after graduating, she will work full time at an architectural firm and also work on getting her architectural license. 
 davari will miss the people she has met at tech. ""it is such a diverse place with amazing students and professors. i learned as much from my peers as i did from my professors, and i will miss seeing everyone daily."" 
 her advice to current students is to continue working hard but find time for other activities they enjoy. ""it is ok to take breaks and do things that make you happy,"" she said. ""even though i did my undergraduate at georgia tech and went straight into the master's program, time goes by quicker than you might think."" 
 davari's parents and her boyfriend will join her for commencement, and a large group of family and friends will celebrate with her after the ceremony, which takes place friday, may 5, at 3 p.m. in bobby dodd stadium.

driving-cassini-doctoral-student-controls-spacecraft-missions-final-days.txt,"driving cassini: doctoral student controls spacecraft in mission's final days 
 michael staab is one of three people authorized to send commands to cassini spacecraft. 
 the cassini spacecraft, which has been orbiting saturn since 2004, will plunge into saturn on september 15. (image credit: nasa / jpl-caltech) 
 sep 12, 2017 
 - atlanta, ga 
 when the 
 cassini spacecraft 
 plunges into saturn on september 15 to end a nearly two-decade mission, georgia tech student michael staab will have a front row seat. it's almost literally the driver's seat. 
 staab is working at 
 nasa's jet propulsion laboratory 
 (jpl) in california while pursuing his 
 aerospace engineering 
 doctoral degree in the distance learning program. he's a cassini spacecraft flight controller, which means he's one of only three people authorized to tell the machine what to do and where to go as it orbits saturn. 
 the job is almost finished. just before 8 a.m. (atlanta time) on friday, staab will hear cassini's signal for the final time before it dives into the planet's atmosphere, becoming a part of saturn. 
 staab has controlled the bus-sized spacecraft since january of 2016, when he was given the keys to the nasa's flagship saturn mission. he's logged more than 1,200 hours at the 
 cassini flight console . his commands have directed the spacecraft around saturn 62 times, hurled it through the planet's rings and soared cassini around saturn's moons. although cassini will technically dive into the planet because of a gravitational nudge by saturn's moon titan, staab was the one who sent the background sequence code that will send it on its fateful plunge. he uploaded the command a few weeks ago. 
 staab earned his master's degree in aerospace engineering in 2015. he came to campus earlier this month to talk to students about the mission and what nasa is calling "" the grand finale ."" 
 we asked him a few questions about his job, starting with the obvious: 
 how did you get such a cool gig? 
 i fell into this job from a combination of luck and having the right background. i actually had no intention of applying to jpl when i stopped by jpl's booth at georgia tech's fall career fair. i chatted with one of their reps and, after some persuasion, was convinced to leave a copy of my resume. i received an offer to be a cassini flight controller a few weeks later. it was the right job and one that i always wanted. 
 prior to attending georgia tech, i was a flight test engineering intern at nasa's armstrong flight research center at edwards air force base in california and, later, a test requirements and analysis engineer for boeing in st. louis. i had a lot of control room and operations experience, which is exactly what jpl was looking for. 
 the duty of a flight controller at jpl is fairly straight-forward; we possess absolute command and control authority of the spacecraft when tracking it through the deep-space network. we are the only people in the world who can tell the spacecraft what to do. we're the first to respond to anomalies with either the ground or flight system, and we have the authority to make any real-time decisions to protect the flight system without prior approval. it's an immense responsibility that only very few people in the world ever get to do. i am still greatly humbled to be given such responsibility by the cassini flight team so early in my career. 
 why are you destroying the spacecraft and ending the mission? 
 the mission is ending for two reasons. the first, and most obvious, is that the spacecraft is out of fuel. we primarily use its moon, titan, to navigate around saturn - stealing more than 100 km / s of delta-v from gravitational assists. but we need fuel to maneuver the spacecraft to very precise locations near titan. without it, we can't navigate the planet. essentially, we'd be flying blind. 
 the second, and more important reason, is because we need to protect titan and enceladus from the potential organisms on cassini. the spacecraft has shown both moons to be suitable for supporting life. 
 titan 
 is the most earth-like world we've discovered in the solar system, with methane clouds and methane-filled surface lakes. cassini has even detected a global, subsurface ocean beneath titan's thick, icy surface. 
 enceladus 
 is perhaps an even more exciting world. it also has a global, subsurface ocean underneath its icy crust. unlike titan, though, enceladus is shooting samples of its ocean into space from a set of geysers at its south pole. scientists have dubbed them ""cold faithful.""  enceladus gave cassini free samples of its oceans during flybys through its plumes. the spacecraft detected the presence of carbon dioxide, simple organic compounds and molecular hydrogen. not only do we have organic chemistry taking place in enceladus' ocean, but we also have direct evidence of hydrothermal vents on enceladus' ocean floor. all the basic ingredients for life - water, organic chemistry and an energy source - exist on the moon. does enceladus have life in its ocean? we don't know yet, but it has shown the strongest evidence yet for the possibility of life outside of earth. 
 we want to go back to enceladus with better instruments to possibly detect the presence of biological signatures. but to do so, we have to preserve the integrity of the moon and not contaminate it with earth ""bugs,"" which might have hitched a ride aboard cassini. are you sad? 
 yes and no. i will, more than anything, miss working with the cassini flight team. they've become my family at jpl. a part of me is also dealing with the fact that i will no longer get to work in the mission control center. i'll miss not being able to sit in the chair anymore. 
 however, cassini is a victim of her own success. her discoveries at titan and enceladus sealed her fate. we have to dispose of the spacecraft to guarantee it will never impact those biologically interesting moons. and, in the end, cassini is just a robot. i'm a heartless engineer, but it's hard to feel sad about the ""death"" of a machine. we like to anthropomorphize our spacecraft at jpl as having personalities and feelings. i don't. it will be hard on the morning of the 15th to say goodbye to this mission. but i know this isn't the end of our exploration of the saturn system. cassini has ensured we will return. the only question is when. 
 what's next for you after cassini is gone? 
 i'm moving over to mars as a spacecraft systems engineer (sse) and flight director for the 
 mars exploration rover opportunity . in combination with the responsibilities of a flight director, sses are a jack of all trades - from tactical downlink lead, to uplink verification lead, to testbed engineers. these versatile skills are necessary for a mission operating well beyond its original design life. opportunity was slated for a 90-sol mission (a ""sol"" is a day on mars). it's been on the surface for 4,800 and counting. 
 what is your advice for your fellow yellow jackets interested in aerospace and / or planetary science? 
 be inquisitive, innovative and, most importantly, bold. jpl's motto is ""dare mighty things."" that really encompasses the spirit of the people and the type of missions the lab designs, builds and operates. 
 there really is no other place on earth where you can build and operate spacecraft that drive on mars, orbit saturn and even travel to interstellar space. these missions require the lab to take bold risks and come up with, to an outsider, crazy ideas. but, as co-worker adam steltzner put it, it's the right kind of crazy. 
 if exploring the solar system and looking for life beyond earth is something that excites you, jpl is the place for you.

 mar 21, 2023 
 idling at a crossroads no longer, the automotive industry is embracing electrification like never before. with more electric vehicles purchased in 2022 than any year prior, consumers are beginning to follow their lead. yet, while opportunity abounds, new challenges will require an innovative approach to ensure a sustainable and accessible electric future for all. 
 with historic investments from major players in the ev space, including rivian, kia, and hyundai, the state of georgia is uniquely positioned to serve as a leader in this effort. as the state's leading research institute, georgia tech is on the cutting edge of the movement. 
 the transportation sector is the largest greenhouse gas emitter in the u.s. at nearly 30%, with passenger vehicles accounting for around 80% of the sector's total output1 as of 2019. electric vehicles are widely regarded as a budding solution to reduce emissions, but even as both demand and production continue to increase, evs currently account for around 1% of the cars on america's roadways. 
 from the supply chain to the infrastructure needed to support alternative-fuel vehicles alongside consumer hesitancy, achieving the goals set by both the public and private sectors - including the biden administration's target of evs making up at least 50% of new car sales by 2030 - will not be easy. through research and development, policy, and collaboration, tech experts are working toward finding solutions that will serve as catalysts during this transitionary period for the environment and the way americans drive.

 are our bodies solid or liquid? we all know the convention 
 - 
 that solids maintain their shapes, while liquids fill the containers they're in. but often in the real world, those lines are blurred. imagine walking on a beach. sometimes the sand gives way under feet, deforming like a liquid, but when enough sand grains pack together, they can support weight like a solid surface. 
 modeling these kinds of systems is notoriously difficult - but 
 zeb rocklin , an assistant professor in the 
 school of physics 
 at georgia tech, has written a new paper doing just that. 
 rocklin's study, "" rigidity percolation in a random tensegrity via analytic graph theory ,"" is published in the journal 
 proceedings of the national academy of sciences (pnas) . the results have the potential to impact fields spanning biology to engineering and nanotechnology, showing that these types of deformable solids offer a rare combination of durability and flexibility. 
 ""i'm very proud of our team, especially will and vishal, the two georgia tech undergraduates who co-led the study,"" 
 rocklin says. 
 the lead author, 
 william stephenson, 
 and co-author 
 vishal sudhakar 
 both completed their undergraduate studies at the institute during the time of this research. stephenson is now a first-year grad student at the university of michigan, ann arbor, and sudhakar has been admitted to georgia tech as a graduate student. additionally, co-author

 connecting the dots… with cables 
 imagine building molecules in chemistry class 
 - 
 large wooden spheres connected with sticks or rods. while many models use rods, including mathematical models, biological systems in real life are constructed of polymers, which function more like stretchy strings. 
 likewise, when creating mathematical or biological models, researchers frequently treat all the elements as rods as opposed to treating some of them as cables, or strings. but, ""there are tradeoffs between how mathematically tractable a model is and how physically plausible it is,"" rocklin says. ""physicists can have some beautiful mathematical theories, but they aren't always realistic.""  for example, a model using connective rods might not capture the dynamics that connective strings provide. ""with a string you can stretch it, and it'll fight you, but when you compress it, it collapses."" 
 ""but, in this study, we've extended the current theories,"" he says, adding cable-like elements. ""and that actually turns out to be incredibly difficult, because these theories use mathematical equations. 
 in contrast, the distance between the two ends of a cable is represented by an inequality, which is not an equation at all. so how do you create a mathematical theory when you aren't starting from equations? "" while a rod has a certain length in a mathematical equation, the ends of the string have to be represented as less than or equal to a certain length. 
 in this situation ""all the usual analytic theories completely break,"" rocklin says. ""it becomes very difficult for physicists or for mathematicians."" 
 ""the trick was to notice that these physical systems were logically equivalent to something called a directed graph,"" rocklin adds, ""where different modes of deformation are linked to each other in specific ways. this allows us to take a relatively complicated system and massively compress 
 it to a much smaller system. and when we did that, we were able to turn it into something that becomes extremely easy for the computer to do."" 
 from biology to engineering 
 rocklin's team found that when modeling with cables and springs, the target range changed - becoming softer, with a wider margin for error. ""that could be really important for something like a biological system, because a biological system is trying to stay close to that critical point,"" says rocklin. ""our model shows that the region around the critical point is actually much broader than what models that only used rods previously showed."" 
 rocklin also points out applications for engineers. for example, since rocklin's new theory suggests that even disordered cable structures can be strong and flexible, it may help engineers leverage cables as building materials to create safer, more durable bridges. the theory also provides a way to easily model these cable-based structures, to ensure their safety before they are built, and provide a way for engineers to iterate on designs. 
 rocklin also notes potential applications in nanotechnology. ""in nanotechnology, you must accept an increasing amount of disorder, because you can't just have a skilled worker actually go in and put segments there, and you can't have a conventional factory machine put segments there,"" rocklin says. 
 but biology has known how to lay down effective, but disordered, rod and cable structures for hundreds of millions of years. ""this is going to tell us what sorts of machines we can make with those disordered structures when we're getting to the point of being able to do what biology can do. and that's a possible future design principle for the engineers to explore, at very small scales, where we can't choose exactly where each cable goes,"" rocklin says. 
 ""our theory shows that with cables, we can maintain a combination of flexibility and strength with much less precision than you might otherwise need.""

early-bottlenecks-developing-biopharmaceutical-products-delay-commercialization.txt,"early bottlenecks in developing biopharmaceutical products delay commercialization 
 an analysis of patented university inventions licensed to biotechnology firms has revealed early bottlenecks on the path to commercialization. 
 from left to right, jerry thursby, matthew higgins and marie thursby. the research team identified bottlenecks in the development of biopharmaceutical products and proposes a way to avoid the setbacks. 
 aug 20, 2014 
 - atlanta, ga 
 an analysis of patented university inventions licensed to biotechnology firms has revealed early bottlenecks on the path to commercialization. to open these roadblocks, the researchers suggest that better communication of basic research results during the discovery stage could lead to faster commercialization down the road. biopharmaceutical drugs are frequently derived from discoveries made in university laboratories and licensed to biotechnology firms. bottlenecks are well known during clinical trials, which have a high failure rate. but a new study pinpoints how much time is lost earlier in the pathway, when biotech companies give up on an invention and transfer the technology to other biotech firms for repurposing in a new disease category. companies rarely share their basic research on an invention, which highlights what the researchers consider to be an underappreciated cost of commercialization as basic science research is then repeated, postponed, or never performed. ""the timeline for commercialization is much longer than most people think. there is so much turmoil and churn within the process,"" said co-author jerry thursby, a professor and the ernest scheller, jr. chair in innovation, entrepreneurship, and commercialization at the scheller college of business at the georgia institute of technology. the study was sponsored by the national institutes of health (nih) and was published august 20 in the journal 
 science translational medicine . the standard path to the marketplace for biotechnology is for universities to do most of the basic research and then license a discovery to a small biotechnology firm that advances the research. the small biotech firm will then sublicense the discovery to a large biotechnology firm that can afford to run clinical trials. the study found that basic research rarely proceeds in this straightforward path to commercialization, often zigzagging across biotech firms and research areas before a drug is finally developed. ""what these data reveal is that there's a lot of bench to bench translational research. it's not linear,"" said marie thursby, a study co-author and the hal and john smith chair in entrepreneurship at the scheller college of business. matthew higgins, an associate professor of strategic management, was also a co-author of the study. for the study, the researchers built a database of 835 patents in 342 university licenses with biotech firms. the researchers then traced the path of patents to document whether they were subsequently sublicensed to another firm for testing in a new disease category or whether the sublicense was to a large firm for clinical trials or marketing. sublicensing often resets the development timeline in what the authors refer to as bench-to-bench translational research. ""a very large fraction of the time, an invention pops out as something else and the timeline for the discovery stage starts all over again,"" said jerry thursby. of the 835 inventions studied, 27 percent appeared in a second license. the average time between invention and first license was five and a half years, and the average time between first- and second-license was three and a half years. this time span for the upstream phase of the translation process is substantial, the study says, given that the average time from discovery to approval of new drugs (including biologics) by the u.s. food and drug administration (fda) is 13 years. of the first-licenses that list a stage of development, 92 percent were either at the discovery or lead molecule stages (the earliest two stages, respectively), with only 6 percent listed in clinical trials. among the second-licenses, only 22 percent were in clinical trials or beyond. ""nobody knew the magnitude of how much licensing changes and the stages at which they change,"" said marie thursby. ""the biotechnology industry is quite fragmented, and there are all sorts of informational problems."" this analysis of early-stage biomedical translation suggests that stakeholders need to design policies and initiatives that enhance early translation by more efficiently driving more inventions into multiple disease pipelines. one option might be the formation of an open-source translational research database that complements clinicaltrials.gov, where patents and licenses for fundamental biomedical research believed to be destined for eventual therapeutic use initially would be logged and shared. ""what might be a failure to a biotech firm could be a success to society as a whole,"" jerry thursby said. this research is supported and based on three separate subcontracts with the office of science policy analysis, office of the director, national institutes of health, under award number hhsn26320100002ic. any conclusions or opinions are those of the authors and do not necessarily represent the official views of the sponsoring agency. citation : marie thursby, et al., ""bench-to-bench bottlenecks in translation.""

 the award-winning ece students include saad bin nasir, divya madapusi srinivas prasad, and william wahby. descriptions of their papers and their work follow. 
 saad bin nasir 
 won the top award in the power management session for his paper, ""hybrid linear regulator featuring switched model control with 6ns / 8.6ma response time and 98.64% current efficiency."" nasir works in the integrated circuits and systems research lab with ece associate professor arijit raychowdhury. 
 the research described in this paper brings together novel control techniques and their circuit implementations in hybrid linear regulators for digital load circuits. the principal aim of this research task is to demonstrate ultra low voltage linear regulators with high gain and bandwidth, taking advantage of digital topologies that have been previously developed by nasir and his fellow researchers. silicon measurements have demonstrated best-in-class response times and energy efficiencies. 
 parts of the ongoing research have been previously published in publications and conferences such as the 
 international solid state circuits conference , 
 journal of solid state circuits , and the 
 ieee transactions on power electronics , and the work has gained significant traction with src's member companies. 
 divya madapusi srinivas prasad 
 won the top honor in the interconnect / dielectric materials i session for her paper, ""interconnect technology optimization based on circuit performance of finfet cmos and beyond."" prasad works in the nanoelectronics research laboratory and is advised by ece associate professor azad naeemi. 
 this paper presents a paradigm shift in interconnect technology design to best serve state-of-the-art cmos transistors. the advent of multi-gate transistor technology (i.e. finfets) has offered a lower device resistance at the expense of a higher device capacitance, when compared with the traditional cmos planar technology. 
 this paper, for the first time, highlights the impact of this shift on the importance of interconnect resistance over interconnect capacitance and proposes a novel scaling regime for interconnects as compared to the one proposed by the international technology roadmap for semiconductors (itrs). this approach reduces the interconnect resistance, at the cost of increased interconnect capacitance, to enable an optimum circuit performance. 
 the proposed design-technology co-optimization has enabled the circuits that were chosen for the case study to run ~1.5x times faster in a best-case scenario. this paper also presents the first rigorous study on the impact of variability in interconnect dimensions on circuit performance at a gdsii-level for various patterning approaches and shows that the new interconnect scaling reduces the performance variability. 
 william wahby 
 won the top award in the packaging and 3d ic integration session for his paper, ""impact of alternate wiring materials on sequential monolithic 3dics."" wahby works in the integrated 3d systems group and is advised by ece professor muhannad bakir. 
 this work focuses on quantifying the impact of the use of tungsten (or other high-resistivity metals or alloys) as an on-chip wiring material in monolithic 3d ics. copper is unsuitable for use as an on-chip interconnect in serially-fabricated monolithic 3d ics for any logic tier below the topmost, as the fabrication of each logic tier exposes all lower tiers to temperatures far in excess of what copper interconnects can withstand. 
 through extensive modeling of 2d and 3d wiring networks, wahby was able to show that the use of high-resistivity metals in monolithic 3d ics typically increases the number of metal levels required for signal routing on each logic tier, which impacts the fabrication cost and performance of these systems.

 new research from georgia tech economist shatakshee dhongde shows there are multiple components of poverty that more accurately describes a household's economic condition.

 since social scientists and economists began measuring poverty, the definition has never strayed far from a discussion of income. 
 new research from georgia tech economist shatakshee dhongde shows there are multiple components of poverty that more accurately describes a household's economic condition. dhongde looks at ""deprivation"" more than simply low income, and her work finds that almost 15 percent of americans are deprived in multiple dimensions. 
 ""this study approaches poverty in a new way,"" said dhongde, who recently published ""multi-dimensional deprivation in the u.s."" in the journal ""social indicators research."" 
 ""we tried to identify what is missing in the literature on poverty, and measure deprivation in six dimensions: health, education, standard of living, security, social connections, and housing quality. when you look at deprivation in these dimensions, you have a better picture of what is really going on with households, especially in developed countries like the united states."" 
 co-authored with robert haveman of the university of wisconsin-madison, the study looks at deprivation in the u.s. since the onset of the great recession, roughly 2008 to 2013. the source data for the study came from the american community survey conducted by the u.s. census bureau. 
 dhongde's and haveman's analysis showed that while the official income-based poverty rate averaged 13.2 percent from 2008 to 2013, the multi-dimensional deprivation index averaged 14.9 percent. 
 ""lack of education, severe housing burden and lack of health insurance were some of the dimensions in which americans were most deprived in,"" dhongde said. ""even though deprivation did increase during the recession, it began to improve between 2010 and 2013."" 
 when placed side-by-side, the multi-dimensional deprivation index was a better reflection of the people's economic state than income alone, and the index was able to detect a more nuanced view of what might be driving people's dissatisfaction. 
 interestingly, the study showed that there was not much overlap between individuals who were income poor and those who were multi-dimensionally deprived. only 6.6 percent of the income poor were also deprived in multiple dimensions. 
 ""almost 30 percent of individuals with incomes s lightly above the poverty threshold experienced multiple deprivations,"" dhongde said. ""our analysis underscores the need to look beyond income based poverty statistics in order to fully realize the impact of the recession on individual's well-being."" 
 in order for a respondent to qualify as having multi-dimensional deprivation, he or she had to have more than one indicator of deprivation, such as lack of education and severe housing burden. 
 while research on deprivation has been growing in recent years in developing countries, this is the first time such an approach has been taken with poverty in the united states. in this country, the study found the greatest deprivation in education, housing and health insurance, and the greatest prevalence of deprivation was in the southern and western u.s. the study specifically cited asian and hispanic populations as experienced the the greatest prevalence of deprivation among ethnic groups. 
 ""from our analysis there are several policy recommendations that can be made,"" dhongde said. ""first, significant reduction of deprivation can be attained by implementing new policies related to health insurance coverage, such as through the affordable care act; improving high school completion rates, especially among hispanics; and constraining housing costs. by looking at a broader set of criteria than just income, policy decisions are clearer and solutions can be more easily identified.""

 - johns creek, ga 
 initially, the move to atlanta was only going to be a temporary one. but upon graduating in 1983 from the georgia institute of technology with a master's degree in electrical engineering, scott means accepted a position with nordson corp. in johns creek. more than three decades later, means has found career advancement, fulfillment, and professional growth at nordson, where he is currently a product manager. ""i was drawn to the size of the company,"" he said of his decision to join nordson after graduate school. ""it was exciting to me that i could get involved in separate areas of the company, wear many different hats, and have a lot of impact, immediately."" means, who has been awarded five design patents at nordson, is the georgia manufacturing extension partnership's (gamep) march face of manufacturing. manufacturing is second only to agriculture in terms of its impact on the georgia economy. the sector, comprised of about 10,000 manufacturers, employs more than 365,000 and has a total economic manufacturing output of $53 billion per year. means' story and that of others in gamep's ""faces"" series, shows just how important the industry is - not only to the state as a whole, but also in the difference it makes in local communities and the lives of people who work in manufacturing. at nordson - a global manufacturer of dispensing equipment for consumer and industrial adhesives, sealants, and coatings - means has held a number of different positions within the company, created new teams, and led departments. ""i get bored easily, so i knew i wanted to work at a company where i could get my hands on many different projects,"" he said. one of his first projects was to help develop an electrical engineering department. though nordson had a deep well of mechanical engineers, electrical engineers were a rarity. in fact, he was often referred to as ""ee no. 3"" because ""i was the third electrical engineer hired at the company and i was able to help develop the department from the ground up."" four years after working to build the department, which was the supporting group for nordson's corporate offices and its other divisions, means was tasked with leading the team. the team hit an important milestone when it fully developed its own control system - the model 2300 - that nordson was able to implement. ""the model 2300 allowed us to showcase our design capabilities, and we've been developing complete control systems in the electrical engineering group ever since."" following that success, means was tapped to build a new electrical team to serve an entirely new market the company began pursuing, non-woven applications. ""i learned a lot from starting a team, and it was energizing to be part of a new business venture that combined the disciplines of engineering, marketing, design, and research,"" means said. after successfully building out the team, means went back to the electrical engineering group. by then, his old group had grown to the point where there were as many electrical engineers as there were mechanical engineers in the company. means also reached out to his alma mater and began to hire georgia tech students in nordson's co-op program, creating a talent pipeline between the institute and the company. now, as product manager, he gets to mix his business skills and technical expertise, which serves him well when meeting the company's global clients. he also continues to work in design engineering in the development of new ideas and innovations for the company. as someone who thrives on new challenges, means has bucked the prevailing trend of americans in the workforce leaving one employer to obtain career advancement at another company.

 mcdonnell will be graduating with a b.s. in environmental engineering before moving to sierra leone. 
 elisabeth mcdonnell will be graduating in december with a b.s. in environmental engineering. 
 dec 08, 2020 
 - atlanta, ga 
 elisabeth mcdonnell, a fifth-year environmental engineering major from roswell, georgia, is just days away from graduating, but also from leaving the country for at least two years. in january, mcdonnell will be heading to sierra leone to work for a company called water4. with locations in more than a dozen african countries, water4 helps empower local communities to lead projects that bring them clean water. 
 this opportunity came from a partnership between water4 and georgia tech's campus christian fellowship (ccf). when mcdonnell arrives in sierra leone, she'll be helping to engineer solutions to bring clean water to various communities. but she'll also have a hand in creating an internship program specifically for georgia tech engineers who want to come do the same thing. she'll be overseeing three to four students at a time in their work with water4. 
 mcdonnell was initially drawn to environmental engineering by her love for animals, but a mission trip in high school set her on the clean water track. halfway through her stay in kenya, the compound she was living in experienced a water shortage. for the rest of their time there, she and her group had to walk three miles to get their water for the day. 
 ""i realized that for some people, this is what they do every single morning for their whole lives,"" mcdonnell said. ""that's when water sanitation came to the forefront of my mind."" 
 she feels confident that her degree program's emphasis on creativity and problem solving has equipped her with the skills necessary to tackle these problems. 
 ""all of the classes i've been in have encouraged ingenuity and creativity in solving problems in a way that's different than the status quo,"" she said. 
 mcdonnell also learned meaningful lessons outside of the classroom, most notably with the ramblin' reck club. since joining in her second semester at tech, mcdonnell has held multiple leadership positions within the organization, including traditions chair and vice president. to her, the reck club served as a way to show her georgia tech spirit, as well as a reminder of just how passionate her fellow students can be. 
 ""people in reck club remind you that you're blessed to have the opportunity to be stressed over the potential to achieve exceptional things,"" she said. 
 after graduation, mcdonnell will have no shortage of fond memories to look back on from her time at tech, including midnight bud, a finals de-stressing event on campus. at the end of her first semester, mcdonnell, who had never heard of midnight bud, was caught off guard one night by the sound of students singing georgia tech songs outside her dorm. she and her friend headed outside, barefoot and in pajamas, and ended up following the crowd all the way to the north avenue apartments - and having the time of their lives. 
 ""when i needed it most, i was reminded of how special georgia tech is,"" she said.

 researchers from the school of cse are using new nsf and facebook research grants to better understand uncertainty in that use time-series data to make predictions.

 - atlanta, ga 
 next-generation artificial intelligence (ai) models used in public health, iot, and other critical applications will soon be able to make better decisions and more accurate predictions thanks to a bit of philosophical wisdom being instilled in them at georgia tech. 
 school of computational science and engineering (cse)  researchers are using a new 3-year, $1.1 million national science foundation (nsf) medium grant to find ways of quantifying uncertainty in current ai models that use time-series data to make predictions. 
 from here, they hope to essentially teach the models what's known as the socratic paradox: ""i know that i know nothing."" 
 ""the key hurdle is that current deep learning neural models are poor at quantifying their uncertainty and are often overconfident in their predictions. quantifying uncertainty will allow a model to say, ‘i don't know,' when facing unknown or unexpected situations,"" said  b.   aditya   prakash , cse associate professor and co-principal investigator for the project. 
 because it doesn't recognize what it doesn't know, a current model may guess at answers and move forward as if it has guessed correctly. this is particularly problematic with time-series data - like public health monitoring and forecasting - where guesses and wrong answers can lead to lower levels of confidence in predictions generated by current-generation models. 
 prakash (left) and  chao   zhang  (right), cse assistant professor and lead pi, are working with co-pi  shuochao   yao  from george mason university to address these limitations. along with quantifying the amount of uncertainty, the team is working to better understand the types and sources of predictive uncertainty. 
 ""we need principled models which are flexible enough to model uncertainties from multiple sources in the datasets and also produce accurate predictions,"" zhang said. ""qualifying uncertainty will allow us to dynamically select a subset of models that are more reliable, which can improve the efficiency of the system and decisions at run time."" 
 because so much depends on specific tasks and data, the researchers say it's difficult to provide accurate estimates of efficiency improvements based on their novel approach. preliminary results in disease forecasting, however, indicate the team's new models, algorithms, and techniques can outperform previous state-of-the-art models up to 2.5x in accuracy and 2.4x in reliability. 
 the techniques and tools emerging from this project, formally titled  collaborative research: principled uncertainty quantification in deep learning models for time series analysis (nsf award #   2106961) , will be open source, and the research findings will be integrated into existing courses, tutorials, and workshops. 
 facebook research award 
 prakash and zhang are taking another tack as well to improve the current state of predictive modeling. 
 the pair recently earned a  facebook 2021 statistics for improving insights, models, and decisions  research award. their proposal,  non-parametric methods for calibrated hierarchical time-series forecasting , was one of 10 winners recently announced by facebook research. 
 according to the team, nonparametric statistical methods can be very flexible and effective for modeling time-series data when there are many unknowns in a dataset. generally speaking, this is because nonparametric tools analyze group medians rather than group means. as a result, scientists can better understand outliers and can use them to strengthen. 
 ""our goal is to develop principled end-to-end models that incorporate hierarchical constraints and behaviors. we will also incorporate signals from different views such as demographics signals, time-series signals, and mechanistic models, to let them mutually reinforce each other to make the models more accurate, reliable, and robust,"" said zhang. 
 once the project is complete, the results of the research will be used to improve predictive modeling in healthcare, public health, and a variety of industrial applications. 
 ""for example,"" said prakash, ""facebook can use this technique to forecast demands in their data centers in different geographic regions. this will give them lead time to make their infrastructure more robust and efficient.""

 in emergencies, people may trust robots too much, a new study has found. 
 georgia tech researchers built the ""rescue robot"" to determine whether or not building occupants would trust a robot designed to help them evacuate a high-rise in case of fire or other emergency. (credit: rob felt, georgia tech)

 - atlanta, ga 
 in emergencies, people may trust robots too much for their own safety, a new study suggests. in a mock building fire, test subjects followed instructions from an ""emergency guide robot"" even after the machine had proven itself unreliable - and after some participants were told that robot had broken down. the research was designed to determine whether or not building occupants would trust a robot designed to help them evacuate a high-rise in case of fire or other emergency. but the researchers were surprised to find that the test subjects followed the robot's instructions - even when the machine's behavior should not have inspired trust. the research, believed to be the first to study human-robot trust in an emergency situation, is scheduled to be presented march 9 at the 2016 acm / ieee international conference on human-robot interaction (hri 2016) in christchurch, new zealand. ""people seem to believe that these robotic systems know more about the world than they really do, and that they would never make mistakes or have any kind of fault,"" said alan wagner, a senior research engineer in the 
 georgia tech research institute 
 (gtri). ""in our studies, test subjects followed the robot's directions even to the point where it might have put them in danger had this been a real emergency."" in the study, sponsored in part by the air force office of scientific research (afosr), the researchers recruited a group of 42 volunteers, most of them college students, and asked them to follow a brightly colored robot that had the words ""emergency guide robot"" on its side. the robot led the study subjects to a conference room, where they were asked to complete a survey about robots and read an unrelated magazine article. the subjects were not told the true nature of the research project. in some cases, the robot - which was controlled by a hidden researcher - led the volunteers into the wrong room and traveled around in a circle twice before entering the conference room. for several test subjects, the robot stopped moving, and an experimenter told the subjects that the robot had broken down. once the subjects were in the conference room with the door closed, the hallway through which the participants had entered the building was filled with artificial smoke, which set off a smoke alarm. when the test subjects opened the conference room door, they saw the smoke - and the robot, which was then brightly-lit with red leds and white ""arms"" that served as pointers. the robot directed the subjects to an exit in the back of the building instead of toward the doorway - marked with exit signs - that had been used to enter the building. ""we expected that if the robot had proven itself untrustworthy in guiding them to the conference room, that people wouldn't follow it during the simulated emergency,"" said paul robinette, a gtri research engineer who conducted the study as part of his doctoral dissertation. ""instead, all of the volunteers followed the robot's instructions, no matter how well it had performed previously. we absolutely didn't expect this."" the researchers surmise that in the scenario they studied, the robot may have become an ""authority figure"" that the test subjects were more likely to trust in the time pressure of an emergency. in simulation-based research done without a realistic emergency scenario, test subjects did not trust a robot that had previously made mistakes. ""these are just the type of human-robot experiments that we as roboticists should be investigating,"" said 
 ayanna howard , professor and linda j. and mark c. smith chair in the georgia tech 
 school of electrical and computer engineering . ""we need to ensure that our robots, when placed in situations that evoke trust, are also designed to mitigate that trust when trust is detrimental to the human."" only when the robot made obvious errors during the emergency part of the experiment did the participants question its directions. in those cases, some subjects still followed the robot's instructions even when it directed them toward a darkened room that was blocked by furniture. 
 in future research, the scientists hope to learn more about why the test subjects trusted the robot, whether that response differs by education level or demographics, and how the robots themselves might indicate the level of trust that should be given to them. the research is part of a long-term study of how humans trust robots, an important issue as robots play a greater role in society. the researchers envision using groups of robots stationed in high-rise buildings to point occupants toward exits and urge them to evacuate during emergencies. research has shown that people often don't leave buildings when fire alarms sound, and that they sometimes ignore nearby emergency exits in favor of more familiar building entrances. but in light of these findings, the researchers are reconsidering the questions they should ask. ""we wanted to ask the question about whether people would be willing to trust these rescue robots,"" said wagner. ""a more important question now might be to ask how to prevent them from trusting these robots too much."" beyond emergency situations, there are other issues of trust in human-robot relationships, said robinette. ""would people trust a hamburger-making robot to provide them with food?"" he asked. ""if a robot carried a sign saying it was a ‘child-care robot,' would people leave their babies with it? will people put their children into an autonomous vehicle and trust it to take them to grandma's house? we don't know why people trust or don't trust machines."" in addition to those already mentioned, the research included wenchen li and robert allen, graduate research assistants in georgia tech's college of computing.the researchers would like to thank larry labbe and the georgia tech fire safety office for their support during this research. support for this research was provided by the linda j. and mark c. smith chair in bioengineering, and the air force office of scientific research (afosr) under contract fa9550-13-1-0169. any opinions, findings, and conclusions or recommendations expressed in this material are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of the afosr. citation : paul robinette, wenchen li, robert allen, ayanna m. howard and alan r. wagner, ""overtrust of robots in emergency evacuation scenarios,"" (2016 acm / ieee international conference on human-robot interaction) (hri 2016). research news georgia institute of technology 177 north avenue atlanta, georgia 30332-0181 usa media relations contact : john toon (404-894-6986) ( jtoon@gatech.edu ). writer : john toon

 baratunde cola would like to put sand into your computer. not beach sand, but silicon dioxide nanoparticles coated with a high dielectric constant polymer to inexpensively provide improved cooling for increasingly power-hungry electronic devices. the silicon dioxide doesn't do the cooling itself. instead, the unique surface properties of the coated nanoscale material conduct the heat at potentially higher efficiency than existing heat sink materials. the theoretical physics behind the phenomenon is complicated, involving nanoscale electromagnetic effects created on the surface of the tiny silicon dioxide particles acting together. the bottom line could be a potentially new class of high thermal conductivity materials useful for heat dissipation from power electronics, leds and other applications with high heat fluxes. ""we have shown for the first time that you can take a packed nanoparticle bed that would typically act as an insulator, and by causing light to couple strongly into the material by engineering a high dielectric constant medium like water or ethylene glycol at the surfaces, you can turn the nanoparticle bed into a conductor,"" said cola, an associate professor in the 
 george w. woodruff school of mechanical engineering 
 at the georgia institute of technology. ""using the collective surface electromagnetic effect of the nanoparticles, the thermal conductivity can increase 20-fold, allowing it to dissipate heat."" the research, which involved both theory and experiment, has been published online in the journal 
 materials horizons , and was highlighted in the july 8 issue of the journal 
 science . the work was supported by the air force research laboratory and the u.s. air force. co-authors include professor james hammonds at howard university, and graduate students eric tervo from georgia tech and olalekan adewuyi from howard university. in the last several years, theoretical papers have predicted the ability of surface phonon polaritons to increase thermal conduction in nanomaterials made from polar materials like silicon dioxide. polaritons are quantum quasiparticles produced by strong coupling of electromagnetic waves with an electric or magnetic dipole-carrying excitation. in the specific case of surface phonon polaritons, the electromagnetic waves are coupled to a certain frequency and polarization of vibrating atoms in the material known as optical phonons. when materials are reduced to sizes below 100 nanometers, the surface properties of the material dominate over bulk properties, allowing phonons of heat to flow from particle to particle in the closely packed bed with the assistance of the coupled electromagnetic waves. although researchers could not previously measure heat flow from surface phonon polaritons due to experimental difficulties, they have observed their wave propagation when light hits the surface of a nanostructure material, suggesting a potential role in heat dissipation. in addition to the first measurement of heat flow, cola and his collaborators also found that the effect can occur when thermal energy is added to a packed bed of nanoparticles. ""what we are also showing for the first time is that when you have nanoparticles of the right type in a packed bed, that you don't have to shine light on them,"" he explained. ""you can just heat up the nanoparticles and the thermal self-emission activates the effect. you create an electrical field around the nanoparticles from this thermal radiation."" the researchers decided to experiment with those special properties, first using water to coat the nanoparticles and turn the silicon dioxide nanoparticle bed into a conductor. but the water coating was not robust, so the researchers switched to ethylene glycol, a fluid commonly used in vehicle antifreeze. the new combination increased the heat transfer by a factor of 20 to approximately one watt per meter-kelvin, which is higher than the value ethylene glycol or silicon dioxide nanoparticles could produce alone, and competitive with expensive polymer composites used for heat dissipation. ""you could basically take an electronic device, pack these ethylene glycol-coated nanoparticles in the air space, and it would be useful as a heat dissipation material that at the same time, won't conduct electricity,"" said cola. ""the material has the potential to be very inexpensive and easy to work with."" silicon dioxide was chosen because its crystalline lattice can generate resonant optical phonons - necessary for the effect - at approximately room temperature. other materials could also be used, but the silicon dioxide nanoparticles provide a good compromise of properties and cost. ""the resonance frequency, converted into the thermal radiation temperature for silicon dioxide, is around 50 degrees celsius,"" said cola. ""with this material, we can turn on this effect at a temperature range that a microelectronic device is likely to see."" though the ethylene glycol works well, it will eventually evaporate. for that reason, cola plans to identify polymeric materials that could be adsorbed to the silicon dioxide nanoparticles to provide a more stable coating with a reasonable product lifetime. the effect depends on the collective action of the silicon dioxide nanoparticles. ""we are basically showing a macroscopic translation of a nanoscale effect,"" cola said. ""even though the nanoparticle bed is a bulk assembly, it is a bulk assembly that has a lot of internal surface area. the internal surface area is the gateway by which it interacts with the electromagnetic field - the light and the heat."" so far, the effect has been demonstrated in small amounts of silicon dioxide nanoparticles. another step would be to scale up the study to demonstrate that heat can be transferred longer distances in larger volumes of the material, cola said. ""the rate at which the thermal energy goes from one side of the particle to the other side of the particle is constant throughout the nanoparticle bed, so it shouldn't matter how thick the nanoparticle bed is,"" he explained. ""when these particles are close enough together, their modes are coupled, which allows the energy to transport."" further testing would be needed to ensure the long-term efficiency and to confirm that there are no impacts on the reliability of the electronic devices cooled with the technique, cola said. this work was supported by the u.s. air force research laboratory minority leaders program contract fa8650-11-d-5800 through a subcontract from united technologies corporation. support is acknowledged from u.s. air force summer faculty fellowships. any opinions, findings, and conclusions or recommendations expressed in this material are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the views of the sponsoring agencies. citation : e.j. tervo, et al., ""high thermal conductivity in polaritonic sio2 nanoparticle beds, (materials horizons, 2016).

 with the new machine, feeding times can be set for different intervals every day. this encourages the gorillas' natural feeding behavior, giving them additional random foraging opportunities throughout the day. 
 ""this is a great example of how technology can positively influence animal welfare,"" says david hu, faculty advisor of the project.

 the national science foundation (nsf) has awarded nearly $20 million to a consortium of universities to support a new engineering research center (erc) that will work closely with industry and clinical partners to develop transformative tools and technologies for the consistent, scalable and low-cost production of high-quality living therapeutic cells. such cells could be used in a broad range of life-saving medical therapies now emerging from research laboratories. 
 led by the georgia institute of technology, the nsf engineering research center for cell manufacturing technologies (cmat) could help revolutionize the treatment of cancer, heart disease, autoimmune diseases and other disorders by enabling broad use of potentially curative therapies that utilize living cells - such as immune cells and stem cells - as ""drugs."" examples of these highly promising therapies include t cell-based immunotherapies for blood cancers, such as the one developed at the university of pennsylvania and approved in august by the u.s. food & drug administration, and a gene-modified stem cell therapy recently approved in europe for a form of the so-called ""bubble boy"" syndrome. 
 to facilitate the widespread application of these cutting-edge emerging treatments, cmat will develop robust and scalable technologies, innovative analytical tools, and engineering systems that will enable industry and clinical facilities to reproducibly manufacture efficient, safe and affordable cell-therapy products. the center, one of four ercs announced september 12 by the nsf, will also develop improved models for a robust supply chain, storage and distribution system for these therapeutic cell products. 
 ""for over 30 years, 
 nsf engineering research centers 
 have promoted innovation, helped to maintain our competitive edge, and added billions of dollars to the u.s. economy,"" said nsf director 
 france córdova . ""they bring together talented innovators and entrepreneurs with resources from academia, industry and government to produce engineers and engineering systems that solve real-world problems.  i am confident that these new ercs will strengthen u.s. competitiveness for the next generation and continue our legacy of improving the quality of life for all americans."" 
 in addition to the consistent manufacture of  cell-based therapies, the public-private cmat initiative will also help develop a skilled, diverse and inclusive bio-manufacturing workforce through extensive education and training activities at the k-12, technical college, undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral levels. 
 living cells become ""drugs"" 
 ""unlike pharmaceuticals and other products now used in medical treatments, cells are living entities whose properties can significantly change depending on nuances in the way they are grown, stored or otherwise manipulated,"" said 
 krishnendu roy , director of cmat and the robert a. milton chair professor in the 
 wallace h. coulter department of biomedical engineering 
 at georgia tech and emory university. ""the center will develop new engineering tools and scalable methods to better characterize, expand, differentiate, separate, transport and store high-quality cells so they provide consistent therapeutic effects, allowing them to be used in standardized therapies by clinicians to serve large numbers of patients worldwide."" 
 beyond georgia tech, the center will include major partners - the university of georgia, the university of wisconsin-madison and the university of puerto rico, mayaguez campus - as well as affiliate partners such as the university of pennsylvania, emory university, the gladstone institutes and michigan technological university. additional international academic partners, as well as industry and the u.s. national laboratories, will also be critical collaborators in the effort. 
 moving discoveries into application 
 ""georgia tech has a long history of building collaborative partnerships with industry, the national labs and other research universities. with the support of the nsf and this new erc, we will be able to capitalize on expertise in multiple areas, taking transformative research from the laboratory to practice much more quickly,"" said georgia tech president g. p. ""bud"" peterson. ""the center for cell manufacturing technologies will also help us educate, train and prepare the workforce in a new industry, thereby continuing to strengthen the u.s. economy."" 
 clinical trials have already established the effectiveness of several cell-based therapies and many other trials are underway. but for these exciting therapies to advance into broad healthcare use, the cells will have to be produced in much larger quantities and with more consistent quality than is now available. there are also very few, if any, established industry standards for analytics and processes in cell manufacturing, which hinders consistent production of safe and efficacious cells. another key limitation identified by industry is the need for a highly-trained workforce. 
 cmat would address these barriers through transformative innovations that build upon a series of earlier efforts, including the 
 national cell manufacturing consortium 
 (ncmc) roadmap, infrastructure established at georgia tech with support from the marcus foundation, quality and other standards programs from the national institute of standards and technology (nist) and independent industry-led bodies, and translational activities by industry, entrepreneurs and other partners. 
 the nsf's multidisciplinary engineering research centers address unique, complex engineering challenges by stimulating knowledge and tech transfer between different sectors, from electronics to energy to infrastructure. each center takes on a specific engineering research challenge. 
 ""the overall goal of the nsf engineering research centers program is nothing less than to revolutionize engineering research and education in the united states,"" said dawn tilbury, nsf assistant director for engineering. ""we look forward to the exciting advances and outcomes in these important areas."" 
 accelerating clinical trials 
 beyond established cell-based therapies, the work of cmat should accelerate the development of new therapies and the testing needed to bring them into the clinic, said 
 steven stice , director of the university of georgia's 
 regenerative bioscience center 
 (rbc). regenerative medicine applications could offer new ways of treating diseases for which there are now essentially no treatments, including parkinson's, alzheimer's, heart disease and stroke. 
 ""there are a significant number of cell therapy clinical trials and investments in the field,"" stice said. ""but there is little or no investment in a set of consistent standardization methods to optimize how these therapies should work. for instance, we know that cell therapies will improve human health, but right now it's difficult to guarantee that each dose produced will be as potent as the next. the work done by cmat researchers will help solve some of these problems."" 
 the university of pennsylvania develops cellular therapies and has conducted more than 40 clinical trials of cell-based therapies, including those for engineered t cell therapies and chimeric antigen receptor (car) t cells. an example is recently-approved treatment for relapsed and refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia in pediatric and young adult patients. 
 ""the cell and gene therapy fields are on the cusp of multiple regulatory approvals in the near term,"" said 
 bruce levine , barbara and edward netter professor in cancer gene therapy in the perelman school of medicine at the 
 university of pennsylvania . ""the challenges ahead lie in developing manufacturing and testing processes incorporating automation that can bring costs down and allow access to more patients."" 
 developing broad-based innovations 
 critical innovations often occur at the boundaries of disciplines, and cmat will bring together relevant specialties for both research and workforce development, noted 
 madeline torres-lugo , a professor in the department of chemical engineering at the university of puerto rico, mayaguez campus. 
 ""due to the complexity of cells as living organisms, a team with a strong background in biology, chemistry, physics, materials science, and engineering is required for this initiative,"" torres-lugo said. ""our participation and contribution to cmat will ensure that puerto rico not only remains at the forefront of pharma manufacturing, but also supports cell manufacturing technologies here and around the world by educating highly talented engineering students."" 
 cmat testbeds have been selected to address several cell types that are in early stages of clinical adoption or moving toward clinical applications, but it isn't yet clear what cell types will have the greatest therapeutic impacts, noted 
 sean palecek , the milton j. and a. maude shoemaker professor in chemical and biological engineering at the 
 university of wisconsin-madison . therefore, one of the center's challenges will be to ensure that fundamental discoveries, and tool and technology development efforts, will apply to multiple cell types. 
 ""our work will provide safer and more potent cell products that will allow clinical studies to establish the effectiveness of these cells as therapeutics,"" palecek said. ""in addition, our work on scaling cell production will enable manufacturing of sufficient numbers of cells to replace damaged organs, such as the loss of heart muscle after a heart attack, at a cost that makes these therapies accessible to broad segments of society. we will also train the future leaders of the emerging therapeutic cell manufacturing industry. these students and their work establishing this industry will be the most significant impact of cmat."" 
 new centers among 19 ercs 
 since the program's inception in 1985, nsf has funded a total of 74 ercs and will support 19 in this fiscal year, including four new centers. each center receives nsf funding for up to 10 years. during this time, centers build partnerships with industry, universities and other government agencies that will sustain them for years to come. 
 in may, the national academies published a report, ""a new vision for center-based engineering research,"" which was the result of an nsf-funded study to examine the future of the nsf erc program. 
 the report identifies and recommends strategies to enable nsf multidisciplinary engineering research centers to continue addressing key research, education and innovation needs of the united states in a changing global context. 
 ""ercs are widely known as outstanding examples of successful partnerships between universities, private industry and government that have made significant contributions to address national challenges,"" said don millard, acting division director for the nsf division of engineering education and centers. ""we are continually working with the scientific and engineering communities, as well as private industry and government partners, to ensure nsf-funded centers and grantees are best-equipped to match societal needs with research abilities.""

 the national science foundation (nsf) has awarded nearly $20 million to a consortium of universities to support a new engineering research center (erc) that will work closely with industry and clinical partners to develop transformative tools and technologies for the consistent, scalable and low-cost production of high-quality living therapeutic cells. such cells could be used in a broad range of life-saving medical therapies now emerging from research laboratories. 
 led by the georgia institute of technology, the nsf engineering research center for cell manufacturing technologies (cmat) could help revolutionize the treatment of cancer, heart disease, autoimmune diseases and other disorders by enabling broad use of potentially curative therapies that utilize living cells - such as immune cells and stem cells - as ""drugs."" examples of these highly promising therapies include t cell-based immunotherapies for blood cancers, such as the one developed at the university of pennsylvania and approved in august by the u.s. food & drug administration, and a gene-modified stem cell therapy recently approved in europe for a form of the so-called ""bubble boy"" syndrome. 
 to facilitate the widespread application of these cutting-edge emerging treatments, cmat will develop robust and scalable technologies, innovative analytical tools, and engineering systems that will enable industry and clinical facilities to reproducibly manufacture efficient, safe and affordable cell-therapy products. the center, one of four ercs announced september 12 by the nsf, will also develop improved models for a robust supply chain, storage and distribution system for these therapeutic cell products. 
 ""for over 30 years, 
 nsf engineering research centers 
 have promoted innovation, helped to maintain our competitive edge, and added billions of dollars to the u.s. economy,"" said nsf director 
 france córdova . ""they bring together talented innovators and entrepreneurs with resources from academia, industry and government to produce engineers and engineering systems that solve real-world problems.  i am confident that these new ercs will strengthen u.s. competitiveness for the next generation and continue our legacy of improving the quality of life for all americans."" 
 in addition to the consistent manufacture of  cell-based therapies, the public-private cmat initiative will also help develop a skilled, diverse and inclusive bio-manufacturing workforce through extensive education and training activities at the k-12, technical college, undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral levels. 
 living cells become ""drugs"" 
 ""unlike pharmaceuticals and other products now used in medical treatments, cells are living entities whose properties can significantly change depending on nuances in the way they are grown, stored or otherwise manipulated,"" said 
 krishnendu roy , director of cmat and the robert a. milton chair professor in the 
 wallace h. coulter department of biomedical engineering 
 at georgia tech and emory university. ""the center will develop new engineering tools and scalable methods to better characterize, expand, differentiate, separate, transport and store high-quality cells so they provide consistent therapeutic effects, allowing them to be used in standardized therapies by clinicians to serve large numbers of patients worldwide."" 
 beyond georgia tech, the center will include major partners - the university of georgia, the university of wisconsin-madison and the university of puerto rico, mayaguez campus - as well as affiliate partners such as the university of pennsylvania, emory university, the gladstone institutes and michigan technological university. additional international academic partners, as well as industry and the u.s. national laboratories, will also be critical collaborators in the effort. 
 moving discoveries into application 
 ""georgia tech has a long history of building collaborative partnerships with industry, the national labs and other research universities. with the support of the nsf and this new erc, we will be able to capitalize on expertise in multiple areas, taking transformative research from the laboratory to practice much more quickly,"" said georgia tech president g. p. ""bud"" peterson. ""the center for cell manufacturing technologies will also help us educate, train and prepare the workforce in a new industry, thereby continuing to strengthen the u.s. economy."" 
 clinical trials have already established the effectiveness of several cell-based therapies and many other trials are underway. but for these exciting therapies to advance into broad healthcare use, the cells will have to be produced in much larger quantities and with more consistent quality than is now available. there are also very few, if any, established industry standards for analytics and processes in cell manufacturing, which hinders consistent production of safe and efficacious cells. another key limitation identified by industry is the need for a highly-trained workforce. 
 cmat would address these barriers through transformative innovations that build upon a series of earlier efforts, including the 
 national cell manufacturing consortium 
 (ncmc) roadmap, infrastructure established at georgia tech with support from the marcus foundation, quality and other standards programs from the national institute of standards and technology (nist) and independent industry-led bodies, and translational activities by industry, entrepreneurs and other partners. 
 the nsf's multidisciplinary engineering research centers address unique, complex engineering challenges by stimulating knowledge and tech transfer between different sectors, from electronics to energy to infrastructure. each center takes on a specific engineering research challenge. 
 ""the overall goal of the nsf engineering research centers program is nothing less than to revolutionize engineering research and education in the united states,"" said dawn tilbury, nsf assistant director for engineering. ""we look forward to the exciting advances and outcomes in these important areas."" 
 accelerating clinical trials 
 beyond established cell-based therapies, the work of cmat should accelerate the development of new therapies and the testing needed to bring them into the clinic, said 
 steven stice , director of the university of georgia's 
 regenerative bioscience center 
 (rbc). regenerative medicine applications could offer new ways of treating diseases for which there are now essentially no treatments, including parkinson's, alzheimer's, heart disease and stroke. 
 ""there are a significant number of cell therapy clinical trials and investments in the field,"" stice said. ""but there is little or no investment in a set of consistent standardization methods to optimize how these therapies should work. for instance, we know that cell therapies will improve human health, but right now it's difficult to guarantee that each dose produced will be as potent as the next. the work done by cmat researchers will help solve some of these problems."" 
 the university of pennsylvania develops cellular therapies and has conducted more than 40 clinical trials of cell-based therapies, including those for engineered t cell therapies and chimeric antigen receptor (car) t cells. an example is recently-approved treatment for relapsed and refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia in pediatric and young adult patients. 
 ""the cell and gene therapy fields are on the cusp of multiple regulatory approvals in the near term,"" said 
 bruce levine , barbara and edward netter professor in cancer gene therapy in the perelman school of medicine at the 
 university of pennsylvania . ""the challenges ahead lie in developing manufacturing and testing processes incorporating automation that can bring costs down and allow access to more patients."" 
 developing broad-based innovations 
 critical innovations often occur at the boundaries of disciplines, and cmat will bring together relevant specialties for both research and workforce development, noted 
 madeline torres-lugo , a professor in the department of chemical engineering at the university of puerto rico, mayaguez campus. 
 ""due to the complexity of cells as living organisms, a team with a strong background in biology, chemistry, physics, materials science, and engineering is required for this initiative,"" torres-lugo said. ""our participation and contribution to cmat will ensure that puerto rico not only remains at the forefront of pharma manufacturing, but also supports cell manufacturing technologies here and around the world by educating highly talented engineering students."" 
 cmat testbeds have been selected to address several cell types that are in early stages of clinical adoption or moving toward clinical applications, but it isn't yet clear what cell types will have the greatest therapeutic impacts, noted 
 sean palecek , the milton j. and a. maude shoemaker professor in chemical and biological engineering at the 
 university of wisconsin-madison . therefore, one of the center's challenges will be to ensure that fundamental discoveries, and tool and technology development efforts, will apply to multiple cell types. 
 ""our work will provide safer and more potent cell products that will allow clinical studies to establish the effectiveness of these cells as therapeutics,"" palecek said. ""in addition, our work on scaling cell production will enable manufacturing of sufficient numbers of cells to replace damaged organs, such as the loss of heart muscle after a heart attack, at a cost that makes these therapies accessible to broad segments of society. we will also train the future leaders of the emerging therapeutic cell manufacturing industry. these students and their work establishing this industry will be the most significant impact of cmat."" 
 new centers among 19 ercs 
 since the program's inception in 1985, nsf has funded a total of 74 ercs and will support 19 in this fiscal year, including four new centers. each center receives nsf funding for up to 10 years. during this time, centers build partnerships with industry, universities and other government agencies that will sustain them for years to come. 
 in may, the national academies published a report, ""a new vision for center-based engineering research,"" which was the result of an nsf-funded study to examine the future of the nsf erc program. 
 the report identifies and recommends strategies to enable nsf multidisciplinary engineering research centers to continue addressing key research, education and innovation needs of the united states in a changing global context. 
 ""ercs are widely known as outstanding examples of successful partnerships between universities, private industry and government that have made significant contributions to address national challenges,"" said don millard, acting division director for the nsf division of engineering education and centers. ""we are continually working with the scientific and engineering communities, as well as private industry and government partners, to ensure nsf-funded centers and grantees are best-equipped to match societal needs with research abilities.""

 not many businesspeople could lay claim to having launched their first business - while still in grammar school. but at 10 years of age, mark sauer convinced his dad to help him finance the acquisition of a tractor, so that he could start a lawn mowing business in his hometown of schoolcraft, michigan, a small farming community located 150 miles west of detroit. ""it was my first experience to understand what financing equipment was like, and i had borrowed money to buy a mowing tractor and was very active in the community, mowing as many yards as i could during the summers and going well into fall,"" sauer said. ""that was my first foray into small business ownership and being an entrepreneur."" today, sauer is still in the farm equipment business, though his customer base has expanded quite a bit from the days of mowing neighbors' lawns. as owner and president of savannah global solutions, sauer leads a 30-person company that makes equipment used in the forestry and agricultural industries in soil and site preparation work. savannah global has customers in more than 30 countries around the world. sauer is the georgia manufacturing extension partnership's (gamep) june face of manufacturing. he is one of more than 365,000 men and women who form georgia's manufacturing industry, a key segment of the state's economy. sauer's life and career in manufacturing serves as just one example of how those in the industry play an integral part in helping to keep their local communities and the state overall economically competitive. though tests he took as young man suggested he would be great at a career in forestry, the harsh winters of the midwest had him considering other possibilities and interests. having an aptitude for math and science, sauer focused his energies on industrial engineering and mathematics, earning degrees in both from western michigan university. but he also had a love for machines. it was a discovery made in high school when he worked in a machine shop. he found that he liked to imagine parts, draw them on paper, and then make a physical product. that job, as well as others he subsequently held, allowed him to develop the skills he would need to run his company. besides working as a machinist's apprentice, sauer also took positions as a millwright assistant, worked at an industrial paint company in payroll and estimating, and assisted on a preventative maintenance plan. he also learned about supervising processes and startup teams in a position he took at a cereal manufacturer upon graduating college. ""every job i've had gave me the experience to get me to where i am today,"" sauer said. several companies later, sauer had an opportunity to take a management position with a small forestry firm just outside savannah. ""it was clear i was going to have to wear a lot of hats,"" sauer said, explaining the company only had 10 employees at the time. ""my experience in engineering, sales, and process and product management, coupled with my background in manufacturing, the paper industry, and growing up on a farm made the job at savannah forestry equipment a perfect fit."" two years later, the owner of the company, a native australian, expressed a desire to return home, and sauer saw it as an opportunity to put an investment team together to purchase the firm. after the acquisition, sauer decided to expand and diversify the company to better address the cyclical issues of the forestry industry. the company fulfilled customized project orders and designed parts both on-site and in the field. he also changed the company's name to savannah global solutions to reflect its strategy of building an international customer base. that strategy was key, sauer said, explaining 95 percent of the company's business was in the southeast. a self-described calculated risk taker, sauer felt certain it was a gamble that would pay off: the firm now sells 50 percent of its products to overseas customers in more than 30 countries. that success has led to recognition for the company and its impact on the state economy. in 2014, savannah global solutions was named georgia small exporter of the year. ""as a kid, my domain was two miles on a lawnmower,"" sauer said. ""today, it's the entire world."" about savannah global solutions based in pembroke, georgia, savannah global solutions employs 30 people and is a leader in the forestry cultivation industry. originally founded as savannah forestry equipment, the company manufactures equipment to address soil and site preparation needs in forestry and agriculture. located on the i-16 corridor 30 miles west of savannah, the company has easy access to the port of savannah, which helps to support the growth of its exporting business, with sales in more than 30 countries across four continents. about the faces of manufacturing  each month, gamep highlights a different person as the face of manufacturing. selections are made by a committee composed of representatives from georgia tech, economic development groups, manufacturing companies, and related associations.

 researchers at the georgia institute of technology have received a $900,000 grant from the u.s. air force office of scientific research (afosr) to study the unusual chemical and physical properties of atoms and molecules at ultra-cold temperatures approaching absolute zero - the temperature at which all thermal activity stops. developing and employing advanced computational methodologies, they will explore the formation of novel types of molecular aggregates at these extreme conditions, where quantum mechanical principles govern and dramatically alter the ways that atoms and molecules interact. the work could help provide a better understanding of the reaction processes underlying strongly correlated atoms and molecular quantum systems in conditions unlike those seen in conventional chemistry. ""bringing atoms together to make a new material is the basis of chemistry, but here we are synthesizing new materials through quantum mechanical forces,"" said 
 uzi landman , a regent's and institute professor and callaway chair professor in the georgia tech 
 school of physics . ""we expect to help lay the foundation for a new theory describing the chemistry of ultra-cold atoms. to do this, we will develop a different type of computational theory."" absolute zero is the temperature at which all thermal activity stops. the researchers will be studying matter at ultra-cold temperatures, which are in the micro-kelvin or nano-kelvin ranges closely approaching that level. at these extremely low temperatures, atoms and molecules move much more slowly and have different kinds of interactions. these atoms and molecules interact via their wave nature, with interference between waves either destroying or amplifying one another. at these ultra-cold temperatures, the wave nature of matter also changes. for instance, the size of the de broglie wavelength is inversely proportional to the square of the temperature, meaning wavelengths become larger as the temperature drops. ""the wavelength of a particle, say a lithium atom, taken from room temperature to one nano-kelvin, grows by a factor of about 600,000, from about 0.04 nanometers at room temperature to 24,000 nanometers (24 microns) at the lower temperature - which is a very dramatic change,"" landman explained. in conventional chemistry, activation barriers must be overcome before atoms can exchange electrons to bind together. because they have so little energy at ultra-cold temperatures, atoms cannot overcome this activation barrier, meaning interactions must occur through other mechanisms - including quantum tunneling effects. and at these conditions, quantum mechanical effects become more pronounced, with the long-distance entanglement of atoms affecting the physical and chemical states of the matter. ""these are pure and deep quantum mechanical objects, and they exist only at these low temperatures because the wave effect takes over,"" noted landman, who is also director of the georgia tech center for computational materials science (ccms). at georgia tech, landman's group will study first the activity of small numbers of atoms and molecules - a phenomenon that ccms senior research scientist constantine yannouleas calls ""few-body interactions."" the calculations will begin with just two atoms and build into larger groups of atoms and molecules. ""one of the things that is most interesting to us is how smaller systems combine to make larger systems,"" landman added. ""we will study this from the bottom up."" the ultra-cold temperatures will allow study of synthetic solids created by the formation of optical lattices that control the location of atoms at ultra-cold temperatures. over the past two decades, scientists have learned to trap neutral atoms by lowering their temperature and building optical structures from laser beams to capture these slow-moving atoms. by constructing layers of atoms held together in this way, scientists can create synthetic solids that are unlike any materials that can be created at conventional chemical reaction temperatures. ""instead of chemical bonds, what holds them together are photons of light from the laser beams,"" landman noted. in conventional systems, thermal noise acts as a veil to prevent direct study of certain phenomena. by nearly eliminating thermal energy at these ultra-cold temperatures, researchers will be able to study interactions without these complicating effects. landman's research group has been studying for over three decades the interactions of matter using advanced computational techniques. in this new research, those techniques often complement experimental work, enabling an iterative process that more rapidly leads to results. studying matter in these extreme conditions will require new computational techniques. ""we can apply these methodologies of ultra-cold atom simulations to solve problems that we cannot solve otherwise,"" said landman.

 researchers at the georgia institute of technology have received a $900,000 grant from the u.s. air force office of scientific research (afosr) to study the unusual chemical and physical properties of atoms and molecules at ultra-cold temperatures approaching absolute zero - the temperature at which all thermal activity stops. developing and employing advanced computational methodologies, they will explore the formation of novel types of molecular aggregates at these extreme conditions, where quantum mechanical principles govern and dramatically alter the ways that atoms and molecules interact. the work could help provide a better understanding of the reaction processes underlying strongly correlated atoms and molecular quantum systems in conditions unlike those seen in conventional chemistry. ""bringing atoms together to make a new material is the basis of chemistry, but here we are synthesizing new materials through quantum mechanical forces,"" said 
 uzi landman , a regent's and institute professor and callaway chair professor in the georgia tech 
 school of physics . ""we expect to help lay the foundation for a new theory describing the chemistry of ultra-cold atoms. to do this, we will develop a different type of computational theory."" absolute zero is the temperature at which all thermal activity stops. the researchers will be studying matter at ultra-cold temperatures, which are in the micro-kelvin or nano-kelvin ranges closely approaching that level. at these extremely low temperatures, atoms and molecules move much more slowly and have different kinds of interactions. these atoms and molecules interact via their wave nature, with interference between waves either destroying or amplifying one another. at these ultra-cold temperatures, the wave nature of matter also changes. for instance, the size of the de broglie wavelength is inversely proportional to the square of the temperature, meaning wavelengths become larger as the temperature drops. ""the wavelength of a particle, say a lithium atom, taken from room temperature to one nano-kelvin, grows by a factor of about 600,000, from about 0.04 nanometers at room temperature to 24,000 nanometers (24 microns) at the lower temperature - which is a very dramatic change,"" landman explained. in conventional chemistry, activation barriers must be overcome before atoms can exchange electrons to bind together. because they have so little energy at ultra-cold temperatures, atoms cannot overcome this activation barrier, meaning interactions must occur through other mechanisms - including quantum tunneling effects. and at these conditions, quantum mechanical effects become more pronounced, with the long-distance entanglement of atoms affecting the physical and chemical states of the matter. ""these are pure and deep quantum mechanical objects, and they exist only at these low temperatures because the wave effect takes over,"" noted landman, who is also director of the georgia tech center for computational materials science (ccms). at georgia tech, landman's group will study first the activity of small numbers of atoms and molecules - a phenomenon that ccms senior research scientist constantine yannouleas calls ""few-body interactions."" the calculations will begin with just two atoms and build into larger groups of atoms and molecules. ""one of the things that is most interesting to us is how smaller systems combine to make larger systems,"" landman added. ""we will study this from the bottom up."" the ultra-cold temperatures will allow study of synthetic solids created by the formation of optical lattices that control the location of atoms at ultra-cold temperatures. over the past two decades, scientists have learned to trap neutral atoms by lowering their temperature and building optical structures from laser beams to capture these slow-moving atoms. by constructing layers of atoms held together in this way, scientists can create synthetic solids that are unlike any materials that can be created at conventional chemical reaction temperatures. ""instead of chemical bonds, what holds them together are photons of light from the laser beams,"" landman noted. in conventional systems, thermal noise acts as a veil to prevent direct study of certain phenomena. by nearly eliminating thermal energy at these ultra-cold temperatures, researchers will be able to study interactions without these complicating effects. landman's research group has been studying for over three decades the interactions of matter using advanced computational techniques. in this new research, those techniques often complement experimental work, enabling an iterative process that more rapidly leads to results. studying matter in these extreme conditions will require new computational techniques. ""we can apply these methodologies of ultra-cold atom simulations to solve problems that we cannot solve otherwise,"" said landman. ""we will attempt to revolutionize the ability to compute things that aren't computable at this point. experiments with ultra-cold atoms emulate an analog-simulator mapping onto the requisite microscopic hamiltonian, approaching realization of richard feynman's vision of quantum simulators that ‘will do exactly the same as nature.' in our work, we develop and implement exact benchmark computational microscopy solutions of the system hamiltonian, uncovering the spectral evolution, wave function anatomy, and entanglement properties of the interacting fermions in the entire system parameter range. in this way we may address some outstanding problem, like high-temperature superconductivity, quantum magnetism, highly correlated quantum systems, and chemistry at the ultra-cold extreme,"" he added. all of this makes for exciting new science that is being explored both experimentally and theoretically at nearly a dozen laboratories around the world. landman and yannouleas hope to use the strong background and expertise of the ccms in computational physics and materials science to make contributions to the computational techniques and modeling used to study these effects.

 feb 29, 2024 
 the longest running, most diverse university-based economic development organization in the u.s., the enterprise innovation institute (ei2) launched its founding program more than 60 years ago. since then, it has expanded to serve enterprises of all sizes, from pre-company teams and startups to long-running businesses, as well as communities seeking to revitalize their local economies. 
 through the enterprise 6 internship program, usg undergraduate and graduate students across a range of disciplines discover how the skills they've been cultivating in classrooms and labs can play a role in economic development. the program is made possible by funding from georgia tech's office of the executive vice president for research. 
 although the internship doesn't accrue academic credit, students receive $25 an hour for a 20-hour work week. each intern is mentored by an ei2 research faculty member, and biweekly remote meetings enable participants to share observations about their experience. 
 ""the enterprise innovation institute engages in meaningful work to expand economic opportunity for all, and the e6 program provides students the opportunity to work on real-world challenges supporting the equitable development and deployment of talent and innovation, both locally and globally,"" said david bridges, the enterprise innovation institute's vice president. 
 ""in some cases, e6 interns are so inspired by this experience that they change the trajectory of their ambitions."" 
 take, for example, eve pike, who at the time of her 2021 internship was a student in the sam nunn school of international affairs. working with enterprise 6 gave her a new set of reference points, and pike realized she wanted to pursue a career in tech - and possibly even expand into marketing or economics. ""it broadened my horizon,"" she said. 
 hanyu lu found that her experience as an enterprise 6 intern in 2023 ""significantly enhanced my skills in analysis and development."" after e6, lu, who is working toward a master's degree in computational science and engineering at georgia tech, went on to complete an internship at heartland forward, in bentonville, arkansas, where she strengthened the abilities she honed as an e6 intern. 
 for another member of the 2023 cohort, olajide olugbade, who is pursuing a ph.d. in science and technology policy at georgia tech, the enterprise 6 internship helped him secure his current position as a graduate research assistant. ""the knowledge i gained, the skills i demonstrated, and the relationship i built while conducting research for the ei2 global team contributed to being the candidate of choice,"" he said. 
 the benefits of the enterprise 6 program flow in both directions; not only do the interns gain valuable skills from their experiences, but they also contribute to the enterprise innovation institute's mission. 
 ""e6 students bring fresh and unique perspectives to our work,"" said bridges. ""these perspectives allow our programs to deliver leading-edge, capacity-building support to people, companies, and communities in georgia and beyond."" 
 enterprise 6 internships run from may 13 to aug. 9. seven internships are available, and interested students may apply to a maximum of two. 
 there are seven projects for this summer and interested students may apply to  no more than two projects . see the project outlines from the application link:  https: / / innovate.gatech.edu / enterprise-6-internship-project-listing-summer-2024 /

 georgia tech students, administrators, and guests gathered yesterday to commemorate the transformation of a site once known as a haven for segregationists into an environmental restoration project now known as 
 the ecocommons . 
 the site, near the intersection of hemphill avenue and ferst drive, is the former location of the pickrick restaurant, which opened in 1948 and was owned by segregationist lester maddox, who later became the governor of georgia. after the passage of the civil rights act in 1964, three black theology students from the interdenominational theological center - george willis jr., woodrow lewis, and albert dunn - attempted to be served at the restaurant on three occasions. each time they were forced out by maddox and white patrons wielding a handgun and pickaxe handles. 
 the students hired black attorney constance baker motley, who filed the first federal lawsuit under the civil rights act. the court ordered maddox to desegregate the pickrick. instead of complying, he closed the restaurant. georgia tech purchased the building when campus expanded and used it as a job placement center for many years. the building was razed in 2008. 
 archie w. ervin, georgia tech's vice president for institute diversity, equity, and inclusion, welcomed guests to the event. 
 ""today, we want to commemorate, celebrate, and honor the bravery of three young men, whose courage allowed them to alter the course of history by challenging racial segregation in the deep south, our beloved city of atlanta, and in the state of georgia,"" he said. ""their acts of courage helped to pave the way for progress addressing some of the many challenges to black equality in america, which allowed for an eventual path toward healing the hurt and harm perpetrated on black americans under racial segregation laws and practices."" 
 karcheik sims-alvarado, assistant professor of africana studies at morehouse college and a member of the committee that helped create the space, talked about the history behind the site, including the legal battle over desegregation. matthew wesley williams, president of the interdenominational theological center, spoke about the three students who participated in the sit-ins. and jeanne kerney, president of the georgia tech black alumni organization, discussed black student success at georgia tech. 
 andre dickens, atlanta city council member who also serves on the georgia tech alumni association board of trustees, spoke about the historical significance of the events that took place here. 
 ""it's important to be able to put a marker down to say that something happened here that led to allowing people to gather together, integrated. i think this is the right thing to do, and this institution continues to get it right,"" dickens said. ""atlanta has always been at the height of the civil rights movement, and this place will be added to the legacy of atlanta. we will make sure that people come see this place and know the story of what happened."" 
 undergraduates kemuel russell and shelbe johnson spoke on behalf of the georgia tech african american student union. 
 ""i hope that the evolution of this space, intended to inspire reflection and connection, is purposefully dedicated to the community that was previously harmed here years ago,"" he said. ""i also hope that georgia tech utilizes opportunities like this to remove barriers to success for minority students, in order to build a community where people of all backgrounds have the opportunity to learn and thrive."" 
 johnson noted that the african american student union was founded after the assassination of martin luther king jr. 
 ""today, we carry on the legacy of legends such as dr. king and the seminary students honored here this afternoon,"" she said. ""we encourage you to join us in taking up the mantle, helping to ensure that their legacies live on."" 
 georgia tech president ángel cabrera was the closing speaker. 
 ""this beautiful element of the ecocommons that we officially open today will help us remember our past, the struggle for civil rights in our city and our nation, and will inspire us to build a better future. it celebrates three courageous students who put themselves at risk to tear down walls and create opportunity for all of us,"" he said. ""this garden, this unity garden, creates an opportunity for us to come together, to heal and to continue on our journey to build an inclusive community where everyone can thrive.""

 a partnership with an atlanta high school allows georgia tech to give students a glimpse of campus life as they work in an office 
 nov 10, 2022 
 - atlanta, ga 
 georgia tech has been a home away from home for abraham pizano for five years - even when he was in high school. 
 pizano went to cristo rey atlanta jesuit high school about 2.5 miles from georgia tech. the school enrolls more than 500 students from families who couldn't otherwise pay for a private, college preparatory education. while families contribute a portion of the $16,400 cost of education, the school fundraises approximately $5,000 per student. the remaining 60% of the cost is earned by the students, who work at area businesses as part of cristo rey's corporate work study program. 
 in his sophomore year of high school, pizano landed at georgia tech and worked in the college of engineering's dean's office. he had never been to campus and wasn't yet thinking of college, although he hoped to one day study engineering. 
 ""i didn't know much at all about georgia tech,"" said pizano, who grew up in atlanta. ""my only goal was to make some connections and do the best i could. that year, i set my heart and mind on tech."" 
 pizano loved georgia tech so much that he returned to the dean's office to work his senior year, then applied and was accepted as a student. 
 once a 15-year-old sitting in tech tower, uncertain about what to do for college, pizano is now a third-year civil engineering student with a focus on transportation systems. 
 ""i came here in high school, loved the people, and kept coming back,"" said pizano, who stayed on in the dean's office as a student assistant in 2020 and 2021. ""my job in the dean's office gave me a kickstart to my current success at tech."" 
 pizano said the work-study experience at georgia tech also taught him the pillars of working in a professional environment, an opportunity that isn't typically available to high school students. it's one of cristo rey's main goals, with georgia tech playing a supporting role since the school was founded eight years ago. read more about the how georgia tech is expanding access through its partnership with cristo rey.

 researchers have extended the possibility of origami for modern engineering applications such as untethered robotics and morphing devices.

 - atlanta, ga 
 a team of researchers from the ohio state university and the georgia institute of technology has extended the possibility of origami, the ancient art of paper folding, for modern engineering applications such as untethered robotics and morphing devices. 
 the researchers demonstrated for the first time a multifunctional, magnetically responsive origami system, possessing distributed, untethered control capabilities. the untethered magnetic actuation separates the power source and controller out of the system, allowing scalable applications. 
 researchers foresee that this actuation solution can be applied locally and remotely on complex origami assemblies. the actuation strategy enables a myriad of new applications, ranging from morphing robotics and satellites to biomedical devices. 
 ""by distributively integrating the programmed magnetic soft materials into the bi-stable origami assembly, the magnetic actuation provides independent control of the folding and unfolding of each unit cell with instantaneous shape locking, which enables various robotic motion for functions such as tunable physical properties and configurable electronics for digital computing,"" said principal investigator ruike (renee) zhao, an assistant professor in the department of mechanical and aerospace engineering at ohio state. 
 the research, ""untethered control of functional origami microrobots with distributed actuation,"" was reported sept. 14 in the journal 
 proceedings of the national academy of sciences . the work was sponsored by the national science foundation (nsf). 
 researchers have explored for decades how to leverage origami folding techniques in advanced engineering applications, such as morphing structures and devices. however, most actuation methods require physical bonds to external stimuli and lead to excessive wiring to provide the driving force for origami folding. 
 the new, untethered system is free from those rigid and often relatively bulky power sources, allowing faster speed and distributed actuation of the multifunctional structure. 
 to demonstrate this, researchers constructed a system of magnetic-responsive materials in a cylindrical origami pattern that consists of identical triangular panels known as a kresling pattern. this pattern allows the cylinder's walls to buckle under axial or torsional load. 
 ""the kresling pattern offers a very rich design space, which was crucial in coupling its mechanical response with magnetically responsive materials to achieve on-demand, untethered actuation, including our multifunctional origami for digital computing,"" said

 school of civil and environmental engineering . 
 by controlling the magnetic field, researchers were able to control the direction, intensity, and speed of the material's folding and deployment. in the tests, researchers achieved untethered actuation as fast as one tenth of a second with instantaneous shape locking. 
 next, researchers attached a magnetized plate to each of the kresling unit cells. this allowed them to utilize a two-dimensional magnetic field to actuate the unit cells simultaneously or independently by using different magnetic torques of the plates and distinct geometric-mechanical properties of each unit cell. 
 ""the multi-unit kresling assembly is an origami robot in which the bi-stable folding and unfolding create robotic motion. it can passively sense and actively respond to the external environment. by integrating electronic circuits into the origami robot, it further enables intelligent autonomous robots with integrated actuation, sensing, and decision making,"" zhao said. ""for example, the external pressure or forces that act on the robot will trigger the passive folding of the robot, indicating the presence of an obstacle. the robot can then actively unfold itself and decide the next move."" 
 the untethered magnetic control pushes the boundary of the application of origami systems, which could lead to solutions of next-generation biomimetic soft robots and robotic systems for advanced engineering applications. 
 ""we anticipate that the reported magnetic origami system is applicable beyond the bounds of this work, including future origami-inspired robots, morphing mechanisms, biomedical devices, and outer space structures,"" paulino said. 
 this research was supported by prof. zhao's two recent nsf awards from the mechanics of materials and structures program (nsf award # 1943070, # 1939543) and ohio state's institute of material research. the authors at georgia tech acknowledge nsf (award # 1538830) and the raymond allen jones chair. any opinions, findings, and conclusions or recommendations expressed in this material are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of the national science foundation.

 - atlanta, ga 
 using an array of tiny needles that are almost too small to see, researchers have developed a minimally invasive technique for sampling a largely unexplored human bodily fluid that could potentially provide a new source of information for routine clinical monitoring and diagnostic testing. 
 biochemical information about the body most commonly comes from analysis of blood - which represents only 6% of bodily fluids - but valuable information may also be found in other bodily fluids that are traditionally hard to get. researchers have now developed a way to extract dermal interstitial fluid (isf), which circulates between cells in bodily tissues, using a simple through-the-skin technique that could provide a new approach for studying the metabolic products of cells, obtaining diagnostic biomarkers, and identifying potential toxins absorbed through the skin. because the dermal interstitial fluid doesn't clot like blood, the microneedle-based extraction could offer a new approach for continuous monitoring of glucose and other key health indicators. 
 results of a human trial on the microneedle-based isf sampling is reported nov. 25 in the journal 
 science translational medicine . the study, conducted by researchers from the georgia institute of technology and emory university, was supported in part by the national institutes of health and children's healthcare of atlanta. 
 ""interstitial fluid originates in the blood and then leaks out of capillaries to bring nutrients to cells in the body's tissues. because interstitial fluid is in direct communication with the cells, it should have information about the tissues themselves beyond what can be measured from testing the blood,"" said 
 mark prausnitz , regents professor and j. erskine love jr. chair in georgia tech's 
 school of chemical and biomolecular engineering . ""this microneedle-based technique could provide a minimally invasive and simple way to access this interstitial fluid to make it available for medical diagnostic and research applications."" 
 isf has been difficult to sample. indwelling instruments for monitoring glucose in isf already exist, and other researchers have used surgically implanted tubing and vacuum-created blisters to extract isf through the skin, but these techniques are not suitable for routine clinical diagnostic use. 
 the researchers, led by first author pradnya samant, used a patch containing five solid stainless steel microneedles that were a hundredth of an inch in length. by pressing the patch at an angle into the skin of 50 human subjects, they created shallow micropores that reached only into the outer layer of skin containing isf. the researchers then applied a suction to the area of skin containing the pores and obtained enough isf to do three types of analysis. for comparison, they also took blood samples and obtained isf using the older blister technique. 
 to accurately determine the biomarkers available in the isf, the researchers needed to avoid getting blood mixed with the isf. though major blood vessels don't exist in the outer layers of skin, capillaries there can be damaged by the insertion of the microneedles. in their studies, the researchers found that if they slowly ramped up the suction after inserting the microneedles, they could obtain fluid clear of blood. 
 the overall extraction procedure took about 20 minutes for each test subject. the procedure was well tolerated by the volunteers, and the microscopic pores healed quickly within a day, with minimal irritation. 
 the extracted fluid was analyzed at emory university using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry techniques to identify the chemical species it contained. overall, there were about 10,000 unique compounds, most of which were also found in the blood samples. however, about 12% of the chemical species were not found in the blood, and others were found in the isf at higher levels than in the blood. 
 ""the skin is metabolically active, and it is full of cells that are changing the fluid,"" prausnitz said. ""we found that some of the compounds were unique to the isf, or enriched there, and that is what we were hoping to find."" 
 while not all the compounds unique to the isf could be analyzed, the research team identified components of products that are applied to the skin - such as hand lotions - and pesticides that may enter the body through the skin. this discovery could set the stage for use of the microneedle technique for dermatological and toxicology studies. 
 ""if you want to look at what accumulates in the skin over time, this may provide a way to obtain information about those kinds of exposures,"" prausnitz said. ""these are materials that may accumulate in the tissues of our body, but are not found in the bloodstream."" 
 the researchers also determined the pharmacokinetics of caffeine and the pharmacodynamics of glucose - both small molecules - from the isf, indicating that that dynamic biomarker information could be obtained from the technique. those measurements suggested that isf could provide a means for continuously monitoring such compounds, taking advantage of the fact that the fluid does not clot. 
 ""we were encouraged that we found a good correlation between the blood and interstitial fluid glucose, which suggests we might be able to have a continuous glucose monitoring system based on this technology,"" prausnitz said. a microneedle-based system could provide a less invasive alternative to existing implantable glucose sensors by allowing the sensing components to remain on the surface of the skin. 
 in future research, prausnitz would like to reduce the time required to extract the isf and simplify the process by eliminating the vacuum pump. additional study of the compounds found in the fluid could also show whether they have medical diagnostic value. 
 ""we'd like to make this microneedle-based technique available to the research community to make isf routinely available for study,"" he said. ""tissue interstitial fluid could be a novel source of biomarkers that complements conventional sources. this research provides a means to study this further."" 
 the research team also included nicholas raviele and juan mena-lapaix from georgia tech; and megan m. niedzwiecki, douglas i. walker, gary w. miller, vilinh tran, eric i. felner, and dean p. jones from emory university.

 - atlanta, ga 
 the 
 institute for robotics and intelligent machines 
 at georgia tech supports and facilitates the operation of several core research facilities on campus. this allows faculty, students, and collaborators to advance the boundaries of robotics research. 
 this installment of the faces of research q&a series is with 
 kinsey herrin 
 what is your field of expertise and why did you choose it? 
 i'm a prosthetist / orthotist and conduct research in the field of prosthetics, orthotics / exoskeletons, and rehab robotics. our goal is to make it easier for people with mobility challenges to live more independent lives by helping them move more easily in the real world. the change we see through our technology sometimes is amazing - people with amputations can go upstairs, step-over-step instead of stiff legged, and kids with walking disabilities start to have more normal walking patterns. as a kid, i always wanted to help people and this profession is the perfect blend of medicine, science, and art - all things that i love plus the added benefit of getting to be around some really incredible people. 
 what makes georgia tech research institutes unique? 
 we're trying to advance technology outside of the lab and into the real world where it can make an impact on real users. that means not only assessing how our users perform with the technology - does it actually make them walk faster, with a more natural and easy gait - but also assessing a user's own perspective on technology and using all of that data to keep improving the end results. our facilities and resources are incredible. i often feel i have access to a dream playground for a research prosthetist / orthotist. on top of all of that, our faculty and students are not only extremely talented and at the top of their fields, but i think there is a deeper passion for pursuing this goal to make mobility easier for people with physical challenges. 
 what impact is your research having on the world? 
 i see our work as having an impact on all people with mobility challenges. we are trying to make the world a better place for them by challenging the status quo and saying what clinicians can currently provide is still not good enough. we can still do more to return people to a new normal after amputation, stroke, brain, and spinal cord injuries. when people can access their own environment independently, it has overwhelmingly positive impacts on their quality of life. i think our research is making great strides toward making that possible. 
 what do you like to do in your spare time when you are not working on your research or teaching? 
 i enjoy being outdoors with my husband and son any chance we get. we love pretty much everything about being on or near water - fishing, kayaking, canoeing, swimming, and camping. i also have nine backyard chickens and a dog that are hilarious and fun additions to the herrin chaos.

 two faculty members in georgia tech's college of sciences are now involved with a future flight to jupiter's moon europa. associate professor 
 carol paty 
 and assistant professor 
 britney schmidt 
 are co-investigators for two instruments that will fly to europa in the 2020s and study the ocean world for three years. europa is an ice-encrusted world known to encase a global ocean of liquid water that is heated by jupiter's tidal forces. on earth, where there is liquid water and energy, there is life. as such, europa has long been considered one of the solar system's best-suited vistas to search for life. schmidt is a co-investigator for the reason instrument - radar for europa assessment and sounding: ocean to near-surface, led by donald blankenship at the university of texas. reason is a dual-frequency ice-penetrating radar that will characterize and sound europa's icy crust from the near-surface to the ocean, revealing the hidden structure of europa's ice shell and potential water within. ""i got into planetary science to help answer the question of whether europa hosts life. i've spent 14 years working with colleagues to send a spacecraft back to europa, and it's finally happening,"" said schmidt. ""the highlight of the europa mission is that it will use a suite of complementary instruments working together to figure out whether europa is habitable or not ­- a key step along the path to finding life. it's a great time to be an astrobiologist."" schmidt says that reason is a critical part of the story, with the ability to ""see"" through europa's ice and map out its structure. it may also find locations of water pockets within, and potentially the ocean below the ice. reason will deliver some of the most critical missing pieces of the europan habitability puzzle: how does the ice shell work, and is there water? paty is on the science team for reason and pims - the plasma instrument for magnetic sounding, led by joseph westlake of the johns hopkins applied physics laboratory. pims, in combination with the magnetometer, will study europa's ocean depth, salinity and the thickness of the moon's surface. ""i am beyond thrilled to be a part of these fantastic instrument teams and to have the opportunity to explore europa,"" said paty, whose research has focused on the icy moons of jupiter and saturn for more than a decade. ""the pims and reason instruments will greatly enhance our understanding of this icy world by enabling us to probe its surrounding environment and subsurface structures."" the pims will measure the plasma environment at europa in order to quantify the magnetic field generated by plasma-driven current systems surrounding the icy moon. in this way, paty says the science team can refine its understanding of the currents and fields generated by the subsurface ocean and more accurately characterize its size, depth and salinity. reason and pims are two of the nine instruments nasa recently selected for the mission.   paty and schmidt are faculty of the school of earth and atmospheric sciences, and members of georgia tech's center for space technology and research (c-star). c-star organizes, integrates and facilitates the institute's space science and technology research activities, bringing together a wide range of georgia tech faculty who are active in space-related research and functioning as a focal point for the growth of the 
 space industry in the state of georgia . c-star personnel are advancing the frontiers of astrophysics, earth science, planetary science, robotics, space policy, space technology and space systems engineering. ""with science investigators on multiple deep space missions and a small spacecraft development pipeline that is turning out flight hardware, georgia tech's spaceflight capability is certainly on the rise,"" said robert braun, c-star director. ""having georgia tech faculty involved in this mission is fantastic news for the campus, the state and the nation, capitalizing on the integrated science and engineering competency that characterizes much of our research.""

 georgia tech researchers have helped select the right rna-seq data analysis tools.

 next-generation sequencing (ngs) has emerged as an important high throughput technology in biomedical research and translation for its ability to accurately capture genetic information. but choosing proper analysis methods for identifying biomarkers from high throughput data remains a critical challenge for most users. 
 for instance, rna-sequencing (rna-seq) is an ngs technology that examines the presence and quantity of rna in biological samples, and it requires bioinformatics analysis to make sense of it all. however, there are hundreds of bioinformatics tools with different data analysis pipelines that result in various results for the same dataset. this can significantly hinder the ability to reliably reproduce rna-seq related research and applications, especially for the regulatory approval process by the u.s. food and drug administration (fda). 
 choosing the right analysis model and tool to do the proper job for high throughput data analysis remains a great challenge. so the fda invited a team of researchers at the georgia institute of technology to conduct a comprehensive investigation of rna-seq data analysis pipelines for gene expression estimation to recommend best practices. 
 ""no common standard for selecting high throughput rna-seq data analysis tools has been established yet. this has been a huge challenge for studying hundreds of tools that form tens of thousands of analysis pipelines,"" noted 
 may dongmei wang , a professor in the 
 wallace h. coulter department of biomedical engineering 
 at georgia tech and emory university who led the investigation. 
 wang and her colleagues presented their results in the journal 
 nature scientific reports . in their study, the researchers developed three metrics - accuracy, precision, and reliability - and systematically evaluated 278 representative ngs rna-seq pipelines. 
 ""we demonstrate that those rna-seq pipelines performing well in gene expression estimation will lead to the improved downstream prediction of disease outcome. this is an important discovery,"" said wang, corresponding author of the paper, "" impact of rna-seq data analysis algorithms on gene expression estimation and downstream prediction ."" 
 she added, ""because the fda is a regulatory agency for approving novel medical devices for ngs-genomics to be utilized in daily clinical practices for personalized and precision medicine and health, it is critical to see whether gene expression generated from rna-seq acquisition and analysis pipeline are reproducible and reliable."" 
 the team's comprehensive investigation revealed that the high throughput rna-seq data quantification modules - mapping, quantification, and normalization - jointly impacted the accuracy, precision, and reliability of gene expression estimation, which in turn affected the downstream clinical outcome prediction (as shown in two cancer case studies of neuroblastoma and lung adenocarcinoma). 
 ""clinicians and biomedical researchers can use our findings to select rna-seq pipelines for their clinical practice or research,"" wang said. ""and bioinformaticians can use these benchmark datasets, results, and metrics to develop and evaluate new rna-seq tools and pipelines."" 
 but one size does not fit every need, as in any machine learning paradigm, wang noted. 
 ""the machine learning and algorithms are heavily dependent on goals,"" she said. ""thus, based on our extensive experience in biomedical big data analytics and ai for almost two decades, we suggested that the fda identify top goals for clinical genomics applications first. based on different needs, different rna-seq pipelines will be selected to achieve the optimal performance."" 
 in addition to wang, the research team included lead author li tong, po-yen wu, john h. phan, hamid r. hassazadeh, weida tong, and members of the fda's sequencing quality control project (wendell d. jones, leming shi, matthias fischer, christopher e. mason, sheng li, joshua xu, wei shi, jian wang, jean thierry-mieg, danielle thierry-mieg, falk hertwig, frank berthold, barbara hero, yang liao, gordon k. smyth, david kreil, pawel p. tabaj, dalila megherbi, gary schroth, and hong fang).

 a team of researchers at the georgia institute of technology has kicked off a three-year federally-funded project to harness new manufacturing technologies and methods in a bid to bring down the cost of making certain antibiotics. 
 the $2 million award from the u.s. food and drug administration (fda) focuses on finding ways to apply continuous manufacturing methods to beta-lactam antibiotics, a class of drugs that includes widely-used antibiotics such as amoxicillin. 
 ""these infection-fighting antibiotics are critically important for the healthcare system, and our goal is to make these medications easier and more cost-effective to produce,"" said andreas bommarius, a professor in the school of chemical and biomolecular engineering, one of the researchers leading the project. 
 georgia tech was one of three research institutions chosen by the fda to explore how to translate manufacturing techniques already in use in food and chemical production to making certain antibiotics that now are often imported into the united states. 
 the georgia tech team will focus on the early stages of drug synthesis, while massachusetts institute of technology and rutgers university will address later stages of the manufacturing process. 
 ""continuous manufacturing utilizes technologies that offer clear benefits for both patients and industry,"" fda commissioner scott gottlieb said when announcing the awards. 
 ""the approach has the potential to shorten production times and improve the efficiency of manufacturing processes. these benefits translate to lower cost of production and thus the cost of medicine."" 
 traditionally, the pharmaceutical industry has relied on batch manufacturing for medicine production. with continuous manufacturing, costs associated with starting up and shutting down production are reduced due to the continuous nature of the manufacturing approach. other potential advantages includes faster ramp-up production during times of shortages and more consistent product quality. 
 during the project, researchers at georgia tech will develop a process to continuously synthesize, crystalize and isolate both cephalexin and amoxicillin, which are examples of two major types of beta-lactam antibiotics. 
 ""our design is intended to enable beta-lactam active pharmaceutical ingredient production in dedicated, compact, less capital-intensive plants, which in turn is envisioned to lead to better access to medicines for patients and ultimately to less expensive drugs,"" bommarius said. 
 the new fda-backed project is among several initiatives at georgia tech involving research into ways of bringing down the cost of producing medications. other projects included a federally-backed initiative to advance medications made from cells, such as vaccines and autoimmune drugs, as well as therapies using living cells to treat a range of conditions. 
 a separate initiative is aimed at advancing technologies for manufacturing therapeutic cells. researchers at georgia tech were also recently awarded a three-year, $1.8 million grant from the u.s. food and drug administration to develop a scalable manufacturing system for cord-tissue derived cells.

fears-promises-and-emerging-tech.txt,"fears, promises, and emerging tech 
 what can the history of telecom infrastructure teach us about ai? 
 apr 09, 2024 
 when gloria calhoun decided to pursue a ph.d. after a career in telecommunications, she initially planned to explore how the system of overhead telephone wires was moved underground. however, when she began studying how the overhead network was built in the first place, she was surprised to find little information on the topic. ""you would almost think that all those wires and poles just appeared by magic,"" calhoun said. as a student in the school of history and sociology, calhoun researches how the emergence of telecommunications infrastructures shaped the wire and cable industries. while digging into the history of overhead wires, she was struck by the way people created narratives about the ""fears"" and ""promises"" of emerging telegraph and telephone infrastructures - and how much they resembled the competing narratives around artificial intelligence (ai) today.   fears, promises, and public discourse    ""your viewpoints on the fears and promises of technology are often shaped by what you stand to gain or lose, so they vary from person to person and by time and place,"" calhoun said. ""with telecom infrastructure, some people's wildest hopes were realized, while others' worst fears came true. some made lots of money from the networks, and others died building them.""   the fears and promises around emerging technologies range from high expectations to deep skepticism. for example, telegraph technology promised to send messages quickly, annihilating time and space in communication, calhoun explained. but others worried about how the wires degraded urban environments and how people could use the telegraph to distort the free flow of market information. with ai, the discourse is similar. we hope the technology will eliminate mundane tasks or solve problems we haven't yet cracked. however, 
 concerns remain : can we prevent bias in ai algorithms? will job replacement disrupt the labor market?   technology doesn't appear in isolation   just like telegraph debates raged through newspapers in the 1800s, the release of openai's chatgpt language learning model in 2022 unleashed a blizzard of opinions in the media, with even some prominent ai researchers 
 changing their minds 
 about the technology. what factors cause this range of opinions? calhoun explains that the technology's use, its physical presence, its symbolic meanings, and its interactions with other technologies can all affect how we perceive it. new technology is unpredictable because people often co-opt it in ways their inventors didn't intend or anticipate. its physical presence also affects how we perceive it - even if it's invisible, ""which can sometimes seem like a good thing, as for urban aesthetics, but can also make it feel more sinister,"" calhoun said. symbolic meanings also vary, with a typical example being railroads, calhoun explained. were they a symbol of progress or a machine in the garden, as the historian leo marx famously phrased it? and finally, just as technology is often used in unintended ways, it also interacts with other tech in surprising ways. for example, low-voltage telecommunications lines aren't hazardous alone but can be lethal if crossed with high-voltage power lines, calhoun said. in a nutshell, ""there is no blank slate. technology doesn't appear in isolation or operate in a vacuum. we don't go overnight from inventing new technology to having it fully deployed and understood,"" calhoun said. ""people's perceptions change as their wants, desires, and expectations change.""     the regulatory challenge   and then what? fear and promises anticipate, but regulation reacts, calhoun said. and often, there is a lag between the two.  ""no matter how obvious it might be that somebody needs to do something, it's often not at all obvious who that somebody is or what they need to do,"" she said. calhoun explained that the main challenge for regulators is balancing competing stakeholder interests and dealing with a technology that evolves as they try to regulate it. for example, city leaders in montreal tried to move the wires underground for 30 years. the overhead system was dangerous, with wires blocking firefighters from reaching burning buildings and deteriorating poles posing a safety hazard.   ""and they hemmed and hawed and dithered, and finally, the fire insurance underwriters said, 'if you don't move these wires underground, we will no longer offer casualty insurance in the city center.' and that finally moved them to start doing something about it,"" calhoun said. ""that's a long way of saying that when the consequences of doing nothing outweigh the consequences of change, even with all the uncertainties the change may bring, that's when it usually starts to happen.""   kranzberg's law   mel kranzberg, the founder of the history and sociology of technology and science program at georgia tech, published 
 kranzberg's laws 
 in 1986. the first states, ""technology is neither good nor bad, nor is it neutral."" ""that view was evolving then, and it's the same thing we're still discussing here,"" calhoun said. as narratives of fears and promises play out with ai, it's impossible to label the tech itself as good or evil ""because the social component of it is not the technology but the use. technologies are human productions, and humans are neither all good nor all bad. so you have to focus on how we use it more than the technology itself.""   from telegraphs and telephones to social media and artificial intelligence, deploying new technologies involves a learning process of trial and error. most people will use it for good - ""or at least try to,"" calhoun said - and just like telegraph infrastructure, ai will be another lesson to look back on and dissect when the next society-changing creation comes along. but the history of technology has already taught us at least one thing, she said.   ""new tech does not simply follow a predetermined path. it increases the range of possible paths but does not dictate which we follow or what will happen next. that's up to us.""

filtration-engineers-offer-advice-do-it-yourself-face-masks.txt,"filtration engineers offer advice on do-it-yourself face masks 
 a new website has been launched to share information and recommendations about creating your own face masks. 
 coping with covid-19 
 apr 06, 2020 
 - atlanta, ga 
 the continuing shortage of face masks and new recommendations on their use by the general public have led many individuals and organizations to make their own masks using available materials. while homemade protection as simple as scarves and bandanas can be helpful, there are ways to optimize the benefit of do-it-yourself personal protective equipment (ppe). 
 ""our expectation is that frontline healthcare workers interacting with covid-19 patients will use certified ppe,"" said 
 ryan lively , an associate professor in georgia tech's 
 school of chemical and biomolecular engineering . ""but for situations that don't involve intimate and prolonged interactions with covid-19 infected individuals, we believe that diy cloth face masks combined with proper social distancing etiquette will help slow the spread of this virus."" 
 while the underlying physics of filtration are complicated, lively and colleagues believe that two or more layers of a tightly woven, knitted, or nonwoven fabric can provide at least a partial barrier to virus-containing droplets, which combined with social distancing, can reduce the likelihood of virus transmission. 
 ""equally, important though, is the way that users fit, wear, handle, and remove the face mask,"" said 
 mark losego , an assistant professor in georgia tech's 
 school of materials science and engineering . ""because the mask will be touching your face, it and your hands should be clean before putting it on. the mask should be snug but not uncomfortable."" 
 gaps around the nose and chin should be minimized. once wearing the mask, you should avoid touching or moving the mask; don't pull the mask down to cough or sneeze! the mask is expected to capture germs, so it should be removed by touching only the straps; otherwise, you will contaminate your hands. 
 equally important to blocking virus-containing droplets is that the mask materials be breathable and non-hazardous for inhalation. ""for example, there is some danger of glass fibers within hepa or merv filters being inhaled if appropriate blocking layers are not included,"" said lively. ""most apparel or home goods textiles are safe. however, if you smell a chemical odor from the material, you should probably avoid using it for a mask."" 
 upon returning home from an errand, the mask should be discarded or thrown in the clothes washer and cleaned before being used again.  if the fabric mask does get wet from another individual's cough or sneeze, the mask should be removed quickly at a safe distance. the team recommends reviewing both the world health organization (who) 
 link 
 and centers for disease control and prevention (cdc)  guidelines 
 for mask wearing. 
 a new website ( www.research.gatech.edu / rapid-response ) has been created to bring together recommendations and templates for making face masks. the website provides guidance for making unsewn, sewn, glued, or 3d-printed face masks. 
 the recommendations resulted from consulting with a team of experts in materials, chemical and mechanical engineering, filtration processes, and production design. ""we have also interacted with relevant stakeholders, including hospitals and manufacturers, and studied the peer-reviewed literature to make recommendations based on scientific evidence,"" said lively. 
 on the website, the researchers suggest alternatives for materials that are in short supply. for instance, high-performance hepa furnace filters can be used with 3d printed masks to create a respirator, provided the hepa filters are installed in between two blocking layers of nonwoven fabric. reusable polypropylene grocery bags without a shiny film can be used as the droplet-repelling outer shell of the masks. 
 the new website includes directions, recommendations, files for 3d printers and more. the team is actively testing fabric materials to provide more specific recommendations for which fabrics to use and which to avoid. a rudimentary diy test using a water spray bottle is described to make an initial assessment of how suitable a fabric is for a mask. 
 masks produced or tested with directions from the site do not meet the standards of federal agencies such as niosh, osha or the fda.

finally-robust-fuel-cell-runs-methane-practical-temperatures.txt,"finally, a robust fuel cell that runs on methane at practical temperatures 
 cheap fuel, cool temperatures, low material costs: this fuel cell could spread to homes and cars. 
 this could actually become a practical, marketable energy solution. practical to run at cooler temperatures and on cheap fuel: the new fuel cell in the lab of meilin liu at georgia tech. credit: georgia tech / christopher moore 
 oct 29, 2018 
 - atlanta, ga 
 fuel cells have not been particularly known for their practicality and affordability, but that may have just changed. there's a new cell that runs on cheap fuel at temperatures comparable to automobile engines and which slashes materials costs. 
 though the cell is in the lab, it has high potential to someday electrically power homes and perhaps cars, say the researchers at the georgia institute of technology who led its development. in a 
 new study in the journal  nature energy   the researchers detailed how they reimagined the entire fuel cell with the help of a newly invented fuel catalyst. 
 the catalyst has dispensed with high-priced hydrogen fuel by making its own out of cheap, readily available methane. and improvements throughout the cell cooled the seething operating temperatures that are customary in methane fuel cells dramatically, a striking engineering accomplishment. 
 methane fuel cells usually require temperatures of 750 to 1,000 degrees celsius to run. this new one needs only about 500, which is even a notch cooler than automobile combustion engines, which run at around 600 degrees celsius. 
 that lower temperature could trigger cascading cost savings in the ancillary technology needed to operate a fuel cell, potentially pushing the new cell to commercial viability. the researchers feel confident that engineers can design electric power units around this fuel cell with reasonable effort, something that has eluded previous methane fuel cells. 
 ‘sensation in our world' 
 ""our cell could make for a straightforward, robust overall system that uses cheap stainless steel to make  interconnectors ,"" said meilin liu, who led the study and is a  regents professor in georgia tech's school of materials science and engineering.  interconnectors are parts that help bring together many fuel cells into a  stack , or functional unit. 
 ""above 750 degrees celsius, no metal would withstand the temperature without oxidation, so you'd have a lot of trouble getting materials, and they would be extremely expensive and fragile, and contaminate the cell,"" liu said. 
 ""lowering the temperature to 500 degrees celsius is a sensation in our world. very few people have even tried it,"" said ben deglee, a graduate research assistant in liu's lab and one of the first authors of the study. ""when you get that low, it makes the job of the engineer designing the stack and connected technologies much easier."" 
 the new cell also eliminates the need for a major ancillary device called a  steam reformer , which is normally required to convert methane and water into hydrogen fuel. 
 liu, deglee, co-first author yu chen, who is a postdoctoral researcher in liu's lab, and co-first author yu tang of the university of kansas,  published the results 
 of their research on october 29, 2018 . their work was funded by the office of basic energy sciences and the advanced research projects agency-energy (arpa-e), both in the u.s. department of energy. it was also funded by the national science foundation's division of chemistry. 
 ‘distributed generation' 
 the research was based on a type of fuel cell with high potential for commercial viability, the  solid oxide fuel cell (sofc) . sofcs are known for their versatility in fuels they can use. 
 if it goes to market, though the new cell might not power automobiles for a while, it could land sooner in basements as part of a more decentralized, cleaner, cheaper electrical power grid. the  fuel cell stack  itself would be about the size of a shoebox, plus ancillary technology to make it run. 
 ""the hope is you could install this device like a tankless water heater. it would run off of natural gas to power your house,"" liu said. ""that would save society and industry the enormous cost of new power plants and large electrical grid expansions."" 
 ""it would make homes and businesses more power independent,"" liu said. ""that kind of system would be called distributed generation, and our sponsors want to develop that."" 
 homemade hydrogen 
 hydrogen is the best fuel for powering fuel cells, but its cost is exorbitant. the researchers figured out how to convert methane to hydrogen in the fuel cell itself via the new catalyst, which is made with cerium, nickel and ruthenium and has the chemical formula ce 0.9 ni 0.05 ru 0.05 o 2,  abbreviated cnr. 
 when methane and water molecules come into contact with the catalyst and heat, nickel chemically cleaves the methane molecule. ruthenium does the same with water. the resulting parts come back together as that very desirable hydrogen (h 2 ) and carbon monoxide (co), which the researchers surprisingly put to good use. 
 ""co causes performance problems in most fuel cells, but here, we're using it as a fuel,"" chen said. 
 making electricity 
 h 2  and co continue on to further catalyst layers that make up the anode, the part of the fuel cell that yanks off electrons, making the carbon monoxide and hydrogen positively charged ions. the electrons travel via a wire - creating the electricity flow - toward the cathode. 
 there, oxygen, which is very electron-hungry, sucks up the electrons, closing the electrical circuit and becoming o 2-  ions. ionized hydrogen and oxygen meet and exit the system as water condensation; the carbon monoxide and oxygen ions meet to become pure carbon dioxide, which could be captured. 
 for the energy produced, fuel cell technology creates far, far less carbon dioxide than combustion engines. 
 in some fuel cells, the water in the initial reactions must be introduced from the outside. in this new fuel cell, it's replenished in the last reaction phase, which forms water that cycles back to react with the methane. 
 catalysts converge 
 the new catalyst, cnr, manufactured by research collaborators at the university of kansas, is the outer layer of the anode side of the cell and doubles as a protectant against decay, extending the life of the cell. cnr has strong cohort catalysts in inner layers and on the other side of the cell, the cathode. 
 on the cathode end, oxygen's reaction and movement through the system are usually notoriously slow, but liu's lab has recently sped it up to raise the electricity output by using what's called nanofiber cathodes, which liu's lab developed in a prior study. ( a tailored double perovskite nanofiber catalyst enables ultrafast oxygen evolution .) 
 ""the structures of these various catalysts, as well as the nanofiber cathodes, all together allowed us to drop the operating temperature,"" chen said.

finding-better-way-use-cameras-reduce-crime.txt,"finding a better way to use cameras to reduce crime 
 crime rates have dropped following a collaboration between georgia tech and the city of warner robins, georgia, that uses a mobile camera platform paired with data-driven, ai guided placement 
 remote video url 
 dec 11, 2023 
 areas of a middle georgia city have experienced a 20% reduction in crime after deploying a system of mobile cameras guided by an algorithm developed by georgia tech researchers. 
 the system is being piloted in warner robins, georgia. it uses artificial intelligence to sift through years of historical crime data to predict where future crimes are likely to happen, and by placing cameras that can read license plates in those areas, a three-month test period shows the community has been able to prevent some of those crimes. 
 ""the fact that we have our cameras in different areas in our city, that smart technology expands the footprint of our police department which helps us solve crime and also helps deter crime, which is even more beneficial,"" said warner robins mayor larhonda patrick. 
 for cities and counties with limited resources, it's a tool that could bring more impact with the money and equipment that is already being used to reduce crime. 
 georgia tech's john taylor, a professor in the school of civil and environmental engineering, says, ""when we were brought in, there was a general belief that crimes were really occurring in certain parts of the city, but as we looked at the crimes from week to week, we saw that they're actually moving around the city."" 
 the work is part of georgia tech's partnership for inclusive innovation, a public-private initiative that catalyzes innovation for shared economic prosperity. it invests in projects that join researchers with communities to bring advanced technologies to build local capacity and improve the human condition. 
 over the three months, researchers saw a reduction in crimes such as assault and burglary. georgia tech is helping the city deploy a more equitable solution in using cameras to fight crime and helping extend the city's budget and its police officers' work to make their community safer.

finding-flickers-therapeutic-pathway.txt,"finding flicker's therapeutic pathway 
 researchers probe the mechanisms underlying the rhythmic dance that recruits the brain's immune system 
 left to right: levi wood, annabelle singer, and dieter jaeger 
 aug 30, 2023 
 annabelle singer 
 was a postdoctoral researcher at the massachusetts institute of technology when she helped develop a light and sound therapeutic system that opened the door to a hopeful future of non-invasive treatments for neurodegenerative diseases. 
 singer, now a faculty researcher at georgia tech, has since demonstrated dramatic success in treating mouse models of alzheimer's disease with flickering lights and buzzing sounds. two years ago she and her team completed the 
 first human feasibility study 
 of this ""flicker"" treatment, delivered to patients via goggles and headphones. 
 ""and there's a long list of clinical trials going on right now using flicker stimulation - people are using the technology in a variety of different contexts,"" said singer, associate professor in the wallace h. coulter department of biomedical engineering at georgia tech and emory university. ""but the mechanism underlying all of this is a major mystery. as scientists, we want to nail down the one key question: what is actually happening?"" 
 she's been piecing the flicker mystery together for years, along the way building a novel way to manipulate the neuroimmune system and prevent alzheimer's damage. 
 her prior work 
 focused on using flickering light and sound set to a frequency of 40 hertz (40 times per second) to stimulate gamma waves, which play a main role in functions such as perception and memory, and which are deficient in alzheimer's disease. singer's flicker treatment set neurons on a rhythmic dance that recruit microglia, the brain's primary immune cells, which engulf pathogens and secrete cytokines - small proteins that alert other immune cells to the cause. 
 now singer and a team of multidisciplinary researchers from georgia tech and emory are providing answers to that one key question - what is going on to make all of this happen? - and they shared 
 their research this month in the journal 
 science advances . 
 studying rhythm in a healthy brain 
 singer's collaborators include fellow faculty researchers levi wood, associate professor in the george w. woodruff school of mechanical engineering at georgia tech, and dieter jaeger, professor in emory's department of biology, where his work focuses on the rhythmic motor patterns generated and modulated in the central nervous system.  both jaeger and wood have appointments in the coulter department. the lead authors are ashley prichard, postdoctoral researcher in singer's lab and kristie garza, former graduate researcher in the lab. 
 for this study, singer took a different approach. 
 ""in the past, our focus was on the diseased state. it was important for this research that we focus on brain rhythms in the healthy brain, to see the effects of sensory stimulation outside the context of alzheimer's pathology,"" singer said. 
 also, this time the team used flicker stimulation to induce electrical activity at two different frequencies in mice: 40hz, corresponding to gamma brain waves; and 20hz, corresponding to beta wave.  these brain rhythms occur naturally in the brain during everyday life and in response to flickering lights and sounds. with jaeger's lab, the team first showed flicker lights and sounds drive these brain rhythms using cutting edge imaging of electrical signals across the brain surface. 
 ""we compared different frequencies, so we'd have a better idea of the effects on the rhythmic activity of neurons,"" said singer. ""that's important because different frequencies of activity have distinct effects on microglia and cytokines."" 
 previously, the team noted the effects of different frequencies on cytokine protein expression - for example, 20hz flicker could induce neural activity, but led to lower cytokine expression, which can be a good thing. cytokines are necessary for a healthy immune system, but in the right amounts - cytokines run amok can lead to harmful inflammation. 
 according to wood, ""although cytokines often come from immune cells, like microglia, we thought the cytokines might come from other kinds of brain cells. to help sort out the sources, we isolated the nuclei from different cells in the brain and looked at the genes affected by 40hz flicker. we found that 40hz stimulates immune genes in neurons that may regulate production of cytokines. we also found changed genes in microglia, but they were mainly involved in controlling cell shape or morphology.""  singer added ""to see that such a simple thing, flickering lights and sounds at different frequencies, lead to differences in immune genes was really cool."" 
 indeed, the team saw the effects that different frequencies can have on the microglia, dramatically altering its morphology - its shape and function. ""forty hertz and twenty hertz were both different from no stimulation at all, and in opposite directions,"" singer said. 
 different shapes, different functions 
 at 20hz, microglia assumed their ramified, surveillance mode - lots of branches, or dendrites, reaching out from the cell body. at 40hz, they look more like amoeba, an amorphous blob that eats, or engulfs, pathogens. so, microglia do a different dance based on the rhythm. 
 furthermore, their research revealed an underlying mechanism allowing all of this to happen. it's a protein complex called nuclear factor kappa b, or nfkb. this signaling mechanism, which regulates immune function, is the pathway that links flicker stimulation to inspire the brain rhythms and the resulting immune response. 
 singer, who is a mother, compared these different effects to a toddler making his way in the world. ""when microglia surveil their environment, they stretch out to the things around them, like a toddler touching ever dirty thing they can get their hands on,"" she said. ""and when microglia enter their engulfing state, it's like a toddler sticking everything in their mouth."" 
 she added, ""the important thing is, in some disease contexts, you want the surveillance state - you want to turn down the immune response. in others, you want the more active, engulfing state that we see at the higher frequency."" 
 so, a different kind of stimulation for a different disease state? or a new, non-invasive way to maintain an already healthy brain? possibly both, eventually. 
 ""the potential is, we can non-invasively manipulate the brain's immune system in either direction, turning it up or turning it down, depending on the stimulation,"" singer said. ""that has important implications for using this technology in a lot of different ways, in the presence of disease, or as way to boost this function or that function.""

 two georgia tech students who invented a device to help keep firefighters safe advanced to the final round of the inaugural acc inventure prize competition. zack braun, a computer engineering major, and tyler sisk, an electrical engineering major, will compete against students from for four other universities. the acc inventure prize awards cash prizes to undergraduate students whose innovations aim to solve world problems and make our lives more comfortable. each of the 15 universities in the atlantic coast conference selected a team of student entrepreneurs for the competition, which is taking place at georgia tech. a preliminary round held tuesday evening narrowed the field to five finalists. besides firehud, the other finalists are: biometrix from duke university. this team, led by two women, invented a way to keep athletes and sports teams healthier. their wearable sensor adheres to the skin, collects data and uses cloud services to quantify rehabilitation progress and provide real-time feedback to reduce athletic injuries.  communigift from university of north carolina. this three-member team created a gift-purchasing platform that enables children celebrating their birthday to invite their guests to give to a child in need instead of buying something for the birthday boy or girl. gifts are sent directly from retail sites to sponsoring non-profits, which distribute the items. contraline from university of virginia. this five-member team is developing a male contraceptive that is long-lasting, non-hormonal and reversible. the non-surgical process is safe, effective and more appealing than condoms or vasectomies, inventors said. mocean from boston college. this three-person team developed a real-time music application that allows an unlimited number of people to play a song at the exact same time. it enables anyone with a smart device to become a live radio station. the five teams will pitch their inventions before a live audience and panel of judges tonight starting at 8 p.m. in the ferst center for the arts. georgia public broadcasting will air the show live and 
 stream it here . the winner will receive $15,000 and the second-place finisher will take home $10,000. a $5,000 people's choice award will go the fans' favorite invention. the competition is sponsored by the acc academic consortium, which supports academic initiatives among member universities. the tournament is modeled after georgia tech's inventure prize, which started in 2009 to leverage the maker culture and encourage students to push their ideas even further. braun and sisk -- who are both from newnan, ga. -- advanced to the acc contest after winning tech's inventure prize last month. the first-place prize in that competition included $20,000 and a free u.s. patent filing. their 
 invention is a heads-up-display 
 that attaches to a firefighter's mask and measures heart rate, respiratory rate, blood oxygen level, body temperature, external temperature and other vital signs. this information will help firefighters determine whether they are overexerting themselves and are at risk for cardiac arrest. the device also transmits data to the incident commander on the scene, who can view it on a computer through an app.

firehud-receives-nsf-small-business-grant.txt,"firehud receives nsf small business grant 
 the 2016 inventure prize winners will use an nsf award to conduct additional research and development on a system to protect first responders. 
 a member of the coweta county fire department wears the latest version of the firehud device. georgia tech graduates started the company to protect first responders. 
 feb 07, 2018 
 - atlanta, ga 
 recent georgia tech graduates received a national science foundation (nsf) grant to continue working on a device to improve the safety of firefighters. 
 their device, 
 firehud , received an nsf small business innovation research ( sbir ) grant for $224,143 to conduct research and development work on a biometric internet of things system for first responders. 
 zack braun, who graduated in december with a degree in computer engineering, and tyler sisk, a fellow december graduate with a degree in electrical engineering, invented firehud. the real-time wearable system and heads up display provides biometric and environmental data to firefighters on the job and officials on site. the device measures heart rate, body temperature and external temperatures that can help predict fatigue and prevent injuries. 
 firehud won the 
 2016 inventure prize , an annual georgia tech innovation competition for undergraduate students. braun and sisk also participated in 
 create-x , a series of initiatives to enhance and support entrepreneurship programs among tech students. 
 another georgia tech graduate, joseph boettcher, also joined the company. all three are working on the device full-time. 
 the nsf grant will fund the company for a full year, said braun, firehud ceo. next month they plan to launch pilot studies with local fire departments and hope to deploy about 25 units. 
 braun said the company has three main goals to accomplish with the nsf award, including the research and development of a rugged wearable system that will monitor the physiology of firefighters in real-time and the development of a machine learning algorithm to identify key markers that will indicate the exertion and stamina levels of first responders in chaotic environments. they will also work to develop a long-range radio system capable of transmission within large urban structures.

 updated: 
 april 29, 2022, to reflect additional $1.1 million in adjustments for employee benefits and maintenance and operations. 
 ************* 
 support from the governor and the state legislature, along with healthy state tax revenues, is bringing positive news for the university system of georgia (usg) and its 26 member institutions, including georgia tech. pending approval by governor brian kemp, the university system of georgia will allocate an unprecedented additional $98.3 million to georgia tech for the upcoming fiscal year (fy23). this brings georgia tech's total state appropriations to nearly $457 million - a 27% increase. 
 ""we are deeply grateful to governor kemp, the general assembly, and the university system of georgia for their ongoing support and their continued investment for the coming year,"" said georgia tech president ángel cabrera. ""their willingness to invest in our people - both students and employees - is a testament to their support of higher education as well as georgia tech's commitment to offer an excellent educational experience to our students and a top-notch place to work for every member of our faculty and staff."" 
 the funds appropriated by the state will allow georgia tech to eliminate the special institutional fee, which amounts to $344 per semester for graduate students and $544 for undergraduates. in addition, the board of regents voted to 
 keep tuition steady 
 for the third consecutive year. ""at a time of great national concern over the mounting cost of higher education, it is comforting to see that the cost of a georgia tech education will not only not go up this year but indeed will be reduced,"" cabrera said. ""we are fortunate to be in a state that invests in higher education so that we can offer high quality and affordable options to our students."" 
 the new budget will also fund a 
 cost of living adjustment 
 of $5,000 per employee that will begin to appear this month in employee paychecks. 
 georgia tech's additional $98.3 million in state appropriations for fy23 can be broken down as follows: 
 $38.8 million in enrollment growth funding. 
 $33.6 million to fund the elimination of the special institutional fees. 
 $24.8 million to fund the cost of living adjustment. 
 $1.1 million in adjustments to employee benefits and maintenance and operations. 
 along with next year's budget allocation, the usg also approved several capital projects, to be paid for with institutional funds, at georgia tech including a new 
 student-athlete performance center , an aerospace engineering aircraft hangar facility, and improvements to the blake r. van leer building for electrical and computer engineering, as well as safety and accessibility enhancements to ferst drive and campus streetscapes. the usg also approved the establishment of the master of science in global development. 
 ""we are very appreciative of these allocations and look forward to investing in areas that support our growth and directly benefit our people, spaces, and processes,"" said kelly fox, executive vice president for administration and finance. ""over the next few weeks, we will work diligently to prioritize spending that supports our strategic initiatives and upholds our values - always putting our students first in everything we do."" 
 ""i'd also like to give a special thanks to our institute relations team,"" cabrera said. ""they are instrumental in sharing our story of growth and impact with state leaders and helping us secure resources to help us develop leaders who advance technology and improve the human condition."" 
 georgia tech's institute budget planning and administration will submit the fy23 budget to the board of regents for spending approval in advance of the board of regents meeting in may. the new fiscal year begins july 1.

flesh-eating-leishmania-come-closer-vaccine-against-them-does-too.txt,"as 'flesh-eating' leishmania come closer, a vaccine against them does, too 
 a potentially deadly parasite that can ulcerate skin, nose, mouth and organs could someday meet its match in an experimental vaccine that has now worked in lab tests on humanized mice. 
 there are some 30 species of leishmania parasites, which take on two different forms in their life cycle. illustrated here are promastigotes (top) and amastigotes (bottom) with a typical boil caused by a leishmaniasis infection. rights: istock / getty / purchased / not transferable 
 sep 13, 2017 
 - atlanta, ga 
 parasites that ulcerate the skin, can disfigure the face, and can fatally mutilate internal organs are creeping closer to the southern edges of the united states. 
 no vaccine is available against  leishmania  yet, but researchers have now come closer to changing that. a new experimental vaccine, made with a proprietary biological particle developed at the georgia institute of technology, has immunized laboratory mice that were genetically altered to mimic the human immune system. 
 the vaccine exploits a weakness in 
 leishmania 's tricky chemical camouflage, which normally hides it from the victim's disease-fighting cells, to trigger 
 a forceful immune response against the parasite, according to a new study. 
 second-deadliest parasite 
 leishmania 
 are 
 the second-deadliest parasite s 
 in the world, topped only by malaria, according to the world health organization. there are some 30 strains of 
 leishmania . 
 they are transmitted mainly through the bite of a 
 phlebotomine sand fly , which feeds on blood, and global warming is expanding the insect's potential habitat northward from latin america. the outbreak regions closest to the united states of 
 leishmaniasis, the disease caused by the parasite , have come within roughly 300 miles of the border. 
 as with many diseases, many people who contract 
 leishmania, 
 the parasite, may develop leishmaniasis, the disease, with varying symptoms, or perhaps even show no outward signs of the disease. but when it breaks out, it can cause large skin boils, and some forms severely eat away at the nose and lips, even removing parts of them. 
 if another form of the parasite gets into the bloodstream, it can damage the liver and spleen in a deadly form of the disease called visceral leishmaniasis, also known as black fever. 
 ""if you don't treat it, within 20 to 40 days visceral leishmaniasis very often kills the victim,"" said alexandre marques, a professor in the parasitology department of the universidade federal de minas gerais in brazil, and one of the lead researchers on the new experimental vaccine. conventional treatment, though mostly effective, can leave behind small numbers of the parasite, which can lead the patient to relapse or act as a carrier, in a similar manner as malaria. 
 a vaccine could be better at halting or averting outbreaks. 
 long-awaited vaccine 
 leishmania , which are single-cell organisms about the size of large bacteria, have been a scourge in about 90 countries in south america, africa, the middle east, asia and southern europe. for decades, researchers have worked to find a vaccine against them and similar parasites without success. 
 ""in comparison to viruses and bacteria, these are much more complex organisms and more difficult to crack,"" said m. g. finn, who also led work on the new vaccine. finn is a 
 professor in georgia tech's school of biological sciences 
 and in 
 the school of chemistry and biochemistry, which he also chairs . 
 the new vaccine leverages intimate knowledge that marques's team has gained living and working on the edge of leishmaniasis outbreak regions. ""alex's (marques's) students collect the sand flies, then they extract the parasites in the lab and do complex mass spectrometry and other tests to study their molecular makeup in impressive detail,"" finn said. 
 the team has uncovered minute details on the outer surface of 
 leishmania 
 that make it vulnerable to a human immune reaction. the potential new vaccine, invented at georgia tech, employs a fake virus as bait to attract major immune system forces to these weaknesses to attack them. 
 the fake virus, or virus-like particle, is not infectious, and the body destroys it after use. finn's lab has developed many variations of such particles in recent years, and other products containing it have already been through phase ii human clinical trials. 
 marques and finn 
 published the results of their vaccination development and testing on september 13, 2017, in the journal acs central science. 
 the research was funded by the national institutes of health, children's healthcare of atlanta, and brazil's national council for scientific and technological development. 
 leishmaniasis vaccine q & a 
 here are some questions and answers to help readers better understand how the vaccine would leverage 
 leishmania 's chemical camouflage. 
 what's so tricky about 
 leishmania 's chemical camouflage? 
 the parasites cover themselves in carbohydrates, which look like food and also cover all other cells in the body. so, to the body, the 
 leishmania 
 cells look inoffensive, and the immune system mostly leaves them alone. 
 what's the chink in the camouflage? 
 some of those carbohydrates do actually trigger a mild human immune response. it's not strong enough to really battle leishmaniasis, but it gives marques and finn's vaccine a foot in the door. 
 it's lucky that humans, and some other primates, have this particular immune reaction, because other mammals don't, so this vaccine wouldn't work on them. incidentally, that's why, to test the new vaccine, the laboratory mice have to be genetically altered to make their immune systems react to the carbohydrates the way ours does. 
 how does the fake virus work? 
 ""we use the virus-like particle to highlight a 
 key carbohydrate 
 on the surface of 
 leishmania 
 clearly to the body. this coaxes its immune system into reacting strongly against it as a foreign structure,"" finn said. 
 the immune system goes after the fake virus like guard dogs after an invader. the researchers attach the odd carbohydrate to the fake virus, and that makes the immune system recognize that carbohydrate as a serious threat. immune cells then hunt it down, and, in the process, destroy the parasite that produces it. 
 when could a vaccine be on the market? 
 it's too early to stoke hopes because a lot has to happen before any drug or vaccine can hit the market. but the researchers have some interesting arguments for moving on to human testing. 
 ""normally, in medical testing, you would test next in rabbits or infected cats or dogs,"" finn said. ""but they don't have the right immune system. the only other possibilities are genetically altered pigs, or certain primates, or humans."" 
 as mentioned, the fake virus is a biological nanoparticle that has been tested in humans before without showing toxicity. also, the researchers want to add some more kinds of 
 leishmania 
 camouflage carbohydrates to the fake virus to give the vaccine even more punch. 
 isn't leishmaniasis limited to poverty regions with poor hygiene? 
 absolutely not. 
 it can take hold anywhere people and animals live in high density and certain species of sand flies, and some other insects, can thrive. the insects like warmer weather, which is why climate change is causing the sand fly's habitat to spread north. 
 ""people in developed countries in climates that were cooler will have to start caring about this, as global warming encourages this to spread to them,"" marques said. 
 another potentially deadly 
 insect-borne tropical disease called chagas disease 
 has already made it to three southern u.s. states, and the same researchers are working on a vaccine against it, too. 
 highly cited chemist 
 m. g. finn is a highly cited award-winning chemist. the 
 thompson reuters news agency included finn in its 2013 predictions of possible winners of that year's nobel prize in chemistry . (that year's prize went to different well-deserving researchers and their achievements.)

flexible-wearable-oral-sodium-sensor-could-help-improve-hypertension-control.txt,"flexible, wearable oral sodium sensor could help improve hypertension control 
 researchers have developed a flexible, wearable sensor for measuring how much salt a person consumes. 
 the intraoral electronics with a sodium sensor is based on a breathable elastomeric membrane that resembles a dental retainer. the ultrathin device is flexible and stretchable, and can wirelessly transmit data up to 10 meters. (credit: rob felt, georgia tech).

 - atlanta, ga 
 for people who have hypertension and certain other conditions, eating too much salt raises blood pressure and increases the likelihood of heart complications. to help monitor salt intake, researchers have developed a flexible and stretchable wireless sensing system designed to be comfortably worn in the mouth to measure the amount of sodium a person consumes. 
 based on an ultrathin, breathable elastomeric membrane, the sensor integrates with a miniaturized flexible electronic system that uses bluetooth technology to wirelessly report the sodium consumption to a smartphone or tablet. the researchers plan to further miniaturize the system - which now resembles a dental retainer - to the size of a tooth. 
 ""we can unobtrusively and wirelessly measure the amount of sodium that people are taking in over time,"" explained woon-hong yeo, an assistant professor in the woodruff 
 school of mechanical engineering 
 at the georgia institute of technology. ""by monitoring sodium in real-time, the device could one day help people who need to restrict sodium intake and learn to change their eating habits and diet."" 
 details of the device are reported may 7 in the 
 early edition of the journal proceedings of the national academy of sciences . the device has been tested in three adult study participants who wore the sensor system for up to a week while eating both solid and liquid foods including vegetable juice, chicken soup and potato chips. 
 according to the american heart association, americans on average eat more than 3,400 milligrams of sodium each day, far more than the limit of 1,500 milligrams per day it recommends. the association surveyed a thousand adults and found that ""one-third couldn't estimate how much sodium they ate, and another 54 percent thought they were eating less than 2,000 milligrams of sodium a day."" 
 the sodium sensing system could address that challenge by helping users better track how much salt they consume, yeo said. ""our device could have applications for many different goals involving eating behavior for diet management or therapeutics,"" he added. 
 key to development of the intraoral sensor was replacement of traditional plastic and metal-based electronics with biocompatible and ultrathin components connected using mesh circuitry. sodium sensors are available commercially, but yeo and his collaborators developed a flexible micro-membrane version to be integrated with the miniaturized hybrid circuitry. 
 ""the entire sensing and electronics package was conformally integrated onto a soft material that users can tolerate,"" yeo explained. ""the sensor is comfortable to wear, and data from it can be transmitted to a smartphone or tablet. eventually the information could go a doctor or other medical professional for remote monitoring."" 
 the flexible design began with computer modeling to optimize the mechanical properties of the device for use in the curved and soft oral cavity. the researchers then used their model to design the actual nanomembrane circuitry and choose components. 
 the device can monitor sodium intake in real-time, and record daily amounts. using a smartphone or tablet application, the system could advise users planning meals how much of their daily salt allocation they had already consumed. the device can communicate with a smartphone up to ten meters away. 
 next steps for the sodium sensor are to further miniaturize the device, and test it with users who have the medical conditions to address: hypertension, obesity or diabetes. 
 the researchers would like to do away with the small battery, which must be recharged daily to keep the sensor in operation. one option would be to power the device inductively, which would replace the battery and complex circuit with a coil that could obtain power from a transmitter outside the mouth. 
 the project grew out of a long-term goal of producing an artificial taste system that can sense sweetness, bitterness, ph and saltiness. that work began at virginia commonwealth university, where yeo was an assistant professor before joining georgia tech. 
 in addition to yeo, the paper's authors include yongkuk lee, saswat mishra, and musa mahmood of georgia tech; matthew piper, youngbin kim, connor howe, dong sup lee, katie tieu, james coffey and richard costanzo of virginia commonwealth university; hun-soo byun of chonnam national university in korea, and mahdis shayan and youngjae chun of the university of pittsburgh. 
 this research was funded with a research grant from the medarva foundation, a seed grant from the georgia tech institute for electronics and nanotechnology, a grant by the fundamental research program (pnk5061) of the korea institute of materials science, and startup funding from georgia tech.

 julie kim , associate chair for the  georgia tech school of architecture , is committed to empower entire communities through design thinking and technology. 
 that's why  new america's public interest technology university network (pit-un)  awarded her team a $180,000 grant to expand the work done through kim's lab, the  flourishing communities collaborative . the proposal,  westside neighborhood - english avenue: building a sustainable community through design and technology  received the highest pit-un award at georgia tech this year. 
 ""we have seen what happens when technology that is meant for mass scale audiences, communities, or public citizens of a region, state, or country is designed without their input or considerations for how it might affect them or society at large,"" said  anne-marie slaughter , ceo of new america. 
 ""new america's public interest technology university network (pit-un) was designed to turn that dynamic on its head by making sure that those most proximate to problems are directly present in the crafting of solutions and empowered to do so from an early age. we're excited to support a new group of grantees that are catalyzing public interest technology on their campus,"" slaughter said. 
 flourishing communities collaborative at work 
 for several months, kim, her fellow faculty, and their undergraduate and graduate students have leveraged georgia tech resources to address critical problems in atlanta's westside neighborhood. 
 ""that's why this grant is so special,"" kim said. ""we're working hand in hand with the community. we're providing them with specific tools that allow them to understand how to use design thinking to solve their problems."" 
 ""in this specific circumstance, design thinking is the space of improvisation to address complex problems and to expand the scope of design outside the traditional architectural design studio,"" she said. 
 the flourishing communities collaborative began working in westside last summer with a goal of offering strategies and choices for current residents that help stabilize their community. along with extensive field research and getting to know pillars in the community, kim's group focused on critical opportunities in the neighborhood. 
 ""the need in this neighborhood is great,"" kim said. ""just looking at the figures is eye opening. nearly 80% of the households in this community earn less than the median atlanta household. forty-four percent of the housing is vacant. neighborhood concerns include mounting pressures from external developments and hydrology challenges exacerbated by climate change. yet, the neighborhood is poised for change through the westside land use framework plan (2017), already approved by the community and the city. so, that's where we start, by building on momentum already in place to set positive steps forward to stabilize the community while also bolstering retention."" 
 the neighborhood lacks safe places like libraries, conveniences like food markets, and places for people to gather. 
 ""when we were out on the site last friday, my students saw a woman who was sitting at a bus stop. so they asked her about her thoughts on the community, and which bus she was waiting for. the woman told them she wasn't waiting for a bus; she was sitting there because her friend was getting their hair cut in the nearby barber shop and there wasn't anywhere else to sit."" 
 design thinking and technology 
 the pit-un grant allows kim (the project's principal investigator) and her colleagues to focus on community engagement and social outreach through the lens of technology. kim said the flourishing communities collaborative would leverage co-pi  tarek rakha's  research and expertise in  high performance building , as well as co-pi  danielle willkens'  work using 3d documentation technologies (e.g. lidar, uavs) alongside community outreach and service-learning projects. 
 ""the technology might play out as some innovative kind of fabrication or construction methods,"" she said, ""or we could look at leveraging the neighborhood's finite resources and develop a strategy for repurposing and reusing."" these technological possibilities are driven by design thinking, kim said. 
 ""when you think about technology, you can say that it's ubiquitous. it's all around us, all the time. but it's not equally accessible across all communities."" 
 smart-home and smart-city technologies like photo voltaic panels and other energy saving strategies can have high initial price tags, even if they pay for themselves in the long run, kim said. but for a family like those in the westside neighborhood, an unexpected increase in their electric bill could mean choosing between a week's worth of groceries or paying the higher bill. 
 the challenge in westside isn't just to save money, though. as the name of kim's lab implies, her team is trying to find ways to help westside flourish. a community needs four things to flourish, she said: housing, education, healthcare, and jobs. 
 kim, rakha, and wilkens will propose actionable and affordable housing strategies, suggest new, community-related businesses and jobs that in turn generate local expertise, and research ways to close service gaps. 
 ""i've always thought of the flourishing communities collaborative as similar to a teaching hospital, where you have students working alongside faculty and professionals, just the same way you have residents working alongside attending physicians,"" kim said. 
 ""ultimately we look at empowering through design, through optimistic acts of making and thinking. one of our beliefs is that good design is a human right; it should be accessible to all. and it makes perfect sense for georgia tech to be a part of good design, because our motto is ‘progress and service for all'.""

force-strong-amputee-controls-individual-prosthetic-fingers.txt,"the force is strong: amputee controls individual prosthetic fingers 
 an ultrasonic sensor in a prosthesis allows amputees to control each of their prosthetic fingers individually. 
 jason barnes lost part of his right arm in 2012. he can now play the piano by controlling each of his prosthetic fingers. 
 dec 11, 2017 
 - atlanta, ga 
 luke skywalker's bionic hand is a step closer to reality for amputees in this galaxy. researchers at the georgia institute of technology have created an ultrasonic sensor that allows amputees to control each of their prosthetic fingers individually. it provides fine motor hand gestures that aren't possible with current commercially available devices. 
 the first amputee to use it, a musician who lost part of his right arm five years ago, 
 is now able to play the piano for the first time since his accident . he can even strum the star wars theme song. 
 ""our prosthetic arm is powered by ultrasound signals,"" said gil weinberg, the georgia tech 
 college of design 
 professor who leads the project. ""by using this new technology, the arm can detect which fingers an amputee wants to move, even if they don't have fingers."" 
 jason barnes is the amputee working with weinberg. the 28-year-old was electrocuted during a work accident in 2012, forcing doctors to amputate his right arm just below the elbow. barnes no longer has his hand and most of his forearm but does have the muscles in his residual limb that control his fingers. 
 barnes' everyday prosthesis is similar to the majority of devices on the market. it's controlled by electromyogram (emg) sensors attached to his muscles. he switches the arm into various modes by pressing buttons on the arm. each mode has two programmed moves, which are controlled by him either flexing or contracting his forearm muscles. for example, flexing allows his index finger and thumb to clamp together; contracting closes his fist. 
 ""emg sensors aren't very accurate,"" said weinberg, director of georgia tech's 
 center for music technology . ""they can detect a muscle movement, but the signal is too noisy to infer which finger the person wants to move. we tried to improve the pattern detection from emg for jason but couldn't get finger-by-finger control."" 
 but then the team looked around the lab and saw an ultrasound machine. they partnered with two other georgia tech professors - minoru shinohara, chris fink ( college of sciences ) and levent degertekin ( woodruff school of mechanical engineering ) - and attached an ultrasound probe to the arm. the same kind of probe doctors use to see babies in the womb could watch how barnes' muscles moved. 
 "" that's when we had a eureka moment ,"" said weinberg. 
 when barnes tries to move his amputated ring finger, the muscle movements differ from those seen when he tries to move any other digit. weinberg and the team fed each unique movement into an algorithm that can quickly determine which finger barnes wants to move. the ultrasound signals and machine learning can detect continuous and simultaneous movements of each finger, as well as how much force he intends to use. 
 ""it's completely mind-blowing,"" said barnes. ""this new arm allows me to do whatever grip i want, on the fly, without changing modes or pressing a button. i never thought we'd be able to do this."" 
 this is the second device weinberg's lab has built for barnes. his first love is the drums, so the 
 team fitted him with a prosthetic arm with two drumsticks 
 in 2014. he controlled one of the sticks. the other moved on its own by listening to the music in the room and improvising. 
 the device gave him the chance to drum again. the robotic stick could play faster than any drummer in the world. worldwide attention has sent barnes and weinberg's robots around the globe for concerts across four continents. they've also played at the kennedy center in washington, d.c. and 
 moogfest . 
 that success pushed weinberg to take the next step and create something that gives barnes the dexterity he's lacked since 2012. 
 ""if this type of arm can work on music, something as subtle and expressive as playing the piano, this technology can also be used for many other types of fine motor activities such as bathing, grooming and feeding,"" said weinberg. ""i also envision able-bodied persons being able to remotely control robotic arms and hands by simply moving their fingers.""

 - atlanta, ga 
 a crowd of entrepreneurs, corporate executives, and political leaders gathered at the biltmore wednesday afternoon for an economic development forum, looking at the role technology square has played in the state's economic growth and what it will take to continue expanding. 
 geoff duncan, lieutenant governor of georgia, welcomed guests to ""georgia tech: a driver of economic development."" 
 ""being an entrepreneur is unscripted. it's just in you,"" duncan said. ""as lieutenant governor i want to look for ways to harness and cultivate that potential here in georgia."" 
 he acknowledged the role of education and thanked georgia tech's leaders for striving to make georgia the technology capital of the east coast. 
 the first panel, the innovation center concept, was moderated by parmeet grover, senior partner and managing director with the boston consulting group. he led a discussion with president g.p. ""bud"" peterson and ralph de la vega, former vice chairman of at&t inc. they began by talking about tech square's origins. 
 ""in the late '90s the georgia tech foundation was looking at ways to expand the campus,"" peterson said. ""a decision was made to come across the connector and put a footprint on this side of the interstate. it was a controversial decision that wasn't unanimously supported. but they took a chance and located the foundation here, built the georgia tech hotel and conference center, the bookstore, and the scheller college of business. that turned out to be a hugely important decision that has had a long and very positive impact on georgia tech."" 
 peterson came to georgia tech in 2009 as technology square was evolving. a significant part of georgia tech's strategic planning process was figuring out how the institute could work with the many corporate headquarters located in atlanta. one way was through innovation centers, which first appeared in tech square in 2012. 
 ""when at&t opened the third innovation center in tech square, that gave credibility to what we were trying to do,"" peterson said. ""it was ralph de la vega who helped me understand how an innovation center could add value to the companies that establish them."" 
 de la vega, who was ceo of at&t mobility at the time, said, ""we realized we could no longer wait for people to bring innovation and technology to us. we had to move our people to where innovation was taking place. we were building innovation centers next to academic institutions."" 
 he chose georgia tech as the location because he shared the institute's vision of turning research into an entrepreneurial venture that encourages startups, builds community, and helps to foster an ecosystem. 
 the forum's second panel, georgia's new economy - the startup ecosystem, was facilitated by blake patton, managing partner with tech square ventures and engage. panelists included chris clark, president and ceo, georgia chamber of commerce; lara hodgson, president and ceo, now corp; paul judge, cofounder and partner of tech square labs, and cofounder and executive chairman, pindrop; and hala moddelmog, president and ceo, metro atlanta chamber. 
 patton started by asking the panelists about the key ingredients driving change in atlanta's startup community over the last decade. 
 ""the interest in investing in atlanta startups has gone from negative to neutral to overwhelmingly positive,"" said judge. ""underneath it all, atlanta and georgia have gained the confidence to dream bigger, and it's starting to pay off."" 
 hodgson sees one of atlanta's greatest assets in the mindsets of the people who live and work here. 
 ""atlanta has grit and determination that i don't see in boston or on the west coast. it's a skill that serves us very well,"" she said. ""there's also a lack of fear of growth. you can't live in atlanta and be afraid of growth."" 
 georgia tech's executive vice president for research, chaouki abdallah, gave the closing remarks and cited the institute's growth in the last 10 years. 
 ""in 2009, georgia tech conducted less than $500 million in research. this year that figure is $1 billion, which speaks to the acceleration of change,"" he said. 
 ""the companies moving into tech square appreciate the relationship and teamwork between georgia tech, the metro atlanta chamber, and the state of georgia.""

 four georgia communities developed and will implement smart design solutions to some of the biggest challenges facing the state. the projects, which tackle housing, traffic congestion, sea level rise and shared autonomous vehicles, are supported through the 
 georgia smart communities challenge . 
 this new georgia tech-led initiative brings together industry and public agencies to help local governments implement smart development. the strategies developed by the selected communities will serve as models that could be implemented elsewhere across georgia. 
 the program provides seed funding and access to technical assistance, expert advice and a network of peers. a georgia tech researcher will advise and conduct research in support of each group's goals. 
 the winning proposals are: 
 albany housing data initiative . led by the city of albany the project will evaluate an automated housing registry. the system will allow for improved neighborhood infrastructure and revitalization and encourage a safe and sustainable housing inventory for the city. assigned georgia tech researcher: omar isaac asensio, assistant professor in the school of public policy. 
 shared autonomous vehicle study . led by the city of chamblee the project will study improvements in mobility through the use of autonomous vehicles that travel from marta stations into the community. this will reduce road congestion and increase pedestrian and traveler safety. assigned georgia tech researcher: ellen dunham-jones, professor in the school of architecture. 
 smart sea level tools for emergency planning and response . led by chatham county, this project will develop and test a pilot sensor network for measuring sea level flood risk during natural disasters and storms. the network will improve flood warnings, emergency response action plans and predictions for future flood events. assigned georgia tech researcher: kim cobb, georgia power chair and professor in the school of earth and atmospheric sciences. 
 connected vehicle technology master plan . led by gwinnett county, this project will evaluate traffic management technologies for improved vehicle mobility throughout the region. the technology will improve safety and connectivity. assigned georgia tech researcher: angshuman guin, senior research engineer in the school of civil and environmental engineering. 
 ""georgia tech is excited at the opportunity to collaborate with four of georgia's dynamic communities in this inaugural georgia smart communities challenge,"" president g.p. ""bud"" peterson said. ""the enthusiasm for this new program has been gratifying, and we look forward to seeing how georgia tech's research expertise and the communities' vision of smart development mesh together to improve the lives of their citizens. these groundbreaking projects have the potential to become models for other communities around our state."" 
 georgia smart supports communities of all sizes, including smaller towns, which may not have been as prominent in smart development because of a lack of resources. seventeen communities applied for the program. 
 while each selected team is led by a local government, the work will be a collaboration between different government agencies and nonprofits. 
 the teams will each receive $50,000 in grants and $25,000 from georgia tech in researcher support. the selected communities each raised an additional $50,000. 
 georgia power is the lead sponsor of the program, with additional financial support from the atlanta regional commission. 
 ""at georgia power, we're committed to investments in smart technologies and collaborative partnerships that improve service to our customers, as well as the quality of life in local communities,"" said latanza adjel, vice president for sales at georgia power, who leads the company's efforts in energy efficiency and other areas.

 georgia smart communities challenge plans 
 four communities are the first winners of the georgia smart communities challenge. learn more about their plans: 
 albany housing data analytics and visualization initiative 
 lead: albany 
 collaborators: department of community and economic development; dougherty county; albany, georgia initiative for community housing; and fight albany blight 
 this initiative seeks to bridge the gap between available data and the need for a comprehensive, flexible and accurate database to effectively manage the albany housing inventory. the end result will allow a better measurement of public funds allocated for housing and neighborhood structure repairs and enhancements, using an automated data analytics and visualization tool. the initiative also allows the city and its collaborators to engage with residents and become part of the solution to the communities' housing issues. 
 smart sea level tools for emergency planning and response 
 lead: chatham county 
 collaborators: savannah and creative coast 
 this project will develop and test a pilot sensor network for measuring sea level flood risk during natural disasters and storms. sea level rise presents a risk to coastal communities and those risks become more pronounced during hurricane landfalls when extreme flooding exacts a major toll on public safety and key infrastructure. the proposed sensor network will improve flood warnings, emergency response action plans and predictions for future flood events. this project is considered the first of its kind for the region and the expectation is it will serve as a model for future smart designs along georgia's coastline. 
 shared autonomous vehicle study 
 lead: chamblee 
 collaborators: doraville, marta, stantec and assembly community improvement district (cid) 
 this project will study improvements in mobility through the use of shared autonomous vehicles, which travel from marta stations into the community. this option will reduce road congestion, increase pedestrian and traveler safety and improve equity in the community. while the project will look at challenges surrounding the ""last mile"" - getting from a transportation hub to a final destination - there will be additional implications. the research will look at the potential impacts of autonomous vehicle technology on land use, attracting residents and employees, expanding access to marta, prioritizing pedestrian and bike mobility; and improving public health. 
 connected vehicle technology master plan 
 lead by gwinnett county 
 collaborators: berkeley lake, duluth, norcross, suwanee and georgia department of transportation 
 this project will evaluate traffic management technologies for improved vehicle mobility throughout the region. it will use the latest technological advances in traffic management systems to improve traffic congestion and reduce crashes along the peachtree boulevard corridor. in addition to modeling how to set up a connected vehicle system, this project will help agencies charged with new traffic safety and mobility to manage expectations and costs, and fully realize the benefits of these new technologies.

 - atlanta, ga 
 as diversity, equity, and inclusion continue to be among the nation's most important focus areas, a georgia tech researcher has created a framework to help his peers utilize more equitable data in their energy and environmental engineering studies. 
 one of 
 joe bozeman 's core research areas is america's food consumption habits and how they affect climate change, specifically greenhouse gas emissions. the assistant professor in georgia tech's 
 school of civil and environmental engineering 
 looks at food intake across a number of groups, including socioeconomic status, race, and age. using that data, he's able to create models that better inform communities and assist policy makers. 
 however, the most consistent, thorough data he uses to develop those models are from 2005-2010. five-year datasets before and after that timeframe aren't standardized, as all sociodemographic groups are not included. this makes it difficult for bozeman to draw comparisons that are inclusive of everyone across spatial scales and time periods. 
 it's one reason why he and researchers at carnegie mellon university and the university of colorado denver have 
 published a framework and 10-step process 
 to help engineers, scientists, and community members standardize their data related to energy and environmental topics. their goal is to integrate equity into these fields, a practice bozeman and his colleagues call systemic equity. by doing so, they hope to create a system that all demographics of groups are included, including age groups, income levels, race, and ethnicity. read the entire story on the college of engineering website.

future-5g-infrastructure-could-be-built-tile-tile.txt,"the future of 5g+ infrastructure could be built tile by tile 
 manos tentzeris and his team of georgia tech researchers flex their novel 5g+‐enabled massively scalable tile arrays 
 genaro soto valle, manos tentzeris, kexin hu, and yepu cui with the fabricated proof-of-concept tile arrays and inkjet-printed tile arrays. 
 mar 29, 2022 
 - atlanta, ga 
 5g+ (5g / beyond 5g) is the fastest-growing segment and the only significant opportunity for investment growth in the wireless network infrastructure market, according to  the latest forecast by gartner, inc.  but currently 5g+ technologies rely on large antenna arrays that are typically bulky and come only in very limited sizes, making them difficult to transport and expensive to customize. 
 researchers from georgia tech's college of engineering have developed a novel and flexible solution to address the problem. their additively manufactured tile-based approach can construct on-demand, massively scalable arrays of 5g+ (5g / beyond 5g)‐enabled smart skins with the potential to enable intelligence on nearly any surface or object. the study,  recently published in scientific reports , describes the approach, which is not only much easier to scale and customize than current practices, but features no performance degradation whenever flexed or scaled to a very large number of tiles. 
 ""typically, there are a lot of smaller wireless network systems working together, but they are not scalable. with the current techniques, you can't increase, decrease, or direct bandwidth, especially for very large areas,"" said  manos tentzeris , ken byers professor in flexible electronics in the  school of electrical and computer engineering . ""being able to utilize and scale this novel tile-based approach makes this possible."" 
 tentzeris says his team's modular application equipped with 5g+ capability has the potential for immediate, large-scale impact as the telecommunications industry continues to rapidly transition to standards for faster, higher capacity, and lower latency communications. 
 building the tiles 
 in georgia tech's new approach, flexible and additively manufactured tiles are assembled onto a single, flexible underlying layer. this allows tile arrays to be attached to a multitude of surfaces. the architecture also allows for very large 5g+ phased / electronically steerable antenna array networks to be installed on-the-fly. according to tentzeris, attaching a tile array to an unmanned aerial vehicle (uav) is even a possibility to surge broadband capacity in low coverage areas. 
 in the study, the team fabricated a proof-of-concept, flexible 5×5-centimeter tile array and wrapped it around a 3.5-centimeter radius curvature. each tile includes an antenna subarray and an integrated, beamforming integrated circuit on an underlying tiling layer to create a smart skin that can seamlessly interconnect the tiles into very large antenna arrays and massive multiple-input multiple-outputs (mimos) - the practice of housing two or more antennas within a single wireless device. tile-based array architectures on rigid surfaces with single antenna elements have been researched before, but do not include the modularity, additive manufacturability, or flexible implementation of the georgia tech design. 
 the proposed modular tile approach means tiles of identical sizes can be manufactured in large quantities and are easily replaceable, reducing the cost of customization and repairs. essentially, this approach combines removable elements, modularity, massive scalability, low cost, and flexibility into one system. 
 5g+ is just the beginning 
 while the tiling architecture has demonstrated the ability to greatly enhance 5g+ technologies, its combination of flexible and conformal capabilities has the potential to be applied in numerous different environments, the georgia tech team says. 
 ""the shape and features of each tile scale can be singular and can accommodate different frequency bands and power levels,"" said tentzeris. ""one could have communications capabilities, another sensing capabilities, and another could be an energy harvester tile for solar, thermal, or ambient rf energy. the application of the tile framework is not limited to communications."" 
 internet of things, virtual reality, as well as smart manufacturing / industry 4.0 - a technology-driven approach that utilizes internet-connected ""intelligent"" machinery to monitor and fully automate the production process - are additional areas of application the team is excited to explore. 
 ""the tile-architecture's mass scalability makes its applications particularly diverse and virtually ubiquitous. from structures the size of dams and buildings, to machinery or cars, down to individual health-monitoring wearables,"" said tentzeris. ""we're moving in a direction where everything will be covered in some type of a wireless conformal smart skin encompassing electronically steerable antenna arrays of widely diverse sizes that will allow for effective monitoring."" 
 the team now looks forward to testing the approach outside the lab on large, real-world structures. they are currently working on the fabrication of much larger, fully inkjet-printed tile arrays (256+ elements) that will be presented at the upcoming international microwave symposium (ieee ims 2022) - the flagship ieee conference in rf and microwave engineering. the ims presentation will introduce a new tile-based large-area architecture version that will allow assembly of customizable tile arrays in a rapid and low-cost fashion for numerous conformal platforms and 5g+ enabled applications.

 bucking conventional wisdom about semiconductors, a new class of light-emitting materials is flexible, easily produced from solution, and could be painted onto a surface.

 [yes, hoip quantum properties look extremely robust, and their physics are mystifying] 
 some novel materials that sound too good to be true turn out to be true and good. an emergent class of semiconductors, which could affordably light up our future with nuanced colors emanating from lasers, lamps, and even window glass, could be the latest example. 
 these materials are very radiant, easy to process from solution, and energy-efficient. the nagging question of whether hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites (hoips) could really work just received a very affirmative answer 
 in a new international study 
 led by physical chemists at the georgia institute of technology. 
 with significant effort, researchers succeeded in testing an existing hoip and observed a ""richness"" of semiconducting physics created by what could be described as electrons dancing on chemical underpinnings that wobble like a funhouse floor in an earthquake. that bucks conventional wisdom because established 
 semiconductors 
 rely upon rigidly stable chemical foundations, that is to say, quieter molecular frameworks, to produce the desired quantum properties. 
 ""we don't know yet how it works to have these stable quantum properties in this intense molecular motion,"" said first author felix thouin, a graduate research assistant at georgia tech. ""it defies physics models we have to try to explain it. it's like we need some new physics."" 
 quantum properties surprise 
 their gyrating jumbles have made hoips challenging to examine, but the team of researchers from a total of five research institutes in four countries succeeded in measuring a prototypical hoip and found its quantum properties on par with those of established, molecularly rigid semiconductors, many of which are 
 graphene -based. 
 ""the properties were at least as good as in those materials and may be even better,"" said 
 carlos silva, a professor in georgia tech's school of chemistry and biochemistry . not all semiconductors also absorb and emit light well, but hoips do, making them 
 optoelectronic 
 and thus potentially useful in lasers, leds, other lighting applications, and also in photovoltaics. 
 the lack of molecular-level rigidity in hoips also plays into them being more flexibly produced and applied. 
 silva co-led the study with physicist 
 ajay ram srimath kandada . their team published the results of their study on two-dimensional hoips on march 8, 2018, 
 in the journal 
 physical review materials . their research was funded by eu horizon 2020, the natural sciences and engineering research council of canada, the fond québécois pour la recherche, the research council of canada, and the national research foundation of singapore. 
 the ‘solution solution' 
 commonly, semiconducting properties arise from static crystalline lattices of neatly interconnected atoms. in silicon, for example, which is used in most commercial solar cells, they are interconnected silicon atoms. the same principle applies to graphene-like semiconductors. 
 ""these lattices are structurally not very complex,"" silva said. ""they're only one atom thin, and they have strict two-dimensional properties, so they're much more rigid."" 
 ""you forcefully limit these systems to two dimensions,"" said srimath kandada, who is a 
 marie curie international fellow 
 at georgia tech and the italian institute of technology. ""the atoms are arranged in infinitely expansive, flat sheets, and then these very interesting and desirable optoelectronic properties emerge."" 
 these proven materials impress. so, why pursue hoips, except to explore their baffling physics? because they may be more practical in important ways. 
 ""one of the compelling advantages is that they're all made using low-temperature processing from solutions,"" silva said. ""it takes much less energy to make them."" 
 by contrast, graphene-based materials are produced at high temperatures in small amounts that can be tedious to work with. ""with this stuff (hoips), you can make big batches in solution and coat a whole window with it if you want to,"" silva said. 
 funhouse in an earthquake 
 for all an hoip's wobbling, it's also a very ordered lattice with its own kind of rigidity, though less limiting than in the customary two-dimensional materials. 
 ""it's not just a single layer,"" srimath kandada said. ""there is a very specific perovskite-like geometry."" 
 perovskite 
 refers to the shape of an hoips crystal lattice, which is a layered scaffolding. 
 ""the lattice self-assembles,"" srimath kandada said, ""and it does so in a three-dimensional stack made of layers of two-dimensional sheets. but hoips still preserve those desirable 2d quantum properties."" 
 those sheets are held together by interspersed layers of another molecular structure that is a bit like a sheet of rubber bands. that makes the scaffolding wiggle like a funhouse floor. 
 ""at room temperature, the molecules wiggle all over the place. that disrupts the lattice, which is where the electrons live. it's really intense,"" silva said. ""but surprisingly, the quantum properties are still really stable."" 
 having quantum properties work at room temperature without requiring ultra-cooling is important for practical use as a semiconductor. 
 going back to what hoip stands for -- hybrid organic-inorganic 
 perovskites 
 - this is how the experimental material fit into the hoip chemical class: it was a hybrid of inorganic layers of a lead iodide (the rigid part) separated by organic layers (the rubber band-like parts) of phenylethylammonium (chemical formula (pea) 2 pbi 4 ). 
 the lead in this prototypical material could be swapped out for a metal safer for humans to handle before the development of an applicable material. 
 electron choreography 
 hoips are great semiconductors because their electrons do an acrobatic square dance. 
 usually, electrons live in an orbit around the nucleus of an atom or are shared by atoms in a chemical bond. but hoip chemical lattices, like all semiconductors, are configured to share electrons more broadly. 
 energy levels in a system can free the electrons to run around and participate in things like the flow of electricity and heat. the orbits, which are then empty, are called electron holes, and they want the electrons back. 
 ""the hole is thought of as a positive charge, and of course, the electron has a negative charge,"" silva said. ""so, hole and electron attract each other."" 
 the electrons and holes race around each other like dance partners pairing up to what physicists call an "" exciton ."" excitons act and look a lot like particles themselves, though they're not really particles. 
 hopping biexciton light 
 in semiconductors, millions of excitons are correlated, or choreographed, with each other, which makes for desirable properties, when an energy source like electricity or laser light is applied. additionally, excitons can pair up to form biexcitons, boosting the semiconductor's energetic properties. 
 ""in this material, we found that the biexciton binding energies were high,"" silva said. ""that's why we want to put this into lasers because the energy you input ends up to 80 or 90 percent as biexcitons."" 
 biexcitons bump up energetically to absorb input energy. then they contract energetically and pump out light. that would work not only in lasers but also in leds or other surfaces using the optoelectronic material. 
 ""you can adjust the chemistry (of hoips) to control the width between biexciton states, and that controls the wavelength of the light given off,"" silva said. ""and the adjustment can be very fine to give you any wavelength of light."" 
 that translates into any color of light the heart desires.

 research next 
 mar 16, 2021 
 - atlanta, ga 
 research universities will likely face significant challenges ahead, and addressing them begins with understanding the issues involved. that is the goal for the phase 1 report from the commission on research next (crn), an initiative brought together by georgia tech's executive vice president for research, chaouki t. abdallah. 
 the crn - led by tim lieuwen, regents professor, david s. lewis jr. chair in the daniel guggenheim school of aerospace engineering, and executive director of the strategic energy institute; and wen masters, deputy director, information and cyber sciences in the georgia tech research institute (gtri) - tapped the knowledge and expertise of georgia tech faculty, staff, and students to analyze what the research landscape will look like ahead, for georgia tech and for other research-intensive universities. 
 the report's authors will provide an overview of their findings at a town hall meeting on wednesday, march 17, at 1 p.m. at 
 primetime.bluejeans.com / a2m / live-event / czadczdq . the phase 1 report will be available online after the presentation at 
 researchnext.gatech.edu . 
 the report includes six chapters: 
 framing the research landscape (chapter 1) sets the stage by asking one question: if we were to develop the university research enterprise from scratch, what would it look like? this question arises from the growing complexity and interconnectedness of modern research universities. 
 the world beyond (chapter 2) analyzes the external global factors that are beyond the control of any individual research university, but which affect how these universities function. specifically, it addresses how evolving conditions could shape the topics, methods, funding, partnerships, and other resources important to conducting research. 
 research that matters (chapter 3) identifies grand challenges, emerging topics, and requisite methods that will be addressed at major research universities. by tackling these areas, leading research universities will enhance society by fostering discovery through curiosity-driven research. 
 working with others (chapter 4) focuses on university partnerships, analyzing the connection between research, education, and the value flow between them. in particular, it addresses the question of how research universities can cultivate a portfolio of purposeful strategic relationships, amplifying impact across individual, institutional, city, state, regional, national, and global dimensions. 
 the world within (chapter 5) examines the explicit and implicit functions and structures employed by the university research ecosystem to carry out its mission. 
 chapter 6's closing remarks bring together the findings and set the stage for the second phase of the initiative - developing a plan for how the georgia tech research enterprise will respond to the challenges identified. 
 a second team of faculty, staff, and students is now working on phase 2 of the effort, which will be to develop a strategy for how georgia tech's research enterprise will - in alignment with the institute's new strategic plan - move forward into the decades ahead. there are 82 members of committees working on the six goal teams for phase 2.

fy24-budget-allocations-provide-support-people-growth-and-performance.txt,"fy24 budget allocations provide support for people, growth, and performance 
 $484 million in state appropriations for fiscal year 2024 opens the door for georgia tech leadership to prioritize areas of investment. 
 jul 03, 2023 
 the university system of georgia (usg) board of regents (bor) recently voted to allocate $484 million in state appropriations to georgia tech for fiscal year 2024 (fy24) - a 6% increase over last year. this opened the door for georgia tech leadership to prioritize areas of investment and finalize allocations for the upcoming fiscal year. 
 overall, the usg's fy24 budget included a $66 million decrease in state funding which will affect teaching budgets across the state. georgia tech's portion of the decrease is roughly $10 million, which was based on its share of state appropriations among the 26 usg institutions. 
 additionally, the bor is maintaining tuition and mandatory student fees at current levels for most usg institutions, including georgia tech, in the 2023-24 academic year. 
 in light of limited new funding, georgia tech leadership, along with the administration and finance dean's council, budget advisory committee, and institute budget planning and administration, has worked to ensure that funds are conservatively and strategically allocated. 
 ""now more than ever, it is important for us to demonstrate our commitment to financial stewardship, ensuring that every dollar is spent in a timely manner and invested to support our students, mission, and strategic plan,"" said jim fortner, vice president for finance and planning and interim chief financial officer. ""we prioritized our allocations to enable us to continue to advance our instructional, research, and service missions, and prioritize our people, growth, and performance."" 
 the following q&a with jamie fernandes, executive director for institute budget planning and administration, provides additional details on the fy24 budget, including revenue sources, where funds are being allocated, and how leadership prioritized allocations. 
 how will state earnings and increased tuition revenue affect georgia tech? 
 we are grateful to the bor and the state for our formula earnings, which generated an additional $21.3 million for fy24. in addition to these formula earnings, we project a $7.9 million increase in tuition revenue associated with enrollment growth and $3 million growth in our indirect cost recoveries.  with this growth, we did not have to consider a budget reduction in fy24, and we were able to allocate funds for the institute's highest priorities. 
 what are some of the key campus allocations for fy24? 
 they are focused on three primary areas: people, growth, and performance. 
 supporting students, faculty, and staff ($17.6m) 
 $13.1 million to assist with cost-of-living adjustment funding. 
 $3.9 million for faculty and staff retention and compression, strategic hires, and faculty promotion and tenure. 
 $670,000 to subsidize graduate student's' health insurance. 
 facilitating growth ($13.8m) 
 $5.1 million to support instruction, including new tenure and non-tenure track faculty lines. 
 $5.6 million to support faculty research and related indirect cost expenses. 
 $1.7 million to support previous growth in class sizes and course sections. 
 $1.4 million for development initiatives. 
 improving performance and reinforcing compliance ($2.2m) 
 $1.4 million for facility contract increases and maintenance and operations expenditures. 
 $800,000 for memberships, background checks, and other compliance activities. 
 what were the determining factors in how allocations were prioritized once the budget was approved? 
 the limited new funds available required careful prioritization by leadership. we worked with our 
 budget governance committees 
 to prioritize planned expenditures to enable us to continue to advance our instructional, research, and service missions. 
 additional information on the fy24 budget, including allocations, will be provided as it becomes available.

gcmi-and-t3-labs-support-novel-therapy-reduce-heart-injuries.txt,"gcmi and t3 labs support novel therapy to reduce heart injuries 
 a new treatment could prevent damaging effects of heart attacks. 
 jun 02, 2022 
 - atlanta, ga 
 heart attacks and surgeries like angioplasty, bypass, or transplants can lead to organ and blood vessel damage called reactive oxygen species (ros). ros is generated from four sources in cardiac tissue after heart attacks or reperfusion injury, the restoration of blood flow to previously deprived tissue: mitochondria, nadph oxidase, uncoupled endothelial nitric oxide synthase, and xanthine oxidase. but a new treatment could prevent these damaging effects. 
 partnering with the 
 global center for medical innovation (gcmi) 
 translational testing and training laboratories, inc. (t3), lindon h. young, the director of the endocrinology and introduction to human disease and therapeutics courses in the doctor of osteopathic medicine program at the philadelphia college of osteopathic medicine, is developing this therapy. 
 ""these treatments could be used to help reduce damage to the heart from ros during procedures such as percutaneous coronary intervention after heart attack,"" he said. ""this treatment is aimed at improving the heart function and hospitalizations / morbidity post myocardial infarction."" 
 young is testing his treatment on pigs with induced ischemia, or loss of blood flow, for an hour via balloon catheter followed by three-plus hours of reperfusion, or when blood returns to oxygen-deprived tissue. treatment starts at the onset of reperfusion via an intra-arterial administration through the left anterior descending artery of the left coronary artery. during the procedure, the researchers will take blood samples and measurements such as ekg readings and blood pressure to monitor the animal's response. researchers then observe the heart tissue and effects of treatment. 
 this methodology came directly from young's partnership with t3. 
 ""the surgeons told us they are most likely to deliver this therapy straight to the artery,"" he said. ""adopting a protocol that more closely mirrors the actual clinical application in humans, was a high value recommendation."" 
 the study is already producing promising results and could lead to more funding. 
 ""the t3 labs team gave us great advice outside of our area of expertise on the procedure even if it meant protocol deviation, on the fly, because of their high level of confidence in clinical relevance,"" young said.

genomic-study-412-anthrax-strains-provides-new-virulence-clues.txt,"genomic study of 412 anthrax strains provides new virulence clues 
 georgia tech and cdc researchers have provided new information about the factors affecting the virulence of anthrax. 
 under high magnification, this digitally-colorized scanning electron microscope image depicts endospores from bacillus anthracis bacteria. these endospores can live for many years, which enables these bacteria to survive in a dormant state. (cdc image) 
 aug 29, 2018 
 - atlanta, ga 
 by analyzing genomic sequences from more than 400 strains of the bacterium that causes anthrax, researchers have provided the first evidence that the severity - technically known as virulence - of  specific strains may be related to the number of copies of certain plasmids they carry. plasmids are genetic structures of the cell that can reproduce independently, and are responsible for producing the anthrax toxin and other virulence factors. 
 the research found that bacteria strains collected from humans and animals tended to have more copies of the virulence plasmids than those collected from environmental sources. the research, a collaboration between scientists at the georgia institute of technology and the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc), used cdc's collection of 
 bacillus anthracis 
 strains gathered from around the world beginning in the 1950s. 
 ""there is a hypothesis that the copy number - number of copies of the plasmids - plays a role in how virulent each strain is,"" said 
 kostas konstantinidis , a professor in the 
 school of civil and environmental engineering 
 at the georgia institute of technology. ""we want to understand which are the more virulent strains, which are less virulent and what explains the difference. this study provides the first evidence that there is a significant difference in plasmid copy number that may be related to the virulence. but more research is needed to test this emerging hypothesis."" 
 the research, which was sponsored by the cdc and the national science foundation, was reported august 14 in the journal 
 msystems , an open access journal from the american society for microbiology. the study involved more than 600 gigabytes of data, which will be shared with other researchers working to understand anthrax. 
 in 
 b. anthracis , two plasmids - known as pxo1 and pxo2 - are autonomous and independent pieces of dna that encode the toxin and other virulence factors. in bacteria, plasmids like these tend to move around independently of the organisms' main chromosomes, and can jump from one strain to another via genetic mechanisms of dna transfer. bacterial resistance to antibiotics can also be transferred through plasmid movement, for instance. interestingly, this study found that the anthrax plasmids show limited genetic exchange between strains; rather, they are inherited from the ancestor, similar to the chromosomes. 
 ""this work and additional analyses performed at georgia tech and cdc on these genomes from strains of 
 b. anthracis 
 from around the world help further define the global diversity of this health threat,"" said alex hoffmaster, chief of cdc's zoonotic select agent lab and a co-author on the article. ""understanding more about the strains and their distribution can help us more easily determine whether anthrax cases were caused by natural or man-made sources so we can respond as needed to protect the public's health."" 
 the research could also provide information about other organisms, konstantinidis said. ""beyond 
 b. anthracis , this work could help provide a better understanding of the virulence potential of other organisms carrying similar plasmids. being able to distinguish between more virulent and less virulent strains is a broader challenge for microbiology."" 
 the study began with researchers from the cdc's division of high-consequence pathogens and pathology, who used next-generation techniques to sequence diverse strains of 
 b. anthracis . the agency provided its data to the konstantinidis laboratory at georgia tech, where graduate research assistant angela pena-gonzalez led the bioinformatics analysis of the data. 
 ""we were able to use the sequencing data to calculate the correlation of the copy number with the source of each strain,"" she explained. ""we used the whole length of the plasmid to calculate the copy number, and our results were based on the analysis of hundreds of strains obtained from several sources - humans, animals and the environment - and not just a couple of them. this was an advantage of our study."" 
 analytical techniques developed at georgia tech allowed the whole genome comparisons to be done on the more than 400 genomes - a substantial data science challenge. the research revealed that b. anthracis genomes carried, on average, 3.86 and 2.29 copies of the pxo1 and pxo2 plasmids respectively, and that there was a positive linear correlation between the copy numbers of the two plasmids. 
 ""the technology to do this whole genome sequencing is available, but the processing of the data and the interpretation is not yet very straightforward,"" konstantinidis said. ""the very magnitude of the data requires a specific process and considerable experience. the way in which we analyzed this data was not even available two years ago when we started the study."" 
 beyond the possible correlation of copy number of virulence, the study also showed the genome of the strains was surprisingly consistent. ""the work shows that these plasmids are relatively stable, though we found a few strains that had different varieties of the plasmids that seem to have attenuated the virulence,"" he said. 
 a next step would be to investigate further the possible correlation between copy number and virulence in animal studies. 
 konstantinidis hopes to continue collaborating with the cdc to gain a better understanding of virulence and other factors in anthrax and other organisms that have implications for public health. 
 ""the cdc has unique resources like this collection of anthrax strains, and we hope to continue this collaboration to further understand what is going on with this and other pathogens,"" he said. ""there are a lot of applications to public health and to improving our understanding of the basic biology behind these organisms."" 
 in addition to those already mentioned, the work included luis m. rodriguez-r from the georgia tech school of civil and environmental engineering; and chung k. marston, jay e. gee, christopher a. gulvik, cari b. kolton, elke saile and michael frace from the cdc. 
 this work was supported by united states national science foundation (nsf) award number 1356288 and dhhs / phs / cdc award number rf023, and by colciencias-colombian administrative department for science, technology. the findings and conclusions in this work are those of the authors and do not necessarily represent the official positions of the nsf or cdc.

genomics-technique-could-accelerate-detection-foodborne-bacterial-outbreaks.txt,"genomics technique could accelerate detection of foodborne bacterial outbreaks 
 a new testing methodology could accelerate the diagnosis of foodborne bacterial outbreaks. 
 a microbiologist uses next-generation sequencing technology to identify a bacterial dna fingerprint. (credit: centers for disease control and prevention). 
 nov 30, 2016 
 - atlanta, ga 
 a new testing methodology based on metagenomics could accelerate the diagnosis of foodborne bacterial outbreaks, allowing public health officials to identify the microbial culprits in less than a day. the methodology could also identify co-infections with secondary microbes, determine the specific variant of the pathogen, and help alert health officials to the presence of new or unusual pathogens. 
 researchers from the georgia institute of technology and the u.s. centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) recently compared the new methodology against traditional culture-based methods with samples from two severe outbreaks of 
 salmonella , a common foodborne pathogen. the metagenomics approach - which relies on dna sequencing and bioinformatics analysis of the resulting sequencing data -- not only correctly identified the bacterial culprit, but also found a possible coinfection with a second important pathogen, 
 staphylococcus . 
 widespread use of the new shotgun metagenomics methodology could improve real-time disease surveillance, provide a better quantitative picture of pathogen abundance and help scientists and doctors understand the response of the body's natural microbiome. supported by the cdc and the national science foundation, the research was reported november 23 in the journal 
 applied and environmental microbiology . 
 ""when we receive the samples, we can move directly to characterizing them by sequencing the genomes of the microbes that are in the sample without waiting for conventional culturing techniques,"" explained 
 kostas konstantinidis , the carlton wilder associate professor in the georgia tech 
 school of civil and environmental engineering . ""using computational analysis, we can then say what the pathogen is and identify the variant, its virulence factors, even what antibiotic might be effective against it. that can usually be done in a single day."" 
 conventional techniques used for identifying foodborne bacteria involve culturing the microbes to increase the numbers necessary for detection. this takes time, as long as two or three days, and some bacteria don't grow on traditional culture media and could be missed. polymerase chain reaction (pcr) can also be used to identify pathogenic bacteria, but it also relies on isolating the unknown microbes from a culture. 
 metagenomics technology has already been used to analyze the microbial content of everything from lake ecosystems to drinking water in pipes. the evaluation of samples from separate bacterial outbreaks in alabama and colorado is one of the very first applications of the methodology for diagnosing foodborne bacteria. 
 ""stool samples are very complex and contain lots of different dna from humans, healthy bacteria, and the food you ate,"" explained andrew huang, ph.d., a microbiologist / bioinformatician in 
 cdc's enteric diseases laboratory branch . ""the process of generating the dna fingerprint of the bacteria directly from a sick patient's stool is like finding a needle in a haystack of all kinds of dna. because of this, the use of metagenomics for disease detection is in the early stages of research and development. however, this study shows the potential to use stools from healthy and sick people directly to determine who is involved in an outbreak, which will revolutionize the way we detect and monitor for foodborne disease in the future."" 
 metagenomics identifies the microbes present by sequencing all of the dna present in a sample and comparing the genomic data to a database of known microbes. in addition to identifying the bacteria present in the samples, the methodology can also measure the relative abundance of each microbial species and their virulence potential, among other things. 
 ""currently, the most advanced dna fingerprinting method, whole genome sequencing, requires first pulling out, or isolating in a pure culture, the bacteria that made a person sick to generate a fingerprint,"" said huang, who co-leads a group working on culture independent and metagenomics subtyping. ""metagenomics differs from whole genome sequencing because it could allow us to sequence all the dna in a patient's sample. it could allow us to skip the isolation steps and go directly from a stool sample to a highly detailed dna fingerprint of the bacteria that made you sick. this method saves time and provides more detail that could be helpful for diagnosing a patient and identifying an outbreak."" 
 in the two 2013 outbreaks investigated, the traditional diagnostic technique and the metagenomics methodology arrived at the same answers, but the metagenomics data provided specific information about the bacterial phenotype involved and identified a secondary 
 staphylococcus aureus 
 pathogen present in two of the samples tested. knowing the specific phenotype can help in pinpointing the origins of an outbreak, while information about the secondary infection may help explain related factors such as the severity of the infection. 
 scientists were also able to rule out one species - 
 escherichia coli 
 (or 
 e. coli ) - because the variant present was not of a virulent type. variants of this bacteria are present naturally in the gut microbiome (called ""commensal 
 e. coli "") while other variants are notorious enteric pathogens. metagenomics showed the abundant 
 e. coli 
 population in the outbreak samples was probably commensal, and its growth may have been accelerated when conditions became more favorable during the 
 salmonella 
 infection. in the two cases evaluated, scientists were able to determine that although the symptoms were similar, the outbreaks were caused by different variants of 
 salmonella 
 and therefore were probably not connected. 
 as many as half of foodborne disease outbreaks are never attributed to a source. those outbreaks may be caused by new infectious agents, or by microbes not commonly seen in food. the metagenomic methodology could help identify unknown microbes, potentially providing advance warning of new outbreaks. 
 ""without going through culture methods, we are able to see all of the microbes that are in the sample,"" konstantinidis said. ""we can get this information in a day or so, which is quite important in selecting the right antibiotic to combat the infection, controlling the outbreak and working with food producers to recall items that caused the outbreak. the sooner we have the answer, the better."" 
 though the study confirmed the benefits expected, two challenges must be addressed before the new approach can go into widespread use, konstantinidis said. 
 the first is the cost, which can be significantly higher than traditional approaches, suggesting the metagenomics test might be used first in complicated cases. the second challenge is in removing human dna from the samples. all dna must be sequenced, but the human dna can account for as much as 99 percent of the genomic data, so removing it from consideration could accelerate the analysis.

 georgia aim selected to highlight the importance of community-based work in achieving equity. 
 remote video url 
 feb 16, 2024 
 georgia aim, part of georgia tech's  enterprise innovation institute , works to drive ai adoption to lead the next revolution in u.s. manufacturing across all sectors, geographies, communities, and across underrepresented constituencies. 
 in addition to ennis,  aaron stebner , an associate professor in georgia tech's  george w. woodruff school of mechanical engineering , serves as georgia aim co-director and lead at the  georgia tech manufacturing institute 's  advanced manufacturing pilot facility . 
 georgia aim's mission is to serve all georgians, including rural residents, women, black, indigenous, and people of color (bipoc), those living with disabilities, and veterans. historically, these groups have been underrepresented in manufacturing. 
 the white house selected georgia aim among the many build back better-funded projects to highlight the importance of community-based work in achieving equity. below are ennis' prepared remarks for the event. with ennis was don graves, deputy secretary of commerce, and former columbia, south carolina mayor stephen k. benjamin, a senior advisor to president joe biden. 
 thank you, secretary raimondo and mr. benjamin, for this opportunity to discuss how critical the build back better funding has been to our efforts in georgia in promoting equity. 
 the georgia artificial intelligence in manufacturing project (or georgia aim) is dedicated to fostering the equitable development and deployment of innovation and talent in ai for manufacturing. through new innovative approach to funding, that is a coalition model, eda has provided a pathway for us to develop a network of over 40 partners across the state, including educational institutions, community organizations, and local agencies, to establish an ecosystem unlike any other focused on workforce development, technology innovation, and resilience in manufacturing. 
 georgia aim's projects are strategically different in communities across georgia, because they are tailored to those communities' specific needs. from boosting robotics competitions in k-12 education to enhancing hurricane resilience and aiding local manufacturers, our grassroots approach ensures meaningful outcomes.  this has all been enabled through the build back better funding. 
 our customized approach means these innovations can significantly impact lives in georgia's rural areas, as well as in communities that are historically underrepresented in manufacturing-in particular, women, people of color, veterans, and members of the workforce without a college degree. 
 for example, just a few weeks ago, we welcomed our first 18 graduates of a georgia aim-sponsored ai robotics training program at the georgia veterans education career transition resource center. graduates transition to jobs with robins air force base, internships with georgia tech's advanced manufacturing pilot facility, or private industry around the state. 
 and because of this funding, mobile labs developed by the russell innovation center for entrepreneurship, university of georgia, and hbcu fort valley state university will extend our reach to rural communities and communities of color, introducing them to smart technologies. these labs are equipped with examples of virtual reality, sensors, robotics, and 3-d printing, with instructors and custom curricula to introduce residents to these new technologies. 
 among manufacturers, georgia aim has reached nearly 150 small and medium manufacturers including, rural, women-, veteran- and minority-owned companies to help them understand smart technologies. 
 funding for georgia aim is allowing georgia tech's advanced manufacturing pilot facility to nearly double its footprint and incorporate a new suite of smart tools and demonstration projects. already, this facility has partnered with dozens of manufacturers, offering internships and apprenticeships, and guidance to manufacturers of all sizes. in the past year alone, more than 140 companies have learned about ai integration through tours of the facility. 
 while i could go on and on about how the build back better funding is helping georgia, i want to emphasize that georgia aim's focus is strategic. we are building a foundation for an innovation economy in a part of the country that historically has not experienced this level of investment from the federal government. because of this investment, our ai-based solutions for manufacturers and stem education efforts are customized for communities, creating a framework that can be replicated across the country. but underlying all of this is equity. we are building an ecosystem that uses ai to solve problems and create innovations for all communities-and, over time, create a template that can then be used to lift up communities across the country. please visit georgiaaim.org for more details about our project.

 when u.s. rep. earl l. ""buddy"" carter from georgia's 1st district visited atlanta recently, one of his top priorities was meeting with the experts at georgia tech's 20,000-square-foot  advanced manufacturing pilot facility  (ampf). carter was recently named the house energy and commerce committee's chair of the environment, manufacturing, and critical materials subcommittee, a group that concerns itself primarily with contamination of soil, air, noise, and water, as well as emergency environmental response, whether physical or cybersecurity. carter was recently named the house energy and commerce committee's chair of the environment, manufacturing, and critical materials subcommittee, a group that concerns itself primarily with contamination of soil, air, noise, and water, as well as emergency environmental response, whether physical or cybersecurity. because ampf's focus dovetails with subcommittee interests, the facility was a fitting stop for carter, who was welcomed for an afternoon tour and series of live demonstrations. programs within georgia tech's  enterprise innovation institute  - specifically the  georgia artificial intelligence in manufacturing  (georgia aim) and  georgia manufacturing extension partnership  (gamep) - were well represented. ""innovation is extremely important,"" carter said during his april 1 visit. ""in order to handle some of our problems, we've got to have adaptation, mitigation, and innovation. i've always said that the greatest innovators, the greatest scientists in the world, are right here in the united states. i'm so proud of georgia tech and what they do for our state and for our nation."" carter's ampf visit began with an introduction by tom kurfess, executive director of the  georgia tech manufacturing institute ; steven ferguson, principal research scientist and  managing director at georgia aim ; research engineer  kyle saleeby ; and donna ennis, the  enterprise innovation institute 's director of community engagement and program development, and co-director of georgia aim. ennis provided an overview of georgia aim, while ferguson spoke on the manufacturing 4.0 consortium and kurfess detailed the ampf origin story, before introducing four live demonstrations. the first of these featured  chuck easley , professor of the practice in the scheller college of business, who elaborated on supply chain issues. afterward alan burl of  epics: enhanced preparation for intelligent cybermanufacturing systems  and mechanical engineer melissa foley led a brief information session on hybrid turbine blade repair. finally, gamep project manager michael barker expounded on gamep's cybersecurity services, and deryk stoops of  central georgia technical college  detailed the georgia aim-sponsored ai robotics training program at the  georgia veterans education career transition resource  (vectr) center, which offers training and assistance to those making the transition from military to civilian lif e. the topic of artificial intelligence, in all its subtlety and nuance, was of particular interest to carter. ""ai is the buzz in washington, d.c.,"" he said. ""whether it be healthcare, energy [or] science, we on the energy and commerce committee look at it from a sense [that there's] a very delicate balance, and we understand the responsibility. but we want to try to benefit from this as much as we can."" he continued: ""i heard something today i haven't heard before, and that is instead of calling it artificial intelligence, we refer to it as ‘augmented intelligence.' i think that's a great term, and certainly something i'm going to take back to washington with me."" said ennis, ""it was a pleasure to host rep. carter for a firsthand look at ampf, which is uniquely positioned to offer businesses the opportunity to collaborate with georgia tech researchers and students and to hear about georgia aim."" she added, ""at georgia aim, we're committed to making the state a leader in artificial intelligence-assisted manufacturing, and we're grateful for congressman carter's interest and support of our efforts.""

georgia-institute-technology-and-morehouse-school-medicine-announce-collaborative.txt,"georgia institute of technology and morehouse school of medicine announce collaborative effort for health technology startup development 
 initiative aims to expand morehouse school of medicine's research commercialization efforts, and support focus on the needs of underserved minority and rural populations. 
 the morehouse school of medicine is part of the the atlanta university center in downtown atlanta 
 jul 09, 2019 
 - atlanta, ga 
 the georgia institute of technology and morehouse school of medicine (msm) today announced the launch of a new initiative that will support msm's commercialization efforts to create health technology (healthtech) startups. 
 the effort brings the institute's globally recognized technology incubator - the advanced technology development center (atdc) - to the msm campus, ranked the no. 1 medical school in the nation in fulfilling its social mission and the top ranking historically black college or university for producing patents (2009-2019). 
 ""we're excited to forge this effort between our two schools that will help translate ideas that may start in the lab to real-world solutions for minority and rural populations in healthcare,"" said james w. lillard, ph.d., msm's associate dean for research and director of the office of translational technologies. ""this initiative leverages the research rigor and innovations developing at morehouse school of medicine with georgia tech's proven atdc model of helping technology entrepreneurs create viable, scalable companies."" 
 the collaboration with msm, the eighth for atdc through its  atdc @ program, continues the incubator's mission of working with technology startups across georgia. the catalyst for this initiative was an i6 challenge grant the u.s. department of commerce  awarded to georgia tech  in 2015. 
 that $500,000 grant, secured by tech's  innovation ecosystems  group, supported wide-ranging innovation and entrepreneurship initiatives across the state. in atlanta, it called for the institute to collaborate with georgia state and clark atlanta universities, morehouse college, the morehouse school of medicine, and spelman college to develop entrepreneurship programs that supported their unique visions. 
 the  atdc @ msm  will provide the medical school with a full suite of services and educational programming to support entrepreneurship in the healthtech arena among faculty, staff, and students on the msm campus. the core goal is to help entrepreneurs gain insight into successful healthtech commercialization, through the program, which includes curriculum, connections, and coaching. 
 atdc was founded in 1980 to help technology entrepreneurs learn, launch, scale, and succeed in the creation of successful businesses in the state. since its founding, atdc has developed a global reputation for fostering technological entrepreneurship, with forbes naming atdc to its list of ""incubators changing the world"" in 2010 and 2013, alongside y combinator and the palo alto research center. 
 kirk barnes, atdc's healthtech catalyst, said the effort is a great example of how two world-class institutions can collaborate to create a medically-oriented innovation ecosystem. it also brings focus to the needs of minority and rural populations that are traditionally underserved from a medical standpoint, just as state leaders in georgia are looking at the issue more closely. 
 ""this is a great collaborative undertaking that takes our ""startup success, engineered"" model into the clinical setting and gives particular focus on black entrepreneurs who are an underrepresented community in tech,"" barnes said. 
 ""this will help expand the pace and flow of innovation and commercialization of research coming out of the morehouse school of medicine as well as give them access to the broader resources at georgia tech and the atdc model will formalize and expedite how that happens."" 
 about the advanced technology development center 
 the advanced technology development center (atdc), a program of the georgia institute of technology, is the state of georgia's technology startup incubator. founded in 1980 by the georgia general assembly which funds it each year, atdc's mission is to work with entrepreneurs in georgia to help them learn, launch, scale, and succeed in the creation of viable, disruptive technology companies. since its founding, atdc has grown to become one of the longest running and most successful university-affiliated incubators in the united states, with its graduate startup companies raising more than $3 billion in investment financing and generating more than $12 billion in revenue in the state of georgia. to learn more, visit  atdc.org .

 11:30 am pdt. dr. meredith's work will focus on developing a rapid and low-cost diagnostic for childhood enteric disease, such as diarrhea. these diseases are a worldwide problem and leading cause of childhood mortality. treating these diseases is difficult because predicting how the intestinal mucus layer of children will behave under stress is a challenge for researchers because intestinal tracts of children are quite different from adults. that mucus layer is critical to absorbing nutrients. if it's damaged by disease, it won't function as well, and can lead to endemic gastrointestinal disease. meredith has proposed a novel, low-cost method to test the health of the mucus lining in children, by using both natural and synthetic pollen particles. ""nature provides great sources of complex microparticles that can be adapted for engineering applications,"" meredith said. ""pollen grains are covered with unique nanoscale spines that i believe will make them excellent, but inexpensive sensors of mucus function."" pollen is sticky, edible, can survive in harsh environments, and has a wide variety of spiny appendages, sizes and shapes. the first step of meredith's work will be to characterize how fast different synthetic pollen shells travel through viscous liquids that simulate what's inside the inside of the gut. this part of the work will involve collaboration with dr. victor breedveld, also a chbe faculty member.   about grand challenges explorations grand challenges explorations

 georgia lt. gov. casey cagle visited the georgia institute of technology campus oct. 6 to get a firsthand look at technology square's thriving innovation ecosystem. 
 cagle met with president g.p. ""bud"" peterson and chris downing, vice president of the enterprise innovation institute (ei 2 ), georgia tech's chief unit dedicated to economic development and innovation and the nation's largest and most comprehensive university-based program of its kind. 
 the visit was designed to show cagle how the activity at tech square brings entrepreneurs, startups, and fortune 500 firms together to connect, create, and collaborate, and ways to replicate that success across georgia. 
 he toured tech's advanced technology development center (atdc). led by jennifer bonnett, general manager, atdc is an ei 2 
 program that serves as georgia's statewide technology incubator. 
 cagle discussed startup efforts successes and challenges with several atdc companies, including clean hands safe hands, a wireless hand hygiene monitoring system for hospitals, and gozio health, where he learned about its smartphone-based wayfinding platform that improves hospital visits for both visitors and medical facilities. 
 the lieutenant governor also met with verisolutions, a sensor-based startup that works with restaurants to prevent inventory loss, optimize staff efficiency, and improve customer food safety. 
 ""atlanta could be the silicon valley of the southeast,"" cagle said following the tour, which included visits to two corporate innovation centers: health insurer anthem's innovation studio and southern co.'s energy innovation center. 
 paul judge, a tech graduate with a doctorate in computer science and chairman of pindrop, told the lieutenant governor that venture capitalists see that atlanta has a distinct advantage in terms of talent and access to georgia tech resources and expertise. 
 pindrop, a cybersecurity company located at the historic biltmore - which the georgia tech foundation has acquired  - is a georgia success story. 
 ceo vijay balasubramaniyan launched the company in 2010 while he was pursuing his doctoral degree at tech's college of computing. the then-fledgling company started out in venturelab, tech's incubator for startups founded by tech students and faculty. pindrop also received early financial support from the georgia research alliance to bring the idea to a viable concept stage. venturelab also partnered with flashpoint, a georgia tech startup accelerator that works with founders to get them to think strategically about their business. 
 it then went through atdc's signature program and graduated in 2014. pindrop announced this year that it had raised $75 million in its series c funding round. 
 ""we're doing a wonderful job, and we have to protect, help, and encourage what's going on here in atlanta. we also have to spread that across the state,"" cagle said. 
 ei 2 
 has been doing that through atdc, downing said, noting the "" atdc @"" 
 program - which brings the incubator's curriculum and management to its partner communities - currently operates in savannah, augusta, athens, and soon, peachtree corners. 
 ""a core part of our mission at ei 2 
 as georgia tech's chief economic development arm, is to do that and help communities across the state scale and help them leverage their assets for economic development,"" downing said.

 georgia manufacturers are enjoying higher profits, but they may be shortchanging investment in future-focused technology and innovation. 
 the 2014 georgia manufacturing survey shows that the state's manufacturers are enjoying higher profits, but cutting back on long-term investment. 
 sep 24, 2014 
 - atlanta, ga 
 georgia manufacturers are enjoying higher profits, but in the rush to meet the demands of a rebounding economy, they may be shortchanging investment in future-focused technology and innovation, a new survey of the state's manufacturing companies has found. the 2014 georgia manufacturing survey found that profits of georgia manufacturers grew, on average, 13 percent between 2012 and 2014 - compared to an overall decline reported between 2010 and 2012. despite this good news, however, the survey found fewer companies planning to invest in new technologies such as robotics, and a reduced reliance on innovation as a competitive strategy. ""manufacturing companies in georgia are more profitable than they have been for years,"" said jan youtie, director of policy research services at georgia tech's enterprise innovation institute and the survey's director. ""however, we are seeing less investment in the kinds of things we would normally recommend as good practices in preparing for the future. this may indicate too much attention to the present and not enough on sustaining success in the future."" the reduced investment may simply signal a transition between the slow economy of the past several years and one that is getting back on a growth track, said karen fite, director of the georgia manufacturing extension partnership program (gamep), a federally-supported georgia tech program that helps manufacturers improve their competitiveness. ""as companies are able to adjust to the new capacity needs, we're expecting them to begin investing again in the kinds of things that will ensure long-term competitiveness,"" said fite. ""we are also hearing from manufacturers that they are waiting on some of the most exciting technologies, such as additive manufacturing and cloud-based systems, to mature and for prices to fall. investing too early in the development cycle of new technologies can be costly."" results from the survey, produced by the georgia institute of technology, georgia department of labor, kennesaw state university and the accounting firm habif, arogeti & wynne, llp (ha&w), were released september 24. the survey is based on responses from 504 georgia manufacturing companies contacted during the first half of 2014. concerns about the availability of workers with technical and basic skills were more prevalent in the 2014 survey than in earlier studies, noted philip shapira, a professor in georgia tech's school of public policy and co-director of the study. ""georgia manufacturers have benefitted over the last year or so from economic recovery, and indicate problems finding workers with basic and technical skills to further grow their businesses,"" said shapira, who is also a professor of innovation management and policy at the manchester business school in england. ""yet, worryingly, investment in workforce training is below 2012 survey levels."" georgia companies may be overlooking a tax credit that could help them improve the skills of their employees. ""the georgia retraining credit is an often overlooked tax credit that georgia manufacturers can take advantage of to train their current employees on certain equipment, technology, processes, or software,"" said adam beckerman, partner-in-charge of ha&w's manufacturing and distribution group. ""the credit creates a huge opportunity for georgia manufacturers to provide their workforce with the technical training that many lack by covering a manufacturer's direct expenses for training session."" beyond improving profitability, falling energy prices also provided good news, as the survey reported a dramatic reduction in the percentage of firms concerned about energy cost. ""the cost of energy has been a significant issue for several years, but in the newest survey, it dropped to among the lowest levels,"" said youtie. ""in the 2012 survey, for example, 21 percent of respondents cited high energy costs as a concern, but just two years later, only 11 percent ranked it as a big issue."" energy expenditures as a percentage of sales declined nearly 6 percent for the median georgia manufacturer between 2012 and 2014. the decline was even more significant for large manufacturers, who saw a 12 percent drop. exporting has provided new market opportunities, and past surveys had seen an increase in the percentage of georgia manufacturers sending their goods overseas. in the 2014 survey, however, the number of companies expecting to increase exports dropped to 20 percent from 23 percent in 2012. georgia tech helps companies apply innovation to their products and processes. the survey found that innovation remains largely an activity for larger companies, where two-thirds of respondents said they were innovating in products, processes, organizations or marketing. most firms reporting innovation said they were collaborating with suppliers and customers. ""companies that want to grow must shift away from low-cost strategies and innovate through new technologies, research and development, and new products and processes,"" said beckerman. use of sustainable manufacturing techniques such as life-cycle analysis, carbon foot printing and greenhouse gas emission inventories remains low in georgia, with only 9 percent of companies producing a carbon footprint inventory, for example. ""the percentage using sustainable manufacturing technologies is very low, and a large number of respondents felt they weren't applicable,"" said youtie. ""we feel that life cycle analysis is applicable to any manufacturer, but half the companies don't plan to do it and 26 percent say it's not applicable."" among other findings: the percentage of georgia companies benefitting from in-sourcing - the transfer of production to them from another facility - dropped from 16 percent in the 2012 survey to 13 percent in 2014. the percentage losing work to other facilities dropped from 14 percent to 11 percent. the percentage of georgia companies using robotics technology remains low, with just 10 percent using robots in their processes and only 6 percent planning to adopt them. high-use technology included enterprise resource planning software (68 percent) and computer-aided-design software (63 percent). the use of lean manufacturing techniques, which improve efficiency and reduce costs, dropped from nearly 60 percent in the 2012 survey to 44 percent in the latest survey. the profitability of companies that compete on the basis of low price nearly doubled from the 2012 to 2014 survey, reflecting the results of a higher production volume. such companies reported profit margins of more than 9 percent, compared to 10 percent for companies competing on the basis of innovation. companies that compete on the basis of innovation had the highest average wage rate: $43,605. companies competing on the basis of quick delivery or low price reported wages of $37,763 and $38,006 respectively. only 27 percent of georgia manufacturers conduct research and development activities in-house. first produced in 1994, the georgia manufacturing survey is conducted regularly to benchmark the use of modern manufacturing technology, practices and techniques. information obtained from the survey is used to improve manufacturing assistance programs and regional innovation initiatives that help georgia companies compete, improve their profitability, and create jobs for georgians. more information can be found at ( www.gms-ei2.org ). research news georgia institute of technology 177 north avenue atlanta, georgia  30332-0181 usa media relations assistance : john toon ( jtoon@gatech.edu ) (404-894-6986) or brett israel ( brett.israel@comm.gatech.edu ) (404-385-1933). writer:

georgia-manufacturing-extension-partnership-launches-outreach-initiative-food.txt,"georgia manufacturing extension partnership launches outreach initiative for food processing manufacturers 
 food-related focus to support georgia's $12 billion food processing industry. 
 damon c. nix, senior project manager at the georgia manufacturing extension partnership (gamep), is leading the food manufacturing initiative. 
 aug 28, 2017 
 - atlanta, ga 
 georgia is a one of the nation's leading agriculture states, with the industry contributing about $74.9 billion to the state economy each year. 
 a related sector - food processing - is a strong and growing component of the georgia economy, and accounts for $11 billion to $12 billion each year of the state's gross domestic product. food processing also employs 69,000 across the state, with 10,000 of those jobs being created since 2010, according to georgia power's 2016 food processing industry report. 
 it's that strength in food processing, which comprises the largest segment of georgia's manufacturing sector, that led to the georgia manufacturing extension partnership's (gamep) new initiative focused on those manufacturers' unique needs. 
 gamep, a federally funded economic development program at the georgia institute of technology's enterprise innovation institute, works with manufacturers across georgia to help them remain viable and economically competitive. 
 ""food processing comprises many different products and sizes of manufacturers and it is important to assure their viability and growth,"" said gamep director karen fite. ""this effort is in recognition of where the growth is occurring in the manufacturing sector and we want to make sure we're applying our resources and expertise, as well as cutting edge research coming out of georgia tech, that can help our manufacturers."" 
 damon c. nix, gamep's senior project manager, is leading the food manufacturing programming, which includes coaching, analysis, and consulting in: 
 food safety 
 compliance with the food and drug administration's (fda) new food safety modernization act (fsma) requirements. 
 management system implementation and audit team support. 
 energy management 
 energy assessments to identify cost reduction and performance improvement opportunities. 
 companies with fewer than 500 employees at a plant site may qualify for a free energy assessment through georgia tech's industrial assessment center program. 
 environmental services 
 environmental compliance services and management system (iso 14001) support. 
 environmental protection agency p2 grant-funded projects that support pollution prevention through reduced greenhouse gas emissions, water usage, and hazardous materials generation. 
 worker safety and health 
 implement lean / process improvement approaches to safety problem solving. 
 partner with the georgia tech research institute's food processing technology division to support occupational safety and health administration rules compliance, applied research, and technology solutions. 
 workforce development 
 operational leader and frontline supervisor training. 
 ""georgia's food processing gdp ranks it sixth in the country and we rank sixth in employment,"" nix said, noting the state has roughly 680 food processing manufacturers, including the 127 that either relocated to georgia or built new facilities here since 2010. 
 ""the gamep has created significant results serving manufacturers overall,"" nix said. ""we want to continue that momentum in food processing. georgia's manufacturing industry remains competitive and continues to grow because the food processing industry is expanding. we want food processors to know that the gamep is a resource to support their continued growth.""

 - atlanta, ga 
 the georgia manufacturing extension partnership (gamep) at georgia tech has launched a new program to help manufacturers boost their competitiveness by implementing energy management best practices in iso 50001. 
 a 12-month effort, the southeast mep energy management program is being funded with a grant from the u.s. department of commerce's national institute of standards and technology (nist) manufacturing extension partnership (mep). 
 ""the program aims to help companies in the southeast accelerate their energy and cost savings and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by incorporating best practices as outlined by iso 50001,"" said bill meffert, the gamep's group manager for energy and sustainability projects. 
 the iso 50001 energy management system - an international standard in which the gamep had a role in developing when first drafted in 2011 and its 2018 revisions - provides business and industry with an energy performance improvement framework. 
 ""that's the focus of the iso 50001 training and coaching. we're assisting companies in their efforts to bring energy costs under control and make smart energy usage part of their daily processes,"" meffert said. 
 participants in the southeast mep energy management program will take a series of classes and webinar sessions, and receive on-site coaching over a 12-month period. completing the program allows them to be certified by the u.s. department of energy as 50001 ready by showing they've implemented the standard into their operations. they can also take an additional step to become certified, meffert said. 
 the class for the first cohort launches in early 2019 and applications are being accepted at this link :  https: / / gamep.org / southeast-energy-management-program / . 
 the federal grant covers most of the cost for the training, but participating companies will pay about 25 percent of that. as part of the grant, the gamep will partner with meps in tennessee, north carolina, south carolina, alabama, and texas. those sister meps will find clients in those states to work with them to implement the iso 50001 management system. 
 ""for many companies, energy use is a critical component of their ability to maintain a competitive edge,"" meffert said. 
 a medium- to large-sized company with 250 employees or more could spend more than $1 million a year on energy, including electricity, natural gas, fuel, and water. 
 ""what we see with the companies that we've worked with to adopt the iso standard in the past is that they achieve energy performance improvements that go beyond the typical approaches,"" he said. ""roughly 70 percent of the savings achieved are through operational controls and behavior change."" 
 since the iso standard's adoption in 2011, the gamep has helped more than 70 facilities in north america to implement iso 50001, with most becoming certified, including nine in the southeast. 
 ""this energy management system is applicable to a whole host of industries from textiles and floor coverings to food and beverage to automotive manufacturing,"" meffert said. ""one of the reasons we sought to get more companies in the southeast to adopt this energy standard is because we have such a strong manufacturing presence in all of these sectors. 
 ""incorporating these standards and changing processes for energy usage can really make a difference to the bottom line, while also helping companies meet their competitiveness and sustainability objectives,"" meffert said.

 - atlanta, ga 
 the georgia tech foundation inc. (gtf) has reached an agreement to purchase the historic biltmore on west peachtree street in midtown atlanta from an affiliate of novare group for an undisclosed price. 
 ""the biltmore is already a vibrant component of what the georgia tech foundation, the institute and its partners have previously built in creating the innovation neighborhood of technology square,"" said gary t. jones, chairman of the georgia tech foundation. ""this simply strengthens what is one of the country's most energetic technology ecosystems and is a wonderful example of the connections and collaborations between startups, business leaders and georgia tech faculty, students and researchers. it's a great honor for the georgia tech foundation to own this well-known midtown landmark and to continue to be a part of technology square as it serves as a magnet for georgia's entrepreneurial community."" 
 ""for many years, the biltmore has served as the historic anchor in midtown atlanta,"" said g.p. ""bud"" peterson, president of the georgia institute of technology. ""when you cross the fifth street bridge connecting our main campus with tech square, it is the first thing you see. we are proud to be able to incorporate it as a part of georgia tech. the acquisition of the biltmore, combined with the state's generous support of our business incubator program, the advanced technology development center (atdc), positions georgia tech to further expand the number of companies we serve. we look forward to integrating this iconic structure into our growing entrepreneurial ecosystem, where it will help us accommodate additional innovation centers and startups that want to take advantage of the energy, expertise and technologies at georgia tech, as well as the collaborative spirit in one of the south's most thriving innovation neighborhoods."" 
 ""it has been a privilege to restore and operate this atlanta icon, and we are proud of the work done in preserving a landmark for the community and creating a premier creative office and elegant event space,"" said jim borders, president, novare group. ""with the building effectively 100 percent occupied, the timing was right to bring the biltmore to market. we had significant interest from several qualified groups, and we are very pleased that georgia tech will carry the flag into the future."" 
 william candler, son of coca-cola magnate asa candler, was the local financier behind the biltmore project, purchasing the land for the hotel in 1921 with his proceeds of the sale of the coca-cola company and incorporating the atlanta biltmore hotel company in conjunction with the new york-based biltmore hotel chain. the atlanta biltmore opened in 1924 and served as the cultural and social center of atlanta for decades. the biltmore fell into disrepair in the 1980s when it was closed for a failed conversion into apartments.  novare purchased the property in january of 1998 and adapted the building into loft office space, and the elegant ballrooms that were a part of the original biltmore were restored to their former glory. 
 the building, which has approximately 290,000 square feet of loft office, retail and ballroom space, is directly across west peachtree street from technology square, a multi-block part of the georgia tech campus that is home to the scheller college of business, the georgia tech hotel and conference center, the georgia tech global learning center, the advanced technology development center and the to-be-developed high performance computing center, now known as ""coda."" the georgia tech foundation has worked with georgia tech over the past 15 years to develop technology square. 
 the biltmore is occupied predominantly by engineering firms, energy companies and late-stage technology startups. the largest tenants are pindrop, southstar energy services and kimley-horn and associates. the acquisition does not include the biltmore residences, which are privately owned condominiums. 
 ""the purchase of this property will not affect the historical status of the building,"" said al trujillo, president of the gtf. ""we will continue the legacy of appropriate financial and operational stewardship of this remarkable treasure."" 
 jay o'meara of cbre marketed the biltmore on behalf of novare group. 
 update : the sale of the biltmore to the georgia tech foundation was completed on october 5, 2016.

 - atlanta, ga 
 nearly 6,100 georgia students who applied to georgia tech in early action 1 received their admission decisions on saturday. 
 a total of 2,399 georgia students were admitted, for an overall admit rate of 39%. admitted students hail from 95 counties and 353 high schools (80% public schools and 20% private schools) around the state. of the early action 1 admit pool 52% are women and 48% are men, 13% come from rural areas of georgia, and 22% identify as black or hispanic. through the 
 georgia tech scholars program , tech offers admission to valedictorians and salutatorians who apply from any accredited georgia high school with more than 50 graduates, and 11% of the admitted students are predicted to be honored as such. 
 ""georgia tech is committed to serving our state by continuing to expand access to more students from communities across georgia. in fact, this year 1,000 more residents are studying at tech than just five years ago,"" said rick clark, director of undergraduate admission. ""we are hopeful these newly admitted students will choose to become yellow jackets, since they are not only academically talented, but have also had a tremendous impact and influence in their schools and communities. 
 ""i'm particularly excited about the number of women who continue to apply, enroll, and thrive at tech. companies recruit here because of the diverse talent pool we provide - and the female voice and perspective, particularly when it comes to policy and product creation, is essential."" 
 on friday undergraduate admission staff members virtually surprised students with their acceptances at several high schools across the state: warner robins high school and northside high school in warner robins, west hall high school in oakwood, habersham central high school in mount airy, commerce high school in commerce, lamar county comprehensive high school in barnesville, north murray high school in chatsworth, cook high school in adel, crisp county high school in cordele, and atlanta girls school. 
 beginning with last year's admission cycle, first-year applicants could select from one of three admission plans: early action1, early action 2, and regular decision. 
 the first cycle of admission is reserved specifically for georgia students, including georgia residents attending high school out of state. the application deadline for early action 1 was oct. 15. 
 early action 2 will be announced in late january. students still interested in applying to tech as first-year students have until jan. 5 to meet the regular decision 
 application deadline . those decisions will be announced in late march. 
 in the weeks and months ahead, the admission team will not only continue to review applications, but will also work with students who were deferred admission and discuss 
 transfer pathways 
 for students considering another college before completing their undergraduate degree at georgia tech. they will also be hosting in-person and virtual ""yield"" programs to convince early admits to choose tech. 
 ""the students we admit are also being accepted and awarded scholarships from other amazing universities,"" clark said. ""our team, along with campus partners, current students, and tech alumni, will be focused on hosting students on campus and virtually to tell them about the incredible opportunities, experiences, network, and return on investment tech provides.""

 - atlanta, ga 
 a ramblin' wreck from georgia tech is the new 
 chief of staff of the u.s. army. 
 gen. james c. mcconville 
 took over as the army's top officer august 9 . he replaces gen. mark a. milley, who was confirmed in july as the next chairman of the joint chiefs of staff. 
 mcconville earned a master's degree in aerospace engineering from georgia tech in 1990. a decorated helicopter pilot, mcconville is the first aviator to serve as the army's chief. 
 ""armed with a master's in engineering to go with decades of flying and maintaining helicopters, he brings a unique understanding of how to operate and support complex weapons and equipment,"" said army secretary ryan mccarthy. ""in this respect, no senior officer is better prepared to lead the army as we undertake what will be a massive and, yes, risky and costly transformation towards more advanced weapons and war-fighting approaches."" 
 mcconville has served as the army vice chief of staff under milley, where he already has been leading those modernization efforts. it's work he said he has been well prepared for, in part, thanks to his graduate studies. 
 ""georgia tech is a tremendous school of higher learning, and it helped me as a leader to think critically, innovate and solve the most difficult problems. georgia tech also taught me the power of technology and to challenge the status quo,"" mcconville said. ""the practical knowledge i gained helped me find tangible ways to overcome challenges while expanding my sense of what is truly possible if we work as a team and don't limit our creativity."" 
 mcconville recalled sending his first email - using a dial-up modem - while he was on campus, an interesting inflection point for the man who noted at the change of responsibility ceremony that the army ""cannot be an industrial age army in the information age. we must transform all our industrial age processes to be more effective, protect our resources, and make better decisions."" 
 at georgia tech, mcconville played on the club hockey team and celebrated the birth of his first son. (that son and his two siblings are now all army officers themselves.) mcconville praised the professors he studied under in the daniel guggenheim school of aerospace engineering, especially daniel schrage and dimitri mavris. 
 ""they were great mentors and coaches, and very committed to the development of their students,"" he said. 
 ""even when gen. mcconville was a master's student, we knew he would go far,"" said mavris, a regents professor and also mcconville's brother-in-law. ""throughout his distinguished career, he has demonstrated an exemplary level of commitment and service to our country. we are confident he is the best man for the job and that he will excel at leading and preparing the army for the future."" 
 mcconville's career includes stints commanding the 4 th 
 brigade, 1 st 
 cavalry division, where his aviators played a decisive role in the battle of fallujah in iraq. later, he became the longest-serving division commander in army history when he led the 101 st 
 airborne division on multiple combat tours over three years. 
 ""mcconville is one of the most courageous and thoughtful officers i have ever served with,"" milley said. ""jim's blend of battlefield experience, both in the middle east and in washington, made him the perfect officer to take over as chief. he has the drive, the background and the vision to make the army even better.""

 - atlanta, ga 
 the georgia institute of technology and the u.s. department of energy's 
 pacific northwest national laboratory 
 (pnnl) have entered into a formal agreement to bolster the interactions, collaborations, and joint scientific output of both institutions. 
 the goals of this collaborative arrangement are to: 
 solve big problems 
 by leveraging the significant infrastructure and intellectual capabilities of both parties in a multidisciplinary and multi-institutional manner. 
 sustain and engage human capital 
 by exposing a pipeline of talented future members of the workforce to problems of practical importance and complex nature early in their academic programs. 
 accelerate technology adoption 
 by introducing new ideas, science, and technology into the industrial and federal marketplace for the public good. 
 this five-year agreement was acknowledged during a virtual memorandum of understanding (mou) signing event on oct. 23, organized by georgia tech's 
 strategic energy institute 
 (sei). 
 ""this mou provides a basis for both parties to engage in research collaborations, and the joint creation and administration of intellectual property,"" said tim lieuwen, sei's executive director. 
 leaders of both institutions emphasized that the mou leverages existing relationships and takes advantage of synergies. pnnl and georgia tech already have a long history of collaboration, with more than 100 journal articles, conference papers, and the like coauthored by pnnl and georgia tech researchers over the past decade. pnnl also boasts 32 current staff members who earned a bachelor's, master's, or doctoral degree from georgia tech. 
 the mou lays out several potential topics of mutual interest to both institutions.

 georgia tech will begin a soft launch of the 
 zoom 
 video collaboration platform beginning monday, feb. 7. the announcement comes after an almost yearlong effort to evaluate and introduce a new videoconferencing solution for academic course delivery and collaboration. 
 with the institute's existing agreement with bluejeans set to expire at the end of the spring semester - and the sunset of the webex platform in december 2021* - the 
 video collaboration review 
 (vcr) team formed in early 2021 to explore new video collaboration platforms that meet the academic and operational needs of students, faculty, and staff. the committee, comprised of members from each division and college, along with students and technology representatives, identified requirements and evaluated possible solutions on their ability to: 
 enable secure, reliable, and flexible course delivery and student learning. 
 support virtual classrooms and meetings of multiple sizes. 
 facilitate effective collaboration and communication across the institute. 
 ""it was critically important to us that we start our selection process with an examination of our needs from a collaboration, teaching, and learning perspective,"" said daren hubbard, georgia tech vice president of information technology and chief information officer. ""the committee spent a great deal of time articulating these criteria so that we could, as objectively as possible, evaluate a number of options and eventually recommend a solution for georgia tech."" 
 ""not only did zoom, to a large extent, meet our committee's criteria, but it is also one of the most widely used video collaboration tools,"" said yakut gazi, ph.d., associate dean for learning systems at georgia tech professional education. ""many of our students, faculty, and staff have participated in zoom meetings during and even before the pandemic, which we anticipate will facilitate adoption at georgia tech."" 
 the vcr team had planned to launch a two-month pilot of zoom at georgia tech last october. 
 ""due to unforeseen circumstances, we regrettably had to delay, then ultimately cancel our planned october pilot,"" gazi said. ""thanks to collaborative work between the office of information technology (oit), procurement and business services, and the office of the general counsel, we were able to come to an agreement with zoom in december, setting us up for our soft launch in february with our campus partners."" 
 canvas has been integrated with zoom and will enable convenient access for faculty and students in blended and online learning courses. during the first phase of the zoom soft launch, the platform will only be available to georgia tech users who host meetings from inside the u.s. zoom recordings will be automatically migrated to the user's 
 kaltura mediaspace 
 account. 
 ""over the course of the next few months, our teams will work to tighten the integration of zoom with the classroom technology systems, as well as with the kaltura mediaspace video storage and delivery system, to further enhance the interoperability of our academic technology ecosystem,"" gazi said. ""we will also be working with tech entities and zoom to expand the platform's usage to all georgia tech learners, independent of their global location."" 
 gazi also applauded the extensive due diligence process that guided the committee's decision to bring the platform to georgia tech. 
 ""i am thankful for the resilience and persistence of the committee members who guided this process for many months. i am excited to introduce this much needed platform to our community and welcome input as we continue to improve our technology tools and services."" 
 oit will work with the georgia tech community through the spring to prepare for the transition from bluejeans. upcoming communications will share resources for securely migrating stored lecture and meeting recordings and additional information. 
 the campus community is invited to join an upcoming ‘ask me anything' informational zoom session:

""most faculty, staff, and students have learned how to incorporate a video collaboration service into their work and that's a big hill that we don't have to climb again. in addition, zoom has capabilities similar to those of bluejeans and is widely used in education - making it a strong contender as a videoconference platform for georgia tech."" 
 zoom will integrate with canvas and kaltura to enable course delivery for hybrid and online learners. the pilot will inform the review committee's ultimate decision to implement zoom as an enterprise videoconferencing solution at georgia tech. 
 ""we have more than 120 requirements against which we will evaluate zoom's performance during a portion of the fall semester,"" said yakut gazi, associate dean of georgia tech professional education. ""we performed our due diligence in terms of cybersecurity and procurement processes prior to the trial so that if the trial results in a positive outcome, we can quickly move forward with an enterprise license and full implementation."" 
 gazi added that the extensive due diligence process guided the committee's decision to begin the pilot mid-semester. 
 ""we will make sure to engage a variety of courses and activities to ensure a robust evaluation of zoom in our environment,"" gazi said. ""georgia tech learned a lot about what works and what doesn't in the digital learning environments, especially during the transition to remote and hybrid work stemming from the covid-19 pandemic. the committee members brought a lot of their experience to the table and were really engaged in this process. i thank them all for their thoughtful contributions."" 
 the office of information technology will work with students, faculty, and staff over the fall to prepare for the transition from bluejeans and webex. additional communications will share resources for securely migrating stored lecture and meeting recordings and a schedule of information sessions planned to share updates and answer questions.

 conference examined some key promises and challenges related to iot technologies and building a sustainable world. 
 jul 19, 2019 
 - atlanta, ga 
 a large manufacturer needed help to increase their output after realizing that running lines faster wasn't producing more products. using internet of things (iot) technologies, the company saw a 10 percent increase in efficiency without having to add new infrastructure or use more power. 
 robert schmid, chief iot technologist at deloitte, shared this real-life business solution and others during the keynote address of the georgia institute of technology's center for the development and application of internet of things technologies (cdait) international conference on the internet of things (iot) and sustainability held july 18, 2019, at the georgia tech research institute in atlanta. 
 titled ""the internet of things for sustainability is smart business,"" the conference drew more than 400 registered attendees and explored catalysts to examine some of the key promises and challenges that relate to the application of iot technologies toward building a sustainable world. the conference also aimed to address different aspects of iot, and how this technology could be used in multiple industries, from energy to transportation, financial services to healthcare, and environment to smart cities. 
 ""we need to be rooted in technology because it's complex,"" said alain louchez, managing director of the georgia tech cdait. ""however, solving related human and business problems, a critical focus at cdait, are paramount to a successful iot deployment. at the end of the day, regardless of the inherent beauty of the technological solution, effectively and efficiently meeting customers' present and future needs remains the acid test for iot."" 
 iot connects a wide range of devices with smart capabilities and is increasingly seen as a core component of corporate and societal digital transformation. sustainability or sustainable development - that which meets ""the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs,"" according to the united nations 
 brundtland report 
 - is now viewed by businesses as 
 mission critical . 
 conference attendees included business, academic and government leaders who are working to bring cohesion and greater development of iot across various business sectors.  bilel jamoussi, chief of the study groups department, international telecommunication union (itu) standardization bureau, opened the conference with a video message from geneva. he was followed by schmid's address and one of two roundtables which addressed how iot technologies could be a game changer for sustainability as well as education and training needed to meet business objectives. participants also attended five break-out sessions focused on government regulation and policy, design and operation of smart buildings and smart homes, sustainable manufacturing, supply chain and logistics and consumer products. 
 according to the world economic forum, iot could become a game-changer for sustainability because of its technology. iot is about measuring and remotely controlling things that were previously unconnected, reaching people and objects that technology could previously not reach, and in the process it also supports sustainable development elements. 
 about cdait 
 the center for the development and application of internet of things technologies (cdait, pronounced ""sedate"") is a global, nonprofit, partner-funded center located in atlanta that fosters interdisciplinary research and education while driving general awareness about the internet of things (iot). cdait bridges sponsors with georgia institute of technology (georgia tech) faculty and researchers, as well as industry members with similar interests. central to its value proposition is the belief that only a holistic approach, i.e., mindful of the complexity of the entire iot value chain and the intricate relationships between the various links, can generate superior results. cdait's broad overarching goal is to expand and promote iot's huge potential and transformational capabilities. cdait aims to efficiently identify, understand, and solve challenges and problems that may arise along the entire internet of things value chain through six working groups: iot education and training; iot startup ecosystem; iot thought leadership; iot security and privacy; iot standards and management; and iot research.

 the georgia institute of technology has announced its agreement to join the ibm q hub at the oak ridge national laboratory (ornl) to help advance the fundamental research and use of quantum computing in building software infrastructure and developing specialized error mitigation techniques. georgia tech will have cloud access, via the oak ridge hub, to the world's largest fleet of universal quantum computing systems for commercial use case exploration and fundamental research. 
 ""access to ibm machines will allow georgia tech to build software infrastructure to make it easier to operate quantum machines, create specialized error mitigation techniques in software - thereby mitigating some of the hardware errors - and develop algorithms and applications for the emerging noisy intermediate-scale quantum (nisq) computing paradigm,"" said 
 moinuddin qureshi , a professor in georgia tech's 
 school of electrical and computer engineering . ""access will also allow georgia tech researchers to better understand the error patterns in existing quantum computers, which can help with developing the architecture for future machines."" 
 as part of the ornl hub, georgia tech will join a community of fortune 500 companies, startups, academic institutions and research labs working to advance quantum computing and explore practical applications. georgia tech will leverage ibm's quantum expertise and resources, qiskit software and developer tools, and will have cloud-based access to ibm's quantum computation center. ibm makes available through the cloud 15 of the most-advanced universal quantum computing systems available, including a 53-qubit system - the most qubits of a universal quantum computer commercially available in the industry. 
 since the ibm q network's launch in 2017 it has grown to more than 100 organizations, collaborating with ibm and one another to advance fundamental quantum computing research, and the development of practical applications for business and science. 
 research is being conducted worldwide to develop a new type of computational device known as a quantum computer, based on the principles of quantum physics. quantum computers could tackle specialized computational problems such as integer factorization, understanding materials properties or optimization challenges much faster than conventional digital computers. quantum computers will use one of a number of possible approaches to create quantum bits - units known as qubits - to compute and store data, giving them unique advantages over computers based on silicon transistors. 
 while the machines have great promise, there are difficult challenges in operating such machines and in writing software that will take advantage of their power, qureshi said. 
 the agreement will give georgia tech access to ibm's premium systems, including the 53-qubit quantum computer. ""in the regime between 50 and 60 qubits is where quantum machines can potentially do computations that are beyond the capabilities of existing conventional computers,"" qureshi said.

 georgia tech researchers have earned a darpa contract to determine ways of defeating low-volume denial of service attacks on websites. 
 georgia tech assistant professor taesoo kim and a team of researchers here recently earned a $2.9 million darpa contract to study ways of detecting and defending against low-volume distributed denial of service (ddos) attacks on websites. 
 may 03, 2016 
 - atlanta, ga 
 georgia tech researchers have been awarded a $2.9 million contract from the u.s. defense advanced research projects agency (darpa) to develop a cybersecurity method that will identify and defend against low-volume distributed denial of service (ddos) attacks. high-volume ddos attacks that overwhelm servers with large amounts of malicious traffic in order to shut down a particular website have received a significant amount of study. however, low-volume attacks have not. low-volume attacks-while generally receiving less attention from scholars and media outlets-account for a significant percentage of all ddos assaults. they can take down a website and be as damaging, but may use less bandwidth, are often shorter in duration, and may be designed to distract a security team from the aftershocks of follow-on attacks. in fact, according to neustar, inc., around 54 percent of ddos attacks were found to be relatively small at less than 5 gbps, yet 43 percent leave behind malware or viruses. neustar's 
 april 2016 
 report found that 82 percent of corporations were attacked repeatedly. ""this has been a 25-year problem with no practical solution,"" says 
 taesoo kim , lead principal investigator for the study and assistant professor in georgia tech's school of computer science. ""our goal is to create a precise and timely detection method that identifies attacks by how they subtly change the resource consumption of a machine. with little to no degradation of system performance, we believe we can mitigate the threat and write a new signature for it inside the hardware within approximately 10 seconds so a network interface card will recognize it again. this effectively puts an anti-virus patch into your hardware in real time."" under the project name roki, kim and colleagues propose to first establish a baseline of resource consumption using three intel hardware features. next, they will develop continuous analysis algorithms to compare a packet's effect on system performance against historical consumption under similar scenarios. a new path-reconstruction engine will then produce a sequence of instructions to nullify an attack and encode the finding into the network interface card to stop current or future attack traffic. ""roki has the potential to achieve both timeliness and precision,"" says 
 wenke lee , co-pi on the project and co-director of the 
 institute for information security & privacy 
 at georgia tech. ""we don't need to know what an attack looks like, just that it deviates from the baseline. existing defenses against low-volume ddos attacks lack precision and they cannot create a response in a timely manner. this will."" the research is part of darpa's 
 extreme ddos defense 
 (xd3) program (awarded under contract # hr0011-16-c-0059) and began in april. first deliverables are expected in approximately 18 months, beginning with a prototype to demonstrate the core idea. the project is expected to be complete in three years. field exercises to mitigate previously unknown ddos attacks will occur in 2019. about the researchers taesoo kim ,

 more than 50 representatives from across the campus have been appointed by president ángel cabrera to the newly formed georgia tech diversity, equity, and inclusion council (gtdeic). the council will identify issues of campus racial and gender disparity, bias, and inequity to be addressed in order to deliver upon the institute's vision of diversity and inclusion. the members represent diverse voices and perspectives from staff, faculty, and students. their initial meeting will be nov. 30. 
 the gtdeic will continuously monitor and assess the institute's progress on achieving its goals for becoming a model campus community for diversity, equity, and inclusion and develop evidenced, informed recommendations, which they will submit periodically to cabrera and the institute's executive leadership team for consideration in developing strategic actions. 
 ""our diversity and inclusion council is one of several action steps announced this past summer to deliver on our promise of inclusion,"" said president cabrera. ""as outlined in our 
 new strategic plan , we are striving to remove barriers to access and success, and to build an inclusive community where people of all backgrounds have the opportunity to learn and contribute to our mission. i am grateful to the individuals who volunteered to serve as inaugural council members, and look forward to working closely with them as they identify issues and propose new courses of action."" 
 campus research has revealed discrepancies in the satisfaction levels of various groups. the 
 2017 faculty and staff climate assessment surveys 
 and 
 2018 student climate assessment survey 
 revealed high levels of faculty, staff, and student satisfaction on a wide array of campus experiences on a number of dimensions measured across multiple social identities, such as faculty rank, job function, gender, and race. 
 ""the surveys also revealed there are some important differences in levels of satisfaction reported regarding some campus experiences,"" said archie ervin, vice president for 
 institute diversity, equity, and inclusion  (idei). ""disaggregation of the data by social identity reveal lower levels of satisfaction with campus experiences on a number of dimensions measured by the survey that deserve attention and deeper exploration to understand why the differences exist and what action steps, if any, could be taken to address root causes of problematic or potentially adverse differences of experiences for campus members."" 
 ""in sum, the climate assessment reports help us to understand our strengths and suggest areas where we should focus our attention to improve experiences of some members of the tech community,"" ervin added. ""given the baseline data obtained by the climate assessment surveys, and the recent development of college-level diversity councils, the establishment of an institute-wide council on diversity, equity, and inclusion is both timely and necessary for the next iteration of an improved overarching strategy to achieve tech's goals for diversity and inclusion."" 
 the gtdeic will be charged with the following objectives: 
 provide a forum for georgia tech stakeholders representing all divisions of the institute to identify and consider forward-looking, proactive strategies, methods, and approaches to enhance diversity, equity, and inclusion practices and outcomes at georgia tech; 
 create a setting in which institute leadership can share and vet diversity, equity, and inclusion-related issues and opportunities; and 
 develop data-informed recommendations to improve diversity, equity and inclusion and allow the institute to lead by example as a model institution advancing inclusive innovation. 
 the group will be chaired by ervin, and pearl alexander, executive director of idei's staff diversity, inclusion, and engagement, will serve as vice chair. the gtdeic is composed of representatives from across the campus academic and administrative units, faculty, staff and student governance (undergraduate and graduate) and other faculty and staff who enhance the diversity of perspective of the council.

 the association of public and land-grant universities (aplu) named eight public research institutions - including the georgia institute of technology - as finalists for its second annual innovation & economic prosperity (iep) awards. all eight finalists, which also include virginia tech, pennsylvania state university and purdue university, are vying for four different awards that highlight the key components of economic engagement: talent, innovation, place and connections. aplu is a research, policy and advocacy organization that represents 236 public research universities and state university systems. the winners will be announced at aplu's 127 th 
 annual meeting on nov. 4. economic development has been a core mission of georgia tech since its founding in 1885. the institution has a number of initiatives and units dedicated to furthering economic development statewide through two key divisions: research with stephen e. cross serving as executive vice president of research, and outreach and business development at the enterprise innovation institute (ei 2 ). ei 2 
 is charged with a number of development programs that include business startup and innovation support through its advanced technology development center, flashpoint, and venturelab. it also has advisory and consulting services through its innovation strategy and impact program, the georgia manufacturing extension partnership, and the minority business development agency (mbda) business center, among other initiatives. technology square, which is adjacent to tech's campus and home to ei 2 , also is a critical component. besides ei 2 , it also is home to five corporate innovation centers including the at&t foundry, the global learning center and two business incubators. ""economic development has been an important part of georgia tech's mission since we were founded 129 years ago,"" said stephen fleming, ei 2 's executive vice president. while ei 2 
 is a critical component of that economic development focus, fleming said it's a core undertaking at tech as whole.  on the research side, tech has created 10 interdisciplinary research institutes (iris) to beef up both industrial and economic engagement. all told, tech's direct economic development initiatives surpassed $2.3 billion in fiscal year 2011, the most recent data available. that's more than any other institution in the university system of georgia. ""we've maintained a consistent focus on economic development for the whole state of georgia being one of the things that we invest in, one of the things that we focus on, and one of the things we're proud of doing here,"" fleming said.

 although covid-19 shifted the look and feel of the fall semester, georgia tech's fall 2020 enrollment increased to nearly 40,000 students. 
 overall enrollment grew to 39,772, a 9% increase over the previous year. graduate students accounted for most of the increase, with the bulk of those new students enrolled in online master's degree programs. 
 tech's total graduate enrollment is 23,210, a 14% increase over last year. of those, 15,664 students are enrolled in online master's programs: 10,580 in computer science; 4,252 in analytics; and 832 in cybersecurity. 
 ""georgia tech's online master's programs in computer science, analytics, and cybersecurity offer our students affordable and accessible options for earning degrees that otherwise might not have been available to them,"" said bonnie ferri, vice provost of graduate education and faculty development. ""these programs continue to grow because they offer high-quality degrees that help students achieve their goals - even in the midst of a pandemic."" 
 undergraduate enrollment also climbed slightly to 16,562 students. the fall 2020 class includes 10,322 undergraduate students from georgia, which is more than 60% of the undergraduate population. tech continued to see overall increases in hispanic or latino (10.7%), black (8.4%), and female students (10%). in fact, the first-year class included a record number of black students - 10% more than 2019. 
 this year, georgia tech also enrolled an institute record 1,150 new transfer students, 200 more than last year's fall class. transfer students hailed from 213 different colleges, including 39 georgia colleges and 43 community colleges. through newly created transfer pathway programs ( admission.gatech.edu / transfer / transfer-pathway-programs ), tech continues to enroll significantly more first-generation students and students from underrepresented backgrounds. 
 tech's fall semester enrollment increase comes at a time when college enrollment across the nation is declining, amid uncertainty during a major health pandemic. 
 ""despite the numerous challenges covid-19 has presented, tech remains incredibly healthy from an enrollment standpoint,"" said rick clark, director of undergraduate admission. ""this speaks to the strength of our distinct brand, the long-term value of a georgia tech degree, and the immeasurable resilience of our students. at a precarious time for some colleges and universities, tech continues to thrive in its role as a critical public good for our city, state, and nation.""

 ""given the instability of the past year, this is not your typical scenario in higher education and we are cautiously optimistic moving forward,"" said kelly fox, executive vice president for administration and finance. ""we are also extraordinarily grateful to the state of georgia and the university system of georgia for their commitment to higher education and our students as well as their thoughtfulness and willingness to work with us during these uncertain times."" 
 comparing spring 2020 with spring 2021 enrollment, among all 26 schools in the university system of georgia (usg), tech had the largest growth in terms of number of students, with an increase of 4,223 students (mostly at the graduate level), and in terms of percentage, at 11.9%. overall, the system averaged an increase of 1.3% in spring 2021. 
 thanks to strong enrollment numbers and healthier than expected state tax revenue collections, georgia tech is receiving $33 million in new state formula funding for fiscal year 2022. in total, state appropriations account for 16% of georgia tech's fy22 budget of $2.3 billion. 
 in looking at georgia tech's overall budget, it is important to understand the vulnerability of state appropriations, which has been increasing in dollars along with tech's enrollment but declining as a percentage of the total budget for nearly a decade. this year, tuition revenue exceeds state appropriations for the 12th consecutive year. 
 in addition, the board of regents (bor) also voted to keep 
 tuition and mandatory fees 
 - another source of revenue for usg institutions - steady across the system for the upcoming academic year. 
 ""while we are very fortunate to end this year better than expected, there are sensitivities, and we need to be mindful of all the variables that contribute to the health of our budget,"" fox said. 
 the rollout of the institute's strategic plan earlier this year is helping to guide how tech will invest this new funding to advance many of the institute's goals and values. here are a few highlights from the approved fy22 budget: 
 retention and support of our talented faculty and staff: 
 $8.5 million initially budgeted for faculty and staff equity pool adjustments. while merit increases are not funded by the state in fy22, georgia tech is able to provide equity adjustments with the potential to reevaluate minimum wages and review current salary ranges with market comparisons. this reflects the minimum amount of investment pending fall semester tuition revenues. adjustments are expected in the first and second quarters of fy22. 
 more than $3.5 million for faculty startup packages. 
 $800,000 for faculty and staff retention pool, with $400,000 budgeted for each. 
 $740,000 for faculty promotion and tenure. 
 students are our top priority: 
 $1.2 million for student advisory positions (financial, academic, and admission) across the institute to help ensure student success. 
 $750,000 to support graduate students primarily by covering the increased costs in student health insurance plans for graduate teaching and research assistants. 
 $750,000 to help fund graduate teaching assistant stipends as well as increasing the number of teaching assistants. 
 $300,000 to create career educator positions. 
 support of the institute's growth: 
 nearly $2 million for building and associated infrastructure renovations. 
 $1.3 million for capital campaign support. 
 $890,000 to create positions to support oneusg. 
 as georgia tech moves into fiscal year beginning july 1, more information related to the budget will be made available.

georgia-tech-establishes-division-lifetime-learning-nelson-baker-named-interim-dean.txt,"georgia tech establishes division of lifetime learning, nelson baker named interim dean 
 nelson baker has been named interim dean of the newly established division of lifetime learning. 
 nelson baker 
 jul 13, 2023 
 - atlanta, ga 
 provost steve mclaughlin has named nelson baker interim dean of georgia tech's newly established division of lifetime learning, effective july 1. 
 following an organizational alignment in late 2022, the new division comprises three core units - the center for 21st century universities (c21u), the center for education integrating science, mathematics, and computing (ceismc), and georgia tech professional education (gtpe) - and is part of the institute's ongoing lifetime learning initiative. 
 the lifetime learning initiative is 
 one of 20 strategic initiatives 
 designed to advance the goals and objectives of the institute's strategic plan. baker, who has served as dean of gtpe since 2012, has been serving as the lifetime learning initiative co-chair. 
 ""the world around us is changing rapidly, and we know we need to change with it to continue to fulfill our educational mission,"" said mclaughlin. ""this appointment is an important step to facilitate the big thinking, collaboration and consensus, and operational planning necessary to create a new college. i'd like to thank dean baker for his vision and leadership of the initiative thus far and for his continued leadership during this transition."" 
 most recently, members of the 
 initiative working groups 
 completed phase 1 and delivered a 
 report that outlines recommendations, including a proposed new college, to president ángel cabrera and the institute executive leadership team. the working report was a collaborative effort across all three working groups, including significant contributions from c21u, ceismc, and gtpe. 
 the groups 
 recommend that georgia tech, through the lens of its technological expertise, build educational opportunities from ""k to grey"" t hat are accessible, affordable, transformational, and achievable at all stages of life and career. after further collaboration with the university system of georgia (usg) and other key stakeholders, the final report will be approved and released at a later date. 
 phase 2 starts now and will take place over the next several months. phase 2 activities will involve deeper engagement opportunities, more formal governance conversations with faculty leadership and the usg, additional listening sessions with the broader campus community, and detailed implementation planning. as interim dean, baker will lead the process of creating the new unit, including establishing its leadership team. when the final college is approved and named, there will be a national search for a permanent dean. 
 ""i am deeply excited to be a part of this transformational work, providing new opportunities for research, education, and service to people at all stages of life,"" said baker. ""i look forward to learning from and working with the many colleagues in c21u, ceismc, gtpe, and across georgia tech, building upon what has been accomplished to date and to help shape the future of this new endeavor.""

 oct 27, 2015 
 - atlanta, ga 
 in response to widespread and persistent cybersecurity threats to businesses, government and individuals, the georgia institute of technology today announces the formation of a new, interdisciplinary research collaborative - the institute for information security & privacy (iisp). the iisp aligns the expertise of 200 researchers and nine labs across 
 four colleges 
 and the 
 georgia tech research institute 
 (gtri) to form a single gateway to all cybersecurity efforts. its purpose is to connect academia, industry and government to seamlessly develop vital solutions for national security, economic continuity and individual safety. it is led by co-directors 
 bo rotoloni , a principal research engineer at gtri, and 
 wenke lee , a professor in the 
 college of computing 
 and one of the world's most prolific cybersecurity researchers. associate directors include experts in law, business management, computing and defense. ""cybersecurity is no longer just a computer science problem for programmers; this is an issue that now touches every area of society,"" says lee, whose research involves protecting industrial control systems, hardening defense equipment and secure internet browsing. ""it involves new policy considerations, better initial product design and more training for the professionals involved. we are doubling down to discover, connect and solve modern cybersecurity threats."" georgia tech executive vice president for research stephen cross says this effort is essential at a time when consumers readily trade private personal data for convenience and the public has become more dependent on cyber-physical systems. ""georgia tech has the academic foundational research and educational programs, the technology transfer and applied research that make a real impact with industry and government, and the ability to understand and study the broader, societal impact,"" cross says. ""cybersecurity work takes place in these three spheres, and the institute for information security & privacy has been built at the intersection of all three."" initial research will focus on six areas: privacy policy, consumer-facing privacy, attribution, risk, trust and cyber-physical systems. ""under the iisp, we expect to double our current cybersecurity research activity to move more research out to the marketplace, to develop new continuing education programs for professionals and to broaden the cybersecurity curriculum so it is taught across more degree fields at georgia tech,"" says rotoloni. ""we want to be a catalyst for an information security industry in georgia that is already attracting national attention and embolden it through joint research projects with companies of all sizes and critical government agencies."" for more about the institute for information security & privacy, see

 georgia tech will submit a detailed proposal to university system of georgia leadership and the board of regents. 
 price gilbert library - georgia tech 
 aug 31, 2022 
 - atlanta, ga 
 steve mclaughlin, provost and executive vice president for academic affairs at georgia tech, has announced that initial planning is underway to explore the creation of a new academic unit around lifetime learning. 
 ""georgia tech's strategic plan has an emphasis on expanding access, and we have always been a leader in serving all kinds of learners. now we have an opportunity like never before to serve them in new and innovative ways,"" said mclaughlin. 
 after the launch of tech's strategic plan in late 2020, working groups were formed to explore ideas and initiatives to bring the 
 strategic focus areas 
 to life. nelson baker, dean of georgia tech professional education (gtpe) and charles isbell, dean and john p. imlay, jr. chair of the college of computing, co-chaired one of those groups, called ""gtpe next."" they focused on ways to realize the institute's strategic focus areas - expand access and amplify impact, among others. 
 the gtpe next group collaborated over the last year to develop several key takeaways, one of which was to explore the creation of a new academic unit. the proposed academic unit would expand research on learning innovation, hire faculty and develop curriculum around related topics, and provide services and support to learners from all phases of life. 
 ""dean baker, dean isbell, and gtpe next members provided a critical analysis of the role georgia tech can and must play to expand access as demands and the environment transform rapidly around us,"" said mclaughlin. 
 moving forward, the gtpe next group will evolve into a broader ""lifetime learning"" group and begin preparations for a proposal outlining the structure of a new academic unit. with the assistance of an external consultant, planning will begin immediately and take place through january 2023. an inclusive planning process will include smaller groups, managed by campus stakeholders, focused on key aspects of a potential new academic unit, such as finance, operations, academic vision, and faculty governance. they will also address administrative processes and internal policies, communications planning, and faculty and staff roles. the process will include opportunities for feedback from key campus stakeholders. 
 at the end of the lifetime learning planning process, georgia tech will submit a detailed proposal to university system of georgia leadership and the board of regents. any final decisions on organizational or programmatic implementation of the proposed new academic unit would be made following approval from the board of regents. 
 ""we want this effort and the resulting proposal to be inclusive of voices from across the georgia tech community,"" said mclaughlin. ""for this process to be comprehensive and reflective of our individual and collective strengths, we need and want all ideas at the table."" 
 a key foundational step for the proposed new academic unit is the expansion of georgia tech's ecosystem for lifetime learning. that expansion will include the organizational alignment of the 
 center for education integrating science, mathematics, and computing (ceismc) , the 
 center for 21st century universities (c21u) , and 
 gtpe . the three units will form the core group for the proposed academic unit. 
 leadership and members of the faculty and staff were informed about the alignment over the summer. no group is being absorbed into the other and day-to-day work will continue as usual. steve harmon, interim executive director of c21u and lizanne destefano, executive director of ceismc, will report to baker. the c21u team will continue to report to harmon. the ceismc team will continue to report to destefano. 
 ""we have incredible talent among the faculty and staff of ceismc, c21u, and gtpe, and it seems only natural that their expertise forms the starting point for the research and educational mission of the proposed new academic unit,"" said mclaughlin. ""these units are longtime campus partners and collaborators and have been driving forces behind georgia tech's continued leadership in this space across the state, nation, and world. we are excited to maximize and elevate their existing work."" 
 the early inspiration for this ecosystem and exploring a new academic unit track closely to a recommendation made several years ago by georgia tech's commission on creating the next in education (cne). led in part by c21u, the two-year cne exercise engaged more than 50 faculty, staff, and students, including baker and isbell, as well as other campus leadership and representatives from gtpe and ceismc. 
 in 2018, the commission released its report, deliberate innovation, lifetime education. the report envisioned continual engagement with learners, alignment with primary and secondary schools, flexible learning options, connectivity for learning beyond traditional college, and a network that supports learners all over the world. 
 ""georgia tech has a long history of investment in education outside of our traditional degree programs,"" said dean charles isbell. ""the next step is to explore how we might leverage our experience and our resources to make even more of a difference for learners and employers across the state … and to lead the national conversation on where lifetime learning goes from here.""

 georgia tech has won a portion of a new department of energy initiative on concentrated solar power.

 - atlanta, ga 
 georgia institute of technology researchers are part of a new u.s. department of energy (doe) initiative to develop the next generation of concentrated solar power (csp), a technology that uses heat from the sun to turn power-generating turbines. csp is an alternative to the better known photovoltaic technology, which produces electricity directly from sunlight. 
 six georgia tech researchers will receive a portion of a $72 million doe investment that will ultimately lead to construction and demonstration of an operating generation 3 csp facility. the georgia tech researchers will collect information on the thermophysical properties of molten salts used in concentrated solar facilities and study particle flows and heat transfer that may be part of thermal storage applications. 
 ""concentrated solar power is another option that allows us to generate electricity from sunlight,"" said shannon yee, assistant professor in georgia tech's george w. woodruff school of mechanical engineering and one of the award recipients. ""concentrated solar allows storage of the sun's heat, so we can generate electricity even when the sun isn't shining - at night, for example."" 
 concentrated solar facilities use mirrors to concentrate sunlight that is then captured by solar receivers installed at the top of towers. some existing installations use the heat to generate steam, which then drives a turbine to produce electric power. engineers want to operate the facilities at higher temperatures - 700 degrees celsius or above - to more effectively use the concentrated sunlight from fields of mirrors (i.e., heliostat fields) that deliver more concentrated sunlight to solar receivers than the widely used parabolic troughs. 
 ""we have to move to higher and higher temperatures, which means we have to use materials that are more and more exotic,"" said yee, whose research team will receive a total of about $2 million during the five-year program. ""we really don't have the information we need about the thermophysical properties of these materials. our goal will be to learn more about these materials, and to disseminate that information to the organizations that will be designing the new facility."" 
 an alternative to using molten salts is to use solid particle flows as a thermal energy carrier and storage medium to transfer thermal energy from the receiver to a working fluid to produce electricity. understanding these materials will be the work of associate professors peter loutzenhiser and devesh ranjan, and professor zhuomin zhang, all faculty members in the woodruff school of mechanical engineering. 
 ""we will be working together to characterize flow and model the heat transfer for different particles under different conditions as they are applied to csp applications,"" said loutzenhiser, whose team will receive $1.4 million from the doe over three years. ""the end goal will be supporting the use of particles as solar energy storage and carrier media to provide on-demand electricity derived from supercritical co 2 
 and / or air brayton cycles. solid particles are advantageous because they have high energy densities and can operate to higher temperatures without much degradation compared to molten salts."" 
 ranjan compared the particle flow to that of volcanic lava. ""the particles can absorb a lot of heat and allow us to move the thermal energy,"" he said. ""we will be looking at these particle flows in detail."" 
 the work will include both theoretical and applied aspects, loutzenhiser noted. ""we will examine fundamental behavior of the particle flows and heat transfer for different solar particle heating receiver configurations. this work will then be used to support the design and development of real technologies at scale-up that are being pursued by other generation 3 researchers within the scope of the program. the project will culminate in a suite of experiments that will use our high-flux solar simulator to closely mimic the conditions that the particle flows would experience under sunlight in an actual solar receiver."" 
 in addition to yee, loutzenhiser, ranjan and zhang, the overall doe project will also include said abdel-khalik and sheldon jeter, also mechanical engineering professors, who will support the development of the demonstration csp facility proposed by sandia national laboratories. the proposed sandia design will use particle heating technology. the team led by abdel-khalik and jeter has been developing particle heating csp technology in collaboration with sandia and others for several years. 
 ultimately one test facility will be built by a team to be chosen from among sandia or competitors brayton energy and the national renewable energy laboratory. those three organizations received preliminary awards from the doe. 
 the new doe funding will extend previous research on high-temperature components, develop them into integrated assemblies, and test these components and systems through a wide range of operational conditions, the agency said. 
 if successful, the doe expects that this will result in reducing the cost of a csp system by approximately $0.02 per kilowatt-hour, which is 40 percent of the way to the 2030 cost goals of $0.05 per kilowatt-hour (kwh) for baseload csp plants. 
 ""doe has led the world in csp research,"" said daniel simmons, principal deputy assistant secretary for the doe's office of energy efficiency and renewable energy. ""these projects will help facilitate the next wave of new technologies and continue the effort to maintain american leadership in this space."" 
 through the generation 3 csp program, three teams will compete to build an integrated system that can efficiently receive solar heat and deliver it to a working fluid at a temperature greater than 700 degrees celsius, while incorporating thermal energy storage, the agency said in its news release. 
 over the first two-year period, those teams will work to de-risk various aspects of diversified csp technology pathways, prepare a detailed design for a test facility, and be subjected to a rigorous review process to select a single awardee to construct their proposed facility. if selected, they will receive an additional $25 million over the subsequent three years to build a test facility that allows diverse teams of researchers, laboratories, developers and manufacturers to remove key technological risks for the next generation csp technology, the doe said.

 researchers from the georgia institute of technology college of computing developed a new cyber security analysis method that discovered 11 previously unknown internet browser security flaws. their findings were honored with the internet defense prize, an award presented by facebook in partnership with usenix this week at the 24 th 
 usenix security symposium. ph.d. students byoungyoung lee and chengyu song, with professors taesoo kim and wenke lee, of georgia tech received $100,000 from facebook to continue their research and increase its impact to make the internet safer. their research, ""type casting verification: stopping an emerging attack vector,"" explores vulnerabilities in c++ programs (such as chrome and firefox) that result from ""bad casting"" or ""type confusion."" bad casting enables an attacker to corrupt the memory in a browser so that it follows a malicious logic instead of proper instructions. the researchers developed a new, proprietary detection tool called caver to catch them. caver is a run-time detection tool with 7.6 percent - 64.6 percent overhead on browser performance (chrome and firefox, respectively). the 11 vulnerabilities identified by georgia tech have been confirmed and fixed by vendors. ""it is time for the internet community to start addressing the more difficult, deeper security problems,"" says 
 wenke lee , professor in the school of computer science and an adviser to the team. ""the security research community has been working on various ways to detect and fix memory safety bugs for decades, and have made progress on ‘stack overflow' and ‘heap overflow' bugs, but these have now become relatively easy problems. our work studied the much harder and deeper bugs - in particular ‘use-after-free' and ‘bad casting' - and our tools discovered serious security bugs in widely used software, such as firefox and libstdc++. we are grateful to facebook for this recognition."" the work was selected for facebook's second ever internet defense prize award, which recognizes superior quality research that combines a working prototype with significant contributions to the security of the internet -- particularly in the areas of protection and defense. the award is meant to recognize the direction of the research and to inspire researchers to focus on high-impact areas. ""designing defensive security technology has never been more important, and that's why we are once again offering the internet defense prize to stimulate high quality research in this area,"" said ioannis papagiannis, security engineering manager at facebook. ""the georgia tech team's novel technique for detecting bad type casts in c++ programs is the type of standout approach we want to encourage. we look forward to seeing what the team does next to create broader impact and improve security on the internet."" ""georgia tech's award-winning entry exemplifies the groundbreaking security research that has become a hallmark of the usenix security symposium,"" said casey henderson, executive director of the usenix association. ""their trailblazing work stood out among the many outstanding submissions judged by the usenix security awards committee and facebook. we look forward to their continued progress enabled by the internet defense prize in the coming year.""

georgia-tech-historian-co-authors-book-sports-war-and-pandemic.txt,"georgia tech historian co-authors book on sports, war, and pandemic 
 georgia tech historian johnny smith writes about the influence of pandemic flu and war on sports in 1918. 
 in 1918, war and a flu pandemic upended the world of sports. while the war forced the world series between the chicago cubs and the boston red sox, pictured, to be moved from october to september, the event itself likely helped spread the disease throughout the city of boston, according to johnny smith, associate professor in the school of history and sociology. he has co-authored a new book on the era called ""war fever"" 
 mar 24, 2020 
 - atlanta, ga 
 by michael pearson 
 it's the last week of the 1918 baseball season. the boston red sox are on the cusp of winning the world series on the back of baseball legend-in-making babe ruth. world war i is still raging in europe. and a killer virus is stalking the streets of boston. 
 this is the backdrop for 
 war fever: boston, baseball, and america in the shadow of the great war,  the latest work by georgia institute of technology historian johnny smith -a story that resonates today amid the spread of the coronavirus and its impact on our lives. 
 ""we are living in a moment where a global pandemic has disrupted everyday life in ways we have not seen since 1918,"" said 
 smith , the j.c. ""bud"" shaw professor of sports history in the school of history and sociology. 
 smith's book with his frequent collaborator, purdue university historian randy roberts, is only partially about the flu pandemic. the book is the interwoven tale of three figures - ruth, boston symphony orchestra conductor karl muck, and an army officer from the boston area named charles whittlesey, who led the ""lost battalion"" that held off german forces in the argonne forest. it examines the impact of anti-german xenophobia and the flu pandemic on boston in the fall of 1918. 
 the book tells how many of the patriotic rituals we expect at sporting events today - the playing of the national anthem and other patriotic tunes, honors for members of the military - stem from world war i. it also speaks to widespread anti-german sentiment, including sudden doubts about muck, one of many people of german descent whose loyalties were questioned during the war. 
 the effects of the flu also are an integral part of the tale smith and roberts weave, from ruth coming down with a case of the flu during the season and nearly dying from a treatments - presaging the coming epidemic - to the possible effects of the virus on attendance during the decisive sixth game of the series. 
 they also offer a new argument that the series helped further spread the flu throughout boston, which ultimately saw some 4,500 deaths. an estimated 675,000 people in the united states and 50 million people worldwide died as a result of the flu that emerged that year. 
 with all of this going on, the red sox victory ""failed to generate celebrations in the streets of boston,"" smith says, as news from overseas and the flu epidemic stole all the headlines. 
 war and illness led to the biggest disruption in sports until now, smith notes, with hundreds of contests, football games, boxing matches, and other events canceled or postponed. 
 similar cancellations swept through the sports industry a few weeks ago, with every major sports league suspending operations, leaving millions of suddenly homebound americans with no sports to entertain them. of course, the world is different now than it was a hundred years ago. streaming video will help fill the gap left by sports in a way that the early 20 th 
 century communications tools could not, smith said. 
 but he predicts that once the virus' grip on society has eased, sports will return to its place as a unifying diversion, a role it has long filled. 
 ""it happened in the ‘20s because the culture shifted to looking for an escape from the war and the flu,"" smith said. ""it happened after 9 / 11. it's as if the stadium serves as a cathedral of normalcy. and there will come a time when we will fill the arenas again and celebrate this return to normalcy. and it will be a very moving moment.""

 mar 29, 2017 
 - atlanta, ga 
 student entrepreneurs from the 15 universities in the atlantic coast conference (acc) will spend two days at georgia tech this week, pitching their inventions and startups before panels of judges. 
 the 
 acc inventure prize 
 rewards students with $30,000 in cash prizes for innovations with the potential to solve societal problems. 
 the competition is an offshoot of georgia tech's own 
 inventure prize , which started in 2009. 
 cauteryguard, the winner of this year's georgia tech contest, will represent the institute in the acc competition. four biomedical engineering students developed 
 cauteryguard , a safer medical device used to remove unwanted tissue and to stop bleeding. 
 both inventure competitions leverage the maker culture flourishing at college campuses across the country. the contests foster entrepreneurial confidence and encourage students to push their ideas further. 
 ""the inventure prize at georgia tech continues to give our students exciting opportunities to flex their creative and entrepreneurial muscles through academic competition,"" said rafael l. bras, georgia tech's provost and executive vice president for academic affairs and the k. harrison brown family chair. ""the success and energy around the competition were the motivators for the acc provosts to extend the format to the entire conference and increase the collaborative academic initiatives among the 15 schools. we look forward to hosting the acc inventure prize again this year."" 
 the acc inventure prize is sponsored by the acc academic consortium, which supports academic initiatives among member universities. 
 during the two-day program, students will tour atlanta incubators and accelerators and meet with entrepreneurs and venture capitalists. 
 while 
 15 teams 
 enter the competition, only five will advance to the finale taking place friday at 8pm in the georgia tech ferst center for the arts. 
 the finale will be televised on georgia public broadcasting and other pbs affiliates around the country. the finale can be 
 watched online here . 
 teams will be judged in four areas: entrepreneurship, business model, quality of the idea, and the probability of becoming a successful business. 
 first place wins $15,000, sponsored by united technologies research center. the second-place team earns $10,000. a $5,000 people's choice award goes to the fans' favorite, which will be determined by online and text voting during the televised final round. 
 cauteryguard enters the acc inventure prize competition with $25,000 in winnings from the institute's competition. the team won first place and was named fans' favorite. 
 the team redesigned an electrocautery device by adding a retractable tip. this change prevents the risk of burns many doctors and patients face from the device's exposed tip. it also eliminates the chance of fires in operating rooms because an exposed tip could come into contact with flammable materials. 
 the team members are: jack corelli, hunter hatcher, devin li and dev mandavia. 
 ""it's incredible to represent georgia tech,"" mandavia said. ""we are thankful for all the support we've received over the past year and a half of working on the device.""

 with health care a major focus at the state and national levels, the georgia institute of technology welcomed georgia lt. gov. geoff duncan and other state legislative leaders to campus for a health summit focused on how technology drives innovation, leads to better patient outcomes, and reduces costs. 
 duncan, joined by georgia state sens. dean burke, greg kirk, and ben watson, toured the institute's advanced technology development center (atdc) to learn more about the incubator's efforts to support health technology (healthtech) innovation and meet startup leaders in its portfolio. 
 burke spearheaded the visit from the state government delegation. 
 a program of the enterprise innovation institute, tech's economic development arm, atdc is the state of georgia's technology startup incubator. created in 1980, atdc has helped its companies generate more than $12 billion in revenue and raise in excess of $3 billion in investment capital. 
 ""one of my most ambitious goals is for georgia to become the technology capital of the east coast. incubators like atdc are critical to that vision,"" duncan, a tech alum, said. ""georgia boasts the top talent coming out of our world-class university system, business-friendly environment, low cost of living, high quality of life, and emerging venture capital presence necessary to grow from the silicon valley of the south to the tech capital of the east coast."" 
 the delegation received an overview of atdc's focused efforts to support healthtech innovation and startups, including the july 2018  launch of the atdc healthtech program . 
 supported with a financial gift from nasco, the atdc healthtech program focuses on helping entrepreneurs launch viable companies in that sector, kirk barnes, atdc's healthtech catalyst explained to the delegation. 
 recently, atdc entered into a  collaboration with navicent health 's center for disruption & innovation (cfdi) to support the development of new technologies, treatments, and care created by healthcare technology-oriented companies based in the state. the goal: to improve the health and lives of patients in central and south georgia. 
 it's a goal that resonated with duncan. 
 ""it's encouraging to see the system built around these ideas and to see these ideas commercialized,"" the lieutenant governor said. ""it's not just about cutting costs, it's about improving service and quality of care. 
 ""i'm appreciative of the impressive work being done at georgia tech and atdc, and i look forward to working alongside them as lieutenant governor."" 
 since its launch, the atdc healthtech program's portfolio of companies has grown to 48 and includes a host of technologies ranging from digital health and medical devices to drug discovery tools and healthcare robotics. 
 one of those companies, rimidi inc., a provider of software and clinical analytics for chronic disease management,  raised more than $6.5 million  in its series a-1 financing, which included an investment from eli lilly and co. 
 tee faircloth, who helped spearhead the summit, is founder of coordinated care inc. (cci), an atdc healthtech company. cci, one of the companies the delegation met, works with urban and rural hospitals to move patients back to their local hospitals for rehabilitation. 
 faircloth said such summits give state leaders valuable insight into how public support of programs such as atdc and public-private partnerships such as the one with nasco work. 
 ""with the incoming administration's focus on rural healthcare, it's great to see them embrace innovation as an agent of change so early on. this summit continues the dialogue of how we, as technology companies focused on bringing solutions and innovation to healthcare, can work with state and local leaders,"" faircloth said. 
 ""we want to find areas where we can work together in these public-private partnerships to leverage the resources of the atlanta and georgia ecosystems so that we really improve healthcare for all georgians.""

 cdait releases white paper titled ""driving new modes of iot-facilitated citizen / user engagement.""

 jul 09, 2018 
 - atlanta, ga 
 with an ever-expanding research portfolio from georgia tech faculty, students and member companies, the georgia institute of technology's center for the development and application of internet of things technologies (cdait) has released a white paper titled ""driving new modes of iot-facilitated citizen / user engagement."" it summarizes the collective opinion of practitioners and researchers regarding the internet of things (iot), highlighting in particular the inherent intricacies of its value chain, the possible roadmaps to success, and the critical issues that must be urgently resolved. 
 produced by cdait's iot thought leadership working group, the report explores the smart city ecosystem as ""a case in point"", reviewing situations in which emerging technologies bring about radical change to traditional business models and substantial benefits to the iot users. 
 ""this report is timely as the internet of things is currently generating a lot of questions from legislators, regulators and businesses in the united states and around the world,"" said dr. karen i. matthews, technology and market development manager, science and technology at corning incorporated, and chair of the cdait iot thought leadership working group. 
 ""on the one hand, the risks surrounding cybersecurity and privacy are a legitimate source of concern, and on the other hand, the expectations fueled by widespread enthusiasm regarding the radical transformative nature of the internet of things and its associated huge potential are in some cases slow to materialize,"" she said. 
 the white paper introduces an original screening concept called ""epic,"" which is tailored for cities and any other organized collectivity in charge of the public interest to help them assess the attractiveness and impact of iot-driven undertakings. through epic, an iot project is evaluated from four angles: ethics (impact on individuals, groups and society), profit (economic and social), intimacy (ease of access, mutual openness and customized experience), and connectivity (medium, computing and trustworthiness). 
 ""readers will find useful discussions and references concerning pressing iot issues such as security, privacy, platforms and device connection,"" said alain louchez, co-founder and managing director of cdait. ""one of the paper's appeals is that it blends academic and industry perspectives and has a bent for action."" 
 among the key expectations regarding the iot future are the following: 
 the iot will grow in clusters where various use cases and their related devices, applications and connectivity shape their ecosystem. 
 there will be a natural tendency for clusters to link first to other like clusters, creating ""clusters of clusters."" 
 standards and regulations will emerge that enhance the performance and interoperability of the clusters of uses. 
 the growth and integration of iot clusters will ultimately lead to an overall iot common platform. 
 the paper's contributors represent a variety of industry sectors and academic disciplines, and are directly involved in building the iot and its myriad applications. each shared personal ideas, observations and viewpoints grounded in real-life experience. 
 ""we hope that this effort will provide a better understanding of what the internet of things is about, including benefits, critical challenges, and available avenues to address them,"" matthews said.

 the georgia institute of technology's center for the development and application of internet of things technologies (cdait) will host an international conference on the internet of things (iot) and sustainability july 18, 2019, at the georgia tech research institute in atlanta. 
 titled ""the internet of things for sustainability is smart business,"" the conference will explore catalysts and use cases to examine some of the key promises and challenges that relate to the application of iot technologies toward building a sustainable world. secondarily, the conference aims to highlight the business opportunities that exist at the intersection of iot and sustainability. 
 iot connects a wide range of devices with smart capabilities and is increasingly seen as a core component of corporate and societal digital transformation. sustainability or sustainable development - that which meets ""the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs,"" according to the oft-quoted united nations 
 brundtland report 
 - is now viewed by businesses as 
 mission critical . 
 at iot week in june 2017 in geneva, switzerland, the international telecommunication union (itu) - the united nations specialized agency for information and communication technologies -  and other iot stakeholders in their ""internet of things 
 declaration 
 to achieve the sustainable development goals"" underlined that the iot can ""directly contribute to achieving the targets in the sustainable development goals (sdgs). accordingly, the emerging iot paradigm has the potential to create an efficient, effective, and secure ecosystem taking advantage of connected devices for managing the major global challenges faced by this and future generations."" 
 the conference will feature business and academic leaders widely recognized for their expertise. bilel jamoussi, chief of the study groups department, itu standardization bureau, will open the conference. he will be followed by robert schmid, chief iot technologist at deloitte, who will deliver the conference keynote. 
 the program is built around two general roundtable discussions and five shorter sessions on specific topics. 
 the first roundtable will address why it makes business sense for companies to focus on sustainability through the deployment of iot technologies. the second roundtable will focus on educational and training needs in light of the related business objectives. 
 the five sessions will tackle a range of specific issues such as regulation and policy perspectives; home and commercial buildings; manufacturing; supply chain and logistics; and consumer products. 
 the conference includes a luncheon, breaks, and a reception. there is no charge thanks to the generous support of various corporate organizations including lead sponsors deloitte, the coca-cola company, and comcast. 
 additional details and registration information can be found here:   https: / / cdait.gatech.edu / internet-things-sustainability-smart-business 
 while aimed at a business audience concerned with sustainable development, the conference will also be of interest to participants in any and all links of the internet of things value chain as well as representatives from academia, government, industry, and media curious about the impact of disruptive technologies on the world of today and tomorrow.

 freeman . ""georgia tech is excited to be part of the digital credentials consortium and to contribute to a report that seeks to define crucial standards for the future of digital credentials."" 
 in 
 building the digital credential infrastructure for the future , the authors reiterate the group's commitment to open source and open standards. the report outlines additional credential standards that the consortium sees as critical to the development of verifiable digital credentials, including: 
 flexible ways to express the identities of issuers and learners that tie into existing university services 
 stronger privacy-by-design and privacy-by-default with attention to regional legal frameworks 
 more reliable revocation mechanisms and credential lifecycle management 
 direct learner agency over one's lifelong learning record 
 higher level of consistency between the machine-readable data of the credential, the human-readable visual representation, and the necessary output formats-paper or digital 
 ""we've set our sights on the design and governance of a technology infrastructure for academic credentials - transforming credentials into tokens of social and human capital that can create new opportunities for participation in education and industry,"" said 
 philipp schmidt , advisor to the vice president of open learning at mit. ""our report marks the first step in the process."" 
 about the digital credentials consortium 
 the digital credentials consortium (dcc) was founded in 2018 by leading universities with expertise in the design of verifiable digital academic credentials. driven by a mission to create a trusted, distributed, and shared infrastructure that becomes the standard for issuing, storing, displaying, and verifying digital academic credentials, the dcc's goal is to contribute to an education landscape that increases learner agency and promotes more equitable learning and career pathways. while the consortium is primarily concerned with use-cases in higher education, their work is also part of a broader effort to bridge post-secondary and lifelong learning, connecting traditional institutions of higher education, non-formal education providers, as well as the workplace, through interoperable standards. learn more at digitalcredentials.mit.edu.

 the georgia institute of technology is among more than 80 public and private colleges united in a new effort to improve the college admission application process for all students. the coalition for access, affordability, and success is committed to making college more affordable and accessible for students from diverse backgrounds and to helping students earn degrees. over the next few months, the coalition will develop tools and processes intended to address many of the barriers that prevent students from attending college or successfully earning a degree. the coalition, which was announced monday, is developing a free platform of online tools to streamline planning for and applying to college. the first phase of tools will be available to high school freshmen, sophomores and juniors beginning in january 2016. in creating this platform, members hope to motivate a stronger college-going mindset among students of all backgrounds, especially those from low-income families and underrepresented groups who have historically had less access to leading colleges. ""georgia tech is committed to promoting college access for all students, and participation in the coalition for access, affordability, and success is a positive step in pursuit of that goal,"" said rick clark, director of undergraduate admission at georgia tech. ""additionally, we believe this platform will reduce unnecessary stress, help students and their families identify excellent college options, and put their best foot forward in the college admission process.""   that stress can create barriers for students, most notably for those who are the first in their families to attend college. the coalition hopes to address these challenges through its free online tools and increased transparency around admissions and financial aid. later this year, the coalition will share details about new college planning and application tools that will streamline admission and financial aid processes, which will allow students to begin planning for college much earlier in their high school years. the online tools - which will include a digital portfolio, a collaboration platform, and an application portal - will make students more familiar with the application process and give everyone the same opportunities for college success. more information and a list of participating colleges and universities can be found at coalitionforcollegeaccess.org.

georgia-tech-lead-nasa-center-lunar-research-and-exploration.txt,"georgia tech to lead nasa center on lunar research and exploration 
 the center's research about the nature of lunar dust and volatiles will support upcoming human-crewed missions to the moon. 
 may 18, 2023 
 georgia tech researchers have been 
 selected by nasa 
 to lead a $7.5 million center that will study the lunar environment and the generation and properties of volatiles and dust. the center for lunar environment and volatile exploration research (clever) will be led by 
 thomas orlando , professor in the 
 school of chemistry and biochemistry . 
 clever is the successor to orlando's pioneering 
 reveals 
 (radiation effects on volatiles and exploration of asteroids and lunar surfaces) center, and both are part of nasa's solar system exploration research virtual institute (sservi) program. 
 reveals and clever look ahead to the return of humans to the moon for sustained periods - a key part of nasa's plan for space exploration in the coming decade. volatiles such as water, molecular oxygen, methane, and hydrogen are crucial to supporting human activity on the moon. dust is also important since the space-weathered particles can pose health effects to astronauts and hazards to the technology and hardware. 
 the interdisciplinary group of researchers supported by clever will study how the solar wind and micrometeorites produce volatiles, research how ice and dust behave in the lunar environment, develop new materials to deal with potential dust buildup, and invent new analysis tools to support the upcoming crewed missions of the 
 artemis program . 
 "" the resources and knowledge that clever will produce will be useful for the sustainable presence of humans on the moon,"" orlando says. "" we have the correct mix of fundamental science and exploration - real, fundamental, ground-truth measurements; very good theory / modeling; and engineering - an easy mix with georgia tech and outside partners."" 
 orlando adds that clever adopts a unique perspective on the challenges of understanding how to operate on earth's moon. ""the atomic and molecular view of processes with angstrom distances and femtosecond time scales can help unravel what is happening on planetary spatial scales and geological time frames,"" he says. ""we can also translate our knowledge into materials, devices, and technology pretty quickly, and this is necessary if we want to help the artemis astronauts."" 
 clever includes investigators from georgia tech, 
 university of georgia, the florida space institute, university of hawaii, auburn university, space sciences institute, the johns hopkins university applied physics laboratory, lawrence berkeley national laboratory, nasa ames, nasa kennedy space center, and partners in italy and germany. in addition to pursuing a blend of fundamental science and mission support, clever 
 will also emphasize the research and career development of students and young investigators, another important goal of the sservi system.

 - atlanta, ga 
 russell dupuis, a pioneering engineer in the field of solid-state lighting technology, has been awarded the 2021 queen elizabeth prize for engineering (qeprize). 
 dupuis, the steve w. chaddick endowed chair in electro-optics in georgia tech's school of electrical and computer engineering (ece), received the award for his role in the creation and commercialization of led lighting, which forms the basis of all solid-state lighting technology. he shares the prize with four of his colleagues from universities and industry around the world. 
 ""it is really something to share in this award with my friends and colleagues,"" said dupuis, a georgia research alliance eminent scholar in ece. ""all five of us played an important role, and this recognition means a lot to me personally."" 
 first awarded in 2013 in the name of her majesty the queen, the qeprize celebrates groundbreaking innovation in engineering. the 2021 winners were announced tuesday. 
 administrators of the prize said solid-state lighting technology changed how we illuminate our world. it can be found everywhere, from sports stadiums, parking garages, inside and outside commercial buildings, homes, digital displays, computer screens, and cell phones to hand-held laser pointers, automobile headlights, and traffic lights. today's high-performance leds are used in efficient solid-state lighting products across the world and are contributing to the sustainable development of world economies by reducing energy consumption. 
 visible leds are now a global industry predicted to be worth over $108 billion by 2025 through low-cost, high-efficiency lighting. they are playing a crucial role in reducing carbon dioxide emissions, consuming significantly less energy and producing 90% less heat than incandescent lighting, and their large-scale use reduces the energy demand required to cool buildings. for this, they are often referred to as the ""green revolution"" within lighting. 
 ""the impact of this innovation is not to be understated. it makes lighting a lot cheaper and more accessible for emerging economies, said sir christopher snowden, chair of the qeprize judging panel.  ""for example, leds are being used on fishing boats where previously the only option would have been paraffin lamps. they are much cheaper and safer. it is not only an extreme engineering achievement, but a societal impact that has a significant impact on the environment."" 
 dupuis, a member of the national academy of engineering, the nation's highest honor for engineering professionals, shares the prize with: shuji nakamura, the cree chair in solid-state lighting and displays in the materials department at the university of california, santa barbara; m. george craford, a solid-state lighting fellow at philips lumileds lighting company; isamu akasaki, a university professor at nagoya university and meijo university (japan); and nick holonyak jr., the john bardeen endowed chair emeritus in electrical and computer engineering and physics at the university of illinois at urbana-champaign. 
 the winners will be honored at a ceremony later this year.

 the 
 georgia tech nmr center , a campus-wide multiuser facility, will hold an open house on friday of homecoming week, oct. 28, 2016. everyone is invited, especially visiting alumni, to view the latest additions to the center's suite of nuclear magnetic resonance (nmr) spectrometers. 
 nmr spectrometry is a powerful analytical tool, providing information such as molecular structure and dynamics. advances in instrumentation have enabled nmr spectrometry to move into solid-state and solution applications. lately, nmr has been used increasingly in high-throughput screening for drug discovery and related uses. 
 analysis by nmr is based on the interaction of certain atomic nuclei with an external magnetic field. the higher the frequency of this external magnetic field, the greater the sensitivity of the instrument, and the richer the information one can get from nmr analysis 
 in july 2016, the georgia tech nmr center installed two 
 bruker avance instruments , one with a 700-mhz, and the other with an 800-mhz, magnet. these are among the highest-field-strength-magnets currently available in the market. 
 ""the recent investment of more than $5 million in new solid-state and solution capabilities enables advanced studies encompassing the imaging of small objects, the atomic level structure and dynamics of ceramics, small molecules of relevance to biology and materials science, synthetic polymers and biological macromolecules,"" says 
 angus p. wilkinson , a chemistry professor and associate chair for operations and undergraduate programs in the 
 school of chemistry and biochemistry. 
 ""georgia tech's investment in this scientific equipment not only will make our experiments more successful and our research more grandiose,"" says 
 julia kubanek , a professor of biological sciences and the associate dean for research in the college of sciences. ""they have already been effectively used to recruit new faculty to georgia tech,"" she adds. 
 nmr instruments use superconducting magnet technology, cooling the magnet to the extremely low temperature of 4 k, with the help of liquid helium. ""in addition to our working instruments, a sectioned magnet will be available for inspection so that visitors can gain an appreciation of the internal construction of these very expensive magnets,"" wilkinson says. also on display will be the newly installed helium recovery plant, which takes helium as it boils off from the magnets and condenses it to liquid helium at 4 k. given the shortage of helium worldwide, ""this system helps conserve a nonrenewable and very expensive resource,"" wilkinson says. 
 leslie gelbaum , the center's manager and a principal research scientist in the school of chemistry and biochemistry, will be on hand to answer questions and consult on scientific problems relating to biological and non-biological molecules in solution. 
 johannes leisen , the center's assistant director and also a principal research scientist in the school of chemistry and biochemistry, will be available to answer questions and consult on problems that relate to studies of solid samples and imaging. 
 the open house will take place at 2:00-4:00 pm on friday, oct. 28, 2016. the center is located in the basement of the 
 molecular science and engineering building 
 (901 atlantic drive), room g143. 
 visitors are asked to gather in room g021 for an introductory slide show and snacks, before going to room g143 in small groups for the lab tour.

 the nation's first remote robotics lab, the robotarium, opens. 
 the robotarium opens on august 22, 2017. from left to right: steve cross (vice president of research), magnus egerstedt, g.p. ""bud"" peterson and rafael bras (provost and executive vice president for academic affairs) 
 aug 23, 2017 
 - atlanta, ga 
 the nation's first remote robotics lab, and the nearly 100 machines that call it home, is now open thanks to a little help from its friends. 
 the robotarium held its grand opening on tuesday in the van leer building. appropriately, a scissor-wielding robot (named snips) cut the ribbon. later, a researcher from the university of illinois at urbana-champaign skyped into the room to run a live remote experiment. 
 ""it's time to begin a new era in robotics,"" said magnus egerstedt, the julian t. hightower chair in systems and controls and a professor in the school of electrical and computer engineering. 
 egerstedt, who oversees the lab, was joined by president g.p. ""bud"" peterson, other cabinet members and more than a dozen congressional staffers who were on campus to learn more about georgia tech research and initiatives. 
 the robotarium is a $2.5 million facility funded by the national science foundation and office of naval research. it allows researchers around the world to upload their own code, then have georgia tech's rolling and flying swarm robots perform the experiment. afterwards the researcher is sent data and video. 
 egerstedt, executive director of georgia tech's institute for robotics and intelligent machines, dreamed up the lab about two years ago. it's expensive to build and maintain robots, let alone an entire robotics facility. he wanted more people to have access. 
 ""it irritated me, and it still does, that robotics research is largely a resource competition and not a ‘who has the best ideas' competition,"" he said. ""the robotarium is solving that. if you have a good idea, you should have a platform to try it."" 
 hundreds of students visited the lab after the ribbon-cutting ceremony for an open house. the robotarium team conducted several experiments, including flying quadcopters able to change formation without crashing into each other. 
 researchers can upload their programs and run experiments for free by visiting 
 www.robotarium.org . see photos from the ribbon cutting.

georgia-tech-part-5-million-grant-funded-center-advance-robotics-poultry-processing.txt,"georgia tech part of $5 million grant-funded center to advance robotics in poultry processing 
 researchers at georgia tech and four other institutes were awarded the grant to increase use of artificial intelligence and robotics in chicken processing. 
 the center for scalable and intelligent automation in poultry processing, established by a $5 million usda-nifa grant, aims to adapt robotic automation to the poultry processing industry. 
 mar 10, 2023 
 - atlanta, ga 
 this news release first appeared in the  university of arkansas division of agriculture 
 newsroom, and has been tailored for georgia tech readers. 
 researchers at georgia tech, the university of arkansas system, the university of nebraska-lincoln, and fort valley state university in georgia were awarded a $5 million grant to increase use of artificial intelligence and robotics in chicken processing to reduce waste in deboning and detect pathogens. 
 the grant from the u.s. department of agriculture's national institute of food and agriculture will establish the center for scalable and intelligent automation in poultry processing. the center, led by the university of arkansas system division of agriculture, will join researchers from five institutions in three states in efforts to adapt robotic automation to chicken meat processing. 
 douglas britton, manager of the agricultural technology research program at the georgia tech research institute (gtri), said his team was very excited to work on this project with experts at the four other institutions. 
 ""the ultimate goal is to drive transformational innovation into the poultry and meat processing industry through automation, robotics, ai, and vr technologies,"" britton said. ""building on years of work in the gtri agricultural technology research program, we are pleased to see that the usda-nifa has chosen this team to continue these efforts."" 
 georgia tech is a major partner in the project, and was awarded $2 million to focus on automating the processing lines that turn chickens into meat, said jeyam subbiah, professor and head of the food science department for the division of agriculture and the dale bumpers college of agricultural, food and life sciences at the university of arkansas, and director of the project. the grant is for four years. 
 the arkansas agricultural experiment station, the research arm of the division of agriculture, will receive $2.2 million from the grant primarily to focus on food safety automation for poultry processing plants. 
 the remaining grant money will be divided between julia mcquillan, willa cather professor of sociology at the university of nebraska-lincoln, and brou kuoakou, associate dean for research at fort valley state university in georgia. 
 jeff buhr, a usda agricultural research service scientist, will contribute his expertise in broiler physiology to guide robotic deboning of meat, subbiah said. 
 georgia is the nation's top broiler producer. arkansas is number 3, according to 2021 figures from usda. 
 meeting the challenge 
 the recent impetus to automate chicken processing began with the covid-19 pandemic, subbiah said. the illness spread quickly among workers on the processing line. since the worst of the pandemic, the poultry industry, like many others, has been having trouble hiring enough workers. 
 ""poultry processing lines began 70 to 80 years ago,"" subbiah said. ""since then, there have been only incremental changes in technology. today, there's a need for transformative change."" 
 humans can feel when a knife hits a bone. in contrast, existing automation in poultry processing, like deboners, wastes a lot of meat. 
 ""human deboners leave about 13 percent of meat on the bones,"" subbiah said. ""automated deboners leave 16 to 17 percent. on an industrial scale, that's a significant loss in value. we will use artificial intelligence and virtual reality to improve precision and reduce wastage."" 
 automation can relieve labor shortages, subbiah said. it also allows plants to locate in rural areas with a smaller labor force but nearer poultry houses and with lower property costs. 
 initially, people working remotely may help advance robotic processing. subbiah envisions workers logging on from home with virtual-reality goggles and haptics gloves to control robots located miles away. 
 while working remotely, the labor force will teach artificial intelligence how to cut up chickens of varying sizes and shapes. 
 ""automated machines right now are programmed to debone or cut up chickens based on an average size and shape. but no chicken is that size or shape,"" subbiah said. ""robot-wielded knives cut meat poorly. the machines have to learn how to adjust to the reality of random sizes and shapes.""

georgia-tech-plans-tokyo-redesign-using-social-data-including-tweets.txt,"georgia tech plans tokyo redesign using social data - including tweets 
 students use big data and machine learning for neighborhood proposals. 
 perry yang with tokyo smart city designs, in the eco urban lab 
 apr 05, 2022 
 - atlanta, ga 
 what if everyone in a neighborhood had a voice in redesigning it? how can city planners democratize future smart cities, big data analytics and decision-making by involving citizen participation? 
 that's the vision of the tokyo smart city studio, using gps and other location data to track trends in human behavior. the studio is part of the  eco urban lab , directed by  perry yang . in the studio, georgia tech designers are changing the way we plan cities. 
 according to yang, designers need to know, ""how urban form accommodates flows of all kinds, including information, energy, and human movements, and how patterns of flows are mapped through physical configurations that change over time."" using advanced analytics on a massive pool of data, designers can see how people choose to use a space. then, they can make decisions based on real behavior rather than theoretical models or small surveys, yang said. 
 projects from the studio recently drew esri's attention for their advanced use of geographic analytics. as part of the studio, students used large-scale location data to model traffic flows in different segments of tokyo. 
 esri is best known as the company that developed gis (geographic information system) software which is widely used by city and regional planners.  esri's blog  covers innovative use of geospatial data. 
 to date, the studio has delivered smart-city proposals for three different tokyo neighborhoods: urawa-misono in 2017, kyojima in 2018-2019, and shinagawa in 2020. yang said this year's project will involve the nihonbashi district, home of the tokyo stock exchange and a historic origin of tokyo's modern urban culture. 
 tokyo is one of the busiest, most populous cities in the world, and as such, it's difficult to create sustainable, healthy environments, said yang. his studio focuses on global collaboration to solve the problems facing cities like tokyo. 
 for the nihonbashi district, the studio is collaborating with the  department of urban engineering at the university of tokyo ; the  global carbon project ; the  national institute for environmental studies, japan ; and the  mitsui fudosan university of tokyo laboratory . 
 thanks to the diversity of ideas that this collaboration generates, the tokyo smart city studio proposals aren't purely theoretical. students work on real neighborhood needs identified by the local government, using real on-site data gathered and processed by groundbreaking methods. massive amounts of data require ai techniques and algorithms to process some of them. 
 design makes cities smart 
 unlike a smartphone or a smart home, a smart city is measured by more than its internet connection or its automation. a city is smart because its design is based on data about flows of people, resources, energy, and information. ""empowered by new tools and technologies, cities are now far more designable than ever before. future urban design and development are to be data-driven,"" yang said. 
 ""cities are becoming more interactive and situation-driven and have to be more responsive, adaptable, and resilient to future conditions."" 
 only in the past few years have smartphones, gps, and internet-of-things (iot) devices made real data on a city-wide scale available. these new technologies may enable good planning that is driven by social, institutional, and physical contexts, yang said. 
 students predict mobility using ai techniques 
 but new data and a new design philosophy require new methods of design, which haven't been created yet.  to meet this challenge, yang's students use ai techniques to create models of behavior. 
 an early test in urawa-misono used tokyo traffic data. the model was ""trained"" using existing traffic data. designers then check the model to see if correctly predicts congestion points. if it works, that suggests the model can be used to estimate the impact of design changes on traffic flow. 
 methods like this allow designers to move mobility analytics into the design phase. mobility is key in the urban environment, but mobility studies usually aren't done until we envision how future urban spaces are shaped through design. 
 ""mobility research during these studios developed test processes to better integrate mobility metrics with design decisions,"" yang said. 
 the following studio in kyojima expanded the role of deep learning techniques. georgia tech students participated in street experiments in tokyo by carrying vital sensors to measure data such as  heart beat, temperature, humidity, uv, pressure and acceleration of human movement, to understand human perception and their connections to urban street environments. students created a rapid automatic assessment of sequential urban experiences: basically, how pleasant a person would experience walking down a street. 
 the resulting article,  computing sequential experience of an urban street using deep learning technique , led by helen chen, a ph.d. student in the school of city and regional planning, was presented at the 2019 international conference of urban informatics. 
 both the urawa-misono and kyojima studio projects made mobility analysis and feedback part of the design phase, yielding designs better supporting resilience, sustainability, and community health. 
 using social media to check risk of heat stress 
 in tokyo, studio planners expanded mobility studies to include public health. tokyo officials were concerned that heat waves would pose a risk to the 2020 olympic crowds. 
 to address this, researchers used a combination of gps and social networking service information to track people's motion and response to heat ""in near real-time [and] in high spatial resolution,"" said yang. 
 students used thermal images from a helicopter to find hot zones. gps data showed pedestrian exposure to those hot zones. the combination of heat and pedestrian exposure allowed prediction of risky areas. 
 in collaboration with partners in japan, researchers searched geotagged twitter data for terms related to heat discomfort. they found a high correlation between the predicted risk zones and areas where people complained about heat. 
 both the prediction of heat risk and the use of social media to check the prediction are new methods developed in the studio.

 - atlanta, ga 
 dr. ilya kaminsky , the bourne chair in poetry and director of poetry @ tech, was awarded the prestigious  academy of american poets fellowship . the award places him in the company of such giants of american poetry as 
 robert frost , 
 gwendolyn brooks , and 
 tracy k. smith 
 who are past recipients of the fellowship. 
 established in 1936 and given in memory of 
 james ingram merrill , with generous support from the 
 t. s. eliot foundation , the prize recognizes distinguished poetic achievement and carries with it a stipend of $25,000 and a residency at the eliot summer home in gloucester, massachusetts. fellows are nominated and elected by a majority vote of the 
 academy's board of chancellors . 
 in announcing the award to kaminsky, 
 academy chancellor kwame dawes 
 said, ""ilya kaminsky is among a few poets that one has to admire for his impact on the wider poetry world through the force of his art, despite his relatively modest publishing output as a poet. consequently, he is quite easily and rightfully recognized as a vital voice in global poetry and one of the most brilliant poets working today."" 
 ""his is a poetics for our moment, as much engaged in understanding the world of eastern europe as it is in understanding america today. and yet in his work one suspects a reach that extends beyond our moment-a reach for something urgent and essential-a sense of social justice and a compelling proposition that speaking out against tyranny and abuse perpetuated by governments remains a timeless and necessary imperative of art. the quest for beauty in language is, therefore, an act of resistance and even protest in the face of the ugliness of human oppression. ilya kaminsky remains a tremendous broker for the poetic arts in our world today."" 
 kaminsky is the author of multiple collections of poetry, including 
 deaf republic 
 (graywolf press, 2019). his work has been recognized in the past by a 
 lannan literary fellowship , a 
 whiting award , the 
 ruth lily poetry fellowship , and a 
 2019 creative writing fellowship from the national endowment for the arts (nea) . 
 our heartiest congratulations to dr. kaminsky for this distinction, which also brings credit to the georgia institute of technology ivan allen college of liberal arts and its school of literature, media, and communication which houses the poetry@tech program.

 by michael pearson 
 ilya kaminsky, a professor in the georgia institute of technology's ivan allen college of liberal arts, has been named a finalist for the 2019 national book award in poetry. 
 his book, 
 deaf republic , was one of 245 volumes of poetry nominated for the prestigious award. the 
 national book foundation 
 will announce the winner nov. 20. 
 this is believed to be the first time a non-u.s. born refugee is a finalist for the national book award in poetry, according to the foundation. 
 ""it is a great honor to be named a finalist for the national book award among poets whose work i so admire and have read with much attention for some time now,"" 
 kaminsky 
 said. ""i have worked on this book for more than a decade, and it is gratifying and humbling to see the response."" 
 kaminsky is the margaret t. and henry c. bourne jr. chair in poetry in the 
 school of literature, media and communication 
 and is director of the 
 poetry@tech 
 program, which engages georgia tech students and the public, and presents the south's premier poetry reading series. in addition to his stature as one of his generation's greatest poets, kaminsky also has worked with refugees. kaminsky, who is jewish, was born in odessa, ukraine, in 1977, when the country was still part of the soviet union. his family was granted asylum in the united states in 1993. he joined georgia tech in 2018. 
 deaf republic 
 follows the lives of ordinary citizens living in an occupied country who go deaf the moment a boy with a hearing impairment is shot and killed by soldiers. it was inspired by kaminsky's own experience of navigating his youth in the soviet union as a person living with hearing impairment. 
 john tone, interim dean of the 
 ivan allen college , congratulated kaminsky for being named a finalist, and said his appointment in 2018 highlighted the college's commitment to integrating strong liberal arts perspectives into the curriculum of one of the top technological research universities in the country. 
 ""i am so proud that ilya is a member of the faculty of the ivan allen college of liberal arts, where we work every day to bring innovative human-centered scholarship and creativity to bear on crucial issues here in atlanta and all around the globe,"" 
 tone 
 said. 
 ""through his words, and his work to raise awareness and support for refugees around the world, ilya has shown how an engaged and vital liberal arts can help change the world for the better. through the poetry@tech program, he continues that important mission,"" tone said. ""among other things, he has helped bring poetry to public school classrooms in atlanta, broadened the conversation about poetry to include marginalized communities, and organized a series of upcoming events focused on the work of refugee poets."" 
 richard utz , chair and professor in the school of literature, media, and communication, said it is an ""incredible honor to have ilya kaminsky as a finalist for one of the most coveted and prestigious literary awards in the country."" 
 ""this honor follows his receiving a guggenheim fellowship as well as an american academy of poets fellowship, and all this since he joined us last year,"" utz said. ""this shows how faculty in the humanities confirm georgia tech's status as a top-ranked university, a place at which human-centered creativity is fully integrated with science and technology. 
 kaminsky praised the creative and interdisciplinary community found in the school and college as a combination of ""brilliant students whose excitement about poetry is unmistakable and an amazing community of scholars, many of whom are first-rate writers of poetry."" 
 ""given that my own work has to do with literary arts in several different languages, and my education has to do with law and history and philosophy, in addition to poetry, i find this to be an inspiring place to work, where new ideas are discussed daily and many exciting things occur,"" he said. 
 whether or not 
 deaf republic 
 nets the national book award in november, kaminsky has already cemented his reputation as one of the world's leading poets. but, he adds, he still has much more to say. 
 ""it is a great time in american poetry, and there have been so many powerful and very moving books of poetry published this year,"" kaminsky said. ""so i am tremendously grateful to be a part of this generation, and to have the chance to be alive and writing at this moment in time.""

georgia-tech-procurement-assistance-centers-new-instructional-video-and-template.txt,"georgia tech procurement assistance center's new instructional video and template help defense contractors comply with cybersecurity guidelines 
 changes in u.s. department of defense cybersecurity regulations prompt creation of multimedia training package for nationwide use. 
 to meet the government's cybersecurity standards as cybercrimminals seek ways to hack into critically sensitive systems, contractors must assess their information systems, develop a security plan, and create an action plan. 
 jan 18, 2018 
 - atlanta, ga 
 the georgia tech procurement assistance center (gtpac) has produced and released an 
 instructional video 
 designed to help contractors comply with u.s. department of defense (dod) cybersecurity requirements. 
 gtpac, which works with georgia businesses to help them identify, compete for, and win government contracts, is a program of the enterprise innovation institute (ei 2 ), georgia tech's economic development arm. the video will serve as an instructional tool for procurement technical assistance centers (ptacs) across the country. gtpac is scheduling a series of briefings for its clients statewide and is sharing the complete training package with all ptacs nationwide. 
 accompanying the video is a 127-page template gtpac developed for contractors to use to create a security assessment report, a system security plan, and a plan of action for those cybersecurity requirements. 
 the video and template were funded through a cooperative agreement with the defense logistics agency, and created with the support of the georgia institute of technology. 
 gtpac presented an idea for a multimedia training package to the dod for its defense federal acquisition regulation supplement (dfars) clause 252.204-7012. this clause, revised in 2016 and which the dod is including in many of its contracts, mandates that contractors implement adequate security on all applicable contractor information systems and investigate and report on any compromises to those systems. 
 specifically, the dfars clause requires that contractors: 
 isolate malicious software. 
 preserve and protect all media involved in a cyber incident. 
 provide dod with access to information or equipment for purposes of forensic analysis. 
 assess damage as a result of a cyber incident. 
 ""flow down"" the clause in any subcontracts involving information covered by the requirements. 
 to meet the government's cybersecurity standards, contractors must assess their information systems, develop a security plan, and create an action plan. gtpac's template - available for download as a word document on the same webpage where the video appears (gtpac.org / cybersecurity-training-video) - provides a step-by-step process by which each of these tasks can be completed and documentation can be compiled. 
 ""understanding and incorporating these cybersecurity regulations are critical for dod contractors. that's especially so for small businesses, both primary contractors and subcontractors,"" said joe beaulieu, gtpac's program manager. 
 ""while numerous briefings have been held in recent months about the requirements, there had not been a comprehensive briefing package to help contractors understand the new regulations,"" he noted. ""our multimedia training package for gtpac and procurement assistance center clients across the country comprehensively addresses the requirements and presents a practical, solutions-based approach to the challenge to small businesses that the requirements represent."" 
 georgia contractors seeking assistance in complying with dod's cybersecurity requirements are encouraged to contact a gtpac procurement counselor. a list of counselors, their locations, and contact information can be found at  gtpac.org / team-directory . 
 companies located outside of georgia may contact their nearest procurement technical assistance center for assistance. ptacs are located in all 50 states, washington, d.c., and the u.s. territories of guam and puerto rico. for a directory of ptacs, please visit  aptac-us.org / find-a-ptac .

 when a pandemic spreads, health officials must quickly formulate a strategy to limit infections and deaths. that requires sifting through massive amounts of data in a short amount of time and organizing medical personnel who may have little information on the pandemic. to help coordinate a rapid response to pandemics, a professor at the georgia institute of technology in atlanta has designed software that combines biological data on the pandemic with demographic data of the at-risk population so that health officials can develop a game plan to limit the pandemic's spread. the software also combs social media sites for real-time information on the pandemic and activities of the population. eva lee, director of the center for operations research in medicine and healthcare at the h. milton stewart school of industrial and systems engineering at the georgia institute of technology in atlanta, talked about her emergency response software at the 2014 aaas annual meeting in chicago. 
 ""we have developed a real-time system that will gather the demographics of the region that is being affected, and also pick up on-the-ground-data about who is available and doing what, and about movement of the affected population,"" lee said. ""our work is the first to take demographic information and real-time population behavior and interlace it with the biological information to come up with a decision that health officials can actually use."" lee chaired the panel titled ""emergency response and community resilience via engineering and computational advances.""  lee shared her experience helping federal officials respond to the h1n1 flu in 2009, as well as her experience planning an emergency response to a potential anthrax outbreak. lee was also involved in coordinating a response to the 2010 earthquake in haiti, and the decontamination and health screening effort in japan after the 2011 fukushima radiological disaster. 
 other speakers on the panel include ronald eguchi of imagecat inc. in long beach, calif, who talked about inventory data capture tools to assess risk from natural disasters. yasuaki sakamoto, of stevens institute of technology in hoboken, n.j., spoke about improving social media for disaster response. emergency responders to a pandemic must quickly gather information on the biological agent to assess the characteristics of the pandemic and decide which treatment would be most effective. they also collect data on the risk factors of the individuals in the pandemic, such as the severity of patient's sickness, and if children or pregnant women are infected. 
 ""the big challenge in a pandemic is how do you use all of this information to determine the best strategy that will give you the minimum number of total infections and mortality rate,"" lee said. 
 information from lee's systems approach allows health official to determine where to allocate medical resources and personnel in the best way so that operations will be most successful. through the software developed in her lab at georgia tech, officials can determine, for example, how much vaccine to give at-risk populations and how much to give to the general populations to limit the spread of infection and mortality. officials can also map where to set up medical sites to avoid traffic gridlock and worsening the pandemic as infected patients converge on treatment sites. ""we can do a real-time optimization to tell you exactly what are the sites that you should set up and who should be going where,"" lee said. research news georgia institute of technology 177 north avenue atlanta, georgia 30332-0181 usa @gtresearchnews media relations contacts:

georgia-tech-professor-offers-tips-planning-air-travel-holiday-season.txt,"georgia tech professor offers tips for planning air travel this holiday season 
 travel behavior expert, professor laurie garrow, offers tips on how to plan for this holiday season amid the pandemic and supply chain issues. 
 nov 02, 2021 
 - atlanta, ga 
 the world continues to experience the day-to-day impact of supply chain issues.  laurie garrow , professor and co-director of the center for urban and regional air mobility at georgia tech, offers insight into what consumers can expect this holiday season in terms of air travel demand, airline operations, and tips for consumer travel planning. 
 how will travel plans be affected by supply chain disruptions? 
 supply chain issues affect air travel in many ways. most significantly, airlines are now focused on realigning their workforce. during the pandemic, many airlines laid off flight crews, and ramping back up to meet increasing demand is not a quick or simple process. this process includes meeting regulatory requirements in place to get pilots ready to operate aircraft and get back on flight schedules. garrow urges travelers to plan their trips early, noting that ""airlines are working hard to meet demand."" 
 airlines continue to see the impacts of covid-19. 
 covid-19 has greatly affected the way consumers plan for travel. ""before the pandemic, scheduling was slightly more predictable, with most people booking flights four to six weeks in advance,"" garrow explained. ""travelers are now booking flights much closer to their departure date to account for travel restrictions and monitoring covid-19 trends."" this gives airlines less time to plan and react to unexpected demand patterns. demand uncertainty makes it difficult for carriers to align their supply chain and can lead to an increase in flight cancellations. 
 tips for travelers this season: expect higher fares and plan your flights early. 
 labor shortages and staffing issues can also affect travel this season - particularly the day-of experiences. many airports have closed their long-term parking lots, car rentals are much more limited and expensive, and tsa wait times will likely be longer during this holiday season. it is important that consumers plan ahead and arrive at the airport early. 
 professor laurie garrow is co-director of the center for urban and regional air mobility at georgia tech. she is an expert in aviation, travel behavior, data analytics, and discrete choice modeling. in fall 2020, she was elected to a second term as president of the airline group of the international federation of operational research societies.

georgia-tech-professor-produces-nerdiest-study-2019.txt,"georgia tech professor produces 'the nerdiest study of 2019' 
 prof. joseph h. saleh uses his engineering perspective to decode political history 
 prof. joseph h. saleh 
 jan 08, 2020 
 - atlanta, ga 
 if american politics sometimes 
 seem 
 like a bloodsport, they do not, 
 in fact , risk the lives of our office holders. 
 not so, in ancient rome. 
 this, according to georgia tech professor 
 joseph h. saleh , 
 author of 
 ""statistical reliability analysis for a most dangerous occupation: roman emperor,"" 
 published last month by palgrave communications, a division of the journal 
 nature . 
 ""popular culture associates the lives of roman emperors with luxury, cruelty,and debauchery, sometimes rightfully so,"" writes saleh, a respected risk analysis expert who teaches in the daniel guggenheim school of aerospace engineering. 
 ""one missing attribute in this list is, surprisingly, that this mighty office was most dangerous for its holder. of the 69 rulers of the unified roman empire, from augustus (d. 14 ce) to theodosius (d. 395 ce), 62 percent suffered violent death."" 
 dubbed  ""the nerdiest study of 2019"" by 
 fast company 
 magazine, saleh's piece was reported on by dozens of mainstream publications around the globe. praise from saleh's colleagues in academia was likewise generous. 
 ""this paper has the potential to lead to important interdisciplinary work on a central question in roman history,"" wrote one palgrave communications reviewer. 
 ""[this] has the potential to change how roman historians think about this topic by showing that unique historical cases can be modeled as instances of a stochastic process,"" wrote another reviewer. 
 the fact that so many roman emperors faced violent deaths is a matter of public record, saleh notes. his analysis focuses more on the length of their individual tenures. absent term limits, impeachments, and democratic elections, what factors influenced the length of their reigns? would they be hastened or delayed by their leadership style or by a fault of the particular system of government? 
 saleh dug into those question by borrowing from the parlance of reliability engineering, which would look at a system's ""time-to-failure"" profile. instead, he developed each emperor's ""time-to-violent-death""  profile to gain insight. 
 ""we examined whether there is some structure of underlying randomness in the process [of regicide]."" he notes. 
 among other things, saleh found that two-thirds of all roman emperors died violently in the first year of their rule. of those who survived at least seven years, many were able to hold onto their thrones for another five years. 
 ""a fundamental engine of the spectacle of regicide was not structural in nature, nor within the legions or the flawed system of government of the empire, but intrinsic to the actors themselves,""  he writes. ""the individuals should not be neglected in future work. it was the mutual interactions between the motivations and ambitions of individuals on the one hand, and the social, political, and military factors on the other hand that led to spectacle of regicide of roman emperors. the whole was subject to historical contingencies and some level of randomness in the timing and alignment of factors."" 
 saleh's scientific analysis of the process leaves room for a robust debate involving history, politics, and even human behavior. ever the seeker, saleh welcomes the discussion. 
 ""i undertook this work mostly for the pleasure of writing, and the pleasure of exploring and sharing something on this topic,"" said saleh, who holds a doctorate in aerospace engineering from mit and a master's in history from harvard. ""it was an incredibly enjoyable experience, and i hoped anyone who reads this would get a bit of this pleasure out of it. i did not expect nor considered there would anything utilitarian in this work.""

georgia-tech-professor-uses-virtual-reality-move-major-conference-online.txt,"georgia tech professor uses virtual reality to move major conference online 
 for the first time in its 26-year history, ieee vr will meet in an all-virtual environment. 
 more than 1,800 attendees for an ieee virtual reality conference scheduled for atlanta are holding their conference online. 
 mar 24, 2020 
 - atlanta, ga 
 this week, 1,800 scientists, engineers, designers, and other experts gathered for the 
 ieee conference on virtual reality and 3d user interfaces 
 (ieee vr). the event brings together people from around the world to examine the latest research and advancements in the area of virtual reality (vr). 
 attendees watched presentations and invited talks and participated in poster and demonstration sessions. it's a typical academic conference in every way except for one significant change this year: it will take place entirely online, with social events hosted completely in virtual environments. 
 blair macintyre , a professor in georgia tech's 
 school of interactive computing 
 and ieee vr conference co-chair, proposed transitioning to an all-virtual event to support social distancing recommendations related to the covid-19 pandemic. 
 ""we were planning on a small experiment with online attendees to investigate the use of vr to make conferences more accessible and sustainable. suddenly we needed to ramp up to accommodate everyone across all traditional conference activities,"" macintyre said. 
 the entire five-day event convened in mozilla hubs, an online platform for remote virtual experiences. ieee vr marks the first time that a major academic conference of this scale will move online and depend solely on a virtual environment platform, including the social networking sessions that are an essential part of conferences. 
 the virtual experience merges video conferencing, video streaming, and online chat platforms with a custom version of hubs. the platform operates in most web browsers, and conference attendees can join whether or not they have a vr device. as with an in-person conference, participants will watch and discuss talks, take part in parallel sessions, and network one-on-one while interacting through avatars. 
 the conference is taking place in eastern standard time. while organizers acknowledge that it will be difficult for people in other time zones to attend, they say there are other benefits of a virtual conference such as better work-life balance. 
 ""one of the hardest things for people to do in this sort of format is focus on the content,"" said kyle johnsen, ieee vr co-chair and associate professor of engineering in the college of engineering, university of georgia. ""if you're going to a virtual conference, you need to treat it like you're at an in-person conference, at least during the business day. one of the huge advantages is that you still get to tuck your kids in at night, which is awesome, and we don't want to lose that, but you do need to maintain the same level of time commitment. that's the value of conferences."" 
 social change through technology 
 macintyre began exploring the use of hubs in 2019 to address climate change and the carbon impact of long-haul flights to academic conferences. he points out that the carbon impact of a recent round-trip he took to a conference in berlin, germany, was higher than that of his own four-person household for an entire month. 
 he also views virtual experiences as a way of democratizing academic conferences, which are often limited to attendees from well-funded colleges, universities, and companies, while shutting out those who can't afford to spend thousands of dollars on travel or leave their jobs or families for a week or more. 
 ""if we can take something like ieee vr, which is normally around 1,000 people, and turn it into an event where 10,000 people can attend, we'll have a much more diverse and inclusive event."" 
 now, with recent global challenges of the coronavirus, technology is once again at the forefront of shaping our society - changes that we're seeing, and living, in real-time. whether it's attending a virtual reality conference, working remotely, or taking a class online, ""technology has the opportunity to help people connect,"" macintyre said. 
 one recent example - the city of atlanta has created an emergency fund to assist those impacted by covid-19, $1 million of which will go toward purchasing technology to support the city's telework deployment. 
 while our current crisis has forced an evolution in how we're interacting through technology, he wonders about a permanent change in the future. ""how many companies will shift to online? how many people will demand the opportunity? it will be interesting to see how we all feel after coming out of this forced remote experiment."" 
 any long-term technology transformation would mean an entire cultural shift, he said. ""the technologies are there and can support remote work and education in different ways, but it only works if there's a commitment.""

 the tumor monorail project, a collaboration between the georgia institute of technology, children's healthcare of atlanta and emory university, will receive a $6.5 million grant from the marcus foundation. the project involves the design and testing of a novel device for more efficient treatment of brain tumors. ""support from the marcus foundation will enable us to accelerate the development of a novel tumor monorail device to treat brain tumors in patients,"" said ravi bellamkonda, wallace h. coulter chair in biomedical engineering and lead investigator of this project. ""research labs such as ours are set up to achieve scientific and engineering breakthroughs, but for these breakthroughs to reach patients, we need to follow good manufacturing practices, rigorous safety and quality testing, adhere to fda guidelines for obtaining regulatory approvals, and design appropriate clinical trials. all of these processes are going to be greatly enhanced and accelerated with this critical and visionary marcus foundation support."" funding from the marcus foundation will enable researchers to move this technology into clinical trials and ultimately to people who are facing these medical challenges. the grant will also enable device design and prototyping, development of an fda-compliant manufacturing process and fda approvals for a clinical investigational new drug (ind) study to be conducted in atlanta. 
 critical support for the project was provided by ian's friends foundation, an atlanta-based non-profit that supports pediatric brain tumor research. the monorail project was inspired by a desire to treat pediatric brain tumors. the research may also be applied to adult brain tumors. over the past five years, the research team has demonstrated that the tumor monorail device is capable of significantly reducing tumor load in rodent brains, by guiding tumors to grow into a specially designed ""gel sink."" this study, published in nature materials in 2014, received worldwide media attention and interest. the interdisciplinary research team includes bellamkonda and his laboratory based at georgia tech; dr. barun brahma, children's healthcare of atlanta; and dr. tobey mcdonald, emory pediatrics and aflac cancer center. harold solomon from georgia tech's venturelab is providing product development leadership. the project exemplifies georgia tech and atlanta's unparalleled strength in developing innovative technologies to better child health - a burgeoning area of research known as ""pediatric bioengineering."" ""on behalf of our lab, our collaborators and most importantly all the patients that may benefit from this therapy, i am deeply grateful to the marcus foundation for their vision and commitment to accelerate the development of our breakthrough research so it can reach patients faster than it would have otherwise,"" said bellamkonda.

 - atlanta, ga 
 every four years, the league of american bicyclists announces the bicycle friendly university (bfu) awards, which not only celebrate bike-friendly campuses but also enhance their existing programs. 
 the 2020 awards, 
 announced feb. 18 , highlighted the importance of students' well-being amid the pandemic. bill nesper, executive director of the league of american bicyclists, commended the 38 institutions - including georgia tech - that won a distinction award: ""these colleges and universities are leading by example, building healthy environments where people can safely and easily get around by bike, thereby improving the well-being of their community by enabling access to sustainable transportation options."" 
 tech was awarded a gold level bfu designation, which it also received in 
 2016 . 
 ""the feedback from 2016 encouraged us to continue expanding our bike network and connectivity,"" said lisa safstrom, campus transportation planner at parking and transportation services (pts), ""by offering a diversity of infrastructure, which we have implemented - particularly working with non-campus entities to improve access getting to campus."" 
 the application process is rigorous and seeks to find not only areas of strength but also areas for improvement. on top of that, applicants have the opportunity to recognize different departments and people on campus that contributed to the enhancement of the bike programs. 
 with the help of social media and institute communications, pts' bike programs have garnered more attention over the years, and their partnership with the georgia tech police department and bike gt has added an online option for bicycle and scooter safety classes. starter bikes, a campus group that helps people repair their bikes and sells used ones, also moved its bike sale events to facebook. these implementations have allowed for sustainable transportation options to be more accessible to students and faculty. pts has also collaborated with student groups and non-campus entities to improve accessibility on campus. in response to widespread demand, pts has opened two secure bike rooms within the dalney and tech square hotel parking decks as well. more secure parking is planned for the future. 
 recent changes at the intersection of ferst drive and sixth street improved interactions among bicycles, cars, and pedestrians in a busy area of west campus. exciting upcoming developments near campus  include a spring street cycle track and the fifth street complete streets project. the bike league offers feedback to applicants, offering suggestions for improvement on future projects. 
 in the eight years safstrom has worked with pts, she's seen a change in students' attitudes toward bike riding as a transportation option. 
 ""the number of students biking to campus has increased steadily over the years, but what might be more significant is that the students have gotten more knowledgeable about what makes good infrastructure and have been more communicative about what programs we should be offering on campus,"" she said. 
 with more improvements aiming to make campus as bike friendly as possible, pts hopes to reach platinum level bfu distinction in the next round of applications for 2024.

 may 22, 2015 
 - atlanta, ga 
 the u.s. department of commerce's economic development administration (eda) has awarded the georgia institute of technology a science and research park development grant - one of 12 such awards to universities and government entities the agency announced on may 22. the $460,707 grant will be used to study the feasibility of expanding technology enterprise park (tep) on atlanta's west side into a health and bioscience hub. ""this grant provides us an exceptional opportunity for georgia tech and the city of atlanta to help create high-paying jobs and economic opportunity for the city's west side,"" said chris downing, associate vice president of the enterprise innovation institute, tech's chief statewide economic development arm. downing led the effort in crafting the grant proposal. the university financing foundation, invest atlanta, and the atlanta housing authority also served as partners in the project proposal. the target area encompasses approximately 60 acres and will assess the viability of expanding tep's footprint. georgia tech founded the technology park, which is located at north avenue and northyards boulevard, in 2004. as planned, the vision for the expanded park would be the interconnection of parcels of land owned by the project's collaborators and supporters. those include tech, the atlanta housing authority, and the city of atlanta, among others. the goal is to create a health and bioscience hub in an economically distressed part of the city. as a hub it would be a natural location for startups in the health and bioscience sectors spinning out from area schools, including tech, georgia state university, emory university, morehouse school of medicine, and clark atlanta university. existing health and bioscience companies such as cardiomems, kemira, and cryolife would be able to expand their current operations without leaving the area, and it would be a magnet for leading-edge research and innovation enterprises such as the global center for medical innovation and the georgia tech research institute. the project will study the best practices georgia tech has implemented in the development of the neighboring technology square in midtown, which serves as a model for innovation-led economic development success. this area of the west side could enjoy a similar outcome, downing said. ""it has the potential to create thousands of jobs and deliver hundreds of millions of dollars in economic output."" the science and research park development grants are part of the regional innovation strategies program, which is being run by the eda office of innovation and entrepreneurship. it is a new initiative designed to advance innovation and capacity-building activities in regions across the country through three different types of grants: i6 challenge grants, cluster grants for seed capital funds, and science and research park development grants. in march, commerce secretary penny pritzker announced the recipients of the i6 challenge grants, which included $500,000 to georgia tech to support a sweeping innovation and entrepreneurship initiative in athens, augusta, and downtown atlanta.

georgia-tech-represented-inaugural-white-house-summit-stemm-equity-and-excellence.txt,"georgia tech represented at inaugural white house summit on stemm equity and excellence 
 summit launches national initiative to expand access and opportunities in stem and medicine fields. 
 dec 14, 2022 
 - atlanta, ga 
 the white house office of science and technology hosted a summit on monday to launch a national slate of initiatives to build a more equitable, diversified, and inclusive science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and medicine (stemm) workforce and bolster the nation's global competitiveness in these fields. 
 lizanne destefano, executive director of georgia tech's 
 center for education integrating science, mathematics, and computing , was among the more than 100 invited guests from u.s. government agencies, businesses, education, civic, nonprofit, community-based, and philanthropic organizations to attend the inaugural 
 white house summit on stemm equity and excellence . 
 ""i was most excited to see how so many of the initiatives of georgia tech's strategic plan are aligned with this federal commitment,"" said destefano, also a professor of psychology in the 
 college of sciences . ""our plans to reach out to first-generation college students and their families, support k-12 stemm teachers at all levels, create engaging stemm enrichment activities for all georgia students, and strengthen stemm pathways are key to improving diversity, equity, inclusion, and access in stemm."" 
 destefano, whose research interests include the evaluation and sustainability of innovative stem educational programs and multi-site initiatives, had previously served as co-chair of the 
 national science foundation's stem education advisory committee . the group was charged with providing oversight and input for the national stem education strategic plan, involving 19 federal agencies that support stem education at various levels. 
 ""since a portion of the plan addressed diversity, equity, and inclusion in stem, this summit was especially relevant to our work,"" she said. ""returning to washington, d.c. for this momentous occasion in making stemm education equity and access a national priority was an honor. the state of georgia is well-positioned to make a real change in this arena with its rich ecosystem of universities and colleges, industry, and community organizations."" 
 the one-day event included remarks from various government officials in support of the biden-harris administration's commitment to eliminate systematic barriers to entry in stemm followed by a series of panel discussions with representatives from the public and private sectors who work in this space. 
 the summit concluded with a call to join the 
 stemm opportunity alliance (soa) , a new landmark organization led by the american association for the advancement of science with support from the doris duke charitable foundation. the soa is responsible for coordinating current and future national efforts with over 90 partners from industry, government, education, research, foundations, and organizations already committed to achieving shared goals for equity in stemm by 2050. 
 the five action areas that will be addressed by the soa 
 are:

 the national science foundation (nsf) has recognized baratunde ""bara"" a. cola of the georgia institute of technology and john v. pardon of princeton university with the nation's highest honor for early career scientists and engineers, the alan t. waterman award. this marks only the second time in the award's 42-year history that nsf selected two recipients in the same year. 
 bestowed annually, the waterman award recognizes outstanding researchers age 35 and under in nsf-supported fields of science and engineering. in addition to a medal, awardees each receive a $1 million, five-year grant for research in their chosen field of study. 
 ""we are seeing the significant impact of their research very early in the careers of these awardees,"" said nsf director france córdova. ""that is the most exciting aspect of the waterman award, which recognizes early career achievement. they have creatively tackled longstanding scientific challenges, and we look forward to what they will do next."" 
 cola 
 pioneered new engineering methods and materials to control light and heat in electronics at the nanoscale. he serves as an associate professor at georgia tech's 
 george w. woodruff school of mechanical engineering . 
 in 2015, cola and his team were the first to overcome more than 40 years of research challenges to create a device called an 
 optical rectenna , which turns light into direct current more efficiently than today's technology. the device could lead to highly efficient solar cells with the potential to power new generations of cell phones, laptops, satellites and drones. 
 the technology uses carbon nanotubes that act as tiny antennas to capture light. light is then converted into direct current by miniature, nanotechnology-enabled mechanisms called rectifier diodes. the research has the potential to double solar cell efficiency at one-tenth the cost, according to cola. 
 ""ultimately, we see the waterman as fueling the final leg of our long-term effort to be the first to truly bring transformational applications of carbon nanotubes to the market,"" cola said. ""as of now, we know that there will be a substantial investment in engineering another breakthrough in carbon nanotube optical rectenna science."" 
 cola also works to commercialize other novel nanotechnology-based innovations. in 2015, he participated in the nsf innovation corps (i-corps) at georgia tech, a program that immerses scientists and engineers in entrepreneurial training, teaching them to look beyond the lab and consider the commercial potential or broader impacts of their research. i-corps participants interview prospective customers and identify market needs for federally funded innovations. 
 in addition, cola and colleagues were responsible for engineering breakthroughs, including the first thermally conductive amorphous polymer, the first practical electrochemical cell for generating electricity from waste heat and the first evidence of thermal energy conduction by surface polaritons. 
 cola, 35, is the founder of carbice nanotechnologies, inc., a company that uses a carbon nanotube-material to remove heat from computer chip testing stations, allowing for faster and cheaper testing of chips during production. the technology could eventually result in smaller, faster, more powerful computer chips for use in everything from smartphones to supercomputers. carbice nanotechnologies received support from nsf's small business innovation research program. 
 he also is co-founder of the nsf-funded academic and research leadership network, a group of more than 300 ph.d. engineering researchers from minority groups underrepresented in academia, industry and government laboratories. 
 at princeton university, pardon is a clay research fellow and professor of mathematics. his research focuses on geometry and topology, the study of properties of shapes that are unaffected by deformations, such as stretching or twisting. he is known for solving problems that stumped other mathematicians for decades and generating solutions that provide new tools for geometric analysis. 
 the national science foundation (nsf) is an independent federal agency that supports fundamental research and education across all fields of science and engineering. in fiscal year (fy) 2016, its budget is $7.5 billion. nsf funds reach all 50 states through grants to nearly 2,000 colleges, universities and other institutions. each year, nsf receives more than 48,000 competitive proposals for funding and makes about 12,000 new funding awards. nsf also awards about $626 million in professional and service contracts yearly.

 gary mcmurray testified before a congressional committee thursday, offering expert testimony on the importance of agricultural funding, research and innovation. 
 mcmurray leads the food processing technology division at the georgia tech research institute. he also develops advanced robotic systems for the food, transportation and biomedical industries. 
 he spoke before the senate committee on agricultural, nutrition and forestry during a hearing titled ""agricultural research: perspectives on past and future success for the 2018 farm bill."" 
 mcmurray stressed the critical role agricultural research plays in meeting future food production demands. while great strides have been made, he said more work must be done. 
 ""transformative innovation is needed,"" said mcmurray, who is also associate director of georgia tech's institute for robotics and intelligent machines. ""transformative innovation moves beyond just improving existing methods and processes to totally re-thinking systems development by creating entirely new systems."" 
 he highlighted some of the work georgia tech is doing in conjunction with the university of georgia to monitor crop health using autonomous systems. 
 for example, the institutions are developing ways for unmanned ground vehicles to work in conjunction with unmanned aerial vehicles to enable earlier detection of infected trees and plants and to identify the source of the problem so there can be more targeted intervention to prevent crop losses.

 georgia tech scs researchers are creating a secure stack for the office of naval research. 
 jan 12, 2018 
 - atlanta, ga 
 a team of georgia tech researchers from the school of computer science (scs) has been awarded $7.5 million from the office of naval research to develop a customized attack-resistant software stack. 
 scs assistant professor 
 bill harris 
 is the principal investigator on the project and is collaborating with professors 
 wenke lee 
 and 
 alessandro orso , associate professor 
 santosh pande , and assistant professor 
 taesoo kim . 
 the researchers are working on a technique for reducing what's known as the attack surface, the total number of ways in which a program can be vulnerable to exploit. most general-purpose software includes code that not every user needs, and unused code can create an opportunity for exploit for an attacker. through this research, users will be able to run software in which unneeded code is removed, thus decreasing the vulnerability of the programs they use. 
 lee compares the project to a house. ""when you build a house, you only really need one door, but the house may still have multiple doors. the number of doors increases the opportunity to break in,"" lee said. ""if you only have one door, your house is more secure."" 
 in order to do this, the researchers are looking at the full stack of software systems, including applications, operating systems, and possibly internet of things devices. they are planning to use static and dynamic analysis techniques to determine which pathways through the system different users need. each researcher has a specific area of expertise: 
 pande's focus on compilers will help determine what essential code must be loaded for each user during application execution. 
 harris's expertise with static analysis will provide guarantees that the software maintains its integrity despite removed code. 
 orso will use dynamic analysis and testing techniques to confirm the modified system still functions as expected. 
 kim will use his expertise in systems to determine which modules can be removed from the operating system without compromising its functionality. 
 lee will focus on the aspects related to security and use his expertise to analyze and experiment with malware. 
 overall, the five researchers have the set of complementary skills needed for the project to be successful. over the five-year life of the grant, the researchers expect to develop a series of approaches for reducing attack surface that anyone can use on complex systems, as well on low-level code. 
 ""going back to the house metaphor, the problem is that different people want to use different doors,"" orso says. ""our research will allow users to customize the house for each person so that it contains only the door that person needs.""

georgia-tech-researchers-develop-more-broadly-protective-coronavirus-vaccine.txt,"georgia tech researchers develop more broadly protective coronavirus vaccine 
 researchers at the georgia institute of technology and the university of wisconsin-madison have developed a new vaccine that offers broad protection against not only sars-cov-2 variants, but also other bat sarbecoviruses 
 apr 01, 2024 
 scientists have been searching for the optimal coronavirus vaccine since the covid-19 pandemic started. the mrna vaccines developed through the federal government's ""operation warp speed"" program were a massive innovation; however, annually updating those boosters for specific sars-cov-2 variants is inefficient for scientists and patients. sars-cov-2 is just one member of the sarbecovirus ( sar s 
 be ta co rona virus ) subfamily (others  include sars-cov-1, which caused the 2002 sars outbreak, as well as other viruses circulating in bats that could cause future pandemics). 
 researchers at the georgia institute of technology and the university of wisconsin-madison have developed a new vaccine that offers broad protection against not only sars-cov-2 variants, but also other bat sarbecoviruses. the groundbreaking trivalent vaccine has shown complete protection with no trace of virus in the lungs, marking a significant step toward a universal vaccine for coronaviruses. 
 ""we had been working on strategies to make a broadly protective vaccine for a while,"" said 
 ravi kane , 
 garry betty / v foundation chair and gra eminent scholar in cancer nanotechnology and  professor in the 
 school of chemical and biomolecular engineering . ""this vaccine may protect not just against the current strain circulating that year, but also future variants."" 
 they presented their findings in "" broad protection against clade 1   sarbecoviruses after a single immunization with cocktail spike-protein-nanoparticle   vaccine ,"" published in the february edition of 
 nature communications . 
 kane and his research group have been working on the technologies to develop more widely protective vaccines for viruses since he joined georgia tech in 2015. although the team didn't specifically foresee covid-19 arising when it did, pandemics have regularly occurred throughout human history. while the team pivoted their vaccine research to address coronaviruses, they were surprised by how rapidly each new variant arose, making their broader vaccine even more necessary. 
 once they realized the challenge inherent in how fast sars-cov-2 mutates, they had two options for how to build a vaccine: design one to be widely preventative against the virus, or use the influenza vaccine, which updates annually for the anticipated prevalent variant, as a model. 
 making a broad vaccine is more appealing because it enables patients to get one shot and be protected for years. to create their general vaccine, kane's team capitalized on the key to the original mrna vaccines - the spike protein, which binds the virus to healthy cells. their vaccine uses three prominent spike proteins, or a trivalent vaccine, to elicit a broad enough antibody response to make the vaccine effective against sars-cov-2 variants as well as other sarbecoviruses that have been identified as having pandemic potential. 
 ""if you know which variant is circulating, you can immunize with the spike protein of that variant,"" ph.d. student and co-author kathryn loeffler said. ""but a broad vaccine is more difficult to develop because you're protecting against many different antigens versus just one."" 
 collaborators in the kawaoka group at the university of wisconsin tested their vaccine in hamsters, which they had previously identified as an appropriate animal model to evaluate vaccines and immunotherapies against sars-cov-2. the vaccine was able to neutralize all sars-cov-2 omicron variants tested, as well as non-sars-cov-2 coronaviruses circulating in bats. even better, the vaccine provided complete protection with no detectable virus in the lungs. 
 kane hopes that the vaccine strategy his team identified can be applied to other viruses - other coronavirus subfamilies as well as other viruses such as influenza viruses. they also expect that some of the specific antigens they describe in this paper can be moved toward preclinical trials. someday, a trivalent vaccine could comprise a routine part of people's medical treatment.

 georgia institute of technology researchers have developed a computing system that views gameplay video from streaming services like youtube or twitch, analyzes the footage and then is able to create original new sections of a game. 
 envisioned by a computer: more than 300 new playable game areas were created with the georgia tech automatic-level generator. an artificially intelligent system watched gameplay video of super mario brothers from streaming video (e.g. youtube, twitch) to learn how to design game levels, a first-of-its-kind approach. 
 jun 24, 2015 
 - atlanta, ga 
 georgia institute of technology researchers have developed a computing system that views gameplay video from streaming services like youtube or twitch, analyzes the footage and then is able to create original new sections of a game. the team tested their discovery, the first of its kind, with the original super mario brothers, a well-known two-dimensional platformer game that will allow the new automatic-level designer to replicate results across similar games. the system focuses on the gaming terrain (not the playable character) and the positioning between elements on-screen - be it pipes, blocks, coins or goombas - and it determines the required relationship or level design rule. for example, pipes in the mario games tend to stick out of the ground, so the system learns this and prevents any pipes from being flush with grassy surfaces. it also prevents ""breaks"" by using spatial analysis - e.g. no impossibly long jumps for the hero. ""an initial evaluation of our approach indicates an ability to produce level sections that are both playable and close to the original without hand coding any design criteria,"" says matthew guzdial, lead author and ph.d. student in computer science at georgia tech. key to the process is watching the players in action to see where they actually spend most of their time in the game. after recording on-screen locations of sprites, georgia tech's algorithms determine what are high-interaction areas - those spots where players spend more time to collect bonus items or master a challenge. the automatic-level designer specifically targets these areas to gain design information. the system is then able to build a new level section, element by element. ""our system creates a model or template, and it's able to produce level sections that have never been seen before, do not appear random and can be traversed by the player,"" says mark riedl, the study's primary investigator and associate professor of interactive computing. ""one could say that the system ‘studies' the design of mario levels until it is able to create new playable areas."" the georgia tech system output 151 distinct level sections from 17 samples in the original game, controlling for overall playability and style variables. output increased to 334 level sections as the system lessened the constraints. the new levels can be played easily by porting them into a game engine. riedl says this is the first time he is aware of a gameplay video being used to design levels for a mario game. by applying the technique across a number of different platformer games, a system can theoretically learn genre knowledge, which can be beneficial for procedurally creating games of a given genre. the technique may also extend to other game genres beyond platformers. the researchers next plan to develop full-scale levels and evaluate how gamers interact in those levels compared to the original gameplay videos. the research, ""toward game level generation from gameplay videos,"" is featured june 22-25 at the foundations of digital games conference in pacific grove, calif.

 prox-1 launched into space aboard the spacex falcon heavy 
 prox-1 is seen here installed on the payload stack on the spacex falcon heavy rocket. 
 jun 25, 2019 
 - atlanta, ga 
 years of planning, design, and testing have finally paid off for hundreds of georgia tech students and young alumni who make up the brain trust behind the latest tech-built satellite sent to space. 
 prox-1 is about the size of a suitcase, weighs 154 pounds,  and is extremely delicate. the solar panels that help power the spacecraft cannot be touched by bare human hands. any sensor or microcomputer moved out of its proper positioning can prevent the satellite from operating. 
 tech's prox-1 was part of the payload aboard the third launch of the spacex falcon heavy - the world's most powerful operational rocket. its mission is to deploy lightsail-a solar sailing satellite developed by the planetary society. 
 grayson huggins just completed his bachelor's degree in aerospace engineering at georgia tech. he was part of the student team that built and tested prox-1 ahead of the falcon heavy launch. 
 ""it is really one of my proudest achievements in my life, and it's something nobody can ever take away from me,"" said huggins, who is currently interning at nasa's jet propulsion laboratory. ""something i built will be in space, and that's amazing to be able to say at 22 years old."" 
 prox-1 was scheduled to be deployed approximately 80 minutes after takeoff on the evening of monday, june 24, but was delayed by a few hours. 
 the satellite will now spend its first week circling earth quietly, allowing time for the other spacecraft launched into the same orbit to drift away, so that each can be identified individually. many eyes will be on prox-1 because it is carrying lightsail. 
 once deployed from prox-1, lightsail will unfurl a solar sail about the size of a boxing ring and will attempt to become the first spacecraft to be propelled using only sunlight. 
 lightsail is part of a 10-year project sponsored by the planetary society, the independent space interest group headed up by engineer and television personality bill nye. 
 before the launch, georgia tech aerospace alumna and a former mission manager for prox-1, teresa spinelli, met up with nye at nasa's kennedy space center. 
 ""as a college student, i was so excited to work on something real that would go to space. it felt like everything i had dreamed of was coming true,"" spinelli says. ""while i wish prox-1 would have been able to launch while i was a student, i'm so excited to see it finally get a chance to fly."" 
 georgia tech aerospace engineering professor 
 glenn lightsey 
 and former georgia tech professor dave spencer served as advisors to the more than 200 students who played a role in the prox-1 project, which has been supported by the air force office of scientific research. 
 prox-1 is not the only successful satellite mission that started at georgia tech. two cubesats from the 
 range project, 
 ( r anging and 
 n anosatellite 
 g uidance 
 e xperiment) were successfully launched into orbit in december 2018 on board the spacex falcon-9. many georgia tech aerospace students played critical roles in that mission as well.

 colleges of sciences, engineering continue their collaboration on space science projects, including nasa's return to the moon 
 oct 04, 2021 
 - atlanta, ga 
 georgia tech's  colleges of sciences  and  engineering  have long collaborated to launch successful joint space science research projects with the national aeronautics and space administration (nasa). researchers across both colleges and the  georgia tech research institute  (gtri) are now hard at work on several ambitious projects related to nasa's planned return to earth's moon - and beyond. 
 lunar flashlight to search for ice on the moon 
 thomas orlando  says nasa is always looking for multidisciplinary research programs at the higher education level. he uses a recent win of a key nasa partnership, dubbed the  lunar flashlight mission , as an example of what's been a very successful approach for the institute. 
 orlando is a professor in the  school of chemistry and biochemistry , principal investigator for nasa  reveals  (radiation effects on volatiles and exploration of asteroids and lunar surfaces), and former co-founder and director of georgia tech's  center for space technology and research  (c-star.) 
 reveals is researching ways to prepare nasa for the next generation of its crewed space missions, and is, itself, part of a larger nasa  program,  sservi 
 (solar system exploration research virtual institute). 
 the project includes designing spacesuits with radiation detection materials sewn into the suits - and using the moon's natural resources (buried ice for water, minerals at or near the surface) to support astronaut habitats. that ice could also provide drinking water for astronauts and possibly help fuel engines built on site. 
 ""reveals is focusing on the water on the moon issue. this involves understanding how it is made or delivered, how it is transported, and where it is. the work also involves developing technologies to extract it, a project lead by  peter loutzenhiser  ( george w. woodruff school of mechanical engineering ). we obviously need to know how much is there and whether we can get it and utilize it. this is where lunar flashlight comes in,"" orlando says. 
 the lunar flashlight project also focuses on deep collaboration and coordination across several agencies and teams.  this past summer , the  nasa jet propulsion laboratory  (jpl) in southern california shipped all spacecraft parts to tech's atlanta campus to begin assembly and testing. gtri is now providing the clean room for assembly, and a team of researchers, led by  jud ready , is managing all the integration and testing of lunar flashlight before it is shipped to the marshall space flight center in huntsville, alabama, for fueling, then on to  kennedy space center  in cape canaveral, florida, for launch in 2022. 
 ""our new center for space hardware assembly, fabrication and testing will provide the cleanroom space to assemble lunar flashlight and put it through a rigorous series of tests,"" says ready, who is principal investigator of the lunar flashlight project. ready also serves as deputy director of innovation initiatives for the  georgia tech institute for materials  (imat), is an adjunct professor in the  school of materials science and engineering , and is a principal research engineer at gtri. 
 ""there's no instruction manual right now - it's our role to collaborate with the scientists and engineers at jpl and the other partners to write the test and integration procedures, do them, and at the same time to conclusively verify our work,"" ready says. 
 tiny cubesats take to the sky 
 the lunar flashlight is a  cubesat  - a mini-satellite that's basically what its name implies: a 6u cubesat (30 x 20 x 10cm), about the size of a desktop tower computer. cubesats can weigh anywhere from 3 to 20 pounds, and can be deployed much easier and at a lower cost than traditional satellites. 
 since their introduction in 1999, cubesats have become  popular  for science and commercial satellite deployment, while allowing engineering and sciences students at schools such as georgia tech to design and deploy their own satellites. 
 ""that's great in and of itself, for our students to have an opportunity to build a satellite and send it into space,""  glenn lightsey , david lewis professor of space systems technology in the  daniel guggenheim school of aerospace engineering , and current c-star director, says. ""they can apply to a company with a resume that says, ‘i've already built a satellite and it's in space talking to others.' twenty years ago, that just didn't happen."" 
 lunar flashlight cubesat will have sensitive instrumentation for locating buried ice on the moon, and lightsey's team has already built its propulsion system. after launch from kennedy space center, lunar flashlight will have its mission control operations run out of lightsey's lab. 
 engineering hardware with scientific instrumentation - lightsey says you can't illustrate georgia tech's strengths as a nasa partner any better than with interdisciplinary projects like the lunar flashlight. 
 ""i think georgia tech has a competitive advantage based on how it is really emphasizing interdisciplinary research from the beginning, from idea generation on. there aren't many institutions like it in my opinion. it's in georgia tech's bones."" 
 lunar dust-busting in nasa's big ideas challenge 
 the reveals program is also looking at ways to wipe out the problem of lunar dust, which can have an inherent electrical charge and can be more damaging to equipment than earth dust. it can also be a health hazard if it sneaks into an astronaut's habitat. 
 ""it's an engineering project, but a science problem,"" orlando says. ""here's an example of where engineering and science got together, and something great came out of it."" 
 nasa's  big (breakthrough, innovative, and game-changing) ideas challenge , a competition for undergraduates and graduate students to brainstorm away problems for the space agency, was dedicated to lunar dust mitigation for the 2021 version. that project is led by  julie linsey , a professor in the  george w. woodruff school of mechanical engineering 
 who is mentored by orlando and lightsey, along with reveals research scientists  micah schaible  and  zach seibers , a student team of engineering students -  varun bose, john fitton, zhen liu, dicky silitonga, kristoffer (kris) sjolund,  and  jeffery zhang . the crew came up with a hybrid brush, which uses both an electrodynamic system (eds) and ultraviolet (uv) technology to keep dust from building up on lunar spacesuits. 
 the team, which called itself  shoot for the moon , is among six big ideas challenge finalists. shoot for the moon will give a presentation on the hybrid brush at the big ideas forum in november. 
 two members of the reveals team also recently presented their work on human space exploration.  faris almatouq , a graduate student in the  school of physics  working on novel radiation detectors, and  kris sjolund , a graduate research assistant in mechanical engineering working on the dust brush, both won first prize in the poster contest at the sservi / nasa exploration science forum and european lunar workshop in july. 
 ""these students and co-investigators are all doing great and impactful work,"" orlando says. ""there's an interesting distribution of students working on big ideas projects. they're mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, and aerospace engineering students. and there were chemists and other scientists advising them. it was a multidisciplinary student team - and a multidisciplinary advisory team."" 
 from our state to our solar system 
 orlando and lightsey also note that tech's graduates are already finding jobs with  blue origin  and  spacex , two of the new commercial space businesses with successful crewed maiden flights earlier in the summer. that's in addition to how georgia tech has seeded nasa and jpl, plus lockheed, boeing, and other established aerospace companies, with former students. 
 ""almost half of my students are getting a graduate degree in engineering  and  a graduate degree in science,"" orlando says. ""they typically get a master's in engineering or materials science and a ph.d. in chemistry or physics. it markets them much more for spacex or nasa. it's this hybrid training that people are looking for, and i can't think of a better place for it than georgia tech."" 
 lightsey and orlando hope to one day welcome nearby universities, such as emory university and the university of georgia, as partners in some of these initiatives. the move would combine resources and expertise from all three institutions to create a first-of-its-kind statewide space science initiative or institute in georgia. 
 that kind of collaboration could also help create a new powerhouse for planetary and space science research close to home research institutions - and could help create more job opportunities to retain georgia talent, with young alumni working in a range of aerospace-related industries with freshly minted georgia-grown degrees in hand. 
 ""there's a lot of interest,"" lightsey says. ""who doesn't want to work on space exploration? this is something that resonates with everyone in every discipline. i think all the institutions have different areas of expertise they can contribute. i think collectively we can be much more complete than just one institution by itself."" 
 world space week 2021: georgia tech to host space day atlanta 
 the daniel guggenheim school of aerospace engineering at georgia tech will host 
 space day atlanta 
 on 
 october 9, 2021 as an effort to launch local k-12 students' interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (stem). 
 the day-long event on campus, organized by nasa's 
 georgia space grant consortium 
 (gsgc), will allow local schoolchildren to see demonstrations of current aerospace research at georgia tech, as well as participate in various hands-on activities such as virtual flights to mars and rocket building and launching.

 new space technology research institute brings together multiple universities to tackle the challenges associated with electric propulsion ground testing 
 mitchell walker, professor in the daniel guggenheim school of aerospace engineering, is the principal investigator and will serve as director of janus, leading an interdisciplinary team of researchers from across the country. according to the original proposal, the vision of janus is to enable and proliferate the flight of high-power electric propulsion systems.

 every few years, nasa creates 
 space technology research institutes 
 (stri) in areas it believes are going to be strategic for future technology and space missions. today, that area is electric propulsion - the use of electrical energy to accelerate propellant to create thrust. the technology yields extremely efficient thrusters to power space flight for gateway launches to the moon or even shuttling massive loads of cargo to mars. 
 the georgia institute of technology, along with 11 partner universities and 17 researchers, will receive 
 $15 million over five years to fund the joint advanced propulsion institute (janus) 
 - a new stri to develop strategies and methodologies to surmount limitations in ground testing of high-power  electric propulsion  systems. 
 mitchell walker , professor in the daniel guggenheim school of aerospace engineering, is the principal investigator and will serve as director of janus, leading an interdisciplinary team of researchers from across the country. according to the original proposal, the vision of janus is to enable and proliferate the flight of high-power electric propulsion systems. 
 beginning in october 2021, janus will tackle core challenges to electric propulsion ground testing. other on-the-ground challenges will also be examined, including pressure in the vacuum facility, material erosion and deposits, and electrical circuits that don't exist in space the way they do on earth. walker aims to overcome these infrastructure issues to better understand how researchers can test the engines on the ground and extrapolate that data for use in space. 
 ""the challenge is that in order to get electric propulsion devices big enough to push spacecraft and cargo to their destination fast enough for future nasa missions, the engines will be bigger than what we know how to test on the ground,"" walker said. ""janus will address the infrastructure challenges to ensure accurate ground testing and data translation to create electrical propulsion that powers space travel."" 
 for the last 25 years, electric propulsion researchers have known that ground testing was an issue. until now, however, there has never been a dedicated group of researchers across multiple fields from different universities working together to solve the problem. 
 ""janus is important because we are bringing together the people who are experts in all the pieces of the problem,"" walker said. ""together, we as researchers can work side by side to actually have a complete answer and understanding of what to do next. we can then give our electric propulsion testing answers to the community, not just nasa, but the department of defense and all the industrial players. if we get this right in the u.s., this is going to be an international standard for how to do the testing. and it's going to move everyone forward."" 
 serving alongside walker are four leads who focus specifically on diagnostics and fundamental studies (joshua rovey and john williams), physics-based modeling and integration (richard wirz), and pressure electrical facility effects (benjamin jorns). walker has assembled this team to ensure that all researchers are contributing to specific areas of the research institute, tapping into everyone's areas of expertise. he also believes this management model will keep them engaged as the research pivots. 
 for walker, running janus will be a culminating achievement to his 16-year research career in electric propulsion. before now, he hasn't had the opportunity to work in tandem with some of the most talented researchers in the world on a ubiquitous research challenge. 
 ""janus is a dream come true for me,"" he said. ""you get to work with the very best people in the country on the most relevant problems, and the students who come out of this will set the course for the field for the next 20 to 30 years. it's a great time to make a lasting impact and legacy in the field."" 
 another focus for walker with janus is proactively enhancing diversity, equity, and inclusion across the research enterprise. 
 ""team members from clark atlanta university, city colleges of chicago, and chicago state bring a unique perspective,"" he said. ""we chose those institutions because of their existing strengths in materials characterization, expertise that we needed. and then we incorporated many different pathways for undergraduate students from those institutions to contribute to the science. they were an inherent part of the value of the proposal."" 
 over the next three years, walker's team will use uncertainty quantification and sensitivity analysis of the overall thruster performance and life models to drive and accelerate the modeling and experimental inquiries. 
 ""we are expecting some really phenomenal results after three years, and in our proposal, we identify that they will help us pivot our research direction based on the true problems and unknowns we discover,"" walker said. ""these unknowns could be pressure effects, erosion processes, electrical issues, and instability problems."" 
 for the final two years of the grant, the janus team plans to deliver new tools, strategies, and guidelines for evaluating existing infrastructure and designing new infrastructure for testing high-power electric propulsion. these include validated models for the response of thrusters to the vacuum facility, new physics-based standards for testing and modeling that encapsulate best practices for mitigating or compensating for facility effects, and new standardized diagnostic techniques for characterizing the effects of the facility on thruster operation. 
 janus partner universities include the georgia institute of technology (mitchell walker, maryam saeedifard); university of michigan (john foster, alec gallimore, alex gorodetsky, benjamin jorns); university of california, los angeles (richard wirz, jaime marian); university of illinois (huck beng chew, deborah levin, joshua rovey); colorado state university (john williams, azer yalin); pennsylvania state university (sarah cusson); stanford university (ken hara); university of colorado boulder (iain boyd); western michigan university (kristina lemmer); clark atlanta university (issifu harruna); chicago state university (valerie goss); and city colleges of chicago (phillip vargas). industry partners include the aerospace corporation, aerojet rocketdyne, and busek. 
 the work of many georgia tech staff and faculty members went into the creation of walker's proposal, including ming ""millie"" wang in the george w. woodruff school of mechanical engineering and kristal thompson-black in the guggenheim school of aerospace engineering, who provided significant support in assembling the budget for this proposal. rebecca terns, ph.d., and brian james in the office of research development helped managed the assembly and submission of the institute proposal.

 doctoral student seeking new medicines derived from fijian red algae 
 nov 07, 2013 
 - atlanta, ga 
 funding for research is a highly competitive endeavor under the best of circumstances. for georgia tech doctoral student troy alexander, a new avenue for funding has opened. alexander works as a researcher in 
 school of biology professor julia kubanek's group . his latest project seeks to accelerate the discovery of new medicines for the treatment of cancer and infectious diseases by studying fijian red algae. to help raise funds to support this research, alexander and kubanek posted the project on georgia tech starter, a university-based, peer-reviewed crowdfunding platform for faculty-sponsored scientific research projects. alexander established a fundraising goal of $9,450 to fast-track the discovery of these new medicines through a combination of biomedical screening, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and multivariate statistical analysis of his library of marine chemical compounds from the fijian organisms. by identifying unknown molecules, the research will prioritize exploration of previously unseen structures that can exhibit strong potency toward microbial and human cancer cell lines. ""these molecules previously unknown to science will be carried forward for purification, structure determination, and development as treatments for disease,"" alexander said. georgia tech starter is a perfect venue for making human medicine research advances more accessible to a general audience, he added. according to allison mercer, an applied physicist at georgia tech research institute - and the mastermind behind 
 georgia tech starter 
 - using crowdfunding for science means there is a community of people invested in the research, witnessing its benefits and outcomes. ""there is incredible potential for contributors to engage with scientists in a way that hasn't been done before: a project that is successfully funded converts into a blog through which only project supporters can monitor the progress of the project, ask the scientists questions, and witness world-class research at tech as it unfolds."" but, before taking a step to gain the world's attention through 
 tech starter , researchers need to consider several things, alexander said: one is the amount of funding to request. ""the amount we seek to raise should be large enough to make an impact on our research, but it shouldn't be so large to sound insurmountable to potential donors,"" he said. ""another item to consider is how easily one can make their research appeal to a broader audience,"" he said. ""do you have any tangible goals that can be achieved within the first year as proof of progress to donors? are you willing to commit to engaging with the audience - from making the video to maintaining social media contact? these are huge commitments, and they need to be managed without becoming a drain on research time."" lastly, alexander advises that the goals of the project need to be easy to explain and justify. short-term goals should be clear to give investors something to anticipate. and, he said, researchers should be prepared for the contingency that the funds might not be raised. like other crowdfunding platforms, georgia tech starter operates with an all-or-nothing funding strategy. only if the project goal amount is reached within a 60-day window, are donors' credit cards charged. this helps assure supporters that the researchers will only receive the pledged money if they have enough total funds to achieve the stated project goals. some research efforts are scalable, but many are not. ""if it costs a million dollars to launch a telescope into space, it doesn't do you any good to get halfway there,"" said mercer. students interested in taking advantage of tech's crowdfunding site can visit starter.gatech.edu to submit their contact information. the process for getting a project posted on georgia tech starter includes a comprehensive peer review of the project to ensure that: it is achievable; the requested funding amount is enough to complete the project; and the researchers on the project have the knowledge, skills, and abilities to get the research done right. through the peer review process, researchers will receive feedback on how to better craft the project's message for posting. ""we do everything we can to support the project creators so they can be successful,"" said mercer.

 during the covid-19 pandemic, mirza samnani used parts and pieces to make robotic solutions deployed in hospitals

 mirza samnani estimates that he's built well over 100 robots. 
 ""i built my first robot probably in the eighth grade,"" samnani recalled. 
 as a teen, he started building mars rover prototypes for nasa competitions. he also launched his own robotics startup called ignite labs, which develops affordable robotic equipment for industries and promotes robotics to students of all ages. 
 then, last year, just as samnani was preparing to start a master's degree program at georgia tech in aerospace engineering, the covid-19 pandemic struck. suddenly traveling from mumbai to atlanta was no longer an option. 
 following some advice from his soon-to-be professor and his mother, samnani started working on engineering solutions that might help his community, and he was inspired by the work he had already been doing. 
 ""if we can remotely explore mars and jupiter,"" he observed, ""we should be able to figure out how to make that technology work in a hospital setting."" 
 using parts and pieces he had on hand from his robotic inventions, samnani built a prototype for a medical assistance robot that could deliver food and medicine in the temporary covid-19 hospitals established by the indian government. the big idea: minimize the exposure for frontline workers interacting with infected patients, but also free up their time so they could handle more critical issues. 
 samnani's robot was built to use the same functions he had intended for exploring the red planet, but he retrofitted it for the unique setting of covid-19 hospitals, where patients were isolated and care providers wore full protective equipment to avoid virus transmission. 
 samnani included a tank and nozzle spray apparatus, which could disperse disinfectant throughout the care unit. the arm of the robot has sensors that can determine a patient's temperature, heart rate, and oxygen level. 
 ""as soon as the patient puts their finger in, the doctor is able to remotely see the data from a safe location,"" samnani explained. 
 the robot also has a tablet that can allow doctors and patients to interact with one another from a safe distance. 
 ""the nose or mouth of the robot is actually a camera,"" samnani said. 
 eventually the tablet connectivity allowed patients in isolation to be able to interact with family members, whom they were unable to see in person due to their covid-19 isolation. 
 this roving bot was also used to stack up meal trays and deliver them to patients. in addition to freeing up healthcare workers' time, ""it also just brought a smile to people's faces,"" samnani said. 
 samnani continued to develop robotic solutions to help healthcare workers. when he asked doctors if he could help with any other pressing issues, they let him know that deteriorating covid-19 patients often have to receive up to 20 minutes of cpr if they go into cardiac arrest. 
 ""i thought that process could be automated with a machine,"" samnani said. 
 samnani built what has become india's first automated cpr device after calculating the exact rate and pressure needed to conduct cpr. he deployed the machine for use in a hospital just a day before leaving mumbai for atlanta to start his graduate program. 
 ""i got a call from a doctor who let me know the machine had worked,"" samnani said. 
 the patient, whose heart rate had dropped to gravely low numbers, was revived when doctors positioned the device over the patient's chest and allowed it to start running. samnani says the news brought him tears of joy. 
 ""i want to bring a positive effect to more people's lives,"" he said. ""i think that's what engineers do."" 
 samnani is now completing his master's degree in aerospace engineering at tech and working with assistant professor christopher  carr in tech's space systems design lab. he's helping develop rover robots that could be used to detect signs of life in space, and he hopes to one day manage a space mission, namely to europa - one of jupiter's moons. but along the way he wants to help underprivileged communities gain access to quality healthcare and education. 
 ""improve life on earth, and then head out for space,"" samnani said.

 engineering prowess turned big idea to reality 
 the 4.2-mile course stretched across georgia tech's entire campus and was drawn with some efficient engineering ingenuity. 
 apr 26, 2022 
 - atlanta, ga 
 if you've been around georgia tech's campus, you're likely to run into plenty of people with big ideas. and chances are they're figuring out exactly how to make those big ideas a reality. so what happens when tech students get an idea to break a world record? they get to work. 
 ""it was one of those ideas that comes to you and in hindsight you can't remember how you got it,"" said record organizer and physics major ashleigh henning. 
 henning is a member of see(k) d(iscomfort), or seed, a first-year leadership organization dedicated to helping members develop their leadership and personal potential through unique, once-in-a-lifetime experiences that challenge their perceived limitations. 
 challenges like a record-breaking hopscotch. 
 henning says the group wanted to engage students with campus in a hands-on way, and that's where hopscotch came into play. 
 the student organizers drew up plans for a 4.2-mile course across all corners of georgia tech's campus - and in true tech fashion there was an element of engineering ingenuity that brought this record attempt to fruition. 
 henning helped lead the design and construction of stamps that could be used to mark the course quickly. the stamps were dipped in a cornstarch and water solution that allowed the chalky squares to be applied to sidewalks quickly and efficiently. 
 ""we love solving problems,"" henning explained. she says it was the stamps that really made this attempt possible. 
 organizers had been in contact with officials from guinness world records since october, when the idea came about, and there were some rules they'd need to follow to break the previous record. the course would have to be drawn completely before anyone could begin traversing it. the competitors would have to hop the entire course, and it would need to be filmed. 
 check, check, and check. henning says the students who ended up hopping the course - many of them distance runners or elite athletes - felt like this might be harder than a 10k because of the hopping. she helped optimize hoppers' movement, so they could hit every square while saving their energy to complete the entire course. 
 now the team is waiting for verification from guinness that the world record has been officially broken. that could take a few days or weeks, but all signs are pointing to success. and as henning noted, ""i want to encourage people who might have a big idea - it's very possible at tech.""

 - atlanta, ga 
 when five georgia tech students - brenna fromayan, natalie leonard, wendy ng, anokhi patel, and kaitlin rizk - co-founded stempower in 2014, they wanted to boost the flagging self-confidence of young women in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (stem) fields, despite their natural interest and ability. 
 ""as women pursuing stem degrees from georgia tech, stempower was personally relevant to all of us from the beginning,"" remarked leonard, an undergraduate in the school of psychology. ""the majority of the co-founders had a role model who provided direct encouragement. yet for girls growing up without a role model, where can they turn for support? we knew that we needed stempower to fill this gap."" 
 stempower is a mentoring program offered by georgia tech women students that encourages girls to explore stem and learn key character values. partnering with the girl scouts of greater atlanta, two stempower mentors meet bimonthly with fourth- and fifth-grade girls in a given troop. each meeting is comprised of a different stem activity - building rockets, making circuits, or learning to code - paired with a character lesson like encouraging questions and valuing mistakes. 
 ""research shows that young women start losing interest in math and science during middle school. we created stempower to mentor elementary school girls in stem, thereby increasing their self-confidence and providing relatable role models,"" said rizk, an undergraduate in the h. milton stewart school of industrial & systems engineering. 
 three years later, after initial support from the grand challenges living and learning community, stempower has become one of the outreach initiatives of the center for the study of women, science, and technology (wst), with eight tech mentors and 100 girl scout mentees in the u.s. stempower was also launched at uganda's makerere university after rizk witnessed similar women's empowerment issues during a service project a few years ago. 
 ""after mentoring for years, i still clearly remember my first meeting with a troop,"" leonard reflected. ""the meeting opened with a broad discussion about women scientists and engineers. upon mentioning mae jemison, the first african-american woman astronaut, girls raised their hands and jumped up and down for the opportunity to tell me what they already knew about her. after this first meeting, i walked away impressed by their knowledge and energy and encouraged that supporting these girls through stempower would help each of them thrive."" 
 according to carol colatrella, professor in the school of literature, media, and communication, assistant dean for graduate studies, and co-director of wst, ""we are excited to support stempower as their efforts align with wst's mission and goals to promote the recruitment, retention, and advancement of women students and faculty in stem fields.""

 josh jacob and ashley tofil, students in the sam nunn school of international affairs at georgia tech, were selected by cnn to have their questions asked during a primetime cnn gop debate. 
 dec 16, 2015 
 - atlanta, ga 
 georgia tech students were in the spotlight during last night's gop debate on cnn. earlier this month, cnn traveled the country in a campaign camper to allow people to film questions that might be used in future debates. of the three questions selected for candidates in tuesday night's primetime debate, two of them came from georgia tech students. both of the featured yellow jackets are students in the sam nunn school of international affairs, a division of georgia tech's ivan allen college of liberal arts. the first came from international affairs major josh jacob from johns creek. he first introduced himself as a georgia tech student before launching into his question. ""recently donald trump mentioned that we must kill the families of isis members. however, this violates the principle of distinction between civilians and combatants in international law,"" jacob began. ""so my question is: how would killing innocent civilians set us apart from isis?"" the response on social media after his question was quick and positive. ""can i vote for the georgia tech student for president? most direct statement all night."" said @kenzietheintern on twitter. twitter user @sckozub said, ""guy from georgia tech coming in with the best question of the night."" when asked why he chose the question he did, jacob says the answer is simple. ""i feel many gop candidates tend to ignore international law when they pontificate about war."" jacob says he had no previous knowledge that his question had been selected, and was shocked when his face appeared on national television. he also credits an experience at tech for helping him come up with a question. ""i studied abroad in the europe. we went on a number of site visits to national parliaments and international institutions. i credit that experience with sharpening my ability to ask concise but incisive questions,"" jacob says.  only minutes after jacob's appearance came another georgia tech student's recorded question. ashley tofil, a student in the modern languages program, was also surprised to see herself on television. she directed her question to carly fiorina, who recently made a campaign stop at georgia tech. ""ms. fiorina, in november you said that you would not talk to vladimir putin after you were elected because you would be communicating from a position of weakness,"" she started. ""do you believe it is feasible to not communicate with another world leader and do you think that is also a sign of weakness?"" she asked. fiorina then went on to explain that she would not cut off all communication with putin, but that now was not the time to engage with him. ""it wasn't a bad response,"" says tofil. ""i think that not talking to putin and walking away from the negotiating table when necessary are two different things,"" she says. the social media praise continued after tofil's question. ""shoutout to georgia tech students for being politically aware and asking legit questions. # gopdebate"" sara edwards posted on her twitter account. both jacob and tofil are beaming about their inclusion in the national conversation. ""there were hundreds of provocative and interesting questions asked by students from other colleges, so to have two out of the three questions come specifically from the nunn school is certainly an honor,"" jacob says. ""i'm always proud to represent georgia tech,"" says tofil.

 georgia tech study seeks to bring more diverse voices into computing ethics education 
 jason borenstein of the 
 school of public policy , ellen zegura of the 
 school of computer science , and charles isbell, dean of the 
 college of computing , will lead a three-year, national science foundation-funded study seeking to ""better understand and amplify the diverse range of voices that may have been absent during the development of a traditional computing ethics curriculum."" 
 borenstein is the project's principal investigator. ""the main goal of this grant is to enable groups historically underrepresented in computing to have more of a direct say in what's offered in the computing ethics curriculum,"" said 
 borenstein , who teaches ethics in the 
 ivan allen college of liberal arts 
 and is the director of graduate research ethics programs for georgia tech. 
 black, hispanic, and indigenous individuals represent just over 15% of bachelor's degrees awarded in computer science in the united states and fewer than 4% of doctoral degrees, according to the most recent 
 cra taulbee study . 
 ""as computing expands to touch everyone's lives, it becomes more and more important to have people from a diverse set of backgrounds doing that work,"" said isbell, a co-principal investigator on the study. ""what we do in the classroom and in our careers must be responsible to all of the different groups affected by our work. i am looking forward to this project and eager to see what impact we can make."" 
 by learning more about how changes to the curriculum might change students' perceptions of ethics in computing, the hope is the team will be able to develop recommendations for changes instructors could implement to make the curriculum more diverse, inclusive, and attentive to thorny ethical issues that many students may never personally experience, zegura said. such efforts are foundational to georgia tech's mission to educate leaders who advance technology and improve the human condition. 
 ""we're educating many future software developers. we have a chance through these students to do more to make computing responsible to all parts of society. an important piece is educating future developers to think broadly and carefully about the software they are building,""  said zegura, also co-pi on the study. 
 borenstein, zegura, and isbell hope to survey minority faculty at a number of u.s. universities about what they are teaching and what they think should be taught as part of the computing ethics curriculum. they are working with senior advisors from the faculties of georgia state university, morehouse college, and florida international university and an advisory board. 
 a key step will be to create sample course syllabuses incorporating the views of surveyed faculty and measure to see if the proposed additions would change students' perceptions of the computing fields and the classes they might take. 
 ""our hope is that it might help with retention rates,"" borenstein said. ""if, for instance, you talk about issues more directly related to social justice in your computing courses, is that going to resonate with different student populations and potentially make them more interested in staying in computing?"" 
 the project is funded by a $398,288 
 nsf grant 
 through its ethical and responsible research (er2) program.

 georgia tech researchers worked with arby's to set the guinness world record for the world's smallest advertisment.  using a focused ion beam, they etched the message on a sesame seed. 
 jun 19, 2018 
 - atlanta, ga 
 when arby's announced in world record-breaking fashion that it had completed the nationwide conversion to coca-cola beverages, it turned to georgia tech's institute for electronics and nanotechnology (ien) to help. 
 using a focused ion beam, georgia tech engineers etched ""we have a big announcement. this isn't it."" onto a sesame seed from an arby's bun. the ad measured 38.3 microns by 19.2 microns, or 735.36 square micron in area, and has been officially recognized by the guinness world records as the world's 
 smallest advertisement . 
 the world's smallest ad was displayed inside an arby's in america's largest city, new york. arby's guests at the 32 e. 23rd st. restaurant in manhattan were able to view the world's smallest ad by using a scanning electron microscope (sem) provided by hitachi-hta. 
 ""when arby's ad agency, moxie, approached us about this, i raised an eyebrow,"" said dean sutter, associate director for industry outreach for ien. ""but then i thought it was a great way to highlight our unique capabilities and let industry know we have facilities that can help them with their nanotechnology needs."" 
 arby's used the world's 
 smallest advertisement 
 on june 11 to tease the announcement of switching to coca-cola with a second guiness world records title - the 
 largest advertisement . the 212,000-square-foot advertisement was unveiled june 19 in monowi, nebraska. the town is the only incorporated municipality in the united states with a population of one, making it the smallest city in america. the idea was to have the world's smallest ad in the largest city - new york city - and the largest ad in the smallest city.

 a new partnership with delta air lines and 
 curiosity lab at peachtree corners 
 will give georgia tech researchers access to a real-life environment to test autonomous vehicles and smart city technologies. 
 the collaboration, announced sept. 5, will allow georgia tech's 
 smart cities and inclusive innovation initiative 
 to offer seed funding from delta for projects across campus. researchers will test their ideas and technologies in curiosity lab's living laboratory in peachtree corners. 
 ""this is a wonderful example of industry-university-local government coming together to advance innovative solutions to the built environment and mobility,"" said debra lam, managing director for smart cities and inclusive innovation at georgia tech. ""providing access to such infrastructure will help our researchers test new technologies and further our mission of serving our community through innovation."" 
 the backbone of the partnership is curiosity lab's 1.5-mile autonomous vehicle test track. owned by the city, it has 5g mobile data connectivity, smart infrastructure like connected traffic lights, a dedicated fiber-optic data network, and an operations center where researchers can track data from all the connected devices and sensors on the track. the track is set in a commercial office park in peachtree corners, just northeast of atlanta, and allows interaction with people and vehicles going about their daily lives. 
 ""our 5g-enabled living laboratory will give georgia tech researchers the opportunity to push the frontier of emerging technology in a real-world setting that is almost impossible to replicate in a closed lab,"" said betsy plattenburg, executive director of curiosity lab at peachtree corners. ""curiosity lab also will provide those researchers an opportunity to collaborate with other industry leaders and focus their research on immediate challenges and results."" 
 while it might seem counterintuitive for delta to be interested in cars, especially the driverless variety, the advances that emerge from this partnership could benefit customers and employees, according to delta chief operating officer gil west. 
 ""driving the leading edge of emerging technology means delta can help shape how industry adopts it,"" west said. ""autonomous vehicle technology is one of those innovations we see as having the potential to improve employee safety, the customer experience and operational performance, and this partnership will help us explore all of those possibilities."" 
 as autonomous vehicle research advances across the world, delta sees potential applications for autonomous cars, trucks or buses at airports and beyond. for example, autonomous vehicles could help customers make tight connections across an airport, deliver delayed baggage to customers, or transport aircraft parts to airports. 
 west said this collaboration is an important part of the global airline's strategy to invest in solutions that empower customers and employees, reduce the stresses of travel, and redefine the future of flying. 
 the collaboration builds on georgia tech's autonomous mobility and infrastructure work, which spans the georgia tech research institute, the school of civil and environmental engineering, the institute for robotics and intelligent machines, the office of parking and transportation services, and smart cities and inclusive innovation.

 (wst) at georgia tech hosted its 2021 wst distinguished lecture event featuring dr. ellen ernst kossek, basil s. turner professor of management and research director of the susan bulkeley butler center for leadership at purdue university. kossek, an award-winning social scientist who researches work-family-life policy, and most recently the effects of the covid-19 pandemic on work-life boundaries on women, presented ‘work-life boundaries and women in academic stem: covid-19's wake-up call for career equality.' 
 the virtual event marked the 20 th 
 year of the wst lecture series. kossek's keynote was followed by a panel discussion with institute faculty members drs. terry blum, kim cobb, kaye husbands fealing, and bonnie ferri. 
 dr. mary frank fox, advance professor with ivan allen college's school of public policy and wst co-director said, ""the wst distinguished lecture brings to georgia tech eminent leaders who have supported women, science, and technology through research, policy, and initiatives. dr. kossek exemplifies this tradition."" 
 kossek recently led the writing of a committee report for the national academies of science on the effects of covid-19 for women in academic science. the report, which was issued the same day as the lecture, emphasized covid-19's trends, individual coping styles, organizational practices, and opportunities for policy innovation and research. ""i hope we can think about -- especially now with the pandemic -- how we can make cultures and work-place structures support healthy living on and off the job, and what we can learn from covid,"" she said. 
 the study surveyed over 200 national universities on work-life issues and found that the pandemic did not create inequity, but rather magnified it for women, especially reducing chances for faculty women to attain tenure. some of the issues women faced, the survey reported, were difficulties balancing work and home-life duties -- such as assisting children with virtual learning -- while working from home. 
 ""what we found in the stem women we interviewed and through comments on the survey is that many women felt really challenged in managing not just workload, but professional and personal identity.""

 the university system of georgia (usg) releases its annual economic impact report. 
 jun 28, 2022 
 - atlanta, ga 
 the university system of georgia (usg) released its annual report highlighting the significant economic impact that georgia's higher education institutions had across the state between july 1, 2020, and june 30, 2021. the data calculated by the selig center for economic growth at the university of georgia's terry college of business includes a breakdown of georgia tech's benefit to the state. 
 the study shows that the usg contributed a total of $19.3 billion to georgia's economy during the 2021 fiscal year. georgia tech's economic impact is the highest of any usg institution, with nearly $4.2 billion - a 4.6% increase from fy 2020. 
 the report also found that, collectively, the 26 usg institutions generated a labor income impact on their host communities of $8.9 billion and generated an employment impact of 152,629 jobs in fy 2021. georgia tech alone generated 9,256 on-campus jobs and 18,849 off-campus jobs. 
 this ""output impact"" figure collected in the study was calculated by adding the initial spending to re-spending, or the multiplier effect, for each institution in its community. according to the report, this ""total output impact"" figure is the largest, most inclusive measure of economic impact. 
 included in the initial spending by the institutions are rounds of funding from the higher education emergency relief fund - federal funds allocated by the coronavirus response and relief supplemental appropriations act that provided emergency grants for postsecondary education.

 it was a simple idea - maybe even too simple to work. 
 research scientist james ponder and a team of georgia tech chemists and engineers thought they could design a transparent polymer film that would conduct electricity as effectively as other commonly used materials, while also being flexible and easy to use at an industrial scale. 
 they'd do it by simply removing the nonconductive material from their conductive element. sounds logical, right? 
 the resulting process could yield new kinds of flexible, transparent electronic devices - things like wearable biosensors, organic photovoltaic cells, and virtual or augmented reality displays and glasses. 
 ""we had this initial idea that we have a conductive element that we're covering with a nonconductive material, so what if we just get rid of that,"" said ponder, who earned a ph.d. in chemistry at georgia tech and returned as a research scientist in mechanical engineering. ""it's a simple idea, and there were so many points where it could have failed for different reasons. but it does work, and it works better than we expected.""

good-dog-lassie-spirit-learns-walk-moon.txt,"good dog: lassie spirit learns to walk on the moon 
 researchers at georgia tech have teamed up with nasa and five peer institutions to teach dog-like robots to navigate craters of the moon and other challenging planetary surfaces. 
 apr 03, 2024 
 this story by landon hall was first published in the 
 usc viterbi school of engineering newsroom . 
 georgia tech alumna 
 feifei qian 
 (m.s. phys 2011, ph.d. ece 2015), an assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering at the usc viterbi school of engineering and school of advanced computing, leads the nasa lassie project alongside co-investigator 
 frances rivera-hernández , an assistant professor in the school of earth and atmospheric sciences at georgia tech. 
 sharissa thompson , a graduate student at georgia tech, is a student intern on the nasa curiosity rover project. 
 the palmer glacier on oregon's mount hood isn't the moon, but it's a good place to practice. 
 some 6,000 feet up the snow-capped mountain, located about 70 miles east of portland, a multidisciplinary team from the university of southern california, texas a&m university, georgia institute of technology, oregon state university, temple university, the university of pennsylvania, and nasa gathered to turn loose a four-legged robot named spirit into the wild. 
 the team that included engineers, cognitive scientists, geoscientists, and planetary scientists field-tested spirit as part of the lassie project: legged autonomous surface science in analog environments. spirit covered a variety of challenging terrains, using his spindly metal legs to amble over, across, and over around shifting dirt, slushy snow, and boulders during five days of testing in summer 2023. sometimes he expertly traversed the hillside, while at other moments he teetered and fell over - all part of the process to better understand the substrate properties and learn to better walk on these extreme terrains. the practice time spirit logged produced data that will be used to train future robots for use on intergalactic surfaces, like earth's moon and perhaps planets in our solar system. 
 ""a legged robot needs to be able to detect what is happening when it interacts with the ground underneath, and rapidly adjust its locomotion strategies accordingly,"" says 
 feifei qian , an assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering at the usc viterbi school of engineering and school of advanced computing, which is leading the project funded by nasa. ""when the robot leg slips on ice or sinks into soft snow, it inspires us to look for new principles and strategies that can push the boundary of human knowledge and enable new technology. we learn and improve from the observed failures."" 
 watch this 
 5-minute video 
 produced for the team by documentary filmmaker sean grasso. 
 spirit learns from every step. 
 ""similar to the way that when we walk on uneven surfaces as humans, we can sort of detect how the ground is shifting beneath our feet, a legged robot is capable of the exact same thing,"" says 
 cristina wilson , a cognitive scientist at oregon state university. 
 the more machines the merrier 
 qian's group doesn't intend to stop at just one robot, wandering the wilderness alone. she and her former colleagues at penn, 
 cynthia sung , 
 mark yim , 
 daniel koditschek , and 
 douglas jerolmack , received a two-year, $2 million grant from nasa they're calling the trusses project: temporarily, robots unite to surmount sandy entrapments, then separate. they want to help the space agency put teams of robots on the moon and have them work together on tasks. they would take the knowledge they came in with, and the data they collect on the mission, and communicate those details to each other. 
 ""they would sense how the ground conditions are,"" qian says, ""and then exchange that information with one another, and collectively form a map of locomotion risk estimation. the team of robots can then use this traversal risk map to inform their planetary explorations: ‘there is an extremely soft sand patch that might be high-risk for wheeled rovers. come over here, this might be a safer area.' "" 
 the robots in mind for this kind of work would be more than just spirit: there would be a wheeled rover (great for payload and long distances), a hexapedal robot (intermediate payload but better mobility than the wheeled), and dog-like ones like the rugged version of spirit (highest mobility, shorter distances). and here's the coolest part of that research, the part that sounds like something the transformers would do. or at least a team of castaways on 
 survivor : if one got in a jam, made immovable by loose dirt or a rock or a ravine, his bot-mates would arrive and link together and form a bridge, or a pyramid, to hoist their pal to safety. and then back to work. 
 ""when they plan for the strategy to pull the robot up, they'll decide what force to exert and what position the robot should go to, while also compiling the terrain information,"" qian says. ""that's the key idea of how to use these capabilities: to both prevent and recover from locomotion failures in extreme terrain."" 
 back to mount hood 
 spirit gets around a variety of natural environments, to learn how to better move on challenging terrains. qian has let him off his leash on southern california beaches, and the multi-university team has field-tested him in the soft granules of white sands national park in new mexico. but 
 the video 
 shot at mount hood shows just how otherworldly that landscape can be in these planetary-analog environments. this provides spirit with plenty of opportunities to learn on earth, before potentially exploring other planets. 
 ""you look around us, it would be very hard to drive up this,"" 
 ryan ewing , a geologist from nasa johnson space center, 
 shares . ""but as a legged being, as humans, we can step around it easily. a dog could walk around it easily. so this project is the proving ground that we can enable new science and new mobility on environments that are like other planets."" 
 in fact, a dog is indeed frisking about: howard, wilson's german shepherd, wandered about, with the kind of agility spirit could only dream of. 
 ""we are going to observe how howard moves in different types of snow and ice conditions,"" qian 
 says . ""what exactly, out of those combined motions, allows him to succeed on challenging terrain?"" 
 the lassie project calls for two more trips for spirit: to mount hood this summer, and to white sands next year. the trusses team, from usc and penn, also plans to visit white sands next year with spirit and the other, new, multitasking robots. imagine wall-e with friends.

gravitational-waves-detected-again.txt,"gravitational waves detected again 
 second gravitational wave detected by ligo, which includes georgia tech researchers. 
 this illustration shows the merger of two black holes and the gravitational waves that ripple outward as the black holes spiral toward each other. the black holes-which represent those detected by ligo on dec. 26, 2015-were 14 and 8 times the mass of the sun, until they merged, forming a single black hole 21 times the mass of the sun. in reality, the area near the black holes would appear highly warped, and the gravitational waves would be difficult to see directly. image credit: ligo / t. pyle 
 jun 15, 2016 
 - atlanta, ga 
 the laser interferometer gravitational-wave observatory (ligo) scientific collaboration, which includes georgia tech researchers, and the virgo collaboration have observed a second gravitational wave event. the observation was made in the early morning hours (utc) of december 26, 2015. it is smaller than the initial, historic detection made in september 2015, but was also produced by a pair of colliding black holes. gravitational waves, or ripples in the fabric of spacetime, carry information about their origins and the nature of gravity that cannot otherwise be obtained. physicists say the december waves were produced during the final moments of the merger of two black holes-14 and eight times the mass of the sun-to produce a single, more massive spinning black hole that is 21 times the mass of the sun. ligo estimated the september black holes were 29 and 36 times the mass of the sun. ""it is very significant that these black holes were much less massive than those observed in the first detection,"" said gabriela gonzalez, ligo scientific collaboration spokesperson. ""because of their lighter masses compared to the first detection, they spent more time-about one second-in the sensitive band of the detectors. it is a promising start to mapping the populations of black holes in our universe."" the signal was detected by both of the twin ligo detectors located in louisiana and the state of washington. during the merger, which occurred approximately 1.4 billion years ago, a quantity of energy roughly equivalent to the mass of the sun was converted into gravitational waves. the detected signal comes from the last 27 orbits of the black holes before their merger. ""once again, the collaborative work of hundreds of scientists and engineers has allowed us to pull the curtains and peek into the new window of the universe that was opened last september,"" said laura cadonati, georgia tech professor and chair of ligo's data analysis council. ""we now have two strong signals from merging black holes and we are now excitingly awaiting for more discoveries to come in the next months as the detectors improve and our analysis is robust."" cadonati is one of 12 georgia tech faculty members, postdoctoral researchers and students in the ligo scientific collaboration. the team continues to develop tools and techniques to detect, analyze and characterize sources from the first science run of advanced ligo, including this second event. ""with this second discovery of a binary black hole merger, we begin to unveil a population of black holes in the universe,"" said professor deirdre shoemaker, director of georgia tech's 
 center for relativistic astrophysics 
 and a member of ligo. ""this hints at the excitement to come as we probe deeper into the sky, listening to the story gravity is telling us about the universe."" the first detection of gravitational waves, announced on february 11, 2016, was a milestone in physics and astronomy. it confirmed a major prediction of albert einstein's 1915 general theory of relativity and marked the beginning of the new field of gravitational-wave astronomy. ligo research is carried out by the ligo scientific collaboration, a group of more than 1,000 scientists from universities around the united states and in 14 other countries. more than 90 universities and research institutes in the lsc, including georgia tech, develop detector technology and analyze data. approximately 250 students are strong contributing members of the collaboration. the ligo observatories are funded by the national science foundation (nsf), and were conceived, built and are operated by caltech and mit. the new discovery, accepted for publication in the journal 
 physical review letters , was made by the ligo scientific collaboration (which includes the geo collaboration and the australian consortium for interferometric gravitational astronomy) and the virgo collaboration using data from the two ligo detectors.

 emily grubert , assistant professor in the georgia tech school of civil and environmental engineering, has contributed to a new report from 
 resources for the future 
 (rff) entitled, ""on the path to an equitable energy transition."" rff is an independent, nonprofit, non-partisan research institution in washington, dc. 
 this report, which is newly released today, serves up a ""menu"" of 35 policy options to help workers and communities adapt in the energy transition. in light of the biden administration's recent pledge to cut us emissions by 50-52% of 2005 levels, this report lays out the costs and benefits of policies that can reduce emissions while promoting fairness for communities affected by the transition to clean energy. 
 rff collaborated with a team of 15 scholars from universities across the united states to analyze policy options that touch on several categories: energy infrastructure and resilience, environmental remediation, economic development, workforce, and manufacturing and innovation. each researcher identified specific proposals and drew from available evidence to assess policy design and estimate outcomes, including effects on the environment, economy, and employment. many of the proposals analyzed in this report are currently under consideration in congress, and the report's authors have identified relevant pieces of legislation and sections of the u.s. code.

 team leaders (tls) 
 for the upcoming summer and fall semesters. 
 gt 1000 and gt 2000 introduce new students to campus and support their successful transition to college. the courses meet one hour a week and are taught by faculty and staff volunteers. tech students who are interested in mentoring and working with these newly accepted yellow jackets are encouraged to apply to be a team leader. tls are volunteers, receiving neither pay nor academic credit, but are able to give back to the campus community and have a rewarding experience working with incoming students. 
 team leaders work closely with instructors and serve as an additional contact for first-year and transfer students, offering support to those who may feel overwhelmed by the transition. 
 ""as mentors and leaders on campus, tls have a rewarding impact on incoming students by helping them adjust to life at georgia tech and pursue their path of success here,"" said lacy hodges, assistant director for academic transition programs. ""gt1000 / gt2000 could not exist without team leaders. they are an integral part of the program."" 
 students value what team leaders have to say because the message is peer to peer. 
 ""we can advise students who are struggling to go to tutoring or go to the counseling center. it's easy for them to say that we - as faculty and staff - don't know what it's like to be a student. but the tl can say, ‘yes, i do know,'"" hodges said. 
 all students are eligible to apply, even if they have not taken gt 1000 or gt 2000. to learn more, attend an information sessino on 
 monday, nov. 29, from 7 - 8 p.m. via blue jeans .  rsvp to attend .

 the georgia tech research institute (gtri) celebrated the grand opening of its cobb county research facility (ccrf) on may 8 with a ribbon-cutting ceremony. georgia tech representatives speaking at the event included president g.p. ""bud"" peterson, interim director of gtri lora weiss, and executive director of real estate development tony zivalich. industry partners rod mclean of lockheed martin and cobb county commission chairman mike boyce also addressed the gathering. 
 located on lockheed martin's marietta campus and adjacent to dobbins air reserve base, the south campus, named ccrf-south, now houses four newly renovated buildings - plus 20-acres of undeveloped land - that have been developed into large testing and research spaces as well as renovated offices. 
 the 52-acre acquisition was approved in november 2017, allowing georgia tech to complete a yearlong negotiation process for the property. the estimated $42 million expansion has allowed gtri - the only dedicated applied research division of the institute - to expand to fit its growing portfolio and staffing needs, doubling its original footprint established in 1978. 
 ""when we moved next door to lockheed martin almost 40 years ago, it marked the beginning of a great partnership,"" said peterson. ""this partnership involved researchers, individuals from lockheed martin, and people from georgia tech and gtri who were all interested in developing new technologies, new techniques, and new production and manufacturing processes."" these interests will expand and continue to be fulfilled across laboratories moving into the new gtri cobb county campus. 
 ccrf-south will be home to four of the eight gtri laboratories including the aerospace, transportation, and advanced systems laboratory (atas); the cybersecurity, information protection, and hardware evaluation research laboratory (cipher); the electronic systems laboratory (elsys); and the sensors and electromagnetic applications laboratory (seal). laboratories on the campus will continue to research solutions and engineer technologies that support national security, economic development, health analytics, and food processing. 
 the 350,000-square-foot research facility includes traditional office spaces, open-area collaborative spaces, an auditorium with open breakout space that doubles as a communal lunch area, multiple coffee bars, and extra space for future expansion to address gtri's needs in the years to come. a second building, connected to the first through an indoor walkway to provide easy access between office and lab space, contains a large high-bay space, which will allow tractor trailer trucks to drive directly into the building's lab spaces for assembly. 
 ""gtri is excited to move into this renovated, high-end technical, and modern office space with research labs and high-bay facilities on the cobb county south campus,"" said weiss. ""this expansion will allow gtri to grow its existing work in cobb county as well as move work from the overcrowded main campus in midtown. the new office building can house up to 600 personnel, enough room to grow for at least five years."" 
 for more than 40 years, gtri and lockheed martin have collaborated on several groundbreaking projects. the expansion of gtri's campus facilitates an even closer relationship between the two organizations. gtri, in partnership with lockheed martin, is building a community that will not only change the economic landscape of south cobb county but also continue to strengthen gtri's impact on the nation's technological advances.

 oct 03, 2019 
 - atlanta, ga 
 using a 3d printer and a few simple components that snap together with magnets, a group of georgia tech students has created a small prototype device that can replace multiple biomedical imaging systems. 
 their goal was to create a transformable setup that could be used in remote parts of the world, such as military forward operating bases or developing countries, where resources and infrastructure are scarce. 
 so far, they've made a simple microscope in one configuration and a retinal camera in another. but the idea is to design and print other modular components so the same basic structure could be assembled into a spectrometer, a chemical sensor, or anything else engineers could dream up. 
 ""instead of hauling in a microscope and a camera to see into your eye and a spectrometer to check your blood, maybe we could take the raw materials, which you can pack in a small box, and then build what you need as the need arises,"" said jack wood, who worked with the students and is a senior research scientist at the georgia tech research institute, or gtri. 
 wood said the students ran with a seed of an idea that has been floating around gtri's 
 electro-optical systems laboratory 
 - as he put it: ""can we quickly create biomedical optical systems to accomplish some important goals using limited infrastructure?"" 
 according to chloe collins, a fourth-year biomedical engineering student from bellevue, washington: ""we basically started from scratch. we didn't really have a basis or instructions for what to do like we would have in a class. but our mentor, jack, was very good at giving us some fundamental ideas that we could work off of [and] teaching us about the optics that we needed to know."" 
 collins worked on the project with computer science major farouk marhaba from bridgewater, new jersey; fellow biomedical engineering student aaron metyko from galveston, texas; and chemical and biomolecular engineering student boluwaji omodele from buford, georgia. they were part of a two-year-old internship program at gtri that brings in undergraduates to get a taste of real-world, applied research. 
 other groups in the program worked on projects such as automatically classifying malware using neural networks or using lidar scans of water depths to create visualizations of the seabed. one team worked on a project developing an artificial ""predator"" to help control invasive marine species, like lionfish in parts of the atlantic ocean. 
 ""a big part of the internship program is giving students the opportunity to work on their own and figure things out as they go and also learning how research works,"" said emily farmer, a mechanical engineering student from clarkesville, georgia, who worked on a digital signal processing project. ""it's not so much your typical internship where you go in and sit at a computer all day and do whatever they tell you to do. it's more so learning about how research works and figuring out how you can apply that to your academics."" 
 wood said his team did exactly that - exploring research, probing for answers and driving their ultimate design. 
 ""i found myself having to apologize, because they're used to having a professor know what he's doing, knowing the end result, and then mentoring them through a process,"" he said. ""this was something brand new for us, so in one sense, it was exciting - they got to explore and help define the path. by the same token, that path wandered a little bit."" 
 the team wood mentored ultimately followed the path to a simple microscope and retinal camera because that's where they identified needs they could meet. 
 ""a big issue [for the military] is retinal detachment along with macular degeneration. the best way to find out about retinal detachment is to have a retinal camera, a fundus camera,"" omodele said. ""we also thought about things like malaria in developing countries and how could we pick out the malaria pathogens? the fastest way we can do that is with a microscope. so we thought, why not create a microscope and a fundus camera, because these two things pretty much have the same function."" 
 wood said the goal of the project was to develop a proof of concept that researchers at gtri could further develop and then pursue outside funding. that could expand the potential applications of the device into other kinds of sensors - maybe to measure heart rate or oxygen levels in blood - or for non-medical uses built on the same infrastructure. 
 there also was a team working on complementary software to automate the design process for the imaging device. users without technical backgrounds could enter the kinds of functions they need, and the software would design device components. 
 all of that will take more work, but wood said he's optimistic about the foundation the students have created. 
 for the students, the experience proved eye-opening. 
 ""during this job, i had to become an optical engineer,"" said omodele, the fifth-year chemical engineering student, ""and one thing that georgia tech has taught me is being able to morph myself into whatever kind of engineer i need [to be].""

gtri-works-enhance-ev-battery-reuse-and-recycling-georgia.txt,"gtri works to enhance ev battery reuse and recycling in georgia 
 the georgia tech research institute (gtri) is working to optimize georgia's ev battery supply chain by developing cost-and energy-efficient methods that pose fewer environmental risks. 
 gtri's ev battery recycling efforts are crucial because many of the key minerals found in lithium-ion batteries are sourced from geopolitically sensitive regions across the globe (photo credit: istock).& 
 jun 07, 2023 
 amid the surge in demand for lithium-ion batteries, which power everything from smartphones to electric vehicles (evs), there is a greater need to properly recycle them. the georgia tech research institute (gtri) is working to optimize georgia's ev battery supply chain by developing cost- and energy-efficient methods to recover materials from spent batteries so that more of them can be reused - and pose fewer environmental risks. 
 georgia is quickly emerging as a hub for the electronic transportation industry. according to 
 data 
 from the georgia department of economic development, since 2018, 35 ev-related projects have contributed $23 billion in investments in the state. 
 south korea-based hyundai motor group recently broke ground on its first fully dedicated ev manufacturing facility in savannah's bryan county. the company has also teamed up with lg energy solution to invest $4.3 billion in building an ev battery cell manufacturing plant at the same location. 
 ev manufacturer and automotive technology company rivian, which is based on irvine, calif., has announced a $5 billion investment in its second u.s. plant located east of atlanta in morgan and walton counties. 
 hyundai's new facility is expected to reach full production capacity at the end of 2025, with 30 gigawatt hours (gwh) of energy anticipated to support the production of 300,000 evs. rivian, meanwhile, anticipates its georgia plant will employ over 7,500 workers while producing up to 400,000 vehicles each year. 
 ""this level of industry engagement in georgia is unprecedented,"" said kevin caravati, a gtri principal research scientist, who is supporting this project. ""the hyundai plant, for example, could create tens of thousands of jobs in a very rural part of georgia, which would be a step in the right direction for the entire state."" 
 the lithium-ion batteries that power evs are seen as desirable over other battery technologies because of their high energy density, which allows electric cars to travel longer distances on a single charge. these types of batteries also have a low self-discharge rate, which means that the stored energy remains available for an extended period of time even when the vehicle is not in use. 
 however, these batteries 
 can easily turn into fire hazards - especially at the end of their life cycle. very few batteries ever end up being recycled and those that do get recycled are often mishandled. 
 ""currently, there are no recycling standards in place, which poses challenges for the entire supply chain,"" said milad navaei, a gtri senior research engineer, who is leading this project. "" our goal is to create circular economy for batteries in georgia where we can reduce our dependence on raw materials that often come from overseas and can be very expensive."" 
 lithium-ion batteries use metals including lithium, nickel, manganese, and cobalt that are mined in locations such as africa's democratic republic of the congo, chile and argentina. during the production process, the metals are combined with other materials to form the two key components of a battery cell - the cathode and the anode. inside a battery, the cathode, which has a negative charge, and anode, which has a positive charge, interact to generate electrons that power the electronic device. most lithium-ion batteries are currently made in china. 
 navaei noted that geopolitical sensitivities and lingering supply chain challenges in many of these regions makes gtri's work all the more crucial. 
 gtri's research consists of two parts: one, develop more advanced analytics capabilities for fleet management companies to monitor the health and performance of ev batteries, and two, optimize the recovery of raw materials from batteries at the end of their useful life. 
 ""the battery is the most important part of an ev, and it's critical to know the battery's state of health (soh), which is the ratio of the present capacity to the initial capacity,"" said navaei. ""our goal is to utilize technologies such as the internet of things (iot) to monitor the soh of these batteries and estimate the life cycle, which heavily depends on the usage and the type of battery for its safe and reliable implementation in the next life application."" 
 gtri aims to integrate these technologies into companies' existing inventory management systems to streamline process management and reporting. 
 for the second part of the research, gtri is utilizing a statistical technique known as parametric modeling to aggregate data about known behaviors and characteristics of ev batteries to help companies make more informed decisions about properly depowering them and repurposing their raw materials with minimal environmental impact. 
 ""developing a robust system-modeling approach to support our energy research is a primary focus of ours,"" said gtri principal research scientist ilan stern, who is also supporting the project. ""since our ultimate goal is to utilize domestic sources in our supply chain, really the only way to do that is by building out strong recycling models to account for the fact that these companies are working with finite materials and many of them are coming from conflict zones."" 
 gtri is working with a number of industry partners on this project, including many companies that participated in 
 georgia tech battery day 
 earlier this year. at the event, over 230 energy researchers and industry participants convened to discuss emerging opportunities in energy storage research. some of the companies represented at the event included hyundai kia, delta airlines, cox automotive and panasonic.

 scientists have discovered that phytoplankton are thriving above natural oil seeps in the gulf of mexico. 
 georgia tech professor joe montoya and graduate student sarah weber prepare to recover equipment used to gather water samples in the gulf of mexico. (credit: ryan sibert, university of georgia) 
 jan 25, 2016 
 - atlanta, ga 
 in the water above natural oil seeps in the gulf of mexico, where oil and gas bubbles rise almost a mile to break at the surface, scientists from the georgia institute of technology, columbia university and florida state university have discovered something unusual: phytoplankton, tiny microbes at the base of the marine food chain, are thriving. the oil itself does not appear to help the phytoplankton, but the low concentration of oil found above natural seeps isn't killing them, and turbulence from the rising oil and gas bubbles is bringing up deep-water nutrients that phytoplankton need to grow, according to a study appearing january 25 in the journal 
 nature geoscience . the result is phytoplankton concentrations above oil seeps that are as much as twice the size of populations only a few kilometers away. ""this is the beginning of evidence that some microbes in the gulf may be preconditioned to survive with oil, at least at lower concentrations,"" said ajit subramaniam, an oceanographer at columbia university's lamont-doherty earth observatory and co-author of the study. ""in this case, we clearly see these phytoplankton are not negatively affected at low-concentrations of oil, and there is an accompanying process that helps them thrive. this does not mean that exposure to oil at all concentrations for prolonged lengths of time is good for phytoplankton."" the research shows that the effects of oil and gas at the sea surface can be very different from the impacts of events such as the deepwater horizon spill, said 
 joseph montoya , a professor in 
 georgia tech's school of biology 
 and another of the paper's co-authors. the research could lead to a reconsideration of the response made to spills. ""there may be different responses by different organisms as we look at different regions of the spill itself,"" said montoya.  the study is the first to demonstrate this kind of teleconnection between the sea floor, subsea floor and microbial processes in the upper ocean, said andy juhl, an aquatic ecologist at lamont and co-author. it also provides insight into how microbes and oil interact under water. the researchers, along with colleagues in the ecosystem impacts of oil and gas inputs to the gulf (ecogig) consortium, began studying interactions around oil seeps after the deepwater horizon oil well disaster in 2010 to better understand what happens to the oil during catastrophic gushers and to find ways to better respond to similar disasters in the future. the natural seeps, found in many parts of the gulf of mexico, are tiny compared to an oil well blowout. an oil slick from a natural seep lasts between one and seven days and reaches between 1 and 100 square kilometers. in comparison, the surface oil from the deepwater horizon well covered about 11,200 square kilometers and persisted for months, subramaniam said. but natural seeps still produce enough oil and gas that the scientists can smell it at the surface and see the oil bubbles burst. in the lab, juhl has been conducting experiments to understand how different concentrations of oil affect different types of phytoplankton. he has found no amount of oil on its own that has a positive effect on phytoplankton. ""the direct effect of oil is usually negative, but in some cases small amounts of oil can be outweighed by the positive effect of the nutrients that are tagging along,"" juhl said. nigel d'souza, then a post-doctoral researcher at lamont, discovered the phytoplankton response to oil seeps while on a ship in the gulf of mexico monitoring chlorophyll fluorescence - energy that is emitted as light by compounds inside phytoplankton cells used for photosynthesis. each time the ship crossed over a known oil seep, he noticed a spike in phytoplankton abundance. it was a eureka moment, juhl said. the evidence backed up what susan phan, a co-author and columbia university student working on her senior thesis with subramaniam, had previously noticed in remote sensing data. the scientists were able to compile multiple lines of evidence through chlorophyll fluorescence, water sampling and satellite images that all supported the idea that phytoplankton were benefitting from something connected with the seeps, even though the seeps were thousands of feet below. the biggest impact was seen a few hundred feet deep in the water column, at the point where phytoplankton have enough light from above to still grow, and are receiving the most nutrients rising from below. over oil seeps, d'souza - who is now at georgia tech - found that the population was about double the usual amount. the measurements also showed increases in phytoplankton abundance at the surface. there are still many questions. for example, scientists don't yet know which types of phytoplankton are thriving over the seeps, or if some types of phytoplankton in the community are negatively affected by the rising oil. previous studies have subjected phytoplankton to oil in laboratories to test their sensitivity and found differences in the impact on oceanic versus coastal phytoplankton and differences when phytoplankton were in nutrient-rich or nutrient-poor water, as well as damage to some phytoplankton cells at various concentrations of oil. the study combined sampling from surface vessels with remote sensing from space. ""satellite radar data have given us a detailed picture of where natural seeps are concentrated across deep seafloor of the gulf of mexico,"" said co-author ian macdonald, an oceanographer and professor at florida state university.

hackgt-fast-tracks-student-inventors.txt,"hackgt fast-tracks student inventors 
 more than 1,000 students from 80 different schools came to georgia tech for a weekend of fast-paced ideation and innovation. 
 hackgt, a high-energy weekend of inventing and innovation aims to spread the spirit of application, innovation, and creativity in computer science education. 
 oct 29, 2018 
 - atlanta, ga 
 for the uninitiated, a hackathon is an exercise in collaboration. people get creative through the power and potential of technology ­- and teams consider a problem or an idea and then develop websites, apps, and other high-tech solutions to address it. think of it as a high-tech invention marathon. 
 it is no surprise that for the past five years georgia tech has hosted one of the largest collegiate hackathons in the u.s., or that dozens of companies have lined up to sponsor the event, including facebook, lyft, gm, disney, microsoft, coca-cola, and ncr, among others. 
 this year, more than 1,000 participants from 80 different colleges and institutions gathered on the 
 tech campus for hackgt . 
 from oct. 19 to 21, as student teams worked nonstop on formulating their ideas and developing their projects, hackgt provided workshops and fireside chats with event sponsors, as well as mentors from business and industry to share their guidance and expertise. 
 new to the world of hackathons? no problem. georgia tech's student organizers say they wanted to create an environment in which everyone felt welcome. forty-four percent of the attendees at this year's hackathon were newcomers. 
 winning projects were selected at the end of three days - and they were unfailingly impressive, especially given the time constraints. 
 four students from four different schools developed a tool they call vocapture. it uses computer vision to identify objects to help english learners expand their vocabulary. the technology incorporates a smartphone camera to provide real-time text identifying the objects in view. (in one demonstration, ""chair,"" ""desk,"" ""table,"" and ""door"" appeared when scanning a classroom.) 
 the team noted that 2 billion people will be learning english by 2020, and hoped a tool like this might give them an advantage in honing their language skills. 
 a student from auburn university spent his hackathon weekend developing a bot to write a freestyle rap on any given topic. wikibeat uses natural language processing to scan for information from the internet and matches phrases up into couplets, then lays down a beat to match the generated lyrics.

 with honeybee colony health wavering and researchers trying to find technological ways of pollinating plants in the future, a new georgia tech study has looked at how the insects do their job and manage to stay clean. 
 according to the study, a honeybee can carry up to 30 percent of its body weight in pollen because of the strategic spacing of its nearly three million hairs. the hairs cover the insect's eyes and entire body in various densities that allow efficient cleaning and transport. 
 the research found that the gap between each eye hair is approximately the same size as a grain of dandelion pollen, which is typically collected by bees. this keeps the pollen suspended above the eye and 
 allows the forelegs to comb through and collect the particles . the legs are much hairier and the hair is very densely packed - five times denser than the hair on the eyes. this helps the legs collect as much pollen as possible with each swipe. once the forelegs are sufficiently scrubbed and cleaned by the other legs and the mouth, they return to the eyes and continue the process until the eyes are free of pollen. 
 the georgia tech team tethered bees and used high speed cameras to create the first quantified study of the honeybee cleaning process. they watched as the insects were able to remove up to 15,000 particles from their bodies in three minutes. 
 ""without these hairs and their specialized spacing, it would be almost impossible for a honeybee to stay clean,"" said guillermo amador, who led the study while pursuing his doctoral degree at georgia tech in mechanical engineering. 
 this was evident when amador and the team created a robotic honeybee leg to swipe pollen-covered eyes. when they covered the leg with wax, the smooth, hairless leg gathered four times less pollen. 
 the high-speed videos also revealed something else. 
 ""bees have a preprogrammed cleaning routine that doesn't vary,"" said marguerite matherne, a ph.d. student in the george w. woodruff school of mechanical engineering.  ""even if they're not very dirty in the first place, bees always swipe their eyes a dozen times, six times per leg. the first swipe is the most efficient, and they never have to brush the same area of the eye twice."" 
 the research also found that pollenkitt, the sticky, viscous fluid found on the surface of pollen grains, is essential. when the fluid was removed from pollen during experiments, bees accumulated half as much. 
 ""if we can start learning from natural pollinators, maybe we can create artificial pollinators to take stress off of bees,"" said david hu, a professor in the woodruff school of mechanical engineering and 
 school of biological sciences . ""our findings may also be used to create mechanical designs that help keep micro and nanostructured surfaces clean."" 
 the study, "" honeybee hairs and pollenkitt are essential for pollen capture and removal ,"" is published in the journal 
 bioinspiration and biomimetics . 
 the study is partially supported by the national science foundation (phy-1255127). any opinions, findings and conclusions or recommendations expressed in this material are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of the sponsor.

 georgia institute of technology researchers combed through more than two dozen studies and did surface measurements for 27 mammals and insects to better understand 
 how animals are able to clean themselves . the findings could have implications for keeping manmade structures - such as sensors, robots and unmanned aerial vehicles - free from pollutants, pollen and dirt. the review study is 
 published in the journal of experimental biology .   the research team focused on the many ways hair allows animals to both get dirty and remain dirt-free. the researchers found that a honeybee has the same amount of hairs as a squirrel: 3 million. that's nothing compared to butterflies and moths - each have nearly 10 billion hairs. the human head, as a comparison, has just 100,000. ""animals likely evolved with hair in order to stay warm. but it also brings a burden,"" said david hu, a georgia tech associate professor who co-led the study. ""more hair means more surface area that can trap dirt, dust and pollen."" hu and his mechanical engineering ph.d. student, guillermo amador, ran calculations to find the true surface area of animals, or the surface area that includes every location where dirt can be collected. the hairier it is, the larger the creature's true surface area. in fact, the team says it's 100 times greater than its skin surface area. ""a honeybee's true surface area is the size of a piece of toast,"" said hu. ""a cat's is the size of a ping pong table. a sea otter has as much area as a professional hockey rink.""   and with all that surface area comes the challenge of keeping away all the dirt. it turns out that animals use a variety of ways to stay clean. some depend on non-renewable strategies and use their own energy. ""dogs shake water off their backs, just like a washing machine,"" said amador, who recently graduated. ""bees use bristled appendages to brush pollen off their eyes and bodies. fruit flies use hairs on their head and thorax to catapult dust off of them at accelerations of up to 500 times earth's gravity."" other animals and insects use more efficient, renewable cleaning tactics. ""they don't do anything extra to stay clean. it just happens,"" said amador. eyelashes, for example, protect mammals by minimizing airflow and funneling particles away from eyes. cicadas have sharp points on their wings that act as pincushions, essentially popping airborne bacteria like water balloons. it's these renewable cleaning tactics that have the georgia tech team thinking about applications for technology. 
 ""understanding how biological systems, like eyelashes, prevent soiling by interacting with the environment can help inspire low-energy solutions for keeping sensitive equipment free from dust and dirt,"" said hu. ""drones and other autonomous rovers, including our machines on mars, are susceptible to failure because of the accumulation of airborne particles.""  the study, "" cleanliness is next to godliness: mechanisms for staying clean ,"" appears in the current issue (vol. 218 / issue 20) of journal of experimental biology. this work is partially funded by the national science foundation (phy-1255127). any conclusions expressed are those of the principal investigator and may not necessarily represent the official views of the funding organizations.

 international experts are far from convinced that north korea actually conducted its first h-bomb test, which was reported by the country this week. in the meantime, south korea is blasting pop music, weather and news broadcasts and recorded criticisms of north korea with loudspeakers on the border. speaking of loudspeakers, turn up the volume on your computer because associate professor zhigang peng is allowing people to hear what the explosion (and its predecessors) sounded like when their signals rumbled through the ground. he explains how it works: ""signals from the north korean explosion were detected about 100 miles from the border at a seismological station in mudanjiang, china. so we sped up the frequency 100 times faster than normal,"" peng said. ""that way the frequency is within the range that humans can hear. this is similar to how we fast-forwarded cassette players to hear higher pitch in the old days. then we did the same for four other recent explosions from north korea. ""seismology alone cannot tell whether it was a hydrogen bomb or not. however, what we can tell from the existing data (either by visual display or the sounds) is that this week's seismic events are actually slightly smaller than the 2013 event. the new event also appeared to be very similar to the previous events, suggesting that they occurred at nearby locations and were similar types of explosions."" peng used the same process several years ago to 
 listen to the 2011 japan earthquake.

 new acoustic device research reveals even a healthy knee makes cringeworthy sounds. but the audio can be turned into graphs, and researchers hope they will some day become medically useful. 
 mems microphones and piezoelectric strips pick up sounds of a bending and extending knee. prof. omer inan is engineering a device to convert knee joint sounds into a signal he hopes medical researchers will be able to use. 
 may 23, 2016 
 - atlanta, ga 
 you've injured your knee. a doctor straps a listening device to it, and the noises you hear coming out of it are cringe-worthy. ""crackle! krglkrglkrgl! snap!"" your knee isn't breaking; it's only bending, and in the future, those sounds could help doctors determine whether the convalescing joint is healthy yet, or if it needs more therapy. research engineers at the georgia institute of technology are developing a knee band with microphones and vibration sensors to listen to and measure the sounds inside the joint. it could lead to a future device to help orthopedic specialists assess damage after an injury and track the progress of recovery. former ncaa athlete omer inan has suffered knee pain himself and had been thinking about developing such a device for some time. the assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering is a former discus thrower who was a three-time ncaa all-american at stanford university and the school record holder. he spent years whirling around like a tornado, which knees aren't built for. add to that the stress and strain of weight training that included squats with 500-pound loads. ""i would always feel like my knee was creaking or popping more if i was putting more stress on it,"" inan said. then the defense advanced research projects agency (darpa) issued a call for research proposals on wearable technologies for assisting rehabilitation, and the researcher at the school of electrical and computer engineering pitched his idea. inan's group has published a paper on the latest state of development in the journal 
 ieee transactions in biomedical engineering online , official print publication is pending. the research is being sponsored by the darpa biological technologies office. inan leads a team of 17 researchers, including georgia tech faculty in ece and applied physiology and graduate students. delightfully gross when he heard the first recordings of crackly grinding in early experiments, inan was delighted. ""it was a lot louder than expected and a lot clearer,"" he said. that meant instant progress. to others, it just sounds gross. ""it's a little bit like some kind of halloween stuff happening. you're listening to your bones rubbing on each other, or maybe cartilage,"" inan said. doctors call the joint cracking ""crepitus,"" which rings oddly of ""decrepit."" some 100 years ago, physicians thought that racket might contain a message and listened to it with large stethoscopes. now, inan hopes that in the future, medical research will build on the acoustical sensing technology his group is designing, and eventually decode the sound into useful patterns. currently, the researchers are graphing out the recorded audio and matching it to the joint's range of motion to see where exactly in the leg's extending and bending the knee creates creaks and pops. the result has peaks and squiggles that resemble an electrocardiogram or other physiological signal. the acoustic pattern an injured knee produces is markedly different from that of an intact knee. ""it's more erratic,"" inan said. ""a healthy knee produces a more consistent pattern of noises."" battlefield knee injuries if paired with medical research, inan's acoustic device could lead to inexpensive, wearable monitors, which could benefit athletes who have overburdened their knees, and elderly patients who have slipped and fallen, but darpa's interest is to cut down on repeat battlefield knee injuries and help get soldiers back to duty safely. ""what most people don't know is that musculoskeletal injuries of the knees and ankles are among the top reasons for discharge for active duty service members,"" inan said. backpacks weighing up to 100 pounds press down on soldiers, as they march for dozens of miles over tricky terrain, climb over obstacles on battlefields, and crouch in cramped spots for hours. even without a fall or contortion, a soldier can land in surgery then in rehab. the problem may seem fixed months later, but too often it's not, and too often that's because of re-injury. like professional athletes, soldiers can be overly eager to leap back into the fray. ""they were there in the first place because they wanted to help our country, so they want to get back to it,"" inan said. overcoming challenges after surgery and therapy, that knee may feel like new, but when a fervent soldier jumps back onto it, weaknesses from the injury kick in. as a result, re-injuries are 10 times more frequent than initial ones. an inexpensive wearable device could give soldiers and clinicians in the future feedback on convalescing knees to help them avoid major re-injury by refraining from heavy workloads when needed. that could benefit service members in the long run, too. joint injuries compound over time, setting retired service members up for pain and loss of mobility long into civilian life. ""you can have cases of early osteoarthritis,"" inan said. but at this point, inan's mission is to record the sounds in potentially useful quality. that has posed some challenges. the knee joint is surrounded by fluid, which blunts sound waves that are exiting the joint for the skin. also, when a patient moves around, that causes extraneous noises that can drown out useful sounds. ""the fact that the measurement has to occur by definition during movement is a challenge, because you can't just tell the person to be still and avoid motion artifacts,"" he said. smart phone-like mics the researchers combined microphones with piezoelectric film. the film is a hypersensitive vibration sensor and collects the best sound, but it is very sensitive to interference. the microphones placed against the skin make for an ample backup and for a more practical device. the knee monitor also takes advantage of a technical advancement you will find in your smart phone. micro-electromechanical systems microphones, or mems, integrate better with current technology than microphones based on previous technologies, and that also makes the microphones downright cheap - 50 cents to a dollar - for a very affordable device. the paper's authors also included caitlin n. teague, sinan hersek, hakan töreyin, mindy l. millard-stafford, michael l. jones, geza f. kogler and michael n. sawka, all from georgia tech. it was funded under contract number w911nf-14-c-0058 by the defense advanced research projects agency.

 when the u.s. army updates the defensive and offensive software on its uh60m black hawk and ah64d apache helicopters, the improved systems must be fully tested to make sure they're working properly. that includes evaluating how information is represented on the multi-function display (mfd) and multi-purpose display (mpd), which use symbology to display threats to aviation platforms. until recently, that testing required the use of a real helicopter or costly display components that must be configured to operate in a laboratory environment. thanks to an mfd / mpd emulator developed by the georgia tech research institute (gtri) in collaboration with the army reprogramming analysis team (arat), the testing can now be done on ordinary laboratory computers anytime it is needed. the new emulator saves a significant amount of money and can help get software updates to deployed army aviation forces faster. ""this is an exact replica of what's on the helicopter, so when they're testing the software upgrades in the laboratory, they see exactly what the pilot is going to see in the helicopter cockpit,"" said william miller, a gtri principal research scientists who helped lead the project. ""when the final software for the electronic warfare system is deployed to the field, it is already tested with the display. that saves money and time."" the project began with two days of observation into the operation of a multi-function display in operational helicopters at dobbins air reserve base north of atlanta and redstone arsenal in alabama. gtri engineers watched as the pilots put the aviation survivability equipment (ase) through all its operations and recorded what happened on video. next, a development team led by gtri research scientist heyward adams began developing the emulator in a standard military windows-based computer, using cards to simulate the sensors that would normally be providing data to the mfd. the emulator plugs into the aircraft's 1553 bus, and can simulate inputs from two radar warning receivers: the an / apr 39a(v)1 / 4 and an / apr 48a . though the lab-based computer isn't flight-worthy, it provides the exact look-and-feel of the apache and black hawk ew systems so army mission software developers can make sure the graphical elements are clear and correct. ""we ingest the data that's coming out of the cards just like the real hardware would in the helicopter and represent it accurately,"" adams said. ""the graphics we generate provide the exact look and feel, which we showed to pilots of the helicopter to make sure we were accurate."" the emulator is already in use by army mission software developers in the arat laboratories in aberdeen proving ground, md. the gtri researchers say the system could be easily adapted to other aircraft. ""the framework we used to develop the emulator is scalable, so it's not tied to just one specific multi-function display,"" adams said. ""our system is set up in such a way that we could quickly and cost-effectively emulate other systems, or even an entire cockpit."" the ase tracks threats such as surface-to-air missiles. because the helicopters fly at low altitudes, there's little time to react, and no time for errors. most threats are handled automatically, but the crew needs to know what is happening at all times. ""for pilots flying these helicopters, this is a primary display for all the threat information they are encountering,"" said miller.

 an evolutionary enigma may have just been cracked: explaining how the helix of rna and dna evolved.

 - atlanta, ga 
 trying to explain how dna and rna evolved to form such neat spirals has been a notorious enigma in science. but  a 
 new study 
 suggests  the rotation may have occurred with ease billions of years ago when rna's chemical ancestors casually spun into spiraled strands. 
 in the lab, researchers at the georgia institute of technology were surprised to see them do it under conditions thought to be common on earth just before first life evolved: in plain water, with no catalysts, and at room temperature. 
 the neat spiraling also elegantly integrated another compound which today forms the backbone of rna and dna. the resulting structure had features that strongly resembled rna. 
 pivotal twists 
 the study has come a step closer to answering a 
 chicken-egg 
 question about the evolutionary path that led to rna (from which dna later evolved): did the spiral come first, and did this structure influence which molecular components made it later into rna because they fit well into the spiral? 
 ""the spiraling could have had a reinforcing effect. it could have facilitated the molecules getting connected together that have the same 
 chirality 
 (curve) to connect into a common backbone that is compatible with the helical twist,"" said the study's principal investigator nicholas hud,  a regents professor in georgia tech's school of chemistry and biochemistry . 
 the researchers published the new study  in the journal  angewandte chemie  in december 2018 . the research was funded by the national science foundation and the nasa astrobiology program under the  center for chemical evolution . the center is headquartered at georgia tech, and hud is its principal investigator. 
 the study's resulting polymers were not rna but could be have been an important intermediate step in the early evolution of rna. for building blocks, the researchers used base molecules referred to as ""proto-nucleobases,"" highly suspected to be precursors of  nucleobases , main components that transport genetic code in today's rna. 
 [thinking about grad school?  here's how to apply to georgia tech. ] 
 nucleobase paradox 
 the study had to work around a paradox in chemical evolution: 
 making rna or dna using their actual nucleobases in the lab without the aid of the enzymes of living cells that usually do this job is more than a herculean task. thus, although rna and dna are ubiquitous on earth now, their evolution on pre-life earth would appear to have been an anomaly requiring erratic convergences of extreme conditions. 
 by contrast, the georgia tech researchers' model of chemical evolution holds that precursor nucleobases self-assembled easily to into ancestral prototypes -- that were polymer-like and referred to as assemblies -- which later evolved into rna. 
 ""we would call these ‘proto-nucleobases' or ‘ancestral nucleobases,'"" hud said. ""for our overall model of chemical evolution, we're saying that these proto-nucleobases, which self-assemble into these long strands, could have been part of a very early stage before modern nucleobases were incorporated."" 
 one main suspected proto-nucleobase in this experiment -- and in previous experiments on the possible the evolution of rna -- was  triaminopyrimidine (tap) .  cyanuric acid (ca)  was another. the researchers highly suspect tap and ca were parts of a proto-rna. 
 the chemical bonds that hold together assemblies of the two suspected proto-nucleobases were surprisingly strong but  non-covalent , which is akin to connecting two magnets. in rna the main bonds holding together modern nucleobases are  covalent bonds , akin to welding, and enzymes make those bonds in cells today. 
 helical biases 
 a helix can spiral two ways, left-handed or right-handed. in chemistry, a molecule can also be handed, or  chiral , making for ""l"" or ""d"" forms of the molecule. 
 incidentally, the building blocks of today's rna and dna are all the d form, which make a right-handed helix. why they evolved like this is still a mystery. 
 batches of tap and ca the researchers started out with produced roughly equal amounts of right and left-handed helices, but something stood out: whole regions of a batch were biased in one direction and were separate from other regions that spiraled mostly the other way. 
 ""the propensity for the molecules to choose one helical direction was so strong that large regions of the batches were made up predominantly of assemblies that were unidirectionally twisted,"" hud said. 
 this was surprising because the individual molecules of tap and ca had no chirality of their own, neither l nor d. still, the twists had a preferred direction. 
 ‘world record' 
 the researchers added two more experiments to test how strongly their rna-like assemblies preferred making one-handed helices. 
 first, they introduced a smidgeon of compounds similar to tap and ca, but which had l or d chirality, to nudge the spiraling direction. the whole batch conformed to the chirality of the respective additive, resulting in assemblies twisting in a unified direction as helices do in rna and dna today. 
 ""it was the new world record for the smallest amount of a chiral dopant (additive) that would flip a whole solution,"" said  suneesh karunakaran , the study's first author and a graduate researcher in hud's lab. ""this demonstrated how easy it would be in nature to get abundant amounts of unified helices."" 
 second, they put the sugar compound  ribose-5-phosphate  together with tap to more closely emulate the current building blocks of rna. the ribose fell into place, and the resulting assembly spiraled in a direction dictated by the ribose chirality. 
 ""this molecule easily formed an rna-like assembly that was surprisingly stable, even though the pieces were only held together by non-covalent bonds,"" karunakaran said. 
 evolution revolution 
 the study's results under such simple conditions represent a leap forward in experimental evidence for how the helical twist of biomolecules could have already been in place long before life emerged. 
 the research also expands a growing body of evidence supporting an unconventional hypothesis by the center for chemical evolution, which dispenses with the need for a narrative that rare cataclysms and unlikely ingredients were necessary to produce life's early building blocks. 
 instead, most biomolecules likely arose in several gradual steps, on quiet, rain-swept dirt flats or lakeshore rocks lapped by waves. precursor molecules with the right reactivity enabled those steps readily and produced abundant materials for further evolutionary steps. 
 basement engineer 
 in the lab, helix self-assemblage was so productive that it outstripped a detection device's capacity to examine the output. regions a square millimeter or more in size were packed with unidirectionally spiraled polymer-like assemblies. 
 ""to look at them i had to make adjustments to the equipment,"" said karunakaran. ""i punched holes in a foil and put it in front of the beam of our spectropolarimeter."" 
 that worked but needed improvement, so hud took to his basement at home to build an automated scanner that could handle the experiment's bountiful results. it revealed large regions of helices with the same handedness.

heme-poisonous-nutrient-tracked-green-lantern-sensor.txt,"heme, a poisonous nutrient, tracked by ‘green lantern' sensor 
 tracking heme has dispelled a widely held assumption that it does not float freely in cellular pools. 
 a tailor-made ratiometric sensor makes a baker's yeast cell light up green, as georgia tech scientists use it to track the movements of the essential toxin heme. 
 may 30, 2016 
 - atlanta, ga 
 a pinch of poison can be good for a body, at least if it's heme. in minuscule amounts, it works in cells as an essential catalyst called a cofactor and as a signaling molecule to trigger other processes. now, for the first known time, researchers have tracked those activities inside of cells. but too high of a concentration is toxic. ""poor heme management can cause things like alzheimer's, heart disease, and some types of cancers, so cells have to do a good job of managing how much heme is available,"" said amit reddi, a biochemist and assistant professor at the georgia institute of technology. ""by having biosensors that can monitor heme in cells, we have this new window into how cells make this essential toxin available in carefully sparse concentrations,"" he said. ‘heme' as in ‘hemoglobin' people may recognize heme from its role at the core of hemoglobin, the component of red blood cells responsible for transporting oxygen. the ionic iron in the heme molecule is what attracts the oxygen molecule. in hemoglobin, the heme is embedded tightly in protein, rendering it non-toxic. many scientists have long assumed that heme, even in other cells, is basically always static, held tight by the proteins it works with. but the researchers' results shatter that assumption. they published their findings in the journal  proceedings of the national academy of sciences, on may, 30, 2016 .  their research is funded by the national science foundation and the national institutes of health. misconception dispelled? working with baker's yeast cells, which, like human cells, are eukaryotes, the researchers observed heme being freed up to float around and participate in life processes. ""i think that we have possibly put a misconception to rest,"" said lead researcher david hanna, a graduate student at at the school of chemistry and biochemistry and parker petit institute for bioengineering and biosciences, where reddi also researches. he was expecting to observe a pool of free, or ""labile,"" heme in the cells, and he did. ""a lot of scientists believe in these fixed bonds, that all heme is tied up and buried inside proteins, but there are processes going on that defy that notion that they haven't been able to explain."" now the research team lead by hanna and reddi can explain some of them via the labile heme pool. ""no one's shown this before. we have demonstrated that there is a pool of heme that increases and decreases. we've shown that there is an exchangeable pool of heme."" potentially hazardous nutrient 
 the labile heme serves as a nutrient instead of a poison. but to make sure things stay that way, heme needs to be carefully trafficked through the cell, reddi said. the research team designed a fluorescent sensor molecule to keep tabs on that. with heme at very low baseline levels, the sensor lit up bright green, then as heme concentration increased, it caused the light to fade out. using the heme sensors, georgia tech graduate student osiris martinez-guzman found an enzyme, gapdh, known for its involvement in breaking down sugar, that the team observed helping buffer cellular labile heme (iron protoporphyrin ix), which got tied up in proteins, leaving only a limited amount free for biochemical reactions. when more labile heme is needed, nitric oxide, a signaling molecule, rapidly released heme from entangling proteins, so it could do jobs such as regulating gene expression. ‘green lantern' glow 
 ""if you increase nitric oxide, you see the green glowing sensor dim as the heme becomes labile then the glow brightens back up over time as heme gets bound up again,"" reddi said. not having a sensor was one reason labile heme has not been previously observed, so the georgia tech researchers used a ratiometric fluorescence approach to design one that could be described a little like the comic book superhero ""green lantern."" as hemes are attracted to him like, say, fans, they become clutter, said reddi, the paper's principal investigator. ""he holds them in front of his green light, and they block it, making it appear dimmer."" ""ratiometric fluorescent techniques have been around for a while, but our technique is new, because it specifically senses heme,"" reddi said. ""we took a heme binding protein from bacteria and clipped it onto to green fluorescent protein."" the researchers used a blue laser to charge up the lamp part of the sensor protein pair like a glow-in-the-dark sticker, then it re-emitted the green light. ""you see this green image disappearing and reappearing depending on how much heme is available,"" reddi said. ""you can see what's happening in real time."" raven m. harvey, osiris martinez-guzman, bindu chandrasekharan and gheevarghese raju from georgia tech; xiaojing yuan, iqbal hamza from the university of maryland, and f. wayne outten from the university of south carolina coauthored the paper. the national science foundation funded the research under career award mcb 1552791, and the national institutes of health's national institute of environmental health sciences funded it under grant number es025661. any opinions, findings, and conclusions or recommendations expressed in this material are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the views of the national science foundation. research news georgia institute of technology 177 north avenue atlanta, georgia  30332-0181  usa media relations contacts:  ben brumfield ( ben.brumfield@comm.gatech.edu ) (404-660-1408) or john toon ( jtoon@gatech.edu ) (404-894-6986) writer:  ben brumfield

high-temperature-step-step-process-makes-graphene-ethene.txt,"high temperature step-by-step process makes graphene from ethene 
 researchers have developed a new way to produce single-layer graphene from a simple precursor: ethene. 
 a sequence of images at rising temperatures shows through microscopy (top row) and modeling (bottom row) how ethene molecules adsorbed on a rhodium catalyst transform into graphene. (figure credit: r. schaub). 
 may 04, 2017 
 - atlanta, ga 
 an international team of scientists has developed a new way to produce single-layer graphene from a simple precursor: ethene - also known as ethylene - the smallest alkene molecule, which contains just two atoms of carbon. 
 by heating the ethene in stages to a temperature of slightly more than 700 degrees celsius -- hotter than had been attempted before - the researchers produced pure layers of graphene on a rhodium catalyst substrate. the stepwise heating and higher temperature overcame challenges seen in earlier efforts to produce graphene directly from hydrocarbon precursors. 
 because of its lower cost and simplicity, the technique could open new potential applications for graphene, which has attractive physical and electronic properties. the work also provides a novel mechanism for the self-evolution of carbon cluster precursors whose diffusional coalescence results in the formation of the graphene layers. 
 the research, reported as the cover article in the may 4 issue of the 
 journal of physical chemistry c , was conducted by scientists at the georgia institute of technology, technische universität münchen in germany, and the university of st. andrews in scotland. in the united states, the research was supported by the u.s. air force office of scientific research and the u.s. department of energy's office of basic energy sciences. 
 ""since graphene is made from carbon, we decided to start with the simplest type of carbon molecules and see if we could assemble them into graphene,"" explained uzi landman, a regents' professor and f.e. callaway endowed chair in the georgia tech school of physics who headed the theoretical component of the research. ""from small molecules containing carbon, you end up with macroscopic pieces of graphene."" 
 graphene is now produced using a variety of methods including chemical vapor deposition, evaporation of silicon from silicon carbide - and simple exfoliation of graphene sheets from graphite. a number of earlier efforts to produce graphene from simple hydrocarbon precursors had proven largely unsuccessful, creating disordered soot rather than structured graphene. 
 guided by a theoretical approach, the researchers reasoned that the path from ethene to graphene would involve formation of a series of structures as hydrogen atoms leave the ethene molecules and carbon atoms self-assemble into the honeycomb pattern that characterizes graphene. to explore the nature of the thermally-induced rhodium surface-catalyzed transformations from ethene to graphene, experimental groups in germany and scotland raised the temperature of the material in steps under ultra-high vacuum. they used scanning-tunneling microscopy (stm), thermal programed desorption (tpd) and high-resolution electron energy loss (vibrational) spectroscopy (hreels) to observe and characterize the structures that form at each step of the process. 
 upon heating, ethene adsorbed onto the rhodium catalyst evolves via coupling reactions to form segmented one-dimensional polyaromatic hydrocarbons (1d-pah). further heating leads to dimensionality crossover - one dimensional to two dimensional structures - and dynamical restructuring processes at the pah chain ends with a subsequent activated detachment of size-selective carbon clusters, following a mechanism revealed through first-principles quantum mechanical  simulations.  finally, rate-limiting diffusional coalescence of these dynamically self-evolved cluster-precursors leads to condensation into graphene with high purity. 
 at the final stage before the formation of graphene, the researchers observed nearly round disk-like clusters containing 24 carbon atoms, which spread out to form the graphene lattice. ""the temperature must be raised within windows of temperature ranges to allow the requisite structures to form before the next stage of heating,"" landman explained. ""if you stop at certain temperatures, you are likely to end up with coking."" 
 an important component is the dehydrogenation process which frees the carbon atoms to form intermediate shapes, but some of the hydrogen resides temporarily on, or near, the metal catalyst surface and it assists in subsequent bond-breaking process that lead to detachment of the 24-carbon cluster-precursors.  ""all along the way, there is a loss of hydrogen from the clusters,"" said landman. ""bringing up the temperature essentially ‘boils' the hydrogen out of the evolving metal-supported carbon structure, culminating in graphene."" 
 the resulting graphene structure is adsorbed onto the catalyst. it may be useful attached to the metal, but for other applications, a way to remove it will have to be developed. added landman: ""this is a new route to graphene, and the possible technological application is yet to be explored."" 
 beyond the theoretical research, carried out by bokwon yoon and landman at the georgia tech center for computational materials science, the experimental work was done in the laboratory of professor renald schaub at the university of st. andrews and in the laboratory of professor ueli heiz and friedrich esch at the technische universität münchen. other co-authors included bo wang, michael könig, catherine j. bromley, michael-john treanor, josé a. garrido torres, marco caffio, federico grillo, herbert frücht, and neville v. richardson. 
 the work at the georgia institute of technology was supported by the air force office of scientific research through grant fa9550-14-1-0005 and by the office of basic energy sciences of the u.s. department of energy through grant fg05-86er45234. any opinions, findings, and conclusions or recommendations expressed in this material are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the views of the sponsoring organizations.

hispanic-and-latinx-heritage-president-angel-cabrera-representation-mentoring.txt,"hispanic and latinx heritage: president ángel cabrera on representation, mentoring, leadership 
 this national hispanic heritage month, president ángel cabrera reflects on his time as a student in the college of sciences at georgia tech - and speaks to recruiting and supporting more hispanic and latinx students and faculty in stem. 
 oct 08, 2021 
 - atlanta, ga 
 georgia tech president  ángel cabrera  isn't just the first native of spain to lead an american university. he's also just one of a handful of hispanic and latinx leaders to serve as presidents of major u.s. institutions of higher education. 
 ""it's not a big group,"" he says. ""the president of the massachusetts institute of technology is from venezuela. the president of the university of miami is mexican, and actually served in the mexican government as minister of health. then there are a few others. it's not many of us, but there is a small group."" (central connecticut state university president 
 zulma r. toro , who holds a ph.d. in industrial and systems engineering from tech, is both the first female president of and first hispanic chief executive at ccsu.) 
 that story echoes in  historical hispanic and latinx faculty representation in higher education in the u.s. , and in teaching stem (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) courses in k-12. 
 and although the number of hispanic and latinx students enrolled in colleges and universities has also steadily increased over the past several generations, national representation for this cohort also remains below their share in the u.s. population. ""it's far less in science and engineering majors,"" cabrera adds. ""that's the key. we tend to be under-indexed in engineering and computing, and most of the scientific disciplines."" 
 that's why cabrera values the importance of having hispanic and latinx faculty spend time in the community, showing students in grade school that people like them - with similar surnames, backgrounds, and stories - can be scientists, engineers, even university presidents. 
 and at georgia tech, the overall number of hispanic and latinx students is  on the rise , thanks in large part to sustained initiatives across campus, along with a number of mentoring and outreach efforts led by faculty, staff, students, and alumni advocates. hispanic and latinx enrollment recently topped 3,500 at tech - 500 more than the 2020-21 school year - making up nearly 14% of the undergraduate student body. 
 cabrera's parents weren't able to go college, but he found a mentor in his uncle as he was growing up in madrid. ""we always looked up to him. he was a great uncle, but also super smart. he was the guy we would call when we had a tough math problem in school. and as i realized that, hey, i'm good at this math stuff, he was always my role model. that's why i decided to become an engineer."" 
 cabrera received a telecommunications engineering degree (equivalent to an b.s. and m.s. in electrical and computing engineering) from universidad politécnica de madrid. he then received a fulbright scholarship to attend graduate school at georgia tech. that's when he decided to switch to cognitive psychology, and received a ph.d. in that discipline from the school of psychology in the college of sciences. 
 what did hispanic representation look like at georgia tech when you were here from 1991-95? 
 not great. i don't recall a single hispanic professor in psychology nor any another graduate student. there were a few graduate students in the college of computing and one faculty member, norberto ezquerra, with whom i did some work at the graphics visualization and usability center. but yeah, there was not great representation. i think georgia tech had always had a reasonable number of puerto rican students and international students from latin american countries. there was a good community for that, but on the faculty side, very rare. 
 given your experience, what can and should be done to get more hispanic and latinx students in stem classes in higher education? 
 well, first of all,  why  it is important that we do that? we have a clear mission to educate leaders who advance technology and improve the human condition. and that requires that people of all backgrounds be included. we simply cannot respond to the issues of our society if different perspectives are not represented at georgia tech. we have a responsibility to make sure that everybody's at the table. 
 and right now, not just at georgia tech but in general - maybe less so in biology - but in physics, math, and definitely computing and most engineering fields - women are underrepresented, black students are underrepresented, and hispanic students are underrepresented. and clearly, what the consequences for that will be is technologies and products that don't necessarily respond to every one's needs. there are plenty of examples of that. take for example face recognition software, which is notorious for failing with people with dark skins, or machine learning applications that have managed to incorporate many of our society's stereotypes and prejudices. 
 i think, because we are one of the leading technological universities in the country, and because we're large, we not only have the opportunity, but we have the responsibility to lead and to figure out ways to change that reality. it's a complex problem with a complex set of causes and solutions. clearly, we need to improve the number of faculty from different backgrounds. if you don't see it, you can't be it, you can't become it. 
 there is a piece of that which has to do with training latino teachers in k-12, increasing representation in our faculty. we know it works - giving students early experiences, bringing them to georgia tech, like in  project engages , for example. and also, all the work that  ceismic  (center for education integrating science, mathematics, and computing) does. ceismic, by the way, started off in the college of sciences, then became institute-wide. 
 that's the kind of work that we know has an impact - showing up in high schools, training teachers, providing students with a very direct experience. if you haven't been exposed at home - in most cases, it's having an opportunity to see someone like yourself. those are the things that can make a difference. 
 same question, but let's make it about faculty. what can and should be done to increase hispanic and latinx faculty in higher education? 
 we have experience with similar programs. we have a program called  focus . its goal is to bring college students from underrepresented communities, and engage them in a conversation with minority faculty, people like them who have done it, who are succeeding in engineering. and again, we know those interventions work. you just have to be intentional about that, but anything we can do to bring people to a place like georgia tech, to engage with peers to look at mentors, faculty members who've done it before you. we know those things work. 
 is there anything else you would want faculty and students to know about hispanic heritage month and how it relates to georgia tech's mission? 
 we're very proud of the many contributions of hispanic and latino faculty members in the history of georgia tech. we now have a small but incredibly influential group of faculty members at georgia tech who are making a difference. and i'm really, really proud of what they're doing. not only that, but how many of them are doubling their efforts, no matter how busy they are with their own careers. they're finding time to reach out to connect with students, to motivate others to follow suit. 
 i would also highlight the obvious, which is that we are at an institute that values diversity, that values different backgrounds to the point that they hired a guy like me to be president. i think that honestly goes beyond words - this is walking the talk. this is a university that values the contributions of people regardless of their background. 
 in fact, the last thing i'll say is that some people sometimes think about efforts of diversity as somehow, in a way, having a negative impact on the quality of georgia tech. and what i've always told people is that the more diverse georgia tech has become throughout the decades, the more prestigious georgia tech has become. 
 it's up to you to decide whether there is a cause-and-effect relationship there. but we've never been more diverse than we are today. we've never had the same level of brand recognition and reputation, the same level of applications, the same level of research productivity. we are the living proof that a leading university can benefit tremendously from increased diversity. 
 september 15 to october 15 is  national hispanic heritage month , which celebrates the contributions and influence of hispanic and latinx individuals in all aspects of american life - history, culture, and achievements. 
 this month, we're asking hispanic and latinx faculty in the college of sciences to share some of their early school day stories, the reasons they chose to study science, and their thoughts on the importance of representation in stem classes and leadership in higher education. 
 read q&as with frances rivera-hernández, facundo fernández and carlos silva-acuña 
 about early school days, why they chose to study science, and their perspectives on the importance of representation in classrooms, labs, and leadership in higher education.

 book jackets for holiday reading recommendations 
 dec 17, 2020 
 - atlanta, ga 
 winter break is a great time to find a comfortable chair and cozy up with a good book. so, what should you read? 
 we asked faculty members in the school of literature, media, and communication (lmc) to suggest a favorite holiday-themed book. the recommendations range from classics like 
 little women 
 to collections of gothic christmas tales and science fiction christmas stories. 
 a christmas carol 
 by charles dickens, calla editions (1843) 
 ""my favorite christmas story is 
 a christmas 
 carol, which dickens published in 1843 and remains relevant for a covid-19 christmas. since we've seen adaptations (with its central character played by mister magoo, scrooge mcduck, patrick stewart, and george c. scott), it's hard to realize that dickens wrote it after reading a government report on child labor during a period characterized as the hungry forties. dickens concluded his story by having scrooge give his clerk a turkey and a raise, a feel-good ending that doesn't go far enough to solve the problems of ignorance and want that dickens personifies."" 
 - carol senf, professor and director of undergraduate studies, lmc 
 little women ( or 
 meg, jo, beth, and amy) 
 by louisa may alcott, with illustrations by frank merrill, seawolf press (1868-69) 
 ""louisa may alcott's novel 
 little women 
 opens at christmas with the march sisters discussing presents. the novel explores 19th-century domestic ideologies of gender in ways that still resonate with audiences in describing how marmee educates her four daughters (meg, jo, beth, and amy march) while their patriarch serves as a chaplain supporting the union during the civil war. self-sacrifice, compassion, generosity, and the importance of respecting love over money are among the lessons the mother imparts to her girls. greta gerwig's 2019 film reorders the narrative to emphasize the pleasures and costs of domesticity for the march women."" 
 -carol colatrella, professor and associate dean for graduate studies, ivan allen college of liberal arts 
 at chrighton abbey and other horror stories 
 by mary elizabeth braddon, westside press (2002) 
 ""it was a tradition in the 19th-century to read stories as a family 
 - 
 gothic tales and ghost stories were particularly popular and often read at christmastime. while 
 a christmas carol 
 by charles dickens is the most common example, i recommend a lesser-known collection by the victorian fiction writer mary elizabeth braddon. her stories were highly popular in the period and often had sensational themes and mysterious plots. 
 of chrighton abbey 
 is one of her gothic christmas stories. it brings together a creepy cast of characters in a christmas setting, and its central theme surrounds a family curse and ghostly warnings of a death before a wedding day. this collection of braddon's tales also provides examples of her other gothic and sensational tales, perfect for a read by the fire on a winter day. there is the creepy, but engaging ghost story, ‘the cold embrace,' about a young artist haunted by the ghost of a former lover he betrayed, and a fabulous vampiric story called ‘the good lady ducayne.'"" 
 - narin hassan, associate professor, lmc 
 tyll 
 by daniel kehlmann, pantheon books (translation copyright 2020) 
 ""if you like historical fiction, and if you are in the mood to learn how human beings may have dealt with calamity, war, and pandemic 400 years ago, then daniel kehlmann's 
 tyll 
 might be a good pick. this novel, shortlisted for the booker prize in 2020, transports the reader back into one of the most tumultuous and bloody periods of pre-modern european history, the thirty years war (1618-1648) and into the life of the notorious trickster figure and vagrant folk hero tyll eulenspiegel. tyll's fable-like adventures in an apocalyptic world question authority and absolute truths in ways that will feel eerily familiar to contemporary readers. his survival skills resemble that of a superhero, but his weapons are a mélange of naivete and wit. is anyone surprised that netflix is in the process of adapting the novel into a tv series?"" 
 -richard utz, chair and professor, lmc 
 the tailor of gloucester 
 by beatrix potter, f. warne & co. (2002), and 
 a child's christmas in wales  by dylan thomas, orion (1993) (this edition has the reviewer's favorite illustrations.) 
 ""my mum grew up in london, so a lot of our christmas books were the classic english ones. i still have a kind of nostalgic connection to beatrix potter's 
 the tailor of gloucester 
 - 
 even though half of the words in it were utterly incomprehensible to me (""penn'orth"" and ""pipkin"" and that sort of thing). it's about a tailor who falls sick while trying to finish a coat for the mayor's wedding on christmas day. traditionally you'd read it in a little miniature edition, which was part of the charm. an honorable mention for dylan thomas's 
 a child's christmas in wales , a kind of prose poem, which introduced to me the invaluable distinction between useful presents (terrible) and useless presents (great), a distinction my seven-year-old son has embraced enthusiastically."" 
 - aaron santesso, professor, lmc 
 lisa yaszek, professor, lmc, recommended several science fiction christmas tales: 
 "" the star "" by arthur c. clarke, harcourt brace (1950); "" the wild wood "" by mildred clingerman, size 5 1 / 2 b publishing (1957); 
 a lot like christmas: stories 
 by connie willis, del rey (2017), and 
 christmas on mars , a 2008 film written and directed by wayne coyne, front man of the flaming lips. 
 ""at first it might seem surprising that there is a tradition of science fiction christmas tales - after all, we often assume that science and religion are antithetical to one another, even in fiction. but who better to give us fresh perspectives on a story that has already been visited and revisited by artists for well over 2,000 years? indeed, the two classic short stories i'm recommending for this holiday season deliver that fresh perspective in spades, even today. arthur c. clarke's award-winning 1955 short story ‘the star' provides a surprising but deeply moving perspective on science, faith, and the celestial object that guided the wise men to bethlehem. two years later, mildred clingerman would offer a completely different but equally novel take on christmas with ‘the wild wood,' a 1957 short story that explores the terrifying sexed and gendered energies informing our most cherished holiday traditions. taken together, these stories - both of which are available online for free in either print or audio form - will ensure that you never think about the winter holidays quite the same way again. 
 ""of course, science fiction is a big tent, and for those of you who prefer humor and magic with your holiday stories, science fiction can provide that, too! connie willis is famous for both her humorous science fiction in general and her annual christmas stories in particular. her recent collection, 
 a lot like christmas: stories,

hollister-lab-develops-3d-printing-soft-tissue-engineering.txt,"hollister lab develops 3d printing for soft tissue engineering 
 researchers use architected auxetics to achieve 300 times more flexibility in new 3d printing design. 
 research scientist jeonghun park 
 nov 30, 2023 
 there are young children celebrating the holidays this year with their families, thanks to the 3d-printed medical devices created in the lab of  georgia tech researcher scott hollister . for more than 10 years, hollister and his collaborators have developed lifesaving, patient-specific airway splints for babies with rare birth defects. 
 these personalized airway support devices are made of a biocompatible polyester called polycaprolactone (pcl), which has the advantage of being approved by the food and drug administration. researchers use selective laser sintering to heat the powdered polyester, which binds together as a solid structure. devices made of pcl have a great safety record when implanted into patients. 
 unfortunately, pcl has the disadvantage of having relatively stiff and linear mechanical properties, which means this promising biomaterial has yet to be applied functionally to some other critical biomedical needs, such as soft tissue engineering. how do you make a firm thermoplastic into something flexible, and possibly capable of growing with the patient? hollister's lab has figured out how. 
 ""3d auxetic design,"" said jeong hun park, a research scientist in hollister's lab who led the team's recent study demonstrating the successful  3d printing of pcl for soft tissue engineering . an auxetic material, unlike typical common elastics, has a negative poisson's ratio. that means if you stretch an auxetic material longitudinally it will also expand in the lateral direction, whereas most materials will get thinner laterally (because they have a positive poisson's ratio). 
 so, an auxetic structure can expand in both directions, which is useful when considering biomedical applications for humans, whose bodies and parts can change in size and shape over time and comprise many different textures and densities. hollister's team set out to give usually firm pcl some new auxetic properties. 
 ""although the mechanical properties and behavior of the 3d structure depend on the inherent properties of the base material - in this case, pcl - it can also be significantly tuned through internal architecture design,"" explained park. 
 park guided the design of 3d-printed structures made up of tiny struts, arranged at right angles - imagine the bones of very tiny skyscrapers. the team began by creating cube-shaped structures first, to test the auxetic design's flexibility, strength, and permeability. 
 flexible behavior 
 basically, an auxetic material is a network structure designed by assembling unit cells. these unit cells consist of struts and their intersecting joints, which are an important aspect of an auxetic device's behavior. the rotation of those intersecting joints within the network, under compression or extension, causes negative poisson's behavior. it also enables advanced performance for a printed device, including impact energy absorption, indentation resistance, and high flexibility. 
 ""when you look at the numbers, based on jeong hun's work, the new structure is about 300 times more flexible than the typical solid structure we make out of pcl in our lab,"" said hollister, professor in the wallace h. coulter department of biomedical engineering at georgia tech and emory university, where he also holds the patsy and alan dorris chair in pediatric technology and serves as the department's associate chair for translational research. 
 the combination of flexibility and strength in a device is particularly important here, park said, because the ultimate goal of the research is to ""apply this structure to develop a breast reconstruction implant that has comparable biomechanical properties to native breast tissue. currently, we don't have a biodegradable breast implantation option in the clinical setting."" 
 he explained that these biodegradable breast reconstruction implants serve as a kind of scaffold. the idea is, the biocompatible material (pcl) eventually degrades and is absorbed into the body, while maintaining similar mechanical properties to native breast tissue. 
 ""we expect that native tissue will be first infiltrated into the pores of the biodegradable implant,"" park said. ""tissue volume will then increase within the implant as it degrades and eventually the device itself is replaced with the tissue after complete degradation of the implant."" 
 expanding the cellular network 
 essentially, the 3d-printed breast implant is designed to provide reconstructive support while also facilitating the growth of new tissue. 
 the space between those tiny struts makes all the difference for the larger device, giving it a softness and pliability that would have been impossible otherwise. those spaces eventually can be filled with hydrogel that will help foster cell and tissue growth. 
 the team's architected auxetics also include the design of inner voids and spaces inside the struts, creating a kind of microporosity that enables the mass transport of oxygen, nutrients, and metabolites to nurture the expansion and growth of a cellular network. 
 park is working with emory surgeon  angela cheng  in submitting a grant for further research and testing of the breast implant. and the team already is adapting the technology for other applications. one of the collaborators in this research, for example, is  mike davis , whose lab at emory is focused on cardiac regeneration. 
 ""because of the great flexibility, they're using it to reconstruct infarcted or necrotic myocardial tissue,"" hollister said. 
 and park has developed an auxetic version of the pediatric tracheal splint. ""the advantage there is, with this design, it can expand in two directions,"" he said. ""so, as young patients grow, the new device will grow with them.""

 astronaut shane kimbrough visits campus after returning from space in november of 2021. 
 shane kimbrough listens to ae master's student ebenezer arunkumar during his march 4 visit. 
 mar 08, 2022 
 - atlanta, ga 
 two standing-room-only crowds welcomed shane kimbrough back to his alma mater on march 4, four months after he returned from space. 
 the first was an afternoon question-and-answer session with the georgia tech community. then he went under the lights at a sold-out russ chandler stadium as the yellow jackets baseball team hosted the university of georgia. 
 the day of events marked kimbrough's first on campus since the georgia tech graduate's third mission to space - which included 199 days and 84 million miles aboard the international space station (iss). 
 kimbrough's first stop of the day was a morning tour of the 
 space systems design lab . nearly two dozen students and research engineers showed kimbrough the lab space of 
 glenn lightsey , a professor in the 
 daniel guggenheim school of aerospace engineering (ae school) . 
 kimbrough watched as the group tested electronics and navigation systems for future cubesats. their 
 gt-1 
 spacecraft 
 was deployed into orbit in february , and the students are currently working on three 10 cm x 10 cm x 10 cm follow-up models for future missions. 
 from there, kimbrough visited mission operations center, which is currently being used to track gt-1. he also checked in on 
 lunar flashlight , which is scheduled for launch this summer and will be the first cubesat ever to orbit the moon. a georgia tech interdisciplinary team built the spacecraft's propulsion system. the ae school and the 
 georgia tech research institute (gtri) 
 have been assembling and integrating lunar flashlight for nasa's jet propulsion lab the last several months. 
 ""i was really inspired by the students i met, and i've been very impressed by the projects they're working on,"" said kimbrough, who received his master's degree in operations research from the  h. milton stewart school of industrial and systems engineering (isye) 
 in 1998. ""so many people are interested in space, which is great to see."" 
 ""friday was amazing! it was very cool to share the work we do here at the lab and hear about his various experiences, from the military to nasa to being on the iss,"" said ebenezer arunkumar, gt-1's software team lead and a master's student in aerospace engineering. ""being an astronaut has always been a dream of mine, so meeting someone who has accomplished that goal was awe-inspiring."" 
 the morning ended with a visit to the 
 yang aero maker space . the student-led facility in the weber space and science technology building allows students to use 3d printers, laser cutters, and more to build prototypes that advance their research and curiosity. 
 ""it was a really great opportunity to talk to an astronaut, something i'd only done on zoom,"" said rachel thomas, a member of the 
 ramblin' rocket club 
 who is scheduled to graduate this semester with her undergraduate degree in aerospace engineering. ""i talked to him about my team, 
 gtxr (georgia tech experimental rocketry ), and he was really excited about that. it was a unique experience."" 
 the day's main event, a q&a in the clough undergraduate learning commons, filled an auditorium. in addition to the 250 or so yellow jackets in the room, nearly a thousand k-12 students from around the atlanta area tuned into the livestream as invited guests, with some submitting questions for kimbrough. 
 topics ranged from the astronaut application process, when he knew he wanted to travel to space (as a young child), and the relevancy of his isye degree to his success as an astronaut. 
 the session was moderated by ae school ph.d. student naia butler-craig, an aspiring astronaut. 
 ""i'm so grateful that shane took his time to pour into the next generation of aerospace engineers,"" butler-craig said. ""it was such an honor to hear from someone as accomplished and personable as him. i feel motivated to keep going on my own journey in following his footsteps!"" 
 before taking a detour and riding in the ramblin' wreck for the first time, kimbrough stood before another packed house that night. he threw out the first pitch before georgia tech beat georgia 11-7. kimbrough grew up attending yellow jacket sporting events and nearly enrolled as undergraduate. instead, he attended the u.s. military academy and pitched for its baseball team. 
 ""it was an incredible, perfect day for me. ""getting to come back and give back a little bit to the students and faculty was amazing."" kimbrough said. ""the weather was great. the events were great. i just want to go back to school!""

home-holidays-know-travel-risks-you-go.txt,"home for the holidays: know the travel risks before you go 
 researchers have developed a tool that shows the risk someone with covid-19 will be present at gatherings from 10 to 5,000 people anywhere in the u.s. 
 illustration: jessie brandon 
 nov 18, 2020 
 - atlanta, ga 
 as covid-19 outbreaks surge in several states, the choice to see family this holiday season gets more complicated by the day. thankfully, there's a tool - developed by georgia tech faculty, scientists, gis specialists, and graduate students - that can help estimate the potential risk of exposure involved with a trip home for a turkey dinner. 
 joshua s. weitz , patton distinguished professor in the 
 school of biological sciences , and 
 clio andris , assistant professor in the schools of  city and regional planning  and  interactive computing , created the "" covid-19 event risk assessment planning tool ."" 
 they launched the tool in july, and since then it has generated more than 2 million unique visitors, been featured in national and international media, and spurred the development of related sites in spanish and italian. a multi-authored scientific article describing the tool was published in 
 nature human behaviour 
 on nov. 9. 
 ""we are starting to see the traffic ramp up again as people plan for the holidays,"" andris said. 
 a useful spatial tool 
 the tool breaks down the risk of attending events, no matter the size, based on county-level covid-19 case reports in the u.s. and parts of europe. users can select the county they are interested in and the size of the event they wish to attend. 
 weitz, the founding director of tech's quantitative biosciences graduate program, and an ardent atlanta united fan, was having trouble deciding whether or not to go to a home game when mercedes-benz stadium in atlanta reopened after the covid-19 lockdown. 
 he developed a statistical model based on the odds of encountering one infected individual amongst many. weitz quickly realized that the model would also be useful in the form of an interactive map. 
 ""i reached out to clio, given her expertise in spatial visualization and analysis,"" he said. 
 ""clio and i were already collaborating on modeling covid-19 epidemic spread in georgia. i knew she would be an ideal partner, particularly given the strong visualization background of her team of 
 master of science in geographic information science and technology 
 students."" 
 andris' 
 friendly cities lab 
 works on a number of covid-19 projects meant to assist cities and the people that live in them. 
 ""at that point in the summer, and even now, the covid-19 case rates change based on location,"" she said. ""early on, people only had national-level data, and we wanted to drill down to the county level. this allows people to decide whether to attend an event based on the risk level in their locality."" 
 while the interactive tool works well for large-scale events, users can also select smaller event sizes like 10 or 15 people - the size of many family gatherings during the holidays. 
 what comes next? 
 the friendly cities lab plans to analyze gps trace movement data from 
 safegraph 
 over the thanksgiving holiday from 2019. 
 they'll gain insight into the network backbone and compare the data to 2020. andris said the lab should be able to show risk assessment tool users how covid-19 may spread throughout late november and visualize predictions about december travel. 
 creating a model with that kind of predictive power can get tricky when not properly interpreted. andris stressed that accurate predictions require collaboration with experts on epidemic dynamics - like weitz - and that it takes some circulation time before large spreading events register as a major outbreak. 
 ""we might not see and understand the impacts of thanksgiving travel until january, and by then we'll be settled in for the impacts of december travel as well,"" she said. 
 ""think of our research and the risk assessment tool like a weather map. we aren't telling you to get your umbrella or to stay inside, but we are telling you that outside it is raining."" 
 the friendly cities lab and covid-19 
 during the first wave of the pandemic the friendly cities lab mapped out icu beds, ventilators, and hospital capacity for the state of georgia. these maps were shared with the georgia municipal association. 
 ""it allowed the municipalities to put the pandemic into context for their specific counties,"" andris said. 
 the lab also did a number of 
 mobility studies . these studies analyzed how people moved around during the early stages of the pandemic. they identified which jobs led to high mobility, such as manufacturing and agriculture. in counties with a greater incidence of high mobility jobs, employees were more likely to interact with people outside their households, and possibly spread the virus. 
 another useful tool the lab built for cities is the 
 excess deaths associated with covid-19: county level map . it calculates the number of excess deaths in 2020 per county. 
 ""in a small county, knowing that there are ‘26 excess deaths' requires context,"" andris said. ""for example, if that is 50 percent more deaths than we can typically expect in a year in that location, it points to an extreme detriment to the community and potential strains on both health care systems and the death care industry."" 
 in october, andris received a fellowship from the geospatial software institute (gsi) conceptualization project. the fellowship is for tackling covid-19 challenges using geospatial software and advanced capabilities in cyberinfrastructure and data science. her fellowship involves a covid-19 tracing project with emergency management services in the new york city fire department.

how-communication-among-cells-affects-development-multicellular-tissue.txt,"how communication among cells affects development of multicellular tissue 
 a new study shows how intercellular communication affects the differentiation of an embryonic stem cell colony over time. 
 an agent-based computational model simulates the progression of intracellular molecular gradients and resultant differentiation patterns that emerge within a multicellular system. (credit: chad glen, georgia tech) 
 oct 15, 2018 
 - atlanta, ga 
 using a combination of computational modeling and experimental techniques, a research team has developed new information about how intercellular communication affects the differentiation of an embryonic stem cell colony over time. 
 by providing new information about the role of communication among cells, the research could lead to a better understanding of how multicellular organoids form from colonies of independent cells. the information could lead to new methods for controlling how multicellular constructs develop, and that could have applications in regenerative medicine, pharmaceutical testing and other research areas. 
 the research resulted from collaboration between the georgia institute of technology and the gladstone institutes, and was reported october 5 in the journal 
 nature communications . the national science foundation's (nsf) emergent behaviors of integrated cellular systems science and technology center (ebics) supported the research. 
 ""the goal is to control a system of cells like this to direct tissues to take on different phenotypes, to develop into different complex mixtures, and to self-assemble and emerge into very complicated structures,"" said 
 melissa kemp , an associate professor in the 
 wallace h. coulter department of biomedical engineering at georgia tech and emory university . ""for developing tissues that could be used as surrogates for screening drugs or as eventual implants for therapeutic purposes, we need to how to control and direct them properly."" 
 scientists believe that the patterning of stem cell differentiation affects what kinds of cells will ultimately emerge from the differentiation process. 
 despite the importance of local cell-to-cell interactions in evolving multicellular systems, little has been known about how the overall system regulates its morphological processes. to learn more about this, the paper's first author, chad glen, studied how communication between adjacent mouse cells informs the fate of those cells. beyond understanding this communication, glen discovered a potential mechanism for ""braking"" the rate of differentiation without affecting the overall patterning of the resulting multicellular tissue. 
 ""the amount of coordination among cells that are tightly coupled gives us an idea about how they work as a group,"" said 
 todd mcdevitt , senior investigator at the 
 gladstone institutes 
 and a professor of bioengineering and therapeutic sciences at the university of california, san francisco. ""this reflects the behavior of a team versus individuals. they really do coordinate activity in a rapid way. this study shows how quickly some important cell behaviors are mediated by gap junction communication."" 
 glen, a recent ph.d. graduate of georgia tech, began the project by studying communication between pairs of adjacent cells, which have pores that allow small molecules to enter. by introducing a signaling molecule into a colony containing hundreds of these homogeneous mouse stem cells, the researchers observed that differentiation began with a change in a single cell. that cell triggered a pattern of differentiation that flowed through the cells and eventually led to changes in the entire colony. 
 on a larger scale and in three dimensions, such changes lead to development of bodily organs. understanding how that happens - and how it could be controlled - could be key to directing this transition from individual cells. 
 based on experimental observations, glen developed a model of the process, which allowed the researchers to study the impact of a series of interrelated variables that would have been impossible to study experimentally. the modeling of several hundred individual cells led to specific predictions that the researchers then tested experimentally. 
 to understand and measure the cell communication process, the researchers used a fluorescent dye to show when signaling molecules had moved from one cell to its neighbors. they then used a laser to bleach the dye from a single cell. measuring how long it took for the dye to be replaced showed the permeability of the cell membrane - and how well the cell was communicating with its neighbors. 
 ""if you zap a cell and it immediately returns to green, you know there is a lot of fluidity and cross-talk between the cell membranes,"" kemp explained. ""if you zap a cell and it stays dark, the cell is effectively isolated and has no communication with its neighbors."" 
 by partially blocking communication between cells and otherwise perturbing the communications, the researchers slowed the differentiation process - but didn't change its pattern. ""we were able to shift the way the cells were behaving to slow things down - effectively ‘braking' the process - while preserving the spatial information,"" said kemp. ""cells that were at 48 hours in the process could look like 24-hour cells."" 
 the combination of computational modeling and experiment allowed the research team to arrive at answers that neither technique by itself could have provided, mcdevitt noted. 
 ""with modeling, you can study a much larger set of conditions and parameters than we could experimentally,"" he said. ""the model could make predictions that we could go back and study experimentally to see how those conditions actually affected the behaviors. the behaviors we measured experimentally matched what the computer predicted, and validated that we had a robust model."" 
 mcdevitt and kemp have been studying this system of embryonic stem cells for several years, and the new study moves them closer to a more complete understanding of the complex system. 
 ""we have demonstrated in a series of papers over the past six years that this system's complexity can be modeled,"" he said. ""this paper represents a further step toward the greater goal of integrating information about this system. with each of these steps, we are much closer to taking a bigger leap into potentially controlling these systems.""

 a new study demonstrates the physics that elephants use to feed themselves the massive quantities of leaves, fruit and roots needed to sustain their multi-ton bodies. 
 a human can pick up multiple objects at once by squeezing them together with both hands and arms. an african elephant also picks up many items at once but with only one appendage-its soft, heavy trunk. how the elephant solves this challenge could provide inspiration for future robotics. 
 a wild african elephant eats rapidly, consuming 190 grams of food a minute, to provide adequate fuel for its vast bulk. ""elephants are in a rush when they are eating,"" said david l. hu, associate professor in the school of mechanical engineering and the school of biology at the georgia institute of technology. the elephant diet consists of large volumes of plant materials such as leaves, fruit and roots. to eat these, elephants sweep loose items into a pile and crush them into a manageable solid that can be picked up by the trunk. 
 ""they don't just use the trunk's strong muscles to squeeze the plants together,"" said hu. ""the elephants also use the weight of the trunk, and they do that by forming a joint in the trunk. the trunk below the joint becomes a stiff pillar that applies weight to the pile of plant materials."" 
 about 30 percent of the applied force is derived from the pillar's weight alone, and about 70 percent from exerting muscular effort, according to a new study published in the 
 journal of the royal society interface 
 by hu and colleagues at georgia tech, the rochester institute of technology and zoo atlanta. 
 the african elephant can raise or lower the trunk joint's height by up to 11 centimeters to increase or reduce the applied force. ""when elephants need more force, the joint is higher up on the trunk,"" hu said. elephant trunks weigh about 150 kilograms and have 40,000 muscles. ""the huge number of muscles in the trunk allows the elephant great freedom for where it puts this joint."" 
 hu and his colleagues studied a 34-year-old female african elephant (loxodonta africana) over several weeks in the summer of 2017. all experiments were supervised by the staff at zoo atlanta. food was arranged by hand into a pile in the center of a force plate to measure how much force the animal generated. 
 the elephant's trunk is similar to other boneless organs in nature such as the octopus's arm and the human tongue. but unlike an octopus's arm, an elephant's trunk is heavy enough to provide significant force on an object without muscular pressure. this is the first study to show that an animal can use the weight of its own appendage to help apply force and the first with a live elephant to understand forces that it can apply to materials. 
 using mathematical models, the researchers found that the greater the number of objects to be squeezed and picked up, the greater the force that must be applied. 
 ""picking up two objects requires very little force to press them together, while picking up 40,000 objects requires a lot of force,"" hu said. this principle was tested experimentally with the live elephant by presenting multiple food items varying in number from four to 40,000 in number. the experiments showed that the elephant could vary forces applied with its trunk by a factor of four depending on the number of food items to be picked up. 
 this research could have applications in robotics, where heavier machines would appear to have few advantages over smaller ones. but, in the future, heavy robotic manipulators could be designed with several adjustable joints that use the device's own weight to provide adjustable pressure and save energy. there are currently no commercial robots designed to apply their own weight to objects, hu noted. 
 ""you could have future robots with several joints, which could apply various weight pressures below joints to help compress objects together for lifting them efficiently,"" said hu. ""this would allow you to use the weight of the joints themselves to provide force instead of relying on batteries and extra motors to apply these forces, and that would mean using less energy. for instance, you could have a heavy robot with four joints, and by bending the top joint, the weight below it could apply a load. if you wanted to provide less weight pressure, you could instead bend the second-from-the-top joint. this study shows that there are some advantages for robots in being big and heavy."" 
 african elephants like the ones in this study have two muscular extensions at the tip of their trunk resembling a pair of fingers that also could be studied as models for future robotics. it's not well known that elephants have such projections, and this understanding could inform work that is already underway. ""the elephant's technique with these extensions might be used to develop soft robotic grippers that can pick up delicate items such as fruit without damaging them,"" hu noted. 
 this work was supported by the u.s. army research laboratory and the u.s. army research office mechanical sciences division, complex dynamics and systems program, under contract w911nf-12-r-0011.

how-generative-ai-will-transform-knowledge-work.txt,"how generative ai will transform knowledge work 
 in research published by the harvard business review, maryam alavi examined how generative ai can transform knowledge work and how workers can begin using generative ai tools wisely. 
 nov 09, 2023 
 generative ai tools have taken the world by storm. chatgpt reached 100 million monthly users 
 faster than any internet application 
 in history. the potential benefits of efficiency and productivity gains for knowledge-intensive firms are clear, and companies in industries such as professional services, health care, and finance are investing billions in adopting the technologies. 
 but the benefits for individual knowledge workers can be less clear. when technology can do many tasks that only humans could do in the past, what does it mean for knowledge workers? generative ai can and will automate some of the tasks of knowledge workers, but that doesn't necessarily mean it will replace all of them. generative ai can also help knowledge workers find more time to do meaningful work, and improve performance and productivity. the difference is in how you use the tools. 
 in this article, we aim to explain how to do that well. first, to help employees and managers understand ways that generative ai can support knowledge work. and second, to identify steps that managers can take to help employees realize the potential benefits. 
 what is knowledge work? 
 knowledge work primarily involves cognitive processing of information to generate value-added outputs. it differs from manual labor in the materials used and the types of conversion processes involved. knowledge work is typically dependent on advanced training and specialization in specific domains, gained over time through learning and experience. it includes both structured and unstructured tasks. structured tasks are those with well-defined and well-understood inputs and outputs, as well as prespecified steps for converting inputs to outputs. examples include payroll processing or scheduling meetings. unstructured tasks are those where inputs, conversion procedures, or outputs are mostly ill-defined, underspecified, or unknown a priori. examples include resolving interpersonal conflict, designing a product, or negotiating a salary. 
 very few jobs are purely one or the other. jobs consist of many tasks, some of which are structured and others which are unstructured. some tasks are necessary but repetitive. some are more creative or interesting. some can be done alone, while others require working with other people. some are common to everything the worker does, while others happen only for exceptions. as a knowledge worker, your job, then, is to manage this complex set of tasks to achieve their goals. 
 computers have traditionally been good at performing structured tasks, but there are many tasks that only humans can do. generative ai is changing the game, moving the boundaries of what computers can do and shrinking the sphere of tasks that remain as purely human activity. while it can be worrisome to think about generative ai encroaching on knowledge work, we believe that the benefits can far outweigh the costs for most knowledge workers. but realizing the benefits requires taking action now to learn how to leverage generative ai in support of knowledge work.

 scientists have learned how the hawkmoth juggles the complex sensing and control challenges of seeing in the dark, hovering in mid-air and tracking moving flowers.

 it's difficult enough to see things in the dark, but what if you also had to hover in mid-air while tracking a flower moving in the wind? that's the challenge the hummingbird-sized hawkmoth ( manduca sexta ) must overcome while feeding on the nectar of its favorite flowers. using high-speed infrared cameras and 3-d-printed robotic flowers, scientists have now learned how this insect juggles these complex sensing and control challenges - all while adjusting to changing light conditions. the work shows that the creatures can slow their brains to improve vision under low-light conditions - while continuing to perform demanding tasks. what the researchers have discovered could help the next generation of small flying robots operate efficiently under a broad range of lighting conditions. the research, supported by the national science foundation and air force office of scientific research, was reported in the june 12 issue of the journal 
 science . ""there has been a lot of interest in understanding how animals deal with challenging sensing environments, especially when they are also doing difficult tasks like hovering in mid-air,"" said simon sponberg, an assistant professor in the school of physics and school of applied physiology at the georgia institute of technology. ""this is also a very significant challenge for micro air vehicles."" scientists already knew that the moths, which feed on flower nectar during the evening and at dusk and dawn, use specialized eye structures to maximize the amount of light they can capture. but they also surmised that the insects might be slowing their nervous systems to make the best use of this limited light. but if they were slowing their brains to see better, wouldn't that hurt their ability to hover and track the motion of flowers? sponberg and colleagues at the university of washington studied this question using high-speed infrared cameras and nectar-dispensing robotic flowers that could be moved from side-to-side at different rates. while varying both the light conditions and the frequency at which the flowers moved, the researchers studied how well free-flying moths kept their tongues - known as proboscises - in the flowers. they also measured real flowers blowing in the wind to determine the range of motion the insects had to contend with in the wild. ""we expected to see a tradeoff with the moths doing significantly worse at tracking flowers in low light conditions,"" said sponberg. ""what we saw was that while the moths did slow down, that only made a difference if the flower was moving rapidly - faster than they actually move in nature."" in the experiments, the moths tracked robotic flowers that were oscillating at rates of up to 20 hertz - twenty oscillations per second. that was considerably faster than the two-hertz maximum rate observed in real flowers. because the moth's wings beat at a rate of about 25 strokes per second, they had to adjust their direction of movement with nearly every wingstroke - a major sensing, computational and control accomplishment. ""this is really an extreme behavior, though the moth makes it look simple and elegant,"" said sponberg. ""to maneuver like this is really quite challenging. it's an extreme behavior from both a sensory and motor control perspective."" in the natural world, light intensity varies 10 billion-fold from noon on a sunny day to midnight a cloudy evening. operating in that range of luminosity is a challenge for both moths and the sensors on human-engineered systems. understanding how natural systems adjust to this range of conditions could therefore have broader benefits. ""if we want to have robots or machine vision systems that are working under this broad range of conditions, understanding how these moths function under these varying light conditions would be very useful,"" sponberg said. to gather the data reported in this paper, the researchers used a robotic flower able to move in one dimension. recently, they've used the actuator devices from a 3-d printer to build a robotic flower that moves in two or three dimensions, providing an additional challenge for the moths. in future research, sponberg and his colleagues hope to incorporate their robotic flower into a low-speed wind tunnel to study the aerodynamic challenges the moths overcome - including the role of wing vortices and the flow-effect interaction of the insect's wings with the flowers. the hawkmoth has been studied extensively to investigate the fundamental principles governing the development and function of its neural system, noted tom daniel, a professor in the department of biology and co-director of the institute for neuroengineering at the university of washington. daniel's research group has experimentally characterized the response of flying hawkmoths, using a sensory input comprised of the linear sum of sine waves. sponberg's paper, for which much of the data collection was done at the university of washington while he was a postdoctoral researcher there, extends application of the ""sum of sines"" approach, daniel said. ""simon's work took the formal methods of control theory to dissect out how neural circuits adapt to vast ranges of luminance levels,"" he explained. ""by looking at the time delays in the movement dynamics of a freely-flying moth - interacting with the input of a robotically moved flower - simon was able to extract the luminance dependent processing of the moth's central nervous system."" human engineered devices must often operate at various speeds and in different environments. seeing how well an animal with a tiny brain was able to track complicated movements and adjust its performance to different light levels was a surprising result of the work, sponberg said. ""this was an interesting example of how an organism can tune its brain to maintain its ability to gather food,"" he added. ""the moths do suffer a tradeoff by slowing their brains, but that tradeoff doesn't end up mattering because it only affects their ability to track movements that don't exist in the natural way that flowers blow in the wind."" citation : simon sponberg, jonathan p. dyhr, robert w. hall and tom l. daniel, ""luminance-dependent visual processing enables moth flights in low light,"" (science 2015). research news georgia institute of technology 177 north avenue atlanta, georgia 30332-0181 usa media relations contacts : john toon ( jtoon@gatech.edu ) (404-894-6986). writer : john toon

human-brains-meticulous-interface-bloodstream-now-precision-chip.txt,"the human brain's meticulous interface with the bloodstream now on a precision chip 
 this blood-brain barrier on a chip represents important features more accurately than animal models and previous chips

 a scrupulous gatekeeper stands between the brain and its circulatory system to let in the good and keep out the bad, but this porter, called the blood-brain barrier, also blocks trial drugs to treat diseases like alzheimer's or cancer from getting into the brain. 
 now a team led by researchers at the georgia institute of technology has engineered a way of studying the barrier more closely with the intent of helping drug developers do the same.  in a new study , the researchers cultured the human blood-brain barrier on a chip, recreating its physiology more realistically than predecessor chips. 
 the new chip devised a healthy environment for the barrier's central component, a brain cell called the astrocyte, which is not a neuron, but which acts as neurons' intercessors with the circulatory system. astrocytes interface in human brains with cells in the vasculature called endothelial cells to collaborate with them as the blood-brain barrier. 
 but astrocytes are a particularly fussy partner, which makes them a great part of the gatekeeper system but also challenging to culture in a physiologically accurate manner. the new chip catered to astrocytes' sensibilities by culturing in 3d instead of in a flat manner, or 2d. 
 the 3d space allowed astrocytes to act more naturally, and this improved the whole barrier model by also allowing cultured endothelial cells to function better. the new chip presented researchers with more healthy blood-brain barrier functions to observe than in previous barrier models. 
 ‘astro' in astrocyte 
 ""you need to be able to closely mimic a tissue on a chip in a healthy status and in homeostasis. if we can't model the healthy state, we can't really model disease either, because we have no accurate control to measure it against,"" said yongtae kim,  an associate professor in georgia tech's george w. woodruff school of mechanical engineering  and the study's principal investigator. 
 in the new chip, the astrocytes even looked more natural in the 3d space, unfolding the star-like shape that gives them their ""astro"" name. in the 2d cultures, by contrast, astrocytes looked like fried eggs with fringes. with this 3d setting, the chip has added possibilities for reliable research of the human blood-brain barrier, where currently alternatives are few. 
 ""no animal model comes close enough to the intricate function of the human blood-brain barrier. and we need better human models because experimental drugs that have successfully entered animal brains have failed at the human barrier,"" kim said. 
 the team  published its results on january 10, 2020, in the journal  nature communications . the research was funded by the national institutes of health. kim has founded a company with plans to mass-produce the new chip in the future for use in academic and potentially pharmaceutical research. 
 [ready for graduate school?  here's how to apply to georgia tech. ] 
 choosy, bossy astrocytes 
 the brain is the only part of the body outfitted with astrocytes, which regulate nourishment uptake and waste removal in their own, unique way. 
 ""upon the brain's request, astrocytes collaborate with the vasculature in real-time what the brain needs and opens its gates to let in only that bit of water and nutrients. astrocytes go to get just what the brain needs and don't let much else in,"" kim said. 
 astrocytes form a protein structure called aquaporin-4 in their membranes that are in contact with vasculature to let in and out water molecules, which also contributes to clearing waste from the brain. 
 ""in previous chips, aquaporin-4 expression was not observed. this chip was the first,"" kim said. ""this could be important in researching alzheimer's disease because aquaporin-4 is important to clearing broken-down junk protein out of the brain."" 
 one of the study's co-authors,  dr. allan levey  from emory university, a  highly cited researcher  in neurological medicine, is interested in the chip's potential in tackling alzheimer's. another,  dr. tobey mcdonald , also of emory, researches pediatric brain cancer and is interested in the chip's possibilities in studying the delivery of potential brain cancer treatments. 
 barrier acting healthy 
 astrocytes also gave signs that they were healthier in the chip's 3d cultures than in 2d cultures by expressing less of a gene triggered by pathology. 
 ""astrocytes in 2d culture expressed significantly higher levels of lcn2 than those in 3d. when we cultured in 3d, it was only about one fourth as much,"" kim said. 
 the healthier state also made astrocytes better able to show an immune reaction. 
 ""when we purposely confronted the astrocyte with pathological stress in a 3d culture, we got a clearer reaction. in 2d, the ground state was already less healthy, and then the reaction to pathological stresses did not come across so clearly. this difference could make the 3d culture very interesting for pathology studies."" 
 nanoparticle delivery 
 in testing related to drug delivery, nanoparticles moved through the blood-brain-barrier after engaging endothelial cell receptors, which caused these cells to engulf the particles then transport them to what would be inside the human brain in a natural setting. this is part of how endothelial cells worked better when connected to astrocytes cultured in 3d. 
 ""when we inhibited the receptor, the majority of nanoparticles wouldn't make it in. that kind of test would not work in animal models because of cross-species inaccuracies between animals and humans,"" kim said. ""this was an example of how this new chip can let you study the human blood-brain barrier for potential drug delivery the way you can't in animal models.""

 the key to a successful flight mission is planning - sometimes several hours of it. 
 georgia tech research institute 
 (gtri) specialists in human factors and human computer interfaces are working with navair pma-281, strike planning and execution systems in patuxent river, maryland, to streamline the current mission planning process and identify user interface requirements supporting multi-domain mission management in next-generation naval planning capabilities. 
 with guidance from the gtri researchers, the project will improve usability of the mission planning software tools, creating a more consistent and intuitive screen design that's easier to learn and more logical to follow. this effort could benefit all department of defense (dod) agencies for collaborative mission planning. 
 ""we are working with navy and marine corps aviators to identify areas in mission planning where work-flow can be streamlined, reducing the time required to mission plan,"" said marcia crosland, project director for gtri's joint mission planning system (jmps) user interface design and usability efforts. ""our task has been to define the user interface concepts and decision-making tools to help reduce the time required for mission planning. we've created detailed designs and specifications to direct current and future development of mission planning systems."" 
 mission planning needs to support the ability to collaboratively plan missions involving multiple aircraft but currently does not have that capability. the planning challenge can be quite complex, involving multiple targets, ground-based threats, different aircraft types and a variety of weapons systems. the most complex part of the process is often done by multiple pilots using whiteboards, paper, and spreadsheets to combine relevant information, consider alternatives, and reveal complicated issues. 
 information from the whiteboarding process is then entered into the software system, which produces the mission plans that go on board the aircraft. the gtri human factors team realized that supporting these whiteboarding activities in the mission planning system could accelerate the mission planning process, and they created new designs to support this functionality. 
 ""we are making recommendations for how the navy can streamline the process and move it all into the digital world to eliminate the paper and whiteboard processes,"" said crosland. ""that will allow aircrews to plan a mission more efficiently, reducing the time required and potentially highlighting places where automated decision-making tools could be brought into the process."" 
 she added: ""we tried to understand the tasks of the user and therefore how the workflow could be streamlined. from that, we designed user interfaces that better implement the tasks, and we developed a style guide to help the dod software programmers who were implementing it."" 
 at each iteration of the process, prototype interface designs were evaluated with experts. in some cases, those experts visited the gtri team in atlanta to review and discuss the designs. 
 ""we took them through each of the screens to find out what is intuitive to them and what is not,"" crosland said. ""we did this multiple times with different user groups to make sure we had a good set of interface concepts. in this work, it's critical to involve the intended users of the system."" 
 the gtri team has applied lessons learned from a variety of domains - desktop and web design, and commercial and military applications. for instance, shortening the distance between buttons on a screen, reducing the number of clicks necessary for a task, consolidating screens, and providing a consistent workflow direction make a digital system easier and faster to use - whether it's a website or mission planning system. 
 ""we want to make the system a companion for the aircrews so they consider it a partner in these critical processes,"" she added. in one case, the researchers were able to consolidate nine separate screens, each with different tabs, into a single screen. 
 ""at the root of all user interface design, whether it's web or something else, is creating a time-efficient task that is intuitive so using it takes less time and less training and creates fewer errors,"" crosland said. ""if you can cut down on errors because users understand the system, it will make the system more efficient."" 
 gtri's human systems engineering branch (hseb) has been in operation for more than 30 years to help improve the interaction between warfighters and the technologies they use. 
 ""we have significant experience in understanding the domains of mission planning and mission execution, and the components that make technology easier to use,"" crosland said. ""we use established design standards customized for a particular format, whether it's a mobile tablet or standard computer."" 
 in addition to crosland, the gtri team includes more than 20 people. the leadership component includes tommer ender, director of gtri's electronic systems laboratory (elsys); adam mccorkle and j.d. fassett, both associate directors in elsys; debra jones, head of elsys's hseb, and c.j. hutto, associate branch head for hseb. 
 the project's analysis and design team has included buddy ray, stuart michelson, andrew baranak, vlad pop, liz weldon, chandler price, courtney crooks, chris hale, mike fitzpatrick, robert kempf; technical advisor john huggins; hci graduate students catherine johnson, sarah brooks and rachel chen, undergraduate students megan eberle and spencer frum; and other gtri subject matter experts.

 - atlanta, ga 
 a humanitarian activist who advocates for a military culture free of sexual assault and violence has been named the recipient of the 2016 ivan allen jr. prize for social courage, georgia institute of technology president g.p. ""bud"" peterson announced today. nancy parrish helped launch a national movement to reform how the u.s. military prosecutes sexual violence. protect our defenders works to transform the culture of harassment and rape within the military through legal reform, advocacy, education, and free legal and case assistance for victims. parrish also co-founded the human rights watch's northern california chapter, which as part of its mission to protect human rights around the world sought to prevent the use of child soldiers. she worked with president jimmy carter and rosalynn carter in support of their international humanitarian work at the carter center. she also served as an officer of the children's guardian fund board of sarasota, which helps foster children. parrish will be honored during a symposium scheduled for feb. 18. ""ms. nancy parrish has long been at the forefront in addressing the many difficult social issues facing our country today,"" peterson said. ""here at georgia tech, we are familiar with her international humanitarian work and the many initiatives she has undertaken to help alleviate human suffering. through her exemplary efforts as founder and ceo of protect our defenders, she has given a voice to victims of sexual assault in the military. our world and our country have been greatly enriched by her selfless service."" the ivan allen jr. prize for social courage recognizes individuals who, by standing up for clear moral principles in the social arena, have positively affected public discourse at the risk of their own careers and livelihoods. parrish has been harassed and threatened because of her work on behalf of active duty service women and men, veterans and civilians who are victims of military sexual assault.

humantech-symposium-identifies-opportunities-challenges-humanities-technological.txt,"humantech symposium identifies opportunities, challenges for humanities at technological universities 
 paula m. krebs, executive director of the modern language association, spoke along with other humanities scholars. 
 paula m. krebs, foreground, executive director of the modern languages association, answers a question during the humantech symposium on humanistic perspectives at technological universities at the renaissance hotel midtown on april 19, 2019. anna stenport, chair of the school of modern languages, background, and richard utz, chair of the school of literature, media, and communication, foreground, listen.

 - atlanta, ga 
 by michael pearson 
 humanities scholars found both inspiration and shared challenges at the school of literature, media, and communication's (lmc) humantech symposium, held april 19-20, 2019. 
 the 
 symposium 
 was meant to focus the discussion about what it means to be a humanist at a technologically oriented university such as the georgia institute of technology, said 
 richard utz , chair and professor in 
 lmc . 
 ""while our participants had work experience at large research institutions, small engineering oriented colleges, and traditional universities with strong science and technology sectors, it became clear very quickly that we didn't need to switch codes to understand our most important opportunities. they were the same,"" he said. ""terms like innovation, interdisciplinarity, partnership, integration, and collaboration, were front and center among all presentations and responses."" 
 presentations and discussions also identified similar challenges, including funding disparities between the humanities and the stem fields and a traditional view from both humanities and stem-based scholars that each group is part of a separate academic world. 
 despite such challenges, paula m. krebs, executive director of the modern language association, noted during her opening address to the symposium how many tech firms and even the columbia university medical school, which offers a program in ""narrative medicine,"" are embracing the skills provided by a humanities education and applying them to technical and scientific disciplines. 
 ""if those graduates are better doctors for studying the humanities, what would a better engineer who is fully engaged in the humanities look like?"" krebs asked. 
 as it happens, they might look something like many georgia tech students, who study or intern abroad at much higher levels than the national average and half of whom voluntarily choose to study a foreign language, compared to 8 percent nationally. 
 the 
 ivan allen college of liberal arts , lmc, and the school of modern languages also are leading in the fields of language and cultural studies, as krebs noted. 
 ""georgia tech itself is a leader in connecting language and education with career possibilities at the undergraduate and graduate levels,"" she said. ""the graduate program in 
 global media and cultures , for example, is the kind of program that makes clear the career value of language study."" 
 that degree, a joint offering of 
 lmc 
 and modern languages, and also the master of science in 
 applied language and intercultural studies 
 in the school of modern languages, are both meant to give students rigorous training in communication and global leadership, preparing them for careers in international business, non-profits, media, social justice, and education. 
 other initiatives are under way at georgia tech to help prepare humanities students for interdisciplinary careers in a changing workforce. 
 lmc and modern languages also each have post-doctoral programs for recent humanities graduates. lmc's brittain fellows program seeks ph.d. graduates with an interest in ""digital pedagogy and the cultural studies of science and technology,"" while lmc's global languages, cultures, and technologies program seeks to foster collaboration across languages, technologies, and global cultures. 
 both schools, and faculty from across ivan allen college, also are actively engaged in a number of vertically integrated research (vip) research projects, meant to give undergraduate students the opportunity to participate in meaningful, often interdisciplinary, research projects. 
 such program are the product of a spirit of ""radical interdisciplinarity"" among humanities scholars at georgia tech that has allowed such programs to flourish, said 
 anna stenport , professor and chair in the school of modern languages 
 ""i am very happy and proud to be able to say that there is no crisis of the humanities at the georgia institute of technology,"" she told the symposium. 
 for utz, the symposium was just the beginning. 
 ""this symposium can only be a first step toward future additional conversations, and the school of literature, media, and communication, together with our partners, will take a lead role in continuing what we started this year,"" he said. 
 another humanities-related symposium occurred april 25-27. 
 the atlanta global studies symposium  focused on global, regional, and international studies and the united nation's sustainable development goals. discussion centered on collaboration among institutions of higher education, the public and the community, and the k-12 sector in the atlanta region and beyond through education, research, and outreach.

hydrogel-could-open-new-path-glaucoma-treatment-without-drugs-or-surgery.txt,"hydrogel could open new path for glaucoma treatment without drugs or surgery

 - atlanta, ga 
 researchers have developed a potential new treatment for the eye disease glaucoma that could replace daily eyedrops and surgery with a twice-a-year injection to control the buildup of pressure in the eye. the researchers envision the injection being done as an office procedure that could be part of regular patient visits. 
 the possible treatment, which could become the first non-drug, non-surgical, long-acting therapy for glaucoma, uses the injection of a natural and biodegradable material to create a viscous hydrogel - a water-absorbing crosslinked polymer structure - that opens an alternate pathway for excess fluid to leave the eye. 
 ""the holy grail for glaucoma is an efficient way to lower the pressure that doesn't rely on the patient putting drops in their eyes every day, doesn't require a complicated surgery, has minimal side effects, and has a good safety profile,"" said 
 ross ethier , professor and georgia research alliance lawrence l. gellerstedt jr. eminent scholar in bioengineering in the 
 wallace h. coulter department of biomedical engineering 
 at georgia tech and emory university. ""i am excited about this technique, which could be a game-changer for the treatment of glaucoma."" 
 the research, which was supported by the national eye institute and the 
 georgia research alliance , was published dec. 7 in the journal 
 advanced science . the research was conducted in animals, and shows that the approach significantly lowered the intraocular pressure. 
 as many as 75 million people worldwide have glaucoma, which is the leading cause of irreversible blindness. glaucoma damage is caused by excess pressure in the eye that injures the optic nerve. current treatments attempt to reduce this intraocular pressure through the daily application of eyedrops, or through surgery or implantation of medical devices, but these treatments are often unsuccessful. 
 to provide an alternative, ethier teamed up with 
 mark prausnitz , professor and j. erskine love jr. chair in the 
 school of chemical and biomolecular engineering 
 at georgia tech, to use a tiny hollow needle to inject a polymer preparation into a structure just below the surface of the eye called the suprachoroidal space (scs). inside the eye, the material chemically crosslinks to form the hydrogel, which holds open a channel in the scs that allows aqueous humor from within the eye to drain out of the eye through the alternative pathway. 
 there are normally two pathways for the aqueous humor fluid to leave the eye. the dominant path is through a structure known as the trabecular meshwork, which is located at the front of the eye. the lesser pathway is through the scs, which normally has only a very small gap. in glaucoma, the dominant pathway is blocked, so to lessen pressure, treatments are created to open the lesser pathway enough to let the aqueous humor flow out. 
 in this research, the hydrogel props open the scs path. a hollow microneedle less than a millimeter long is used to inject a droplet (about 50 microliters) of the hydrogel-precursor material. that gel structure can keep the scs pathway open for a period of months. 
 ""we inject a viscous material and keep it at the site of the injection at the interface between the back of the eye and the front of the eye where the suprachoroidal space begins,"" prausnitz said. ""by opening up that space, we tap a pathway that would not otherwise be utilized efficiently to remove liquid from the eye."" 
 the injection would take just a few minutes, and would involve a doctor making a small injection just below the surface of the eye in combination with numbing and cleaning the injection site. in the study, the researchers, including veterinary ophthalmologist and first author j. jeremy chae, did not observe significant inflammation resulting from the procedure. 
 the pressure reduction was sustained for four months. the researchers are now working to extend that time by modifying the polymer material - hyaluronic acid - with a goal of providing treatment benefits for at least six months. that would coincide with the office visit schedule of many patients. 
 ""if we can get to a twice-a-year treatment, we would not disrupt the current clinical process,"" prausnitz said. ""we believe the injection could be done as an office procedure during routine exams that the patients are already getting. patients may not need to do anything to treat their glaucoma until their next office visit."" 
 beyond extending the time between treatments, the researchers will need to demonstrate that the injection can be repeated without harming the eye. the procedure will also have to be tested in other animals before moving into human trials. 
 ""the idea of having a ‘one-and-done' treatment that lasts for six months would be particularly helpful for those whose access to healthcare is non-optimal,"" ethier said. ""having a long-acting therapy would have an additional advantage during times of pandemic or other disruption when access to healthcare is more difficult."" 
 this research was supported by a grant from the national eye institute (r01 ey025286) and by the georgia research alliance. any opinions, findings, and conclusions or recommendations expressed in this material are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of the funding agencies.

 hytech racing , georgia tech's student-led electric racing team, placed third overall at the formula sae electric competition hosted at michigan international speedway. the competition challenges students from around the world to engineer the best performing electric formula race car. 
 this was formula sae electric's most competitive year yet, with 58 collegiate teams. hytech's 386-pound vehicle bested teams from other world-renowned engineering universities including mcgill university, carnegie mellon university, and the university of pennsylvania. 
 ""building a fast car requires a tremendous amount of innovation,"" said brendan bassett, hytech racing president. ""members actively participated in all parts of car construction, including experimental circuitries, material characterization, and computational fluid dynamics."" 
 formula sae electric competitions are not just car races. they involve a lengthy review process to ensure complete safety and compliance. each team competes in two different types of events, static and dynamic. in static events, teams defend their vehicle costs, compete in supply chain and business case scenarios, and present and defend their designs to industry leaders. after passing all static events, team vehicles compete in the dynamic portion of the race. cars compete for the fastest time on straight-line acceleration, skidpad, autocross (single lap), and endurance lap (22-lap) events. 
 this season, hytech took on both ambitious design targets and an aggressive project schedule. students from different disciplines cooperated to find creative solutions on a tight timeline. 
 ""our members put in countless long nights debugging and interfacing the vehicle's subsystems in the student competition center and at the mrdc parking lot,"" said bassett. ""in the end, the team was able to produce a fundamentally competitive vehicle that delivered winning track times consistently."" 
 next year, with the ever-evolving level of competition, the team will pivot to a four-wheel hub motor powertrain architecture, said david knight, incoming chief engineer for the 2022-23 academic year. ""this quantum leap in design complexity is necessary in order to unlock the full performance envelope of an electric race car.""

imaging-technology-could-unlock-mysteries-childhood-disease.txt,"imaging technology could unlock mysteries of a childhood disease 
 scientists have developed a new technique for studying rsv, a common childhood illness. 
 this microscope image shows a cell infected with rsv. the rna tagged by the probe is shown in red, while the nucleoprotein is green. (image courtesy of eric alonas and philip santangelo) 
 dec 30, 2013 
 - atlanta, ga 
 by the time they're two, most children have had respiratory syncytial virus (rsv) and suffered symptoms no worse than a bad cold. but for some children, especially premature babies and those with underlying health conditions, rsv can lead to pneumonia and bronchitis - which can require hospitalization and have long-term consequences. a new technique for studying the structure of the rsv virion and the activity of rsv in living cells could help researchers unlock the secrets of the virus, including how it enters cells, how it replicates, how many genomes it inserts into its hosts - and perhaps why certain lung cells escape the infection relatively unscathed. that could provide scientists information they need to develop new antiviral drugs and perhaps even a vaccine to prevent severe rsv infections. ""we want to develop tools that would allow us to get at how the virus really works,"" said 
 philip santangelo , an associate professor in the 
 wallace h. coulter department of biomedical engineering at georgia tech and emory university . ""we really need to be able to follow the infection in a single living cell without affecting how the virus infects its hosts, and this technology should allow us to do that."" the research was supported by the national institutes of health's national institute of general medical sciences and published online ahead of print in the journal 
 acs nano 
 on december 30, 2013. while rsv will be the first target for the work, the researchers believe the imaging technique they developed could be used to study other rna viruses, including influenza and ebola. ""we've shown that we can tag the genome using our probes,"" explained santangelo. ""what we've learned from this is that the genome does get incorporated into the virion, and that the virus particles created are infectious. we were able to characterize some aspects of the virus particle itself at super-resolution, down to 20 nanometers, using direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dstorm) imaging."" rsv can be difficult to study. for one thing, the infectious particle can take different forms, ranging from 10-micron filaments to ordinary spheres. the virus can insert more than one genome into the host cells and the rna orientation and structure are disordered, which makes it difficult to characterize. the research team, which included scientists from vanderbilt university and emory university, used a probe technology that quickly attaches to rna within cells. the probe uses multiple fluorophores to indicate the presence of the viral rna, allowing the researchers to see where it goes in host cells - and to watch as infectious particles leave the cells to spread the infection. ""being able to see the genome and the progeny rna that comes from the genome with the probes we use really give us much more insight into the replication cycle,"" santangelo said. ""this gives us much more information about what the virus is really doing. if we can visualize the entry, assembly and replication of the virus, that would allow us to decide what to go after to fight the virus."" the research depended on a new method for labelling rna viruses using multiply-labeled tetravalent rna imaging probes (mtrips). the probes consist of a chimeric combination of dna and rna oligonucleotide labeled internally with fluorophores tetravelently complexed to neutravidin. the chimeric combination was used to help the probes evade cellular defenses. ""there are lots of sensors in the cell that look for foreign rna and foreign dna, but to the cell, this probe doesn't look like anything,"" santangelo explained. ""the cell doesn't see the nucleic acid as foreign."" introduced into cells, the probes quickly diffuse through a cell infected with rsv and bind to the virus's rna. though binding tightly, the probe doesn't affect the normal activities of the virus and allows researchers to follow the activity for days using standard microscopy techniques. the mtrips can be used to complement other probe technology, such as gfp and gold nanoparticles. work done by graduate student eric alonas to concentrate the virus was essential to the project, santangelo said. the concentration had to be done without adversely affecting the infectivity of the virus, which would have impacted its ability to enter host cells. ""it took quite a bit of work to get the right techniques to concentrate the rsv,"" he said. ""now we can make lots of infectious virus that's labelled and can be stored so we can use it when we want to."" to study the infection's progress in individual cells, the researchers faced another challenge: living cells move around, and following them complicates the research. to address that movement, the laboratory of thomas barker - also in the coulter department - used micro-patterned fibronectin on glass to create 50-micron ""islands"" that contained the cells during the study. among the mysteries that the researchers would like to tackle is why certain lung cells are severely infected - while others appear to escape ill effects. ""if you look at a field of cells, you see huge differences from cell to cell, and that is something that's not understood at all,"" santangelo said. ""if we can figure out why some cells are exploding with virus while others are not, perhaps we can figure out a way to help the bad ones look more like the good ones."" in addition to those already mentioned, the research team included james crowe, professor of pediatrics at vanderbilt university; elizabeth wright, assistant professor in the school of medicine at emory university; daryll vanover, jeenah jung, chiara zurla, jonathan kirschman, vincent fiore, and alison douglas from the wallace h. coulter department of biomedical engineering at georgia tech and emory university; aaron lifland and manasa gudheti from vutara inc. in salt lake city, and hong yi from the emory university school of medicine. one of the challenges of studying rsv is maintaining its activity in the laboratory setting - a problem parents of young children don't share. ""when you handle this virus in the lab, you have to always be careful about it losing infectivity,"" santangelo noted. ""but if you take a room full of children who have not been infected and let one infected child into the room, 15 minutes later all of the children will be infected."" the research described here was supported by the national institute of general medical sciences of the national institutes of health under contract r01 gm094198-01. any conclusions or opinions expressed are those of the authors and do not necessarily represent the official views of the nih. citation : eric alonas, et al., ""combining single rna sensitive probes with subdiffraction-limited and live-cell imaging enables the characterization of virus dynamics in cells,"" (acs nano, december 2013).

 children's healthcare of atlanta and the georgia institute of technology announce a $5 million grant from the imlay foundation to children's healthcare of atlanta for the development of pediatric therapies. the single largest grant made by the imlay foundation in its 25-year history, this commitment establishes the imlay innovation fund at children's to advance collaboration between georgia tech and children's pediatric innovation and discovery efforts. 
 the research partnership with georgia tech is called the children's healthcare of atlanta pediatric technology center. the collaborative research fostered through this partnership brings together clinicians from children's, academic scientists from emory university and engineers from georgia tech to solve important problems in pediatrics and develop technological solutions for improving the health of children. with the formation of the children's pediatric technology center, children's and georgia tech are providing extraordinary opportunities for interdisciplinary collaboration in pediatrics, creating breakthrough discoveries that often can only be found at the intersection of multiple disciplines. 
 ""it is through generous philanthropy that we are able to foster these alliances that help enhance the lives of children,"" said donna hyland, president and ceo, children's. ""mary ellen and her late husband, john, have demonstrated their love and appreciation of children's and georgia tech in a myriad of ways over the years through their volunteerism, board leadership and philanthropy. this grant furthers their deep commitment to children's and georgia tech."" 
 the grant will help fund two collaborative programs, including quick wins, a novel program that allows children's clinicians and clinical administrative leaders to bring problems that impact care delivery to the attention of scientists and engineers at georgia tech to help develop technology-based solutions to improve pediatric health care. the funds will also support a program to help bridge the gap following proof to concept, giving investigators the ability to collect data, complete further proof-of-concept studies or produce prototypes for testing in order to advance a solution to the next stage of development. 
 ""the grant decision was met with unanimous and enthusiastic approval from the imlay foundation board,"" said mary ellen imlay, a longtime children's foundation trustee. ""we could not think of a more meaningful way to honor john and further his legacy at both children's and his alma mater, georgia tech."" 
 ""this generous grant serves as a powerful affirmation of the great partnership between children's healthcare of atlanta and georgia tech,"" said georgia tech president g. p. ""bud"" peterson.  ""we continue to collaborate with children's in numerous areas and are excited about the potential impact on pediatric medicine.""

 a new initiative known as impax is transferring technology into the navy. 
 rob ""radar"" winston, the gtri principal research engineer who directs the impax program, discusses how the initiative will serve the naval air warfare center - aircraft division. (credit: branden camp, georgia tech) 
 dec 06, 2017 
 - atlanta, ga 
 what if you had to wait eight years to get the great new cellphone technology your friends and neighbors were using today? that's essentially the situation facing today's warfighters, who must wait for long procurement cycles to bring them the latest technology. 
 the u.s. naval air systems command (navair), naval air warfare center - aircraft division (nawcad) and the 
 georgia tech research institute 
 (gtri) are working to address that challenge through a new effort - dubbed 
 impax 
 (innovation and modernization patuxent river) - that aims to accelerate the transfer of new technology to meet u.s. navy and u.s. marine corps needs. impax staff members are empowered to work outside the standard acquisition process to find, develop, and prototype new technology more quickly. 
 impax was launched in 2017 as an initiative of rear admiral mark darrah, program executive officer for unmanned aviation and strike weapons at navair, by working closely with the technology transfer office at nawcad. the first initiative with the navy is to identify technology that will help integrate unmanned aerial vehicles into air control systems by providing miniaturized identification friend or foe (iff) systems. iff systems are already used in piloted aircraft, but the much smaller unmanned aircraft lack the space or power for conventional systems. 
 ""traditionally the department of defense (dod) has been limited in the means and speed at which it could bring new technologies to the warfighter,"" said rob ""radar"" winston, a gtri principal research engineer who directs the impax program near pax river naval air station in maryland. ""our adversaries aren't constrained by cumbersome procurement rules and regulations. through this effort, we want to ensure that our nation's warfighters get the best technology in the shortest time."" 
 impax is empowered to seek out technology from sources the government doesn't usually work with. these can include small- and medium-sized businesses, companies that don't traditionally work with the military or bid on billion-dollar dod procurements. winston and his team work on the navy's behalf, matching warfighter needs with technology that may already exist - or that can be developed to meet the needs. 
 the relationship between gtri and navair's naval air warfare center aircraft division (nawcad) is known as a partnership intermediary agreement (pia). such agreements allow non-federal government intermediaries to coordinate and solicit non-traditional science and technology sources and to bring forth ideas from parties not usually able to contribute directly to military solutions. 
 ""this is the first pia specifically designed for the navy to spin technology into naval aviation,"" winston explained. ""we are looking for technology in industry, academia, and other government agencies that can be brought into the dod very rapidly. if somebody is already working on something that the navy needs, we can bring them together quickly. we are not just working for the government, but as a team member on the government's behalf as a trusted partner."" 
 in one aspect, impax team members will serve as technology scouts, scouring many sources of information to locate technologies of interest. they'll be readily approachable, and won't require extensive paperwork from companies and others wanting to pitch their technology for potential military applications. the overall activities will be directed by a joint gtri / nawcad / navair team. 
 ""if an individual or company has a great idea but they have never worked with the government before, that barrier to entry is very tall now,"" he said. ""they don't know who to talk with, how to get involved in a program, or even how to get through the front gate of a military facility. we are going to be able to talk with these people to assess what they can contribute to the warfighter and do it all outside the gate and without the customary barriers."" 
 dod agencies have their own research laboratories to help develop new technology, of course, but winston's group will tap other sources of innovation. for technology that's promising but not quite ready for dod use, impax will fund brief research and development (r&d) initiatives - as short as three or four months - to determine whether a technology is worth pursuing. pathways from there could include the traditional agency r&d laboratories. 
 ""the purpose is to run these programs very quickly, and also to fail things fast with a minimum of investment in resources or time if they aren't working out,"" he said. ""we can start a technology development program at any time, and it can be any technology of interest to the fleet."" 
 each technology development program will be monitored by a subject matter expert and a director from gtri. they will keep a close eye on program progress, help faltering ones, shut down ones that aren't making progress or add team members and expertise to promising ones. 
 the impax team will also be able to assemble packages of different technologies to meet specific needs, efforts known as mash-ups. 
 ""traditional programs do little to encourage the collision of ideas between different organizations, people, and technologies,"" winston said. ""we're here to help companies and organization work together to address the need with minimal barriers to innovation."" 
 the impax initiative won't change how major weapons systems are acquired, but could affect how those systems are updated over time to retain their effectiveness as new technologies rapidly enter the marketplace. 
 ""impax is going to enable technology that will keep these big platforms operationally relevant over a longer period of time,"" winston explained. 
 the iff capability for unmanned systems is just one example of an ongoing impax project. another initiative is looking at the use of augmented reality to support maintenance and training programs. by combining 3-d computer-aided design files with mixed reality glasses, the technology could help maintainers identify a problem, locate components hidden within an aircraft, and train new personnel more quickly. 
 ""technology already exists for these projects, but it would take a long time to actually get them to the fleet using traditional acquisition timelines,"" said winston. ""we can help develop the capability, get it to the navy who can then get it out to the warfighter quickly. we'll run as fast as we can with a project and give our warfighters the edge by getting the latest technology to them - today.""

 georgia tech leaders hosted h.e. taranjit singh sandhu, india's ambassador to the united states, last week for a session that included a tour of parts of campus and discussion of ways the hosts and visitors might collaborate on research and other opportunities. 
 sandhu, who was joined by swati vijay kulkarni, consul general of india, spent time with tech leaders, including executive vice president for research, chaouki abdallah; provost steve mclaughlin; julia kubanek, vice president for interdisciplinary research; sivakumar raghupathy, interim chief commercialization officer and chair and professor in the school of electrical and computer engineering; and devesh ranjan, associate chair for research and professor in the george w. woodruff school of mechanical engineering. 
 the group toured the kendeda building for innovative sustainable design and the ecocommons before meeting with faculty members and graduate students to talk about the united nations sustainable goals and the connection between technology, healthcare, and social sciences. 
 devesh invited the ambassador to campus, in part, because india and tech share a strong source of talent in the form of students and faculty, and an interest in working together on research that matters. 
 ""india just launched a new national education policy in 2020,"" ranjan said. ""educational partnership can increasingly play an important role in strengthening ties between the u.s. and india.""

 the next invention to make flying more enjoyable could be found in technology square. 
 delta is working with georgia tech students to develop innovative ways to improve overall operations and the customer experience. 
 through delta's global innovation center, called the hangar, teams redesigned food and beverage carts to maximize storage space in the galleys. they developed a program to allow customers to pre-select on-board meals on some flights, guaranteeing their preferred entrée will be available. additional projects explore how to incorporate drones, autonomous vehicles and other forms of disruptive technology. 
 delta opened the doors to the hangar tuesday to showcase some solutions developed over the past year. 
 ""for us, it's really about a vehicle and a new channel to innovate,"" said gil west, delta's chief operating officer. ""we've got our normal channels within delta to work and innovate, which do a great job … this gives us an agile type of development and innovation center that we're able to test ideas and fail and experiment."" 
 the hangar is one of 16 corporate innovation centers in tech square. georgia tech president g.p. ""bud"" peterson said these centers allow larger companies to access the institute's talent and technologies, while also collaborating with the area's startup community. 
 ""the ecosystem that bud and georgia tech have created here is just really powerful,"" west said. 
 a key part of that ecosystem is students like veronica young. young, a senior majoring in industrial design, works in the center as a customer experience designer. she goes through each part of the customer experience with delta and looks at how to make it better for the customer, as well as employees. 
 she's currently working on a project tied to the check-in process for the delta sky club and flew up and down the east coast, visiting different sky clubs. 
 ""i absolutely love my job,"" said young, who is graduating saturday and has been offered a full-time position with delta. ""you are not treated like an intern because you are part of the team. they trust us to lead projects and figure it out."" 
 while the innovation centers generate solutions for existing real-world challenges, they also identify potential future disrupters that will be need to be addressed. 
 as companies like delta look for solutions to current and future problems, it's natural that they turn to georgia tech for help, peterson said. 
 ""we've got a bunch of really smart people that are looking for problems and delta is looking for solutions,"" he said. ""this allows us to marry those problems with solutions.""

 georgia tech researchers are improving the strength and modulus of carbon fibers.

 jul 22, 2015 
 - atlanta, ga 
 carbon fibers are stronger and lighter than steel, and composite materials based on carbon-fiber-reinforced polymers are being used in an expanding range of aerospace, automotive, and other applications - including major sections of the boeing 787 aircraft. it's widely believed, moreover, that carbon-fiber technology has the potential to produce composites at least 10 times stronger than those in use today. a research team at the georgia institute of technology has developed a novel technique that sets a new milestone for the strength and modulus of carbon fibers. this alternative approach is based on an innovative technique for spinning polyacrylonitrile (pan), an organic polymer resin used to make carbon fibers. the work is part of a four-year, $9.8 million project sponsored by the defense advanced research projects agency (darpa) to improve the strength of carbon-fiber materials. the research was reported recently in the journal 
 carbon . ""by using a gel-spinning technique to process polyacrylonitrile copolymer into carbon fibers, we have developed next-generation carbon fibers that exhibit a combination of strength and modulus not seen previously with the conventional solution-spun method,"" said satish kumar, a professor in the georgia tech school of materials science and engineering who leads the project. ""in addition, our work shows that the gel-spinning approach provides a pathway for even greater improvements."" kumar explained that tensile modulus - a measure of stiffness -- refers to the force needed to stretch a material by a given amount. tensile strength expresses how much force is required to actually break the material. in gel spinning, the solution is first converted to a gel; this technique binds polymer chains together and produces robust inter-chain forces that increase tensile strength. gel spinning also increases directional orientation of fibers, which also augments strength. by contrast, in conventional solution spinning, a process developed more than 60 years ago, pan co-polymer solution is directly converted to a solid fiber without the intermediate gel state and produces less-robust material. the gel-spun carbon fiber produced by kumar's team was tested at 5.5 to 5.8 gigapascals (gpa) - a measure of ultimate tensile strength - and had a tensile modulus in the 354-375 gpa range. the material was produced on a continuous carbonization line at georgia tech that was constructed for this darpa project. ""this is the highest combination of strength and modulus for any continuous fiber reported to-date,"" kumar said. ""and at short gauge length, fiber tensile strength was measured as high as 12.1 gpa, which is the highest tensile-strength value ever reported for a pan-based carbon fiber."" moreover, kumar noted, the internal structure of these gel-spun carbon fibers measured at the nanoscale showed fewer imperfections than state-of-the-art commercial carbon fibers, such as im7. specifically, the gel-spun fibers display a lower degree of polymer-chain entanglements than those produced by solution spinning. this smaller number of entanglements results from the fact that gel spinning uses lower concentrations of polymer than solution-spinning methods. kumar and his team convert the gel-spun polymer mix into carbon fibers via a selective treatment process called pyrolysis, in which the spun polymer is gradually subjected to both heat and stretching. this technique eliminates large quantities of hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen from the polymer, leaving mostly strength-increasing carbon. ""it's important to remember that the current performance of solution-spun pan-based carbon fibers has been achieved after many years of material and process optimization - yet very limited material and process optimization studies have been carried out to date on the gel-spun pan fiber,"" kumar said. ""in the future, we believe that materials and process optimization, enhanced fiber circularity, and increased solution homogeneity will further increase the strength and modulus of the gel-spinning method."" citation : satish kumar et al, ""high strength and high modulus carbon fibers,"" (carbon, 2015). carbon, 93, 81-87 (2015).   research news georgia institute of technology 177 north avenue atlanta, georgia 30332-0181 usa media relations contact : john toon (404-894-6986) ( jtoon@gatech.edu ). writer : rick robinson

 georgia tech is set to embark on a new quality enhancement plan (qep) and is seeking input and topic ideas from all faculty, staff, and students. qep topic selection is a key part of the institute's reaffirmation of accreditation with the southern association of colleges and schools commission on colleges (sacscoc), scheduled for 2025. 
 as outlined by sacscoc, the qep is a carefully designed course of action that addresses a well-defined topic or issue related to enhancing student learning and student success. georgia tech's next qep topic will be tied closely to the transformative teaching and learning goals identified in the 
 institute's strategic plan . 
 ""the reaccreditation process ensures academic quality, accountability, and continuous improvement - areas that align closely with our strategic goals and values,"" said steve mclaughlin, provost and executive vice president for academic affairs. ""the qep is not only a required part of that process, but it is also an incredible opportunity for us to work together to create new ways to serve our students and our community and continue to realize our strategic plan."" 
 a qep topic selection committee was appointed by mclaughlin in october, and is co-chaired by laurence jacobs, senior vice provost for education and learning, and steven girardot, vice provost for undergraduate education. the committee will host open town halls to receive input, feedback, and ideas from georgia tech faculty, staff, and students. 
 town hall schedule

 9 - 10 a.m. 
 peachtree room, john lewis student center 
 tuesday, jan. 17 
 2 - 3 p.m. 
 peachtree room, john lewis student center 
 ""our transformative teaching and learning strategic goals emerged from more than 5,700 unique perspectives and voices from georgia tech students, faculty, staff, and stakeholders who contributed during the visioning phase of the institute's strategic plan,"" jacobs said.  ""we are eager to hear from our community now about how we can build on those goals in our next qep and create tangible, new outcomes in the educational experiences of our students."" 
 the final qep topic will be shared widely with the georgia tech community in spring 2023. a qep development and implementation committee will then be formed to draft the new qep plan for submission to sacscoc. 
 ""our past qeps, which created the undergraduate research opportunities program, international plan, and serve-learn-sustain (sls), have demonstrated the potential of a qep to create transformative learning experiences inside and outside of the classroom,"" girardot said. ""our next qep will build on this successful track record of enhancing student success."" 
 georgia tech received a commendation from sacscoc president belle s. wheelan ""for the exceptional execution"" of its most recent qep, 
 serve-learn-sustain (sls) , in fall 2021. sls, an ongoing, campuswide academic initiative working with all six colleges, offers students opportunities to collaborate with diverse partners on key sustainability challenges. wheelan praised sls as a ""model of how a qep can transform an academic culture.""

 what started as a simple errand to deposit a check at a bank drive-through became the kind of ""aha"" moment found mostly in books and movies. 
 georgia tech researchers had been working on an idea to simplify traditional direct air capture (dac) systems. their approach used ambient wind flow to draw air across a new kind of coated carbon fiber to grab co2. that would eliminate the loud fans used in many systems. and the carbon fiber strands could be quickly heated to release the captured carbon dioxide with minimal heat loss, boosting efficiency. 
 but they were struggling with how to deploy these new sorbent-coated carbon fibers for maximum effect.

 ryan lively , thomas c. deloach professor in georgia tech's

 - atlanta, ga 
 implantation of a stent-like flow diverter can offer one option for less invasive treatment of brain aneurysms - bulges in blood vessels - but the procedure requires frequent monitoring while the vessels heal. now, a multi-university research team has demonstrated proof-of-concept for a highly flexible and stretchable sensor that could be integrated with the flow diverter to monitor hemodynamics in a blood vessel without costly diagnostic procedures. 
 the sensor, which uses capacitance changes to measure blood flow, could reduce the need for testing to monitor the flow through the diverter. researchers, led by georgia tech, have shown that the sensor accurately measures fluid flow in animal blood vessels in vitro, and are working on the next challenge: wireless operation that could allow in vivo testing. 
 the research was reported july 18 in the journal

 and was supported by multiple grants from georgia tech's institute for electronics and nanotechnology, the university of pittsburgh and the korea institute of materials science. 
 ""the nanostructured sensor system could provide advantages for patients, including a less invasive aneurysm treatment and an active monitoring capability,"" said 
 woon-hong yeo , an assistant professor in georgia tech's 
 george w. woodruff school of mechanical engineering 
 and 
 wallace h. coulter department of biomedical engineering at georgia tech and emory university . ""the integrated system could provide active monitoring of hemodynamics after surgery, allowing the doctor to follow up with quantitative measurement of how well the flow diverter is working in the treatment."" 
 cerebral aneurysms occur in up to five percent of the population, with each aneurysm carrying a one percent risk per year of rupturing, noted youngjae chun, an associate professor in the swanson school of engineering at the university of pittsburgh. aneurysm rupture will cause death in up to half of affected patients. 
 endovascular therapy using platinum coils to fill the aneurysm sac has become the standard of care for most aneurysms, but recently a new endovascular approach - a flow diverter - has been developed to treat cerebral aneurysms. flow diversion involves placing a porous stent across the neck of an aneurysm to redirect flow away from the sac, generating local blood clots within the sac. 
 ""we have developed a highly stretchable, hyper-elastic flow diverter using a highly-porous thin film nitinol,"" chun explained. ""none of the existing flow diverters, however, provide quantitative, real-time monitoring of hemodynamics within the sac of cerebral aneurysm. through the collaboration with dr. yeo's group at georgia tech, we have developed a smart flow-diverter system that can actively monitor the flow alterations during and after surgery."" 
 repairing the damaged artery takes months or even years, during which the flow diverter must be monitored using mri and angiogram technology, which is costly and involves injection of a magnetic dye into the blood stream. yeo and his colleagues hope their sensor could provide simpler monitoring in a doctor's office using a wireless inductive coil to send electromagnetic energy through the sensor. by measuring how the energy's resonant frequency changes as it passes through the sensor, the system could measure blood flow changes into the sac. 
 ""we are trying to develop a batteryless, wireless device that is extremely stretchable and flexible that can be miniaturized enough to be routed through the tiny and complex blood vessels of the brain and then deployed without damage,"" said yeo. ""it's a very challenging to insert such electronic system into the brain's narrow and contoured blood vessels."" 
 the sensor uses a micro-membrane made of two metal layers surrounding a dielectric material, and wraps around the flow diverter. the device is just a few hundred nanometers thick, and is produced using nanofabrication and material transfer printing techniques, encapsulated in a soft elastomeric material. 
 ""the membrane is deflected by the flow through the diverter, and depending on the strength of the flow, the velocity difference, the amount of deflection changes,"" yeo explained. ""we measure the amount of deflection based on the capacitance change, because the capacitance is inversely proportional to the distance between two metal layers."" 
 because the brain's blood vessels are so small, the flow diverters can be no more than five to ten millimeters long and a few millimeters in diameter. that rules out the use of conventional sensors with rigid and bulky electronic circuits. 
 ""putting functional materials and circuits into something that size is pretty much impossible right now,"" yeo said. ""what we are doing is very challenging based on conventional materials and design strategies."" 
 the researchers tested three materials for their sensors: gold, magnesium and the nickel-titanium alloy known as nitinol. all can be safely used in the body, but magnesium offers the potential to be dissolved into the bloodstream after it is no longer needed. 
 the proof-of-principle sensor was connected to a guide wire in the in vitro testing, but yeo and his colleagues are now working on a wireless version that could be implanted in a living animal model. while implantable sensors are being used clinically to monitor abdominal blood vessels, application in the brain creates significant challenges. 
 ""the sensor has to be completely compressed for placement, so it must be capable of stretching 300 or 400 percent,"" said yeo. ""the sensor structure has to be able to endure that kind of handling while being conformable and bending to fit inside the blood vessel.""

 in conjunction with an 
 event at the white house tuesday , intel and the georgia institute of technology announced an enhanced partnership to produce a more diverse, qualified workforce for the technology industry. intel is investing $5 million in georgia tech over five years to build a pipeline of underrepresented engineers and computer scientists. the intel diversity scholars program will recruit and retain underrepresented minority students to stem (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) majors and prepare them for graduate school. the effort is anticipated to benefit about 1,000 students over five years through mentoring, scholarships and professional development workshops. earlier this year, intel announced a new goal: to achieve full representation of underrepresented minorities and women by the year 2020 in its u.s. workforce, along with a $300 million diversity in technology initiative to help build a workforce pipeline. ""filling the tech industry pipeline with diverse students is critical to increasing the number of diverse engineers and computer scientists in the field,"" said rosalind hudnell, vice president of human resources and chief diversity officer at intel. ""the goal of this program is to inspire and support more women and underrepresented minorities to earn technical degrees so we can hire them down the road - we want to foster those future tech innovators.""   georgia tech is a leading producer of women and minority stem graduates and graduates nearly 10 percent of all african-american ph.d. engineers in the nation. ""it is a national imperative that the u.s. continue to enhance the engagement of students of all backgrounds in stem fields to create a more robust economy,"" said gary may, dean and southern company chair in the college of engineering at georgia tech. ""the higher education and private sectors must combine forces to achieve the impact that is necessary. as a national leader in producing outstanding underrepresented engineering graduates, georgia tech is pleased to partner with intel in this transformative initiative."" the gift will expand several georgia tech initiatives already underway, including: summer engineering institute . the three-week summer engineering institute hosts rising 11 th - and 12 th -graders from around the country. students learn basic engineering and computer science techniques and gain hands-on experience through working in teams to solve real-world engineering problems. rise . retaining inspirational scholars in technology and engineering (rise) provides financial support to talented underrepresented minority and non-traditional students. the intel diversity scholars program would provide scholarships, with priority going to those whose majors align with intel's interests: electrical engineering, computer science and computer engineering. peer-2-peer mentoring . this program provides specialized guidance and support to undergraduate students majoring in stem, while also helping them adjust to the climate and culture at georgia tech. mentors and mentees develop leadership, communication and networking skills. sure . summer undergraduate research in engineering (sure) is a 10-week research program to attract qualified minority students from across the country into graduate school in the fields of engineering and science. in addition to conducting research, participants receive mentoring from faculty and graduate students and participate in professional development and technical seminars. focus . this program invites college juniors and seniors from around the country to attend a three-day event designed to raise awareness of graduate education among underrepresented students. participants learn about financial resources, visit research laboratories, network with other scholars and receive help with the graduate school application process. the intel and georgia tech program was announced in conjunction with the first-ever white house demo day, which celebrates the important role entrepreneurship plays in america's economy. unlike a private-sector demo day, where entrepreneurs and startups pitch their ideas to funders, the new event invites innovators from around the country to ""demo"" their individual stories in washington, d.c.

 the low-cost neonatal incubator project has been championed by three passionate interdisciplinary senior design teams for consecutive semesters. 
 interdisciplinary senior design teams create a low-cost infant incubator 
 aug 18, 2021 
 - atlanta, ga 
 ghana has one of the highest neonatal mortality rates in west africa largely due to preterm birth complications. many of these deaths could be prevented with access to incubators to regulate infants' body temperatures. unfortunately, contemporary western incubators are expensive and difficult to repair and maintain. this challenge and a chance meeting between a ghanaian doctor and a faculty member in the georgia tech school of electrical and computer engineering (ece) has resulted in a multi-semester senior design project that has inspired students in multiple majors. 
 the low-cost neonatal incubator project has been championed by three passionate interdisciplinary senior design teams for consecutive semesters. the project was identified during the autumn of 2019 when dr. william okyere-frempong, a physician and superintendent of a hospital in accra, ghana, visited atlanta during the 2019-2020 academic year as a participant in the hubert h. humphrey fellowship program locally hosted through emory university. 
 dr. whit smith of the school of ece met the doctor at his church. when taking dr. okyere-frempong out to dinner shortly following, smith asked him if he needed anything during his stay. 
 ""i was thinking of groceries or recommendations of things to do in atlanta,"" said smith. 
 dr. okyere-frempong quickly began listing a variety of requests for his hospital. one of the most critical needs was for incubators used to maintain infants' body temperatures. many african medical facilities have acquired a variety of contemporary western incubators over the years, but once they failed, they were permanently unavailable. these fancy, high-end incubators with a multitude of features and a price tag to match, were abandoned in warehouses either because replacement parts were too expensive, or technicians did not have the ability to repair them. 
 at the time, the hospital had no working incubators at all. the medical staff was forced to use the traditional solution of wrapping babies in blankets and holding them tightly for warmth. what was needed, dr. okyere-frempong explained, was a device that could be inexpensively manufactured and maintained in ghana. the incubators need not be elaborate. they simply needed to do one thing and do it well-as the doctor said in their initial discussion, ""keep the baby warm."" 
 smith recognized that this would be a perfect project for the students in the ece and interdisciplinary senior design courses he helps orchestrate. ece senior design is a course sequence satisfying the capstone design requirement for electrical and computer engineering majors and provides senior students with the opportunity to address and solve open-ended design problems. working in teams, students complete a project requiring an accepted and formal written proposal including demonstrable technical specifications, public presentations, and appropriate documentation. projects must include knowledge and skills acquired in earlier coursework and incorporate appropriate engineering standards and multiple realistic constraints. every engineering program at georgia tech requires senior design which provides ample opportunities for interdisciplinary teams to form and bring their individual skills and interests to a project. 
 the project progressed over three semesters: spring 2020, fall 2021, and spring 2021. four different majors were represented: biomedical, computer, electrical, and mechanical engineering. noah daugherty, an electrical engineering major, was one of five students on the first senior design team in spring 2020. 
 ""we all fell in love with the project because we had the opportunity to make a huge humanitarian impact. because we were such a well-rounded interdisciplinary team, we had the confidence that we could come up with a solution,"" said daugherty. 
 daugherty especially appreciated the opportunity to work directly with clinical practitioners. regular video calls with dr. okyere-frempong and his team of ghanaian fabricators and engineers gave students the opportunity to adjust their design based on end-user feedback. 
 in addition to safely regulating the baby's body temperature and being manufactured and maintained in ghana, students identified other customer requirements. these were ranked based on constraints and customer needs to identify a set of detailed engineering design specifications. additional specifications that the team incorporated included mandatory sterilization of the incubator and its components, clear visibility of and easy access to the baby, an inclined bed for acid reflux, an analog heating system with built-in safety shut-off, an intuitive user interface which facilitated monitoring the baby's vital signs, and the ability to work with a backup power source. 
 to reduce costs and enable local fabrication, the teams identified generic automotive and desktop computer components commonly available in ghana including fuses, relays, power supplies, fans, and motors. although an embedded computer which consisted of an open-source raspberry pi running open-source python (both available and familiar to the ghanaian technical communities) was included to make a display monitor and future expansion possible, a primary design constraint was that the thermal regulation function did not require a working computer and be repairable with only a simple voltmeter using intuitive and open documentation. 
 each team built on the previous team's work. the spring 2020 group set the groundwork with customer interviews and a thorough understanding of the challenge at hand. their final deliverables included an analysis of the thermal subsystem, a mechanical design in cad, a plan for the electrical control system, and a model of their design. the fall 2020 team conducted thermal analysis experiments and physical tests on the structure. 
 so many students wanted to work on the project by the spring 2021 semester, smith allowed a total of 18 students divided into three subgroups to participate-two ece teams and one mechanical engineering team. each subgroup handled different aspects of the project (e.g., electronics, mechanical, power) and collaborated to integrate their parts into the whole. using the previous semesters' prototypes and thermal tests as a start, the spring 2021 team built and tested a full system prototype including documentation. 
 throughout all three semesters, dr. okyere-frempong's simple request ""to keep the baby warm"" became a catchphrase of sorts and a mantra that students repeated through the project milestones. 
 computer engineering major alton stovall, who worked on the project this past fall, recalls how the teams had to shift their mindsets to accomplish their goals. 
 ""as engineering students, we are trained to make things smaller, faster, cheaper, more powerful, and with tons of features. with this project it was the complete opposite. we had to break it down to the simplest components,"" said stovall. 
 whenever someone strayed from the key criteria for the project or said, ""wouldn't it be neat if we added this?"" they were quickly reminded to dial it back by someone else who replied, ""just keep the baby warm!"" 
 even with strong interdisciplinary credentials and a healthy dose of passion, the teams could not have prepared for one major roadblock: covid-19. the pandemic threw each of the teams a significant curve ball and impacted them in different ways. 
 sourcing acrylic (plexiglas), a major component of the incubator design, became a challenge as the world ramped up their health and safety protocols and began using this material as a barrier in public spaces. the major structural components of the incubator design went from affordable and readily available to expensive and difficult to find. 
 the logistics of working with interdisciplinary teams on a device created for a client on another continent became even more complex as the world quickly began shutting down in the middle of march 2020. daugherty recalls going home for spring break and receiving an email from georgia tech instructing him not to come back to campus. his team of five had to figure out how to keep progressing on the project remotely. 
 ""the end goal had to change significantly. the project turned into a feasibility study and a rough prototype,"" said daugherty. 
 the stakes were even higher for the spring 2021 team. during the semester, one of the team members tested positive for covid-19. all the teammates who had direct contact with that person went into quarantine. during an already hectic point in the project, the team had to come together in crisis mode and figure out a plan in a matter of hours. 
 ""that's where we really began to see the strength of the team. people who were done with their part said, ‘hey, i can solder this. i can wire this.' those teammates who weren't in quarantine picked up the slack and worked into the night to help us all pull it off,"" said stovall. 
 most students heave a sigh of relief after finishing their senior design project. it symbolizes the culmination of their undergraduate career and is a notoriously stressful finale to their last week of classes. but for many students, the incubator project became much more than one last hurdle before graduation. in fact, some members of the spring 2021 team are choosing to continue working on the project for special problems credit during fall 2021 along with new senior design students. 
 one of those continuing students is electrical engineering major breanna ivey, a co-lead on the analog subsystem this past fall and who was also responsible for documentation, photography, and the final project video. 
 ""yes, georgia tech has me for one more semester,"" said ivey. ""i'm really grateful to dr. smith for letting so many students work on this project. the fact that he is creating a course for those of us who are still students and don't want to stop is amazing."" 
 for those continuing with the project, considered tasks include making the mechanical enclosure sturdier and more attractive; redesigning the heating system with a blower and circuit board that is easier to manufacture in ghana; and making more complete documentation including assembly, user, and troubleshooting manuals.  and facing the temptation of ""feature creep"", the students will not forget the most important goal, to ""keep the baby warm.""

introducing-gtgraffiti-robot-paints-human.txt,"introducing gtgraffiti: the robot that paints like a human 
 graduate students at the georgia institute of technology have built the first graffiti-painting robot system that mimics the fluidity of human movement. 
 gerry chen, ph.d. candidate in robotics, and michael qian, b.s. computer science, '22, with a finished artwork painted by the gtgraffiti robot. 
 jun 16, 2022 
 - atlanta, ga 
 graduate students at the georgia institute of technology have built the first graffiti-painting robot system that mimics the fluidity of human movement. aptly named gtgraffiti, the system uses motion capture technology to record human painting motions and then composes and processes the gestures to program a cable-driven robot that spray paints graffiti artwork. 
 the project was devised by robotics ph.d. student gerry chen, in collaboration with juan-diego florez, a fellow graduate student;  frank dellaert , robotics professor in the  school of interactive computing , and  seth hutchinson , professor and kuka chair for robotics. the team's  peer-reviewed study of the robot system  was published in the international conference on robotics and automation proceedings for 2022. 
 how it works 
 for a robot to be able to paint in a human style, both the robot and the art must be designed with the other in mind - at least for now. the gtgraffiti system consists of three stages: artwork capture, robot hardware, and planning and control. 
 first, the team uses motion capture technology to record human artists painting - a strategy that allows for insight into the types of motions required to produce spray-painted artwork. for this study, chen and the team invited two artists to paint the alphabet in a bubble letter graffiti style. as each artist painted, they recorded the motions of the artist's hand across the canvas, as well as the movements of the spray paint can itself. capturing hand and spray paint can trajectories is crucial for the robot to be able to paint using similar layering, composition, and motion as those of a human artist. 
 the team then processed the data to analyze each motion for speed, acceleration, and size, and used that information for the next stage - designing the robot. taking these data into consideration, as well as portability and accuracy required for the artwork, they chose to use a cable-driven robot. cable-driven robots, like the skycams used in sports stadiums for aerial camera shots, are notable for being able to scale to large sizes. the robot runs on a system of cables, motors, and pulleys. the team's robot is currently mounted on a 9 by 10-foot-tall steel frame, but chen says it should be possible to mount it directly onto a flat structure of almost any size, such as the side of a building. 
 for the third stage, the artist's composition is converted into electrical signals. taken together, the figures form a library of digital characters, which can be programmed in any size, perspective, and combination to produce words for the robot to paint. a human artist chooses shapes from the library and uses them to compose a piece of art. for this study, the team chose to paint the letters ""atl."" 
 once the team chooses a sequence and position of characters, they use mathematical equations to generate trajectories for the robot to follow. these algorithmically produced pathways ensure that the robot paints with the correct speed, location, orientation, and perspective. finally, the pathways are converted into motor commands to be executed. 
 with all the computing and competing movements, the motors on the robot could potentially work against each other, threatening to rip the robot apart. to address this, the central robot controller is programmed to recalculate motor commands 1,000 times per second so that the robot can function safely and reliably. once assembled, the robot can then paint an artwork in the style of a human graffiti artist. 
 why art? why graffiti? 
 some of the most typical industries for robotics applications include manufacturing, biomedicine, automobiles, agriculture, and the military. but the arts, it turns out, can showcase robotics in an especially powerful way. 
 ""the arts, especially painting or dancing, exemplify some of the most complex and nuanced motions humans can make,"" chen said. ""so if we want to create robots that can do the highly technical things that humans do, then creating robots that can  dance  or paint are great goals to shoot for. these are the types of skills that demonstrate the extraordinary capabilities of robots and can also be applied to a variety of other applications."" 
 on a personal level, chen is motivated by his hope for people to perceive robots as being helpful to humanity, rather than seeing them as job-stealers or entities that cause feelings of fear, sadness, or doom as often depicted in film. 
 ""graffiti is an art form that is inherently meant to be seen by the masses,"" chen said. ""in that respect, i feel hopeful that we can use graffiti to communicate this idea - that robots working together with humans can make positive contributions to society."" 
 future directions 
 presently, chen and the team's plans for the robot are centered around two main thrusts: preserving and amplifying art. to this end, they are currently experimenting with reproducing pre-recorded shapes at different scales and testing the robot's ability to paint larger surfaces. these abilities would enable the robot to paint scaled up versions of original works in different geographical locations and for artists physically unable to engage in onsite spray painting. in theory, an artist would be able to paint an artwork in one part of the world, and a gtgraffiti bot could execute that artwork in another place. 
 in the future, chen hopes to use gtgraffiti to capture artists painting graffiti in the wild. with the captured motion data, gtgraffiti would be able to reproduce the artwork were it ever painted over or destroyed. 
 ""the robot is not generating the art itself, but rather working together with the human artist to enable them to achieve more than they could without the robot,"" chen said. 
 chen envisions that the robot system will eventually have capabilities that allow for real-time artist-robot interaction. he hopes to develop the technology that could enable an artist standing at the foot of a building to spray paint graffiti in a small space while the cable-driven robot copies the painting with giant strokes on the side of the building, for example. 
 ""we hope that our research can help artists compose artwork that, executed by a superhuman robot, communicates messages more powerfully than any piece they could have physically painted themselves,"" said chen. 
 gtgraffiti is funded by a national science foundation grant that supports research involving human-robot collaboration in artistic endeavors.

 - atlanta, ga 
 jeremy leff taught himself how to play the guitar about five years ago. like many guitarists he uses pedals, electronic or digital devices that let musicians alter how their instrument sounds. 
 but leff, a fourth-year mechanical engineering major, was frustrated with what he saw on the market. the existing effects were rigid and if he wanted a new sound effect he had to buy a new pedal. 
 ""what i wanted was the freedom to customize my sounds, and i wanted that variety without having to spend a ton of money,"" said leff, who is from honolulu. 
 he teamed up with dallas condra, a fourth-year mechanical engineering major, and vanya padmanabhan, a fourth-year industrial design major, and together they started a company called 
 pedalcreator . 
 their first product, disruption, is one of six devices competing for this year's 
 inventure prize , georgia tech's annual invention competition. the winner will be announced march 14. 
 disruption, they said, is an affordable guitar effects pedal that gives musicians the freedom to create distortion sounds. the patent-pending device is fully analog and customizable. 
 their pedal system's design includes a modular base -- smaller than a tv remote - built to house two cartridges. one is a tone cartridge and the other is a distortion cartridge and they work together to create a desired sound. the cartridges can be switched out to change the effect. they have already developed six swappable cartridge options. 
 before entering inventure, they participated in 
 create-x , a series of entrepreneurship programs for undergraduate students. 
 now much of the circuitry work is done in the apartment shared by leff and condra. they store parts and tools on an open shelf in their kitchen. other shelves hold canned goods and cereal. 
 the team went through several iterations to create the clean cartridge system design, said padmanabhan, who is from atlanta. 
 professional musicians are trying out the device and offering feedback. the company is accepting pre-orders and they plan to attend the national association of music merchants gathering this summer in nashville. 
 ""the inventure prize validates what we're doing and shows us that we're on the right track,"" said condra, who is from knoxville. ""we're ready for that next step.""

isabella-sanders-earns-two-more-tech-degrees.txt,"isabella sanders earns two more tech degrees 
 completing two graduate degrees during the pandemic offered sanders some opportunities that she would not have had otherwise. 
 isabella sanders is a fifth-generation ph.d. graduate and the first woman in her family to earn a ph.d. 
 may 06, 2021 
 - atlanta, ga 
 for isabella sanders, commencement may feel a bit like the movie 
 groundhog day . she is double-dipping - earning two degrees - for the second time. 
 in fall 2019 , sanders earned a master's in operations research in the college of engineering and a master's in geographic information science and technology in the college of design. this semester she is earning an mba from the scheller college of business and a ph.d. from the h. milton stewart school of industrial and systems engineering. 
 ""although i am a fifth-generation ph.d. graduate, i am the first woman in my family to get a ph.d.,"" sanders said. ""my mother was a refugee from cambodia and became the first woman in her family to graduate from college in the united states."" 
 that is why she is passionate about empowering women in stem. 
 ""women are often discouraged from staying in stem, and i hope to change that,"" said sanders, who was active in the society of women engineers (swe). ""while serving swe at georgia tech i was able to help rebuild a graduate swe group that has now won awards at the national level."" 
 for sanders, completing two graduate degrees during the pandemic offered some opportunities that she would not have had otherwise. in 2020 she got to do an in-person summer internship at redstone arsenal in huntsville, alabama, doing supplier risk analysis for the industrial base of the army. 
 ""as hard as covid-19 has been, i believe it has brought me closer to my ph.d. and mba classmates and jumpstarted my career,"" she said. 
 while at redstone she saw a posting for a faculty position at west point. she applied and got the job. 
 ""i was hired as an instructor and researcher in the operations research center (orcen) within the department of systems engineering in october, and i started teaching in january. after completing my ph.d., i will move into an assistant professor role within the department,"" she said. 
 sanders grew up in port jefferson, new york. she came to tech in 2016, after earning a bachelor's degree in math from mit. she said she will miss the people she met at tech. 
 ""my classmates-turned-friends have been the most important part of my time at georgia tech,"" she said. ""no one gets a degree alone. my classmates have made me a better person and scholar. georgia tech keeps you humble, and the support network i have had at tech has been unparalleled."" 
 sanders, selected to be the 
 student speaker for the ph.d. commencement ceremony , will use her speech to acknowledge the people who helped her throughout her journey. after the ceremony she will celebrate with her family and friends. 
 ""my ph.d. friends and i are taking a day trip to the countryside to commemorate the occasion. i'm also excited to celebrate with my mba classmates, unlike my other graduate degrees, we are all graduating at the same time and it's nice to be able to share the moment,"" she said. ""i'm looking forward to seeing all the other graduates, from every discipline, come together for one event at bobby dodd."" 
 sanders' has several relatives who are tech graduates: her brother eli, econ 2019; her father, daniel p. sanders, m.s.am 1991, m.s. or 1992, ph.d. aco 1993; her grandfather, hugh a. sanders, am 1965, m.s. am 1969; her great uncle, john j. owen iii, b.s. ae 1969, m.s. ae 1973, m.s. or 1973, m.s. ie 1992, ph.d. ie 1993; her great uncle, hal r. sanders, ee 1952; and another great uncle, wylie h. sanders, ee 1958. she also has several distant relatives who are tech graduates.

 finding multidisciplinary collaboration for humanities in an increasingly technology-driven world 
 apr 17, 2019 
 - atlanta, ga 
 nationwide, student enrollment in the humanities is on the decline. not so at georgia tech. 
 ""unlike other traditional universities, at which applications and enrollments in humanities fields have plummeted, the 
 school of literature, media, and communication's (lmc) 
 application rates have grown by more than 300 percent over the last five years,"" said richard utz, professor and lmc chair. ""i am convinced that one of the main causes for this increase is the unique degree work that offers the advantages of a liberal arts education within the context of a leading technological institute."" 
 on april 19 and 20, lmc will host 
 humantech , a symposium dedicated to exploring the future of the relationship between science and technology and the humanities, positioning georgia tech as a leader in the conscious discussion of the role of the humanities in an increasingly technology-driven world. 
 ""there really isn't wide recognition of the special roles the humanities play when they are at an institution where they collaborate deeply with stem,"" utz said. ""the humantech symposium strives to create an inventory of the specific environment within which humanists and scientists collaborate rather than focusing on the often-entrenched perception of differences."" 
 the symposium connects to the school's stated vision, to introduce new models of intellectual inquiry and practice that bring diverse perspectives to bear on technological invention and innovation. 
 ""our role, we feel, is to add the perspectives of what's affective, invisible, unpredictable, and unmeasurable to science and engineering education, which focuses on the measurable, observable, quantifiable, and testable,"" utz said. 
 the symposium features speakers at the forefront of designing and implementing practices that connect scientific and technological research with human-centered methodologies and practices, demonstrating how ethics and critical thinking are interrelated with innovation and complex problem-solving. 
 ""as a scholar of higher education whose background is within the liberal arts tradition, i have spent the past 15 years exploring the tensions between my scholarly training and that of my stem colleagues at georgia tech,"" said karen head, associate chair in lmc and one of the symposium's organizers. ""humantech offers a conscious attempt to foster more meaningful multidisciplinary collaborations that are necessary to solve the greatest problems of our times. crossing disciplinary lines has always been part of my lexicon of interest and practice, so i am particularly pleased to be able to cohost this symposium.""

 researchers believe they now understand why oversized microgels shrink to fit in with colloidal crystals. 
 researchers now believe they understand why oversized microgel particles spontaneously shrink to allow formation of colloidal crystals in assemblies of smaller microparticles. shown in a laboratory used to study the particles is georgia tech associate professor alberto fernandez-nieves. (credit: john toon, georgia tech) 
 apr 26, 2016 
 - atlanta, ga 
 when an assembly of microgel particles includes one particle that's significantly larger than the rest, that oversized particle spontaneously shrinks to match the size of its smaller neighbors. this self-healing nature of the system allows the microparticles to form defect-free colloidal crystals, an unusual property not seen in systems made up of ""hard"" particles. in 2009, andrew lyon, then a professor of chemistry at the georgia institute of technology, observed this dynamic resizing in a microgel system he had created, but the mechanism behind the self-healing process remained uncertain. now, researchers believe they've finally solved the mystery, and what they've learned could also have implications for biological systems made up of soft organic particles not unlike the polymer microgels. using small-angle x-ray and neutron scattering techniques, the researchers carefully studied the structures formed by dense concentrations of the microparticles. they also used tiny piezoelectric pressure transducers to measure osmotic pressure changes in the system. their conclusion: in dense assemblies of microparticles, counter ions bound to the microgels by electrostatic attraction come to be shared by multiple particles, increasing the osmotic pressure which then works to shrink the oversized particle. ""when the particles are close enough together, there is a point at which the cloud of ions can no longer be associated with individual particles because they overlap other particles,"" said 
 alberto fernandez-nieves , an associate professor in the 
 school of physics 
 at the georgia institute of technology. ""the ions create an imbalance between osmotic pressure inside and outside the larger particles, pushing them to de-swell - expel solvent to change size - to match the pressure of the system given by these delocalized ions. this is only possible because the microgel particles are compressible."" the research is reported april 25 in the early edition of the journal 
 proceedings of the national academy of sciences . the work was supported by the swiss national science foundation, and the research partnership between georgia tech and children's healthcare of atlanta. the presence of non-uniform particles normally creates point defects in the crystals or prevents the formation of crystalline structures altogether. that's true for structures formed from atoms, but not those formed from the microgels, which are soft cross-linked polymer particles immersed in a solvent. the microgels, which range in size from about 100 nanometers up to several microns in diameter, can exist in either swollen or non-swollen states, depending on such external conditions as temperature. lyon and his research group reported the self-healing nature of the colloidal crystals in the journal 
 angewandte chemie international 
 in 2009. they initially believed that what they were seeing resulted from energetic issues associated with formation of the crystals. ""we interpreted the phenomenon in terms of the overall lattice energy - the propensity of the microgels to form an ordered array - perhaps being larger than the energy required to collapse the defect microgels,"" he said. ""in other words, we believed there was an energetic penalty associated with disruption of the crystalline lattice that was greater than the energetic penalty associated with individual microgel de-swelling."" fernandez-nieves initially supported that hypothesis, but later came believe there was more at work. for instance, the shrunken microgels, which are identifiable because of their higher optical density, freely move about just like the smaller ones, suggesting that the shrinkage doesn't result from being crowded by the smaller particles. in a collaboration with researcher urs gasser and ph.d. student andrea scotti at the laboratory for neutron scattering and imaging at the paul scherrer institut in switzerland, the researchers used x-ray and neutron scattering techniques to study the structure of the suspended microgels and the degree of swelling in the large microparticles of the colloidal crystals. the work confirmed that these larger particles had indeed de-swollen, even at concentrations far larger than those initially used by lyon's research team. ""the system is able to make point defects disappear, and the mechanism we have proposed allows us to understand why this occurs,"" said fernandez-nieves. ""what we have proposed is a mechanism to explain what we see happening, and we think this is a general mechanism that could potentially apply to a wider range of soft particles."" as a next step, the research group expects to determine the ionic structure to confirm what the existing research has suggested. fernandez-nieves believes the work will generate more research with soft particle suspensions, for both experimentalists and theoreticians. ""there is indeed much more theory and simulation work needed to confirm what we propose and to fully understand how this self-healing process occurs,"" he said. ""this principle could be at play in a large number of contexts, including biological systems, in which there is a subtle balance between rigidity, osmotic pressure and ionic balance. this is a mechanism that doesn't really involve the other particles in the assembly. it involves the ions."" lyon, now dean of the schmid college of science and technology at chapman university, believes the findings might go beyond creating better colloidal systems to provide insights into how living cells operate. ""by obtaining a deeper insight into microgel assemblies, we may be able to take advantage of the subtle energetic balances that determine the overall structures to create more complex, defect-tolerant assemblies,"" he said. ""the physics we uncovered here could be relevant for other crowded, soft-materials systems, such as the interior of the eukaryotic cells. perhaps an extension of this knowledge will provide a better understanding of how the interior of a cell is organized, and how material is transported through this complex and crowded environment."" citation : a. scotti, et al., ""self-healing colloidal crystals: why soft particles feel the squeeze,""

 - atlanta, ga 
 more than 50 representatives from across the campus, including ivan allen college of liberal arts dean kaye husbands fealing, have been appointed by president ángel cabrera to the newly formed georgia tech diversity, equity, and inclusion council (gtdeic). the council will identify issues of campus racial and gender disparity, bias, and inequity to be addressed in order to deliver upon the institute's vision of diversity and inclusion. the members represent diverse voices and perspectives from staff, faculty, and students. their initial meeting will be nov. 30. 
 in addition to husbands fealing, other ivan allen faculty appointed are carol colatrella,  associate dean for graduate studies and faculty development; mary frank fox, advance professor in the school of public policy; and richard utz, chair of the school of literature, media, and communication. 
 in addition to her appointment to the institute council, colatrella also leads the ivan allen college 
 diversity and inclusion council . 
 the gtdeic will continuously monitor and assess the institute's progress on achieving its goals for becoming a model campus community for diversity, equity, and inclusion and develop evidenced, informed recommendations, which they will submit periodically to cabrera and the institute's executive leadership team for consideration in developing strategic actions. 
 ""our diversity and inclusion council is one of several action steps announced this past summer to deliver on our promise of inclusion,"" said president cabrera. ""as outlined in our 
 new strategic plan , we are striving to remove barriers to access and success, and to build an inclusive community where people of all backgrounds have the opportunity to learn and contribute to our mission. i am grateful to the individuals who volunteered to serve as inaugural council members, and look forward to working closely with them as they identify issues and propose new courses of action."" 
 campus research has revealed discrepancies in the satisfaction levels of various groups. the 
 2017 faculty and staff climate assessment surveys 
 and 
 2018 student climate assessment survey 
 revealed high levels of faculty, staff, and student satisfaction on a wide array of campus experiences on a number of dimensions measured across multiple social identities, such as faculty rank, job function, gender, and race. 
 ""the surveys also revealed there are some important differences in levels of satisfaction reported regarding some campus experiences,"" said archie ervin, vice president for 
 institute diversity, equity, and inclusion  (idei). ""disaggregation of the data by social identity reveal lower levels of satisfaction with campus experiences on a number of dimensions measured by the survey that deserve attention and deeper exploration to understand why the differences exist and what action steps, if any, could be taken to address root causes of problematic or potentially adverse differences of experiences for campus members."" 
 ""in sum, the climate assessment reports help us to understand our strengths and suggest areas where we should focus our attention to improve experiences of some members of the tech community,"" ervin added. ""given the baseline data obtained by the climate assessment surveys, and the recent development of college-level diversity councils, the establishment of an institute-wide council on diversity, equity, and inclusion is both timely and necessary for the next iteration of an improved overarching strategy to achieve tech's goals for diversity and inclusion."" 
 the gtdeic will be charged with the following objectives: 
 provide a forum for georgia tech stakeholders representing all divisions of the institute to identify and consider forward-looking, proactive strategies, methods, and approaches to enhance diversity, equity, and inclusion practices and outcomes at georgia tech; 
 create a setting in which institute leadership can share and vet diversity, equity, and inclusion-related issues and opportunities; and 
 develop data-informed recommendations to improve diversity, equity and inclusion and allow the institute to lead by example as a model institution advancing inclusive innovation. 
 the group will be chaired by ervin, and pearl alexander, executive director of idei's staff diversity, inclusion, and engagement, will serve as vice chair. the gtdeic is composed of representatives from across the campus academic and administrative units, faculty, staff and student governance (undergraduate and graduate) and other faculty and staff who enhance the diversity of perspective of the council.

 new research has found almost 25% of people surveyed experienced some form of deprivation due to the coronavirus pandemic. 
 dec 16, 2020 
 - atlanta, ga 
 new research has found that almost 25% of u.s. respondents experienced two of four types of deprivation due to the coronavirus pandemic. 
 shatakshee dhongde, associate professor of economics in the ivan allen college of liberal arts, analyzed results of the federal reserve board's survey of household economics and decision-making to determine the multiple economic deprivations experienced by respondents. her work was recently published in the open-access journal 
 plos one . dhongde found that significant proportions of u.s. respondents were experiencing economic hardships even early in the covid-19 pandemic, with hispanic citizens being particularly affected. 
 ""the paper highlights the plight of americans during the early months of the economic crisis set in motion amid the coronavirus pandemic,"" dhongde said. ""it sheds light on how economic disparities deepened along racial and ethnic lines."" 
 the pandemic triggered an unprecedented economic crisis in the u.s. data from the centers for disease control and prevention shows more than 374,000 confirmed u.s. covid-19 cases between april 3 and april 6. the federal reserve board surveyed 1,030 u.s. respondents about their households. the survey compiled data on four indicators of economic deprivation: overall financial condition, loss of employment, reduction in income, and inability to pay bills in full. 
 dhongde found significant deprivation among respondents, with almost 25% reporting hardships in at least two of the four indicators. one quarter of respondents saw their incomes fall compared to the previous month, and 13% were unable to pay their monthly bills. young adults and those without a college education experienced a disproportionate loss of economic well-being. 
 she also found that hispanic respondents were experiencing significantly higher deprivation: over 37% of these respondents faced hardships in at least two of the four indicators, and 8% reported hardships in all four areas. 
 ""going forward, it is urgent that we prioritize economic aid to vulnerable populations,"" dhongde added. ""these individuals are experiencing multiple hardships, and, without immediate aid, they will not be able to sustain the economic shock of the pandemic."" 
 the paper, ""multidimensional economic deprivation during the coronavirus pandemic: early evidence from the united states,""  is available at

 retired justice robert benham to receive the institute's premier award. 
 jan 05, 2024 
 on thursday, feb. 8, georgia tech's ivan allen jr. prize for social courage will be presented to retired justice robert benham. the annual award honors individuals who have stood up for moral principles at the risk of their careers, livelihoods, and even their lives. 
 a lifelong resident of georgia, benham was appointed to the supreme court of georgia by gov. joe frank harris in december 1989. he was the first african american appointed to the supreme court of georgia in its more than 140 years. in 1990, he won statewide election to a full term on the supreme court. he served as chief justice from 1995 to 2001 and remained on the court until his retirement in 2020. 
 ""justice benham's long career of public service was defined by a commitment to safeguarding civil liberties and an unflinching belief in serving communities and doing the right thing,"" said ángel cabrera, president of georgia tech. ""he was a key figure in the integration of his hometown and a breaker of barriers. achieving those ‘firsts' meant he was shunned, ostracized, and threatened, but he still showed great social courage and leadership, even when the risks were high."" 
 justice benham earned a bachelor's degree in political science from tuskegee university in 1967 and attended harvard university. in 1970, he obtained a j.d. from the university of georgia's lumpkin school of law and a master of laws degree from the university of virginia in 1989. 
 after law school, he served in the u.s. army reserve, attaining the rank of captain. he then served briefly as a trial attorney for atlanta legal aid society. he later returned to his hometown of cartersville, where he started a private law practice, served as special assistant attorney general, and served two terms as president of the bartow county bar association. justice benham was the first african american to establish a law practice in bartow county. 
 the ivan allen jr. prize for social courage is named for former atlanta mayor ivan allen jr., a graduate of georgia tech, who at great personal and political risk was the only southern white elected official to testify before congress in support of the civil rights act of 1964.

 georgia institute of technology science fiction scholar lisa yaszek will be featured on the upcoming amc program,  james cameron's story of science fiction  - a new series from the director of science fiction  blockbusters such as  avatar ,  alien , and  the terminator. 
 the six-part series, which airs mondays at 10 p.m. et, explores the ""evolution of science fiction from its cult beginnings in pulp to the engine for blockbuster film and television success it is today,"" according to the network. 
 ""i think people are going to learn a lot from this, and i think they will be entertained,"" said yaszek, a professor of science fiction studies in the  school of literature, media, and communication . she researches and teaches science fiction as a global language crossing centuries, continents, and cultures. 
 yaszek  said she was surprised to get the call from producers seeking to interview her about appearing on the show. fellow academics, and a former student, recommended her for the role, she said. 
 she ended up filming interviews for all six episodes. the episodes each focus on a distinct theme: aliens, time travel, outer space, dystopian futures, monsters, and finally, robots, cyborgs and other ""intelligent machines."" 
 yaszek also wrote a chapter for a companion book to the series, also titled  james cameron's story of science fiction. 
 the book includes the full versions of interviews cameron conducted for the series, bonus materials from cameron's archives, and essays corresponding to the main themes around which the show is organized. 
 ""the book publishers reached out to me and asked me to write the time travel chapter after watching the first cut of the series,"" yaszek said. ""it was a challenging but fun task that involved balancing what was covered in the show with a carefully curated selection of other important science fiction time-travel texts across media - and believe me, there are a lot!"" 
 yaszek, who is particularly interested in issues of gender, race, and science and technology in science fiction, has written several books, including  sisters of tomorrow: the first women of science fiction ,  galactic suburbia: recovering women's science fiction ,  and the self wired: technology and subjectivity in contemporary narrative. 
 she said the team involved in the production seemed extraordinarily well-informed about science fiction's past, present, and future. 
 her first interview with the team, in april 2017, lasted two hours. the discussion went deep into science fiction topics and allowed the producers to decide if yaszek would be relatable to a mass audience. 
 ""it was sort of like taking your graduate school comprehensive exams all over again,"" she said. 
 she apparently passed, because they flew her out to los angeles a month later to film her part in the first three episodes. 
 ""the first day was supposed to be a three-hour shoot, but we were there for six or seven hours,"" she said. 
 she later filmed three segments in new york for three additional episodes. 
 it was the first time filming a television series for yaszek, who is often quoted in the news on topics related to science fiction literature, her area of expertise as a professor at georgia tech's  ivan allen college of liberal arts. 
 ""it was fascinating to work with visual media creatives,"" yaszek said. ""science fiction scholars tend to approach the genre intellectually, asking questions like, ‘how does this author contribute to ongoing public debates about some aspect of science or technology, and what techniques do they use to make that contribution?' creative professionals working in film and tv tend to approach science fiction from an emotional context, asking, ‘how would it feel to have this scientific or technological experience? what's the human angle here, and what techniques can i use to convey that?'"" 
 she will appear in segments sandwiched between discussions featuring cameron and science fiction luminaries such as george lucas and steven spielberg.

janelle-dunlap-turns-beekeeping-art.txt,"janelle dunlap turns beekeeping into art 
 the urban honey bee project's new beekeeper in residence is creating art and educating the public with her practice. 
 remote video url 
 oct 30, 2023 
 hundreds of thousands of honeybees make their home atop the kendeda building for innovative sustainable design, and it's up to janelle dunlap to make sure the hives thrive. 
 dunlap was hired earlier this year as the urban honey bee project's (uhbp) first-ever beekeeper in residence. throughout her residency, she'll conduct research into the pollinator's place in our ecosystem and how beekeeping may offer relief to veterans dealing with post-traumatic stress disorder (ptsd), while connecting with the bees through art. 
 dunlap had been gardening for over a decade, but in 2016, when she got the urge to find new ways to engage with nature, she recalled a powerful piece of imagery that shaped her childhood - wu-tang clan's music video for ""triumph"" and its depiction of the group's members as a powerful swarm of africanized killer bees. 
 ""the political messaging and tying africanized killer bees in with the stereotypes and the tropes of african americans in the media, and the way that that was so poetically tied in, visually stuck with me,"" she said. ""it was the first time i recognized a political message being articulated through art. for that reason, it stuck with me that bees were a form of strong symbolism tied to resilience."" 
 living in charlotte, north carolina, dunlap became a certified beekeeper under the mecklenburg county beekeepers association in 2017. she continued practicing as she moved around the country, with stops in chicago and denver, eventually landing in atlanta in 2021. looking for a way to connect to the local beekeeping community, she attended an april presentation by uhbp director jennifer leavey, who offered dunlap a chance to get involved at georgia tech. 
 she now handles the inspection of the hives on the kendeda building roof, where she monitors for pests and ensures the bees have proper nutrition to sustain their population through the seasons. the uhbp began in 2012 with the goal of educating the tech community on the importance of these pollinators within the atlanta ecosystem and beyond - a charge that dunlap carries on. 
 over the next year, she will continue working on her sound art project that examines the frequency at which bees ""buzz"" and how it, along with the responsibilities of beekeeping, is being used by va hospitals and programs to ease the effects of ptsd. while the science behind the connection is still being explored, beekeeping was recommended more than a century ago - to soldiers returning home from world war i - 
 according to a cnbc profile of bees4vets , a nonprofit based in nevada. 
 from the hive to the canvas 
 whether it was baking sourdough bread or learning a new language, many people, including dunlap, took the early days of the covid-19 pandemic to pick up a new hobby. she began a master's program at the school of the art institute of chicago with the goal of using beeswax in encaustic painting, which uses hot wax mixed with pigments. the use of natural materials collected through her beekeeping practice connects dunlap to her work. 
 ""it's a way of tapping into another level of consciousness. it's a way of articulating the noncommunicable relationship between me and the bees. when there's a language gap between people, we try to fill it in with translation, but without a direct way to translate the language or the sensation that i feel from the bees, this allows me to document my practice in an abstract form,"" she said. 
 by layering the wax and applying heat throughout the process, dunlap watches the pieces take shape, often with the unpredictability of an active hive, as she says the art ""can create itself."" she collects the wax in small amounts, knowing that she can only produce her art if the bees are healthy. 
 ""it's an eco-conscious practice, making sure i don't use more than i need,"" she explained. ""i love the landscape it creates, and it's all about me creating a direct relationship with my medium and knowing that i earned it by developing a relationship with the bees."" 
 as dunlap continues her year-long residency with the uhbp, she intends to help educate the community, both on campus and around the atlanta area, in the hopes that more prospective beekeepers will explore their curiosity to unlock the full potential of the practice. 
 ""it's been a practice that keeps unveiling itself to me,"" she said. ""as you get more engaged, you learn there is so much more to it than just the day-to-day hive inspections. there is a lot of beauty to it as well."" 
 students at tech have several ways to get involved with research and beekeeping, including the 
 living building science vip team , 
 the beekeeping club , and various classes and workshops hosted by the 
 uhbp .

 corals are foundational for ocean life. known as the rainforests of the sea, they create habitats for 25% of all marine organisms, despite only covering less than 1% of the ocean's area. 
 coral patches the width and height of basketball arenas used to be common throughout the world's oceans. but due to numerous human-generated stresses and coral disease, which is known to be associated with ocean sediments, most of the world's coral is gone. 
 ""it's like if all the pine trees in georgia disappeared over a period of 30 to 40 years,"" said  mark hay , regents' chair and the harry and anna teasley chair in environmental biology in the  school of biological sciences  at the georgia institute of technology. ""just imagine how that affects biodiversity and ecosystems of the ocean."" 
 in first-of-its-kind research, hay, along with research scientist  cody clements , discovered a crucial missing element that plays a profound role in keeping coral healthy - an animal of overlooked importance known as a sea cucumber.

journey-georgia-tech-ironman.txt,"the journey of a georgia tech ironman 
 fourth-generation tech student colin wegner will swim, bike, and run a total of 140.6 miles in the upcoming 2023 ironman world championship in france. 
 colin wegner crosses the finish line at the panama city beach ironman triathlon in november 2022. submitted photo.& 
 aug 30, 2023 
 as the georgia tech women's basketball team recently completed its 
 foreign tour to croatia and spain , another yellow jacket is preparing to represent the institute abroad. colin wegner, a third-year chemical engineering student, will compete in the 2023 ironman world championship in nice, france, on sept. 10. 
 wegner is a fourth-generation georgia tech student, following in his family's footsteps to attend his dream school, just as he followed in his father's footsteps as a child when the two would run together. at the age of 12, colin and his dad, torsten wegner, signed up for a sprint triathlon. they haven't slowed down since, although colin does believe he's caught up to his dad. 
 ""he's a good cyclist,"" colin said. ""i'm definitely stronger than he is now - finally, after a long, long time."" when asked if torsten would agree, colin replied, ""grudgingly, yes."" 
 after honing his skills over the years, wegner decided in early 2022 to cross an item off his bucket list by competing in a full 140.6-mile ironman triathlon - a 2.4-mile swim, a 112-mile bicycle race, and a 26.22-mile run. on a november day in panama city beach, florida, wegner crossed the finish line with a time of 12:02:10, qualifying him to compete in the upcoming world championship in the 18 - 24 age group. 
 ""it always seemed like such a lofty goal,"" he said. ""but here i am, a normal college kid getting ready to compete on such a grand stage."" 
 dealing with the already busy schedule of a tech student, wegner has learned how to balance the addition of his rigorous training schedule, which includes early morning trips to the north georgia mountains as he prepares for the hilly terrain he'll face in september, both on foot and on the bike. the training can be just as mentally taxing as it is physically, but with one competition under his belt, wegner understands that there are no shortcuts on the road to france. 
 for his first ironman, he says, ""i would take days off here and there and sometimes cut my runs short because i was hurting or tired. but, after feeling unprepared for the run during the race, i realized how important it is to train to run through that same pain on race day. i feel much more prepared this time by just being far more consistent and pushing through soreness and really leaning into the 'hurt locker,' as it's called."" 
 applying the same competitive drive to the classroom, wegner has maintained a 4.0 gpa through his first two years at tech. he credits the supportive nature of the institute for allowing him to pursue his dreams of competing at a high level. 
 wegner is still deciding what path he'll take after completing his degree, and while he doesn't foresee competition becoming his day job, he's eager to see where his dream takes him. 
 ""it's very mentally and physically grueling, but i love the competition and even enjoy the training. it's something i'll carry on throughout my whole life. whether i end up doing really well, we'll find out, but making a career out of it is not the plan right now,"" wegner said. 
 when the starting gun is fired in early september, wegner will be proudly donning a georgia tech tri suit while his family ­­- and the entire tech community - cheers him on.

 may 10, 2023 
 the world would look very different without multicellular organisms - take away the plants, animals, fungi, and seaweed, and earth starts to look like a wetter, greener version of mars. but precisely how multicellular organisms evolved from single-celled ancestors remains poorly understood. the transition happened hundreds of millions of years ago, and early multicellular species are largely lost to extinction. 
 to investigate how multicellular life evolves from scratch, researchers from the georgia institute of technology decided to take evolution into their own hands. led by  william ratcliff , associate professor in the  school of biological sciences  and director of the  interdisciplinary graduate program in quantitative biosciences , a team of researchers has initiated the first long-term evolution experiment aimed at evolving new kinds of multicellular organisms from single-celled ancestors in the lab.

 on april 15 and 16, more than 270 k-12 steam (science, technology, engineering, art, and mathematics) decision-makers, school administrators, and educators gathered virtually for the 2021 steam leadership conference at georgia tech. 
 ceismc steam conference 2021 
 jun 07, 2021 
 - atlanta, ga 
 on april 15 and 16, more than 270 k-12 steam (science, technology, engineering, art, and mathematics) decision-makers, school administrators, curriculum and after-school coordinators, informal educators, principals, teacher leaders, and artists gathered virtually for the 
 2021 steam leadership conference 
 at georgia tech. sponsored by honeywell hometown solutions, the fifth annual conference was hosted by georgia tech's 
 center for education integrating science, mathematics, and computing (ceismc) . 
 ""the world is evolving at a rapid pace,"" said lizanne destefano, executive director of ceismc and professor of psychology. ""these changes have encouraged schools to adapt and reimagine steam education. we are excited to welcome this group of educators as they pitch new ideas and develop mindful designs that not only raise academic achievement but also increase resilience and civic responsibility in the next generation."" 
 the theme for this year's conference, ""the path forward: leveraging steam education in an evolving world,"" encouraged participants to engage in an array of experiences and find ideas, resources, and connections to help them build k-12 steam education. throughout the two-day conference, k-12 steam educators, staff, and leaders discovered solutions and innovative ways of leveraging immersive technology, community partnerships, citizenship, and diversity for the betterment of steam education. 
 georgia tech's provost and executive vice president for academic affairs, steven w. mclaughlin, served as one of the conference keynote speakers. 
 ""a strong k-12 educational system means more georgia students are prepared and ready, and also see georgia tech as their school of choice and a place where they can thrive,"" said mclaughlin. ""engaging students, long before they exit high school, with cutting-edge science and engineering, getting them excited about innovation and discovery, is one of the ways to make that happen. to do that, we need to support k-12 steam teachers with professional development opportunities and help them bring more technology, problem-based learning, and innovation into their classrooms."" 
 with an overarching focus on building leaders through authentic steam learning experiences in remote, blended, informal, and hybrid learning environments, four conference tracks highlighted key themes in k-12 steam education innovation: bringing informal educational practices into the formal classroom, developing and leveraging community partnerships, providing access to equitable steam education and civic engagement, and social justice pedagogy and practice. 
 making the informal formal 
 in 2020, the pivot from the formal classroom to remote and hybrid learning environments highlighted the impact of learning that happens outside the confines of the classroom. it also made educators develop creative, innovative ways to connect with students and facilitate learning in an informal environment. sessions in this conference track focused on ways to build upon informal learning experiences, including civic responsibility, community engagement, activism, and more. 
 for example, one informal learning experience that ceismc provides for students is their summer p.e.a.k.s. (programs for enrichment and accelerated knowledge in steam): one- to two-weeklong day camps for k-12 students featuring robotics, game and app development, digital design, atmospheric science, and sustainable energy programs. these will return to on-campus programming in july. 
 additionally, during the pivot to remote learning in 2020, ceismc staff and faculty developed and distributed more than 2,000 stem learning kits to k-12 students and families across georgia, and curated a set of stem education resources for families home schooling. they also provided professional development on virtual teaching, lesson planning, and curriculum development for more than 1,300 teachers. 
 with the broader reach of virtual platforms, last year ceismc staff were able to serve 62,500 k-12 students from georgia, the u.s., and, for the first time, students in other countries as well. in fact, the response to ceismc's virtual programming was so positive that they plan to continue offering it regularly. 
 the power of community partnerships 
 connecting both community and business partners with practicing teachers, k-12 students, and university faculty and students can expand the skill sets, resources, and expertise of educators and leaders, further enhance their ability to connect with students, create meaningful learning experiences, and spark students' interest in steam careers they might not have considered otherwise. 
 through one such partnership, with honeywell's support, ceismc provides atlanta metro area teachers with innovative professional development in software engineering. teachers attend a monthlong software engineering bootcamp on the georgia tech campus. the following fall, those teachers lead their middle and high school students in a competition to solve real-world problems using software engineering. a recently added leadership cohort will support teachers as they attain a computer science certification, further improving access to computer science coursework and careers. 
 project citizen: steam education, equity, and access 
 through its interdisciplinarity, steam education can be an avenue to support students as they learn to use their voices and actions to effect change in their communities and become well-informed, responsible, respectful, and civically engaged citizens. sessions in this conference track focused on ways to create equitable steam education that teaches and fosters civic engagement. 
 one such effort is underway at georgia tech this year. in partnership with amazon, the institute is seeking to develop the coding skills of future socially conscious entrepreneurs through a music-mixing competition that features artists like pharrell, ciara, and common. winning middle and high school students receive $5,000 scholarships or grants to support startup businesses. 
 fusing social justice and steam 
 social justice movements have gained global traction and made a great impact on students and school communities. part of the role of k-12 educators is to help students contextualize their current lived experiences and empower them to embrace their differences and gain new perspectives. sessions in this conference track focused on ways to implement social justice pedagogy and praxis into steam education. 
 on thursday, april 15, keynote speaker reanna roby, postdoctoral fellow at vanderbilt university peabody college, addressed reconstructing steam education into an equitable space for students. ""i am challenging us to think about how we might reimagine our science and steam+ [education] broadly, because what we have currently does not work,"" said roby. ""those who would benefit are most disenfranchised."" 
 some of those efforts to reimagine steam education are already underway. in honor of ceismc's 30 th 
 anniversary, this year the center will launch a number of new initiatives that will provide scholarships and expand access to steam education and higher education for people of all backgrounds. 
 in partnership with code.org, ceismc plans to train more than 300 teachers across georgia in coding and teaching computer science. 
 with support from the goizueta foundation, ceismc is also launching a new round of gosteam for middle and high school teachers in gwinnett, clayton, and atlanta public schools. 
 with support from the blank foundation, ceismc will continue its partnership with atlanta public schools to offer a full range of summer stem programming for more than 1,000 students in the washington cluster of schools. 
 with a new grant from the national science foundation called remezcla, ceismc is expanding the earsketch platform, a very popular music-mixing platform, to include latin rhythms and instruments, to expand its appeal to an even larger number of k-12 students. 
 the georgia tech georgia intern fellowships will resume on-campus programming for its 30 th 
 year of operation as well. the program provides paid summer stem internships in industry workplaces and university laboratories for k-12 science, mathematics, and technology teachers.

karmella-haynes-leads-exploration-genomes-dark-regions.txt,"karmella haynes leads exploration of the genome's dark regions 
 national science foundation supporting research into the mysteries and mechanisms of noncoding rna 
 aug 28, 2023 
 by jerry grillo 
 karmella haynes  wants to shine some light on the ""dark matter"" of the genome, and the national science foundation (nsf) is helping her flip the switch. 
 haynes, assistant professor in the wallace h. coulter department of biomedical engineering at georgia tech and emory university, is leading a team of multi-disciplinary investigators who were awarded a four-year,  $2.1 million grant from nsf  to explore this dark matter and illuminate how the genome controls living systems in all their diversity and complexity. 
 it's large space to explore. only two percent of the human genome is known to provide instructions to build proteins, a process essential to higher functioning life. this leaves 98 percent of the genome as a biological frontier known as dark matter - these segments do not encode for protein, like the other two percent. 
 ""a lot of progress has been made in studying this part of the genome, but what we don't know yet can be very useful,"" said haynes,  whose lab  works on the front line of synthetic biology, and is typically dedicated to protein engineering, including the investigation and design of chromatin-based systems for controlling gene expression in cancer and other cells. 
 for this project, funded through february 2027, haynes is expanding her focus to include rna engineering, noting that some of those dark regions of the genome can produce long noncoding rnas (lncrnas). usually found in very small amounts within a cell, lncrnas have nonetheless been found to have an impact on biological processes like cell growth and survival, cell identity and environmental interactions, and various human and animal diseases. 
 ""the next step would be to tap into the biomedical and biotechnology potential of these rnas,"" said haynes, who is principal investigator on the multi-institutional project. her co-principal investigators are  alisha jones , assistant professor of chemistry at new york university, and  keriayn smith , assistant professor of genetics at the university of north carolina-chapel hill. joining them are emory biochemist  anita corbett ;  tian hong , a computational biologist at the university of tennessee; and  aaron johnson , a molecular geneticist at the university of colorado. 
 together, they'll delve into the mysteries and mechanisms of lncrna. 
 investigators, assemble! 
 haynes met her collaborators at an nsf ideas lab gathering in the summer of 2022. the program had an acronym that sounds like something borrowed from  star wars , d2r2, which actually stands for  dark dimensions of the rna regulome . 
 ideas labs are intensive workshops facilitated by nsf with the intention of finding innovative solutions to grand challenges. d2r2 brought together engineers, chemists, mathematicians, computer scientists, and others with a goal of developing new theories and models for understanding non-coding rnas, and new approaches for manipulating and controlling non-coding rna activity. 
 ""we all received a crash course on what the scientific community understands about all of this, then we got to work,"" said haynes. her two co-pis, jones and smith, help comprise what haynes believes is a unique leadership trifecta. ""i rarely hear of a large multi-institutional grant that is led by three black women. i think that is significant."" 
 also significant, she added, is the project's emphasis on outreach. haynes and her team are working with students from  project engages  at georgia tech - a high school science education program in partnership with minority-serving public schools in atlanta. the plan is to provide the students a focus presentation on rna technology. 
 ultimately, haynes hopes the nsf project will yield innovations that would enhance our ability to predict and mitigate the effects of changing environments on organisms and ecosystems - in other words, epigenetic control. if they can engineer lncrnas to fine tune their activity, researchers should be able to generate beneficial biomolecules for biomedical applications. 
 ""we expect at minimum to push the boundaries of knowledge by trying to build functional rnas,"" haynes said. ""but if we could develop an effective tool for this kind of epigenetic control, that would be remarkable. this could have some exciting implications for bioengineering.""

kendeda-building-georgia-tech-earns-living-building-certification.txt,"the kendeda building at georgia tech earns living building certification 
 satisfying 225% of its energy needs from solar generation, capturing rainwater for drinking, and screening out common hazardous chemicals, award-winning project seeks to transform buildings in southeast and beyond. 
 the kendeda building for innovative sustainable design 
 apr 22, 2021 
 - atlanta, ga 
 the georgia institute of technology today announced that the kendeda building for innovative sustainable design has earned living building challenge certification, the world's most ambitious and holistic green building achievement. the certification from the international living future institute independently verifies that the kendeda building is among the greenest in the world. 
 ""we feel a responsibility to lead by example,"" said ángel cabrera, president of georgia tech where the kendeda building is located. ""this building - which is a tribute to the power of human ingenuity to find new solutions to our greatest challenges - aligns with our longstanding vision for our campus to serve as a laboratory for innovation to inspire and develop tomorrow's leaders who advance technology and improve the human condition."" 
 the living building challenge (version 3.1) requires a 12-month performance period, during which time the project must prove it is net-positive for energy and water. this means it must generate more energy from onsite renewable sources than it uses, and also collect and treat more rainwater onsite than it uses for all purposes, including for drinking. 
 meeting all seven petals in the living building challenge - place, water, energy, health + happiness, materials, equity, and beauty - the kendeda building is the first living building challenge-certified building of its scale in the southeastern u.s., where a warm humid climate poses many challenges. in spite of this, over the performance period, the building generated 225% of the energy needed to power all of its electrical systems from solar panels on its roof. it also collected, treated, and infiltrated 15 times the amount of water needed for building functions. 
 ""we partnered with georgia tech on this transformational project because the institution is full of world-class problem-solvers. students passing through the kendeda building today will be the engineers, architects, scientists, product designers, urban planners, and policymakers of tomorrow,"" said diana blank, the founder of the kendeda fund, whose $30 million grant to georgia tech made the building possible. ""by raising the bar for building performance, we are encouraging georgia tech to keep reaching higher. we want students and faculty to embrace the challenge, continually asking ‘how can we improve on this?'"" 
 the project's goal is to support georgia tech's mission while transforming the architecture, engineering, and construction industries in the southeastern u.s. by advancing regenerative building and innovation, and by showcasing synergies between environmental stewardship, social equity, and economic development. 
 to ensure living building challenge certification by fulfilling the requirements in the petals performance categories, the kendeda building's performance metrics incorporated the following: 
 the energy-efficient electrical and mechanical equipment and tight building envelope, with a 330-kilowatt photovoltaic canopy supplies 225% of the building's energy needs on an annual basis. 
 the photovoltaic canopy shades the building and captures rainwater. the water is stored in a 50,000-gallon cistern in the basement before being treated and used for all purposes, including drinking. 
 the building is composed of materials screened to ensure the absence of hazardous ""red list"" chemicals, such as bisphenol a (bpa), halogenated flame retardants, phthalates, and formaldehyde. chemicals on the red list have been shown to harm human and environmental health, even though they are common in most buildings. 
 wood from sustainably managed forests, salvaged materials, and other sourcing strategies significantly reduce the building's embodied carbon emissions. 
 by eliminating 99% of its construction waste and incorporating reclaimed, locally sourced materials such as reclaimed wood for the structural decking and salvaged slate tile in the restrooms, the project diverted more waste from the landfill than it sent to the landfill. 
 composting toilets nearly eliminate potable water use for sewage conveyance and allow for human waste to be turned into fertilizer for use offsite. 
 the building allows for universal access. its central feature is an accessible ramp connecting the terraced main floor so that everyone has a similar experience throughout the building. 
 the design and construction team went above and beyond the living building challenge equity petal by promoting an equitable and inclusive sense of community. to build the ceiling panels and floor systems, for example, the general contractor partnered with 
 georgia works! , a nonprofit helping chronically homeless men become self-sufficient. 
 ""living buildings are the future,"" said scott cannon, executive vice president and general manager of building operations in georgia and south carolina for skanska, the general contractor. ""we've been committed to sustainability for years and have seen how projects like this are a catalyst to reshape how people think about the built environment. it illustrates the practical and replicable solutions, materials, and technologies that other buildings in the southeast can use to meet similar environmental standards."" 
 in a region challenged by flooding and drought, the kendeda building also shows that regenerative design can treat stormwater, conserve potable water, lower the risk of downstream flooding, reduce the burden on existing infrastructure, and save money on utilities. 
 ""if there was any doubt, we have shown that net-positive energy and net-positive water are both within reach in atlanta and across the southeast,"" said joshua gassman of lord aeck sargent, one of the lead architects on the project. ""using analytics and sound building science, we were able to provide comfort to the building's occupants, connect them to nature and the history of the place, and live within the water and energy means of the site. we were able to do all of this while creating a clear and sustainable vision for the future."" 
 at $544 per gross square foot, the kendeda building is 13% more expensive than a comparable building at georgia tech. however, in reality, there are few comparable buildings of this type that include the infrastructure for net-positive energy and water in the construction cost. 
 ""we took the lessons we learned from the bullitt center and adapted those ideas for a new climate and new building type,"" said margaret sprug, principal at the miller hull partnership, which designed the building in collaboration with lord aeck sargent and served as the lead architect of the bullitt center, another well-known living building. ""the kendeda building serves as an inspiration and gathering place for people from around the region who are advancing sustainability and regenerative design."" 
 the knowledge and processes used with the kendeda building are already being transferred to other projects. thousands of people have toured the project, the entire design and construction team has learned deep sustainability lessons throughout the life of the project, and the students and administrators who inhabit the building on a daily basis will all take these lessons out into the world and apply them to their future projects. 
 the kendeda building's achievement is being celebrated at living future ‘21, a virtual gathering of the world's leading architects, contractors, and product designers.

 keysight technologies, a leading provider of electronic design and test software, equipment, and services, officially opened the doors to its new software design center in technology square oct. 13. 
 with the official opening of the fortune 1000 firm's software design center, the company becomes the 15 th 
 major corporation to make a home at or near tech square to tap into the institute's research, student talent, and innovation ecosystem. 
 ""we selected georgia tech and midtown atlanta based on several things, including the quality of students coming from tech's school of electrical and computer engineering (ece) and school of computer science,"" said jay alexander, keysight's chief technology officer. 
 other critical factors were the quality of research and  longstanding partnerships the company has with researchers in those schools, along with a supportive business climate in georgia and atlanta's quality-of-life attributes, he said. in 2014, keysight made a $120 million in-kind donation of its software to georgia tech, which the institute is deploying to help students become industry-ready engineers by using the same instruments and software used by customers in government and industry. 
 ""all of those things came together for us, making it  an obvious choice,"" said alexander. ""we couldn't be happier with our decision."" 
 the santa rosa, calif.-based company's $13.9 million investment in georgia is expected to create more than 200 software engineering jobs. 
 ""tech square has been a magnet for a number of promising startups, but we're excited that it also has attracted companies with an impressive legacy like keysight,"" georgia tech president g.p. ""bud"" peterson said. ""for georgia tech, it's a point of pride and a significant achievement that a company of this caliber believes we can add value to its operations. it is the ideal type of industry leader we seek for tech square and georgia tech."" 
 companies such as keysight also are ideal for institute alumni and students such as jonathan jones, who graduated from tech in 2016 with a master's degree in electrical and computer engineering from ece. he obtained his bachelor's degree in computer engineering in 2015. 
 at keysight, he will be part of a team of engineers who are building a new keysight-wide software platform for rapid application development. 
 ""i've heard people compare it to being a heavily funded startup, and that's how i like to think about being here in tech square,"" said jones, a 23-year-old macon native. ""it was very attractive to be with the company as it's starting something new; i like new challenges and tackling something new every day, so when i saw this opportunity, i knew i had to grab it."" 
 deepika narayanan, who is pursuing her master's degree in electrical and computer engineering at ece, echoed jones' sentiments. 
 ""the fact this is opening in atlanta and it's a software design center attracted me to apply for the position, and i'm really excited,"" said narayanan, who expects to graduate in december. the 23-year-old will be working on coding and software development, and she said she hopes to go into data specialization analytics and machine learning. 
 uday ravuri, who also expects to obtain his master's in electrical and computer engineering at ece in december, said keysight's offerings and culture made it an ideal choice for him. 
 ""i basically looked for three things - a cultural fit, technical fit, and career growth,"" said raburi, who will be working as a software engineer for the company. ""and from the feedback i received from the employees, all three of those important factors seemed to be perfect in this company, and that's why i went for it.""

 the proposed space force is not the best way to assure u.s. dominance of space, professor argues.

 aug 10, 2018 
 - atlanta, ga

 creating a sixth branch of the united states military to oversee space defense - a space force - could spur technological innovation, but could just as likely cause disruption among organizations tasked with defending u.s. military and commercial interests in orbit, according to margaret e. kosal, an associate professor in the  sam nunn school of international affairs  at the georgia institute of technology. 
 ""do we need to recognize the value of space as a domain crucial to u.s. national security and our economy? absolutely,"" said  kosal , a former advisor for science and technology in the office of the secretary of defense. ""do we need to better fund basic and applied research? absolutely. do we need to have more robust thinking about space as a military and commercial domain? absolutely. is a space force the best, or second- or third-best way to do that? no."" 
 vice president mike pence announced  august 9, 2018 that the united states would seek to establish a u.s. space force as a separate branch of the military by 2020. president donald trump publicly proposed such a branch in june. 
 kosal, an expert in military technology, said it is unclear what a space force would do beyond the existing roles handled by other military organizations. she said it also could be a destabilizing influence internationally, inducing other nations, such as china and russia, to stand up their own versions of a military space force. 
 ""that may drive a militarization of space,"" she said. 
 one possible benefit of such a service branch, she said, might be greater emphasis on basic and applied research that could help drive new discoveries. 
 but, she said, a better way to do that would be to direct more money to research into space-related technologies, as well as the civilian space program. 
 ""if a space force brings more attention to the importance of space and space exploration, that could be very good broadly,"" she said. ""if it brings more prominence and serious work regarding the role of space-based operations in a security context that could be good. if it takes away from the already good work being done in under-funded programs in the u.s. air force and nasa that would not be good.""

 researchers collaborate with satellite communications company on laser-based system.

 - atlanta, ga 
 a new research project announced recently as a collaboration between the georgia institute of technology and satellite communications provider xenesis could help open the bottleneck that now limits the flow of data from earth-orbiting satellites to ground stations. 
 the project will miniaturize, space qualify and test a laser communications transceiver that could dramatically expand the bandwidth available for downlinking information from the growing number of satellites - and future constellations of space vehicles - in low earth orbit. xenesis has licensed the technology from nasa's jet propulsion laboratory (jpl), and will work with georgia tech and jpl to mature it for use as a primary communication system for satellites as small as cubesats. 
 ""we expect to significantly add to the total bandwidth of information that we can get down from space, and the more bandwidth we have, the more information we can exchange and the more value we can get from satellite networks,"" said 
 brian gunter , an assistant professor in georgia tech's 
 daniel guggenheim school of aerospace engineering 
 who will be leading the project. 
 gunter's lab has experience with small satellites, and will apply that expertise to the project with xenesis - which signed a $1.2 million contract on june 14 to support the work. georgia tech's contribution will be to miniaturize the original jpl technology, update the control software, space qualify all the hardware and test the improved system from space - likely from the international space station. 
 ""with all of the satellites that are going into space, everything from cubesats to major satellites, there is more information being generated than can ever be downloaded,"" said dennis poulos, chief technology officer at xenesis. ""most of today's systems depend on radio frequency downlinks, and there is just a limited amount of bandwidth available for use."" 
 laser-based systems can expand that bandwidth to beyond 10 gigabits per second, poulos said. in addition to boosting bandwidth, optical systems can use smaller antennas, use power more efficiently, and provide better data security. 
 mark lapenna, ceo of xenesis, compared the benefits of the planned space-based network to the jump in performance from terrestrial dial-up connections of the 1990s to today's high-speed broadband services. 
 ""xenesis recognizes the need for a global communications revolution, and we plan to empower space with an optical product called xenhub,"" lapenna said. ""through this architecture, any company, mission or global operator on the ground or in space, will be able to compete on a level playing field for the first time since sputnik."" 
 the laser communications transceiver developed by jpl consists of two components: (1) an optics module that includes a five-centimeter telescope, two-axis gimbal, monitoring sensors and thermal control system, and (2) an electronics module with a transmitter, processor, controllers and power conditioning systems. 
 though it is subject to interference from clouds, the laser system will benefit from producing a narrow beam that can travel farther than comparable radio-frequency transmissions at the same power level. 
 the initial focus will be space-to-ground communication, though the system could also be used for cross-linking communication between satellites. the small antenna size is also more suitable to the small-form satellites envisioned for future constellations that may include thousands of spacecraft. 
 ""once we can show that this works from space to ground, that will demonstrate that the technology can survive the harsh environment of space, and allow us continue the development of the transceiver for commercial use,"" gunter added. ""this has the potential to open up a range of new capabilities, including the ability to provide high-volume data services to anywhere in the world."" 
 in georgia tech's school of aerospace engineering, the contract will support three or four graduate students, a postdoctoral researcher, and a group of undergraduate students, gunter said. ""this will be a major satellite project for our lab, and we look forward to advancing the technology with our collaborators.""

learning-morse-code-without-trying.txt,"learning morse code without trying 
 researchers have developed a system that teaches people morse code within four hours using a series of vibrations felt near the ear 
 oct 27, 2016 
 - atlanta, ga 
 it's not exactly beating something into someone's head. more like tapping it into the side. 
 researchers at the georgia institute of technology have developed a system that teaches people morse code within four hours using a series of vibrations felt near the ear. participants wearing google glass learned it without paying attention to the signals -they played games while feeling the taps and hearing the corresponding letters. after those few hours, they were 94 percent accurate keying a sentence that included every letter of the alphabet and 98 percent accurate writing codes for every letter. 
 this is the latest chapter of passive haptic learning (phl) studies at georgia tech. the same method - using vibrations while participants aren't paying attention - 
 has taught people braille , 
 how to play the piano 
 and 
 improved hand sensation for those with partial spinal cord injury. 
 the phl projects are all led by georgia tech professor thad starner and his ph.d. student caitlyn seim. the team decided to use glass for this study because it has both a built-in speaker and tapper (glass's bone-conduction transducer). 
 in the study, participants played a game while feeling vibration taps between their temple and ear. the taps represented the dots and dashes of morse code and passively ""taught"" users through their tactile senses - even while they were distracted by the game. 
 the taps were created when researchers sent a very low-frequency signal to glass's speaker system. at less than 15 hz, the signal was below hearing range but, because it was played very slowly, the sound was felt as a vibration. 
 half of the participants in the study felt the vibration taps and heads a voice prompt for each corresponding letter. the other half - the control group - felt no taps to help them learn. 
 participants were tested throughout the study on their knowledge of morse code and their ability to type it.  after less than four hours of feeling every letter, everyone was challenged to type the alphabet in morse code in a final test. 
 the control group was accurate only half the time.  those who felt the passive cues were nearly perfect. 
 the research was recently presented in germany at the 20 th 
 international symposium on wearable computers. 
 ""does this new study mean that people will rush out to learn morse code? probably not,"" said starner. ""it shows that phl lowers the barrier to learn text-entry methods - something we need for smartwatches and any text-entry that doesn't require you to look at your device or keyboard."" 
 previous research on phl used custom hardware to provide the tactile stimuli, but here researchers use an existing wearable device. 
 ""this research also shows that other common devices with an actuator could be used for passive haptic learning,"" he says. ""your smartwatch, bluetooth headset, fitness tracker or phone."" 
 ""in our braille and piano phl studies, people felt vibrations on their fingers, then used their fingers for the task,"" said seim. ""this study was different and surprising. people were tapped on their heads, but the skill they learned was using their finger."" 
 seim's next study will go a step further, investigating whether phl can teach people how to type on the trusted qwerty keyboard. that would mean several letters assigned to the same finger, rather than using only one finger like morse code. 
 the work is supported in part by the national science foundation (grant number 1217473). any opinions, findings, and conclusions or recommendations expressed in this material are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of the sponsors.

 the georgia tech inventors have developed a flexible rotman lens-based rectifying antenna (rectenna) system capable, for the first time, of millimeter-wave harvesting in the 28-ghz band. (the rotman lens is key for beamforming networks and is frequently used in radar surveillance systems to see targets in multiple directions without physically moving the antenna system.) 
 but to harvest enough power to supply low-power devices at long ranges, large aperture antennas are required. the problem with large antennas is they have a narrowing field of view. this limitation prevents their operation if the antenna is widely dispersed from a 5g base station. 
 ""we've solved the problem of only being able to look from one direction with a system that has a wide angle of coverage,"" said senior researcher aline eid in the athena lab, established in georgia tech's 
 school of electrical and computer engineering 
 to advance and develop novel technologies for electromagnetic, wireless, rf, millimeter-wave, and sub-terahertz applications. 
 the findings were reported in the jan.12 issue of the journal 
 scientific reports . 
 the fcc has authorized 5g to focalize power much more densely compared with  previous generations of cellular networks. while today's 5g was built for high-bandwidth communication, the high-frequency network holds rich opportunity to ""harvest"" unused power that would otherwise be wasted. 
 tapping into 5g high-frequency power 
 ""with this innovation, we can have a large antenna, which works at higher frequencies and can receive power from any direction. it's direction-agnostic, which makes it a lot more practical,"" noted jimmy hester, senior lab advisor and the cto and co-founder of atheraxon, a georgia tech spinoff developing 5g radio-frequency identification (rfid) technology. 
 with the georgia tech solution, all the electromagnetic energy collected by the antenna arrays from one direction is combined and fed into a single rectifier, which maximizes its efficiency. 
 ""people have attempted to do energy harvesting at high frequencies like 24 or 35 gigahertz before,"" eid said, but such antennas only worked if they had line of sight to the 5g base station; there was no way to increase their angle of coverage until now. 
 operating just like an optical lens, the rotman lens provides six fields of view simultaneously in a pattern shaped like a spider. tuning the shape of the lens results in a structure with one angle of curvature on the beam-port side and another on the antenna side. this enables the structure to map a set of selected radiation directions to an associated set of beam-ports. the lens is then used as an intermediate component between the receiving antennas and the rectifiers for 5g energy harvesting. 
 this novel approach addresses the tradeoff between rectenna angular coverage and turn-on sensitivity with a structure that merges unique radio frequency (rf) and direct current (dc) combination techniques, thereby enabling a system with both high gain and large beamwidth. 
 in demonstrations, georgia tech's technology achieved a 21-fold increase in harvested power compared with a referenced counterpart, while maintaining identical angular coverage. 
 this robust system may open the door for new passive, long-range, mm-wave 5g-powered rfid for wearable and ubiquitous iot applications. the researchers used inhouse additive manufacturing to print the palm-sized mm-wave harvesters on a multitude of everyday flexible and rigid substrates. providing 3d and inkjet printing options will make the system more affordable and accessible to a broad range of users, platforms, frequencies, and applications. 
 replacing batteries with over-the-air charging 
 ""the fact is 5g is going to be everywhere, especially in urban areas. you can replace millions, or tens of millions, of batteries of wireless sensors, especially for smart city and smart agricultural applications,"" said 
 emmanouil (manos)tentzeris , ken byers professor in flexible electronics in the 
 school of electrical and computer engineering . 
 tentzeris predicts that power as a service will be the next big application for the telecom industry, just as data overtook voice services as a major revenue producer. 
 the research team is most excited by the prospect of service providers embracing this technology to offer power on demand ""over the air,"" eliminating the need for batteries. 
 ""i've been working on energy harvesting conventionally for at least six years, and for most of this time it didn't seem like there was a key to make energy harvesting work in the real world, because of fcc limits on power emission and focalization,"" hester said. ""with the advent of 5g networks, this could actually work and we've demonstrated it. that's extremely exciting - we could get rid of batteries."" 
 this work was supported by the air force research laboratory and the national science foundation (nsf) - emerging frontiers in research and innovation program. the work was performed in part at the georgia tech institute for electronics and nanotechnology, a member of the national nanotechnology coordinated infrastructure (nnci), which is supported by the nsf (grant eccs-1542174).

 a fortuitous slip in the lab leads to the creation of a monstrously large polymer brush

 - atlanta, ga 
 a lab goof with an enzyme taken from bacteria has led to the creation of the leviathan of polymer brushes, emerging biocompatible materials with the potential to repel infectious bacteria. 
 polymer brushes are surfaces normally covered with nanoscale bristles made of polymers, spaghetti-like molecular chains that are synthesized chemically. but  in a new study , a team led by researchers at the georgia institute of technology stumbled onto a biological technique to improve on the brushes by growing the bristles into giants 100 times the usual length. 
 ""we were putting the enzyme onto a surface to observe it for a totally different experiment, but we put too much on the surface too densely, and - boom - we ended up with the thickest, longest polymer brush we'd ever seen or heard of,"" said jennifer curtis, who led the study and is  an associate professor in georgia tech's school of physics . ""they were so big you could actually see them under an optical microscope instead of having to feel them with an  atomic force microscope  or use other methods needed for more customary polymer brushes."" 
 the researchers diverted attention from the original study to pursue the freakishly large new brush. 
 to bacteria encroaching on them, the brush's bristles are a virtually impenetrable, squishy thicket that keeps microbes out in lab observations. it hinders the spread of biofilms, bacterial colonies that join together to form a tough material that makes killing the bacteria difficult. 
 biofilm bulwark 
 ""the human immune system has a hard time with biofilms. antibiotics don't work very well on them either. in water filtration, biofilms can stick tenaciously, too. if you have a hyaluronan brush on a surface, a biofilm can't stick to it,"" curtis said. 
 hyaluronan, the compound in the bristles, is a polysaccharide, a chain of sugar molecules, and is naturally widespread in and around our cells. it is also known to many from its use in cosmetic moisturizers. 
 the enzyme that makes the hyaluronan bristles on the brush is  hyaluronan synthase , and it circumvents more tedious chemical synthesis by effortlessly extruding extremely long bristles. the enzymes also can replace bristles when they break off, something chemically synthesized brushes cannot do, which limits those brushes' durability. still, use of the synthase is unorthodox. 
 ""brush people say, ‘what are these enzymes doing here?' because they're looking for chemistry, and biologists wonder what the brush has to do with biology,"" curtis said. 
 the team published  the new study,  self-regenerating giant hyaluronan polymer  brushes,  in the journal  nature communications  in december 2019 . the research was funded by the national science foundation. 
 engineered  e. coli 
 the researchers engineered bacteria to overabundantly produce the enzyme by inserting hyaluronan synthase genes from the bacteria  streptococcus equisimilis  into  e. coli  then they harvested the enzyme. 
 ""we shattered the bacteria into a bunch of non-living gooey fragments then adhered their membrane to surfaces, and the synthase extruded the brushes,"" curtis said. 
 the enzymes can be switched on and off, and adjusting salt concentration or ph in the solution around the brushes makes the bristles extend to a straight form or curl up into a retracted form. functional additives like antibacterials could be embedded in brushes. 
 something like a catheter could conceivably one day be coated with brushes to remain bacteria-free, and the thickness of the wiggly brushes would also act as a lubricant by preventing frictive contact with the surface beneath them. some human cells key to the healing process are actually able to sink through the bristles, which could have potential for medicine. 
 ""for a chronic wound that won't heal, you may be able to design a bandage that encourages new cell growth but keeps bacteria out,"" curtis said. 
 biophysics research 
 the researchers' fortuitous detour into the giant brush has expanded possibilities for their original intent of studying enzymatic hyaluronan in isolation. 
 ""we constantly deal with the coupling of biochemistry, chemical signaling, and mechanics, so having something that isolates the mechanics from the signaling so we can focus on just the mechanics is really useful,"" curtis said. 
 wenbin wei and jessica faubel of georgia tech were the study's first authors. these researchers co-authored the study: hemaa selvakumar, daniel t. kovari, joanna tsao, amar t. mohabir, michelle krecker, and michael a. filler from georgia tech; felipe rivas, elaheh rahbar, and adam hall from the virginia tech-wake forest university school of biomedical engineering and sciences; and jennifer washburn and paul weigel from the university of oklahoma. the research was funded by the national science foundation (grants # 0955811, 1709897 and 1205878). any findings, conclusions, and recommendations are those of the authors and not necessarily of the national science foundation.

 - student center, 320 
 last friday the lbgtqia resource center hosted the second annual trans day of remembrance event at georgia tech.  trans day of remembrance commemorates and honors transgender people who have lost their lives to violence through the past year.  so far in 2016, twenty-four transgender people have been killed in the us, and the majority of these were trans women of color. 
 this year, the lgbtqia resource center hosted a special walk-through exhibit for all members of the georgia tech community. 
 ""trans day of remembrance events typically center around a vigil to honor the trans people we've lost to violence, ""said aby parsons, director of the lgbtqia resource center. ""this year, we wanted to provide a space for that commemoration to take place on tech's campus, but also to galvanize our community into action. everyone can play a part in creating classrooms, student organizations, workplaces, residence halls, athletics teams, and labs that are more inclusive and welcoming of transgender people."" 
 participants were invited to: 
 sit in quiet reflection in the vigil space where they learned about the trans people who have died this year 
 move through the information station where they learned facts and stats about trans communities in the u.s. and information about the climate for trans students and employees at tech 
 visit our action station to learn practical tips for creating a more trans-inclusive environment in your classroom, residence hall, workplace, or student organization 
 ""sometimes it can be hard to know how to show your support, so this self-guided workshop equiped attendees with some important information about trans people at tech and around the u.s., and then provide some practical action strategies for practicing trans allyship,"" said parsons. 
 pledge cards from the exhibit are on display outside the lbgtqia resource center for the remainder of the semester. the lbgtqia resource center, part of the division of student life and institute diversity is located in room 138, smithgall student services (flag) building.

 years from now when people want to know how certain issues were addressed and policies or laws were made, they will turn to records maintained by historians and archivists. the information captured in the archives will tell the stories. archivists at the georgia tech library are working to make sure the archives capture a range of voices so that a more complete picture will be available for future generations. 
 ""we are taking a critical look at our archival materials and identifying the holes,"" said amanda pellerin, university archivist with the library. ""we're putting our efforts into community building in specific ways, reaching out to specific member groups, so we can fill in some of those holes. at the same time, we still continue to offer an opportunity to look at georgia tech's policy and decision-making practices so that people can see why decisions were made."" 
 public speeches are widely available, but the details of what went into the decision making should be found in the archives to help understand the backstory, pellerin said. 
 ""archives tell stories. the stories we deemed to have enduring value are the ones we save,"" she said. ""giving something archival status means we're going to put all this effort, time, and money into keeping it and preserving it, making sure it never goes away - and then also providing the access to it for people who have an interest in knowing more. if you don't see yourself or things that you're interested in documented within the archives, that can be telling about who and what is valued. 
 ""we do not have collections from individual students who identify as members of the black, hispanic, or lgbtqia communities,"" pellerin said. ""the archives are not completely void of multiple experiences, but we want to make a concerted effort to be inclusive."" 
 pellerin said there is talk among archivists regarding how to handle topics that are sensitive and traumatic, because those topics also need to be documented. 
 ""we know life isn't always roses and sunshine, but a lot of times archives will skew toward the celebration of milestones and achievements that are put into a positive light,"" she said. ""even with desegregation of georgia tech's campus, a lot of times it gets condensed into 'georgia tech was the first campus to integrate without a court order in the deep south.' that statement is not untrue, but it is simplified. it also takes the focus off the three men who came to this campus and their struggle to get here."" 
 the library's archives include correspondence between the institute and its first black applicants, as well as 
 atlanta journal-constitution 
 articles and opinion pieces from that period. the archives also have material documenting the first women students, early efforts to organize the lgbtqia community, and the first international students. 
 ""going back into the early 20th century, we have evidence of georgia tech being probably more diverse than we thought,"" pellerin said. ""i pulled logbooks and found two students from cuba were here in 1905 and 1906. and between 1916 and 1922 there were probably two dozen students from south america. there also were students from japan, greece, and syria."" 
 the 
 bulletin , a former georgia tech publication, released a version in spanish in 1917 to help admission recruit spanish-speaking students. 
 these archival materials are available for viewing in the archives reading room on the first floor of crosland tower. the materials do not leave the room, which is proctored by library staff to make sure the information doesn't get damaged or lost and is available for the next person. 
 and, the library will continue efforts to gather historical material from a variety of sources on and off campus. 
 ""a lot of trust goes into turning over your own important papers,"" pellerin said. ""it's not just that we want to collect these groups because they'll tell their story; it tells us more about the whole campus and its approaches to policy. as an archivist it's my job to make sure i'm casting a wide net. i can look at the coverage of those records and see that other voices should also be included."" 
 note: if you have material from your or a family member's time at georgia tech, the archives would like to talk to you about donating them.

life-saving-avalanche-early-warning-system.txt,"a life-saving avalanche early warning system 
 georgia tech aerospace engineering student mirza samnani volunteered more than 1,000 hours to develop early warning systems for avalanches in tajikistan. 
 dec 01, 2022 
 - atlanta, ga 
 mirza samnani has a passion for using his engineering skill set to help people. recently, the georgia tech aerospace engineering master's student volunteered more than 1,000 hours over 10 months to develop early warning systems for avalanches in central asia. 
 samnani hiked over 9,200 feet - three times - to install two weather stations in the remote village of manem in tajikistan. this project has the potential to affect more than 1 million people in hundreds of villages in the high mountainous regions of central and south asia including tajikistan, afghanistan, and pakistan that are prone to avalanches every winter. it can also be scaled to other parts of the world where avalanches pose a high risk. 
 samnani was contacted by a member of 
 madad , a nonprofit organization that works to save lives within impoverished communities that are especially vulnerable to climate change. the group came across his previous 
 work building life-saving robots 
 for a hospital in his hometown of mumbai, india, during the pandemic. seeing his love for helping others and his engineering skills, they invited samnani to join madad. 
 high mountain regions in central asia, karakoram, hindu-kush, and the himalayas are prone to snow avalanches, whose frequency and intensity are expected to increase due to atmospheric warming. the lack of a village-level avalanche early warning system poses a significant challenge in providing forewarning to communities for timely action to avert disaster. currently, local volunteers manage weather monitoring posts, where they manually track temperature, rainfall, and snow depth. 
 the early warning system samnani worked on has seven different sensors that monitor weather and environmental conditions, including wind speed and direction, atmospheric pressure, temperature, humidity, rainfall, snowfall, solar radiation from the sun, solar radiation absorbed from the ground, snow depth, and seismic activity. these conditions help calculate the snowpack parameters and, based on the trigger threshold, the algorithm determines when to disseminate an alert or warning. 
 the project faced uncertainty because of the rough terrain as well as strict regulations and policies in the region, requiring heavy modifications and flexibility in adapting to local environments. even after extensive testing, communication and power issues occurred, but these problems ended up serving as learning opportunities that ultimately improved the system. 
 ""this project presented me with a unique opportunity to utilize my engineering and ai skills to develop a system to predict the risk of an avalanche and save lives of some of the most vulnerable people on the planet. in just 10 months our engineering team took this project from concept to installation. i am excited for the data that we will receive from these pilot units in the upcoming months. i plan to continue to work with this project and other important projects that will help improve the quality of life for people living in poor or dangerous conditions,"" samnani said. 
 currently, he and the group are collecting and monitoring the data being received from each warning system tower and studying the integrity and performance of the towers in collaboration with avalanche experts from the gallatin national forest avalanche center in montana and the colorado avalanche information center in boulder. in the next few years, more of these stations will be deployed to cover more than 600 high-risk villages in central and south asia and eventually will incorporate sirens and text and phone alerts.

 georgia smart communities challenge helps small and large cities improve quality of life. 
 albany, chamblee, chatham county and gwinnett county won the georgia smart communities challenge, a georgia tech-led initiative that brings together industry and public agencies to help local governments. 
 jun 12, 2018 
 - albany, ga 
 while the four georgia communities represent different parts of the state, their leaders expressed a similar goal: improve the quality of life for residents. 
 the cities of albany and chamblee and the counties of chatham and gwinnett will soon embark on year-long projects to address housing blight, traffic and transportation woes and sea level rise along georgia's coast. these projects are supported through the georgia smart communities challenge, a georgia tech-led initiative that brings together industry and public agencies to support large and small neighborhoods in their efforts to implement cutting-edge smart technologies. 
 georgia tech president g.p. ""bud"" peterson and other state leaders traveled to albany tuesday to 
 announce the four winners . 
 ""georgia tech is very proud to have played a role in this program, which we believe will improve the quality of life in the participating communities and also provide models for other communities throughout our state to consider as they strive to make life better for their citizens,"" peterson said. 
 the program provides seed funding and access to technical assistance, expert advice and a network of peers. a georgia tech researcher will advise and conduct research in support of each group's goals. 
 the teams will each receive $50,000 in grants and $25,000 from georgia tech in research support. the selected communities each raised an additional $50,000. 
 georgia power is the lead sponsor of the program, with additional financial support from the atlanta regional commission. 
 in albany, the city and its collaborators will establish an efficient inventory of key community housing and associated infrastructure conditions. city leaders said this housing resiliency project will provide them with the data to make sure resources are being spent and allocated in ways that will result in the biggest positive impact. 
 ""this program allows us to be part of work that is on the cutting edge and will prepare our community for the future,"" albany mayor dorothy hubbard said. ""it means so much for the community to know we have georgia tech behind us and that this is a project we should be doing."" 
 the gwinnett county project will evaluate traffic management technologies for improved vehicle mobility throughout the region. the technology will improve safety and connectivity. for this project to succeed, the county needs to make sure it's investing in the right hardware and technology, said vince edwards, project coordinator with the gwinnett county department of transportation. 
 ""this an opportunity for us to work with the premier research institution in the state and have access to world-class talent,"" he said. ""we know working with georgia tech and the other partners will help us make sure we are successful."" 
 georgia smart organizers expect the strategies developed by the selected communities will serve as models that could be implemented elsewhere across the state. 
 the program is just one part of the work georgia tech is doing in this area. the institute has partnered with the city of atlanta since 2015 to design, implement and study smart city initiatives. 
 ""for us, georgia smart represents a great opportunity to branch out to other parts of our state,"" peterson said. 
 work on the projects will begin in september and continue through september 2019. 
 georgia tech will conduct site visits to the four communities and hold workshops, conference calls and other activities to support the projects, said debra lam, managing director of 
 smart cities and inclusive innovation 
 at georgia tech. 
 ""creating and implementing smart communities is hard work and it's difficult,"" she said. ""but we know we're on the right path when we are purposely empowering local communities themselves with data and technology."" 
 additional georgia smart partners include: association county commissioners of georgia, georgia centers for innovation, georgia chamber of commerce, georgia department of community affairs, georgia municipal association, global city challenges, metro atlanta chamber and technology association of georgia.

 albany housing data analytics and visualization initiative 
 lead: albany 
 collaborators: department of community and economic development; dougherty county; albany, georgia initiative for community housing; and fight albany blight 
 this initiative seeks to bridge the gap between available data and the need for a comprehensive, flexible and accurate database to effectively manage the albany housing inventory. the end result will allow a better measurement of public funds allocated for housing and neighborhood structure repairs and enhancements, using an automated data analytics and visualization tool. the initiative also allows the city and its collaborators to engage with residents and become part of the solution to the communities' housing issues. 
 assigned georgia tech researcher: omar isaac asensio, assistant professor in the school of public policy. 
 shared autonomous vehicle study 
 lead: chamblee 
 collaborators: doraville, marta, stantec and assembly community improvement district (cid) 
 this project will study improvements in mobility through the use of shared autonomous vehicles, which travel from marta stations into the community. this option will reduce road congestion, increase pedestrian and traveler safety and improve equity in the community. while the project will look at challenges surrounding the ""last mile"" - getting from a transportation hub to a final destination - there will be additional implications. the research will look at the potential impacts of autonomous vehicle technology on land use, attracting residents and employees, expanding access to marta, prioritizing pedestrian and bike mobility; and improving public health. 
 assigned georgia tech researcher: ellen dunham-jones, professor in the school of architecture. 
 smart sea level tools for emergency planning and response 
 lead: chatham county 
 collaborators: savannah and creative coast 
 this project will develop and test a pilot sensor network for measuring sea level flood risk during natural disasters and storms. sea level rise presents a risk to coastal communities and those risks become more pronounced during hurricane landfalls when extreme flooding exacts a major toll on public safety and key infrastructure. the proposed sensor network will improve flood warnings, emergency response action plans and predictions for future flood events. this project is considered the first of its kind for the region, and the expectation is it will serve as a model for future smart designs along georgia's coastline. 
 assigned georgia tech researcher: kim cobb, georgia power chair and professor in the school of earth and atmospheric sciences. 
 connected vehicle technology master plan

 a novel three-dimensional solar cell design will soon get its first testing in space aboard the international space station.

 - atlanta, ga 
 a novel three-dimensional solar cell design developed at georgia tech will soon get its first testing in space aboard the international space station. an experimental module containing 18 test cells was launched to the iss on july 18, and will be installed on the exterior of the station to study the cells' performance and their ability to withstand the rigors of space. in addition to testing the three-dimensional format, the module will also study a low-cost copper-zinc-tin-sulfide (czts) solar cell formulation. in all, the module launched to the iss contains four types of pv devices: 3-d cells based on conventional cadmium telluride, 3-d cells based on czts materials, traditional planar solar cells produced at georgia tech, and planar cells based on czts. the experiment was aboard spacex's falcon 9 rocket that blasted off at 12:45 a.m. edt from cape canaveral air force station in florida. ""we want to see both the light-trapping performance of our 3-d solar cells and how they are going to respond to the harshness of space,"" said jud ready, a principal research engineer at the 
 georgia tech research institute 
 (gtri) and an adjunct professor in the georgia tech 
 school of materials science and engineering . ""we will also measure performance against temperature, because temperature has an influence on the performance of a solar cell."" built by coating miniature carbon nanotube ""towers"" with a photo-absorber that captures sunlight from all angles, the 3-d cells developed by ready's lab could boost the amount of power obtained from the small surface areas many spacecraft have. the cells would absorb light from any direction, eliminating the need for mechanical devices to aim pv modules toward the sun. the pv cell experiment will be installed on the nanoracks external platform (nrep), where robustness of the solar cells will be studied under harsh space conditions for six months. the project is sponsored by the center for the advancement of science in space (casis), and the space station opportunity was provided by nanoracks via its space act agreement with nasa's u.s. national labs. ""the czts photovoltaic arrays were built using the readily available elements copper, zinc, tin and sulfur to replace rarer cigs - copper, indium, gallium and selenium - which are used in similar thin-film solar cells,"" said ready. ""the czts approach produces an efficient photo-absorber using earth-abundant materials that cost around a thousand times less than rare-earth elements like indium, gallium and selenium."" one virtue of czts photovoltaic material is its electron band structure, ready explained. like cigs, czts is a direct band gap material. in semiconductor physics, this means incoming solar photons are able to emit current-producing electrons directly, rather than moving through power-robbing intermediate states as indirect band gap materials, like silicon, require. moreover, ready said, direct band gap materials have good resistance to the powerful ionizing radiation encountered in space. that's because direct band gaps are larger than indirect band gaps; it's harder for radiation to damage these larger gaps so severely that functionality is seriously impaired. the 3-d capability could prove especially valuable on the international space station, which is exposed daily to 15-16 sunrises and sunsets as it orbits earth every 92 minutes at 17,150 m.p.h. the 3-d towers can exploit the sun's rays for longer periods than conventional 2-d planar - or flat - designs, which work most efficiently only when the sun is directly overhead. ""with our 3-d design, as the sun's angle increases more surface is exposed and there's a growing chance that photons will enter,"" ready said. ""also, 3-d technology provides more opportunity for photons to bounce around between the towers, increasing the likelihood they will be converted to electron hole pairs and produce mobile charge carriers."" as the iss orbits, the 3-d arrays' performance will be compared to a high quality commercial 2-d planar cell array installed nearby. if things go as expected, gtri's cells will provide relatively better performance than the other cells as they move away from high noon. the new czts 3-d arrays will also be tested in space against an older 3-d design made by gtri using cadmium telluride. one of the gtri development team's key achievements to date has been identifying the best ways to manufacture czts solar cells. the team has pinpointed techniques for successfully processing the four earth-abundant elements into an efficient photo absorber. ""in manufacturing you have to heat these elements, and one major issue is that they evaporate at different rates,"" ready explained. ""getting them to blend in the desired ratios, so that the stoichiometry is retained and electron levels of the constituent elements match up as they should, has been a challenge."" gtri's photovoltaic arrays will be encased in lexan containers aboard the iss. lexan, a clear yet strong polymer, produces minimal interference with incoming solar rays but can protect the delicate arrays from astronauts and space debris - and also protect the crew from any pieces of the arrays that might separate. after the six-month mission, the solar cells will be sent back to earth via a cargo ship. the research team will assess the cells' post-mission performance and look for damage from radiation and other space hazards. ""if it can survive in space, which is the harshest of environments from the standpoint of wide temperature swings, radiation and numerous other factors, then we can be confident it will work well down on earth,"" ready said. ready's novel 3-d photovoltaic technology (u.s. patent # 8,350,146) is licensed for commercial manufacture by bloo solar of el dorado hills, ca. research news georgia institute of technology 177 north avenue atlanta, georgia 30332-0181 usa media relations contacts : john toon ( jtoon@gatech.edu ) (404-894-6986) or ben brumfield ( ben.brumfield@comm.gatech.edu ) (404-385-1933) writer : rick robinson

 - atlanta, ga 
 after five and a half years at georgia tech, including seven semesters of co-op, lily huff is graduating with a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering with a concentration in design. and she is eager to go. 
 ""that last semester really hit hard, and i can't wait to get out,"" said huff, whose co-op work included two semesters with gulfstream aerospace corporation and four semesters with the georgia tech research institute (gtri). 
 even though it was hard, and she graduated ""late,"" huff said she wouldn't do it any differently. 
 ""i used to resent having to work through college because it meant taking more time to graduate and not spending as much time on classes or with friends,"" she said. ""but the experience has led to some great friendships, funny memories, and my full-time job with gtri."" 
 after graduating, huff will work with gtri as a research engineer, designing and testing systems for the military. 
 ""through gtri, i will continue my education with plans to come back for a master's degree and potentially a ph.d.,"" she said. 
 huff grew up hearing stories about georgia tech from her father, joseph, who graduated in 1994 with a degree in chemical engineering. ""my father became the driving force for why i love tech and decided to come here,"" she said. huff's younger sister, aria, a tech student in electrical and computer engineering, will graduate in a year and a half. 
 the huff family now lives in covington, georgia, but she attended high school at the alabama school of fine arts in birmingham, where she graduated with a specialty in math and science. she decided to put her love of math to good use in mechanical engineering. 
 ""i was always known as the jack-of-all-trades growing up, so i thought a mechanical engineering degree would be a starting point,"" she said. 
 huff has a variety of interests outside the classroom. 
 ""i love working on old cars, like a typical mechanical engineer,"" she said. she also enjoys working on art projects as an outlet for her design interests which include photography, creating outlandish coolers, knitting, and upcycling or re-imagining old clothes. 
 what will she miss most from her college experience? the people. ""the pandemic took away my last few years of college, which means i didn't get to meet - in person - the professors of my favorite classes that made the largest impact on me, say goodbye to the friends who graduated before me and helped me survive tech, or truly get to know and hang out with the friends i developed the strongest bonds with,"" she said. 
 with college behind her for now, huff is ready for her next chapter. it begins by walking across the commencement stage, as she has seen countless times while supporting her friends. ""walking across that stage is the culmination of years of working long nights and stressing over everything to reach the end of an era and the beginning of my future,"" she said. 
 huff's parents, sister, one set of grandparents, and several friends will attend commencement.

 oct 09, 2023 
 charles darwin said that evolution was constantly happening, causing animals to adapt for survival. but many of his contemporaries disagreed. if evolution is always causing things to change, they asked, then how is it that two fossils from the same species, found in the same location, can look identical despite being 50 million years apart in age? 
 everything changed in the past 40 years, when an explosion of evolutionary studies proved that evolution can and does occur rapidly - even from one generation to the next. evolutionary biologists were thrilled, but the findings reinforced the same paradox: if evolution can happen so fast, then why do most species on earth continue to appear the same for many millions of years? 
 this is known as the paradox of stasis, and 
 james stroud , assistant professor in the 
 school of biological sciences 
 at the georgia institute of technology, set out to investigate it. he conducted a long-term study in a community of lizards, measuring how evolution unfolds in the wild across multiple species. in doing so, he may have found the answer to one of evolution's greatest challenges.

looking-back-time-watch-different-kind-black-hole.txt,"looking back in time to watch for a different kind of black hole 
 a new simulation may help astronomers watch for signals indicating the formation of black holes in early galaxies.

 black holes form when stars die, allowing the matter in them to collapse into an extremely dense object from which not even light can escape. astronomers theorize that massive black holes could also form at the birth of a galaxy, but so far nobody has been able to look far enough back in time to observe the conditions creating these direct collapse black holes (dcbh). 
 the james webb space telescope, scheduled for launch in 2021, might be able look far enough back into the early universe to see a galaxy hosting a nascent massive black hole. now, a simulation done by researchers at the georgia institute of technology has suggested what astronomers should look for if they search the skies for a dcbh in its early stages. 
 the first-of-its-kind simulation, reported september 10 in the journal nature astronomy, suggests that direct formation of these black holes would be accompanied by specific kinds of intense radiation, including x-rays and ultraviolet emission that would shift to infrared by the time they reach the telescope. the black holes would also likely spawn massive metal-free stars, a finding that was unexpected. 
 the research was supported by nasa, the los alamos national laboratory, the national science foundation, the southern regional education board and two hubble theory grants. 
 ""there are supermassive black holes at the center of many large galaxies, but we haven't been able to observe the way they form or how they got that large,"" said kirk s. s. barrow, the paper's first author and a recent ph.d. graduate of georgia tech's school of physics. ""scientists have theorized that these supermassive black holes could have formed at the birth of a galaxy, and we wanted to turn these theoretical predictions into observational predictions that could be seen by the james webb space telescope."" 
 dcbh formation would be initiated by the collapse of a large cloud of gas during the early formation of a galaxy, said 
 john h. wise , a professor in georgia tech's 
 school of physics 
 and the center for relativistic astrophysics. but before astronomers could hope to catch this formation, they would have to know what to look for in the spectra that the telescope could detect, which is principally infrared. 
 the formation of a black hole could require a million years or so, but to envision what that might have looked like, former postdoctoral researcher aycin aykutalp - now at los alamos national laboratory - used the national science foundation-supported stampede supercomputer at the university of texas at austin to run a simulation focusing on the aftermath of dcbh formation. the simulation used physics first principles such as gravity, radiation and hydrodynamics. 
 ""if the galaxy forms first and then the black hole forms in the center, that would have one type of signature,"" said wise, who is the dunn family associate professor in the school of physics. ""if the black hole formed first, would that have a different signature? we wanted to find out whether there would be any physical differences, and if so, whether that would translate into differences we could observe with the james webb space telescope."" 
 the simulations provided information such as densities and temperatures, and barrow converted that data into predictions for what might be observed through the telescope - the light likely to be observed and how it would affected by gas and dust it would have encountered on its long journey to earth. ""at the end, we had something that an observer could hopefully see,"" barrow said. 
 black holes take about a million years to form, a blip in galactic time. in the dcbh simulation, that first step involves gas collapsing into a supermassive star as much as 100,000 times more massive than our sun. the star then undergoes gravitational instability and collapses into itself to form a massive black hole. radiation from the black hole then triggers the formation of stars over period of about 500,000 years, the simulation suggested. 
 ""the stars of this first generation are usually much more massive, so they live for a shorter period of time,"" wise said. ""in the first five to six million years after their formation, they die and go supernova. that's another one of the signatures that we report in this study."" 
 after the supernovae form, the black hole quiets down but creates a struggle between electromagnetic emissions - ultraviolet light and x-rays trying to escape - and the black hole's own gravity. ""these cycles go on for another 20 or 30 million years,"" wise said. 
 black holes are relatively common in the universe, so the hope is that with enough snapshots, astronomers could catch one being born, and that could lead to a new understanding of how galaxies evolve over time. 
 star formation around the dcbh was unexpected, but in hindsight, it makes sense, barrow said. the ionization produced by the black holes would produce photochemical reactions able to trigger the formation of the stars. metal-free stars tend to be larger than others because the absence of a metal such as iron prevents fragmentation. but because they are so large, these stars produce tremendous amounts of radiation and end their lives in supernovae, he said. 
 ""this is one of the last great mysteries of the early universe,"" barrow said. ""we hope this study provides a good step toward figuring out how these supermassive black holes formed at the birth of a galaxy."" 
 this research was supported by a southern regional education board doctoral fellowship, a lanl ldrd exploratory research grant 20170317er, national science foundation (nsf) grants ast-1333360 and ast-1614333, hubble theory grants hst-ar-13895 and hst-ar-14326, and nasa grant nnx-17ag23g. any opinions, findings, and conclusions or recommendations expressed in this material are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of the sponsoring organizations.

looking-entangled-atoms-bose-einstein-condensate.txt,"looking for entangled atoms in a bose-einstein condensate 
 using a bose-einstein condensate composed of sodium atoms, georgia tech researchers have observed a sharp magnetically-induced quantum phase transition where they expect to find entangled atomic pairs.

 - atlanta, ga 
 using a bose-einstein condensate composed of millions of sodium atoms, researchers at the georgia institute of technology have observed a sharp magnetically-induced quantum phase transition where they expect to find entangled atomic pairs. the work moves scientists closer to an elusive entangled state that would have potential sensing and computing applications beyond its basic science interests. 
 the use of entangled atoms from a condensate could improve the sensitivity and reduce the noise in sensing very small changes in physical properties such as magnetic fields or rotation. and it could also provide a foundation for quantum computers able to perform certain calculations much faster than conventional digital computers. 
 sponsored by the national science foundation, the research was reported january 23 as a rapid communication in the journal 
 physical review a . 
 ""we have defined a window where we expect to be able to observe entanglement,"" said 
 chandra raman , an associate professor in the georgia tech 
 school of physics . ""we now know where to look for it, and we know how to look for it."" 
 raman and former graduate student anshuman vinit have been studying bose-einstein condensates (becs) as a source of entanglement, seeking to take advantage of the system's quantum purity to create conditions where correlation between atoms might occur. becs don't normally contain entangled atoms. 
 ""we found ways to engineer the system to create entanglement,"" raman explained. ""we looked at the behavior of the system as we tuned the magnetic field very close to the phase boundary and showed that the boundary had a very sharply defined point. we were able to resolve that boundary with a level of uncertainty we didn't think we could get until we did the experiment."" 
 theoretical predictions have suggested that at the boundary between different magnetic phases of a spinor bose-einstein condensate, scientists would find an entangled quantum state of all the atoms. in spinor bose-einstein condensates, the individual magnetic moments do not need to have a well-defined orientation in space, but rather, can exist in a superposition of different orientations. 
 in their experiment, the researchers identified two phases: antiferromagnetic and polar. in the polar phase, the atoms all align their moments vertically, while in the antiferromagnetic phase, they are horizontally aligned.  in a bec exactly at the boundary between these phases, theorists had predicted the existence of a quantum mechanical superposition of all possible alignments, an entangled state. 
 the researchers haven't yet observed that entangled state yet, but their work so far has defined an experimental window within which to look for new physical effects governing different magnetic phases, or to generate entangled states that are relevant for quantum-based systems. 
 earlier research in raman's lab had produced the two phases, but the boundary between them was ""smeared out"" by magnetic field inhomogeneities. by smoothing out the magnetic field so that it was more uniform, the researchers were able to eliminate the variations to produce a sharp boundary between the phases. 
 in the narrowly-defined transition area identified in the research, atoms are torn between the two phases, causing entangled pairs to form, raman said. the state may be stable enough to find practical applications, though scientists won't know for sure until they actually can observe and measure the properties. 
 the researchers measured the boundary in their system by ""jumping"" the magnetic field from one part of the bec to another. the move created a dynamical instability in the atomic system; the larger the instability, the less time the system required to return to equilibrium, as predicted by quantum theory. 
 the researchers now believe they've set the stage for observing entanglement in a smaller groups of atoms, perhaps no more than a thousand. 
 ""at our current sensitivity, we think we could observe these spin-correlated states with a reasonable number of particles,"" raman said. ""we think that is experimentally feasible, and since we can measure the boundary with precision, we can begin to test the theories governing behavior in this regime."" 
 once that's shown, the large ensemble of atoms could be broken down into many smaller groups operating independently, each with phase boundaries containing entangled atoms. 
 though raman finds the basic science and quantum computing interesting, he is equally excited about potential sensing applications. 
 ""if you could reduce the noise level through the clever use of quantum mechanical superpositions, you could realize sensors that are more precise and could detect smaller effects,"" he said. ""in quantum sensing you could use entanglement to increase the precision of measurements to levels that, in classical sensor systems, would have a higher noise level."" 
 in classical oscillating systems such as coin tosses, each flip is an independent system and has a certain level of noise. but because of the correlation, the atomic pairs would no longer be independent systems. 
 ""in an ordinary classical system, there's a certain amount of noise that has to do with the fact that you are making measurements on independent systems,"" he said. ""in quantum systems, it is possible to suppress that noise if the atoms are correlated. it's as if the coins were talking to one another."" 
 quantum sensors might therefore be able to detect changes in rotation or magnetic variation that are too small for today's sensors. other applications could be found in spectroscopic measurement, raman said.

m87-one-year-later-proof-persistent-black-hole-shadow.txt,"m87* one year later: proof of a persistent black hole shadow 
 the event horizon telescope (eht) collaboration has released new images of m87*, the supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy messier 87, using data from observations taken in april 2018. 
 jan 18, 2024 
 this press release is 
 shared jointly 
 with the event horizon telescope newsroom. 
 the event horizon telescope (eht) collaboration has released new images of m87*, the supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy messier 87, using data from observations taken in april 2018. 
 with the participation of the newly commissioned greenland telescope and a dramatically improved recording rate across the array, the 2018 observations give researchers a view of the source independent from the first observations in 2017. 
 ""this persistence is a remarkable confirmation of our earlier interpretation that the eht images do reveal the shadow of the black hole - and strengthens the tests of einstein's theories that we have performed,"" says 
 dimitrios psaltis , professor in the 
 school of physics 
 at the 
 georgia institute of technology 
 who served as eht project scientist at the time of the 2019 announcement. 
 psaltis and georgia tech school of physics chair 
 feryal özel 
 are members of the eht collaboration, and are the scientists who developed many of the theoretical tools to analyze and interpret the images. 
 ""modeling the image features of this black hole across observations that span many years - and comparing them to the images of the black hole in the center of our milky way - already provide powerful checks on our plasma models"" says özel, who led the 2022 announcement of the image of the milky way black hole. 
 new era of black hole imaging 
 a 
 recent paper 
 published in the journal 
 astronomy & astrophysics 
 presents the team's new images from the 2018 data that reveal a familiar ring the same size as the one observed in 2017. this bright ring surrounds a deep central depression, ""the shadow of the black hole,"" as predicted by general relativity. excitingly, the brightness peak of the ring has shifted by about 30º compared to the images from 2017, which is consistent with our theoretical understanding of variability from turbulent material around black holes. 
 ""a fundamental requirement of science is to be able to reproduce results,"" says 
 keiichi asada , an associate research fellow at academia sinica institute for astronomy and astrophysics in taiwan. ""confirmation of the ring in a completely new data set is a huge milestone for our collaboration and a strong indication that we 
 are looking at a black hole shadow and the material orbiting around it."" 
 in 2017, the eht took the first image of a black hole. this object, m87*, is the beating heart of the giant elliptical galaxy messier 87 and lives 55 million light years away from earth. the image of the black hole revealed a bright circular ring, brighter in the southern part of the ring. further analysis of the data also revealed the structure of m87* in polarized light, giving us greater insight into the geometry of the magnetic field and the nature of the plasma around the black hole. 
 the new era of black hole direct imaging, spearheaded by the extensive analysis of the 2017 observations of m87*, opened a new window that let researchers investigate black hole astrophysics and allow them to test the theory of general relativity at a fundamental level. 
 ""our theoretical models tell us that the state of the material around m87* should be uncorrelated between 2017 and 2018,"" eht researchers 
 explain . ""thus, multiple observations of m87* will help us place independent constraints on the plasma and magnetic field structure around the black hole and help us disentangle the complicated astrophysics from the effects of general relativity."" 
 greenland telescope 
 to help accomplish new and exciting science, the eht is under continuous development. the greenland telescope joined the eht for the first time in 2018, just five months after its construction was completed far above the arctic circle. this new telescope significantly improved the image fidelity of the eht array, improving the coverage, particularly in the north-south direction. the large millimeter telescope also participated for the first time with its full 50 m surface, greatly improving its sensitivity. the eht array was also upgraded to observe in four frequency bands around 230 ghz, compared to only two bands in 2017. 
 repeated observations with an improved array are essential to demonstrate the robustness of our findings and strengthen our confidence in our results.  in addition to the groundbreaking science, the eht also serves as a technology testbed for cutting-edge developments in high-frequency radio interferometry. 
 ""advancing scientific endeavors requires continuous enhancement in data quality and analysis techniques,"" says 
 rohan dahale , a ph.d. candidate at the 
 instituto de astrofísica de andalucía 
 (iaa-csic) in spain. ""the inclusion of the greenland telescope in our array filled critical gaps in our earth-sized telescope. the 2021, 2022, and the forthcoming 2024 observations witness improvements to the array, fueling our enthusiasm to push the frontiers of black hole astrophysics."" 
 remarkably similar 
 the analysis of the 2018 data features eight independent imaging and modeling techniques, including methods used in the previous 2017 analysis of m87* and new ones developed from the collaboration's experience analyzing sgr a*. 
 the eht team explains that the image of m87* taken in 2018 is remarkably similar to what they saw in 2017. ""we see a bright ring of the same size, with a dark central region and one side of the ring brighter than the other. the mass and distance of m87* will not appreciably increase throughout a human lifetime, so general relativity predicts that the ring diameter should stay the same from year to year. the stability of the measured diameter in the images from 2017 to 2018 robustly supports the conclusion that m87* is well described by general relativity."" 
 mass matters, brightness peak 
 ""one of the remarkable properties of a black hole is that its radius is strongly dependent on only one quantity: its mass,"" says 
 nitika yadlapalli yurk , a former graduate student at the california institute of technology (caltech), now a postdoctoral fellow at the nasa jet propulsion laboratory (jpl) in california. ""since m87* is not accreting material (which would increase its mass) at a rapid rate, general relativity tells us that its radius will remain fairly unchanged over human history. it's pretty exciting to see that our data confirm this prediction."" 
 while the size of the black hole shadow did not change between 2017 and 2018, the location of the brightest region around the ring did change significantly, the team adds. the bright region rotated about 30º counterclockwise to settle in the bottom right part of the ring at about the 5 o'clock position. 
 historical observations of m87* with a less sensitive array and fewer telescopes also indicated that the shadow structure changes yearly (wielgus 2020, apj, 
 901 , 
 67 ) but with less precision. while the 2018 eht array still cannot observe the jet emerging from m87*, the black hole spin axis predicted from the location of the brightest region around the ring is more consistent with the jet axis seen at other wavelengths. 
 ""the biggest change, that the brightness peak shifted around the ring, is actually something we predicted when we published the first results in 2019,"" says 
 britt jeter , a postdoctoral fellow at academia sinica institute for astronomy and astrophysics in taiwan. ""while general relativity says the ring size should stay pretty fixed, the emission from the turbulent, messy accretion disk around the black hole will cause the brightest part of the ring to wobble around a common center. the amount of wobble we see over time is something we can use to test our theories for the magnetic field and plasma environment around the black hole."" 
 2024 and beyond 
 ""while all the eht papers published so far have featured an analysis of our first observations in 2017,"" the research team adds, ""this result represents the first efforts to explore the many additional years of data the eht collaboration has collected."" in addition to 2017 and 2018, the eht conducted successful observations in 2021 and 2022 and is scheduled to observe in the first half of 2024. each year, the eht array has improved in some way, either through the addition of new telescopes, better hardware, or additional observing frequencies. ""within the collaboration, we are working very hard to analyze all this data and are excited to show you more results in the future.""

 mechanical rehab device taps a person's wrist while creating a signal in brain. the signals overlap int he brain and move and the wrist. 
 a pneumatic actuator tendon hammer hits a person's wrist while a transcranial magnetic stimulator creates a weak signal in the brain's motor cortex. the responses overlap in the brain, produce and send a strong signal back to the arm, and the wrist moves. 
 jul 16, 2014 
 - atlanta, ga 
 the repetitive facilitation exercise (rfe) is one of the most common rehabilitation tactics for stroke patients attempting to regain wrist movement. stroke hemiparesis individuals are not able to move that part of their body because they cannot create a strong enough neural signal that travels from the brain to the wrist. with rfe, however, patients get a mental boost. they are asked to think about moving. at the same time, a practitioner flexes the wrist. the goal is to send a long latency response from the stretch that arrives in the brain at the exact time the thought happens, creating a neural signal. the result is a strong, combined response that zips back to the forearm muscles and moves the wrist. it all happens in a span of approximately 40 to 60 milliseconds. ""timing is everything. when the window is that small, it's not easy for two people to match each other,"" said georgia institute of technology master's graduate lauren lacey. that's why lacey and a team of fellow georgia tech researchers created a 
 mechanical device that takes people out of the process , replacing them with accurate computers. their functional mri-compatible hemiparesis rehab device creates a long latency stretch reflex at the exact time as a brain signal. ""it's kind of like trying to fill a bucket with water,"" explained minoru shinohara, an associate professor in the school of applied physiology and director of the human neuromuscular physiology lab. ""stroke individuals can only mentally fill it halfway. the machine pours in the rest to make it full."" so far, the research team has worked only with healthy individuals in their study. study participants lie on a bed with the arm extended beneath a pneumatic actuator tendon hammer. in order to simulate the weak signal created by hemiparesis individuals to move their wrist, a transcranial magnetic stimulator (tms) is placed on the heads of these healthy individuals at a 45-degree angle. milliseconds after the hammer taps the wrist's tendon, the tms creates a weak signal in the motor cortex. the responses overlap, produce and send a strong signal back to the arm, and the wrist moves. the team has successfully varied the timing of the tms signal and speed of the hammer to strike faster or slower depending on how much of a boost is needed to complement the brain signal. now that the researchers have proven the viability of the tms-actuator system, they will next work with stroke individuals. ""the device is designed to adapt to people whether they are hyper, normo or hyporeflexive,"" said lacey, who graduated in spring with a master's degree from the george woodruff school of mechanical engineering. also, because the machine is mri-compatible, it will allow the team to study what is happening in the brain during rehab, opening the door for robotics. ""once we fully understand what is happening mentally and physiologically, we should be able to create a robot that can reproduce successful rehabilitative exercises such as rfe,"" said jun ueda, an associate professor in the school of mechanical engineering. ""it appears that the timing is the critical piece of this exercise. robots are great at timing, so the results are very promising for robotics."" the georgia tech team was assisted by researchers at japan's kagoshima university, kazumi kawahira, megumi shimodozono and yong yu, who originally performed clinical studies of conventional rfe. the device was presented at the 
 design of medical devices conference 
 in minneapolis, minnesota this spring. this research was partially supported by the national science foundation (nsf) under sub-award eec 0540834. any conclusions expressed are those of the principal investigator and may not necessarily represent the official views of the nsf.

man-behind-maps.txt,"the man behind the maps 
 hundreds of maps detail the tech campus. doug sims sees endless opportunities to utilize data to keep the community informed. 
 senior systems support engineer for infrastructure and sustainability doug sims flags an upcoming project using gis mapping.& 
 jun 12, 2023 
 if you're looking for the 
 nearest trash can on campus 
 or if you're interested in 
 the type of heating system 
 used in any given building, there's a map for that. 
 in a digital age, an endless amount of data is available at the tap of a screen. that accessibility allows doug sims to keep all 482 of infrastructure and sustainability's (i&s) maps up to date for the georgia tech community. 
 sims arrived at tech in 2008 as a utility analyst. with a background in civil engineering and the keen eye of a land surveyor, he began identifying ways to streamline operations using a geographic information system (gis). at the time, sims explained that gis was seldom used outside of tax assessors' offices, but he recognized its ability to connect lines on a page to valuable data. 
 ""if you're looking at a line for a pipe, you can click on the pipe and see that it's a 10-inch pipe, and you can see what it carries, what it's used for, and where it goes,"" sims said. 
 over the past 25 years, sims noted how gis has exponentially evolved to map out entire countries. georgia tech is often described as a city within a city, and with the help of gis, that presents an opportunity for the department to get a better lay of the land. 
 ""we have our own electrical distribution system. we have our district energy for the chilled water and the steam managed by i&s. when you look at how gis is normally used, it's normally looking at larger scales. so, once you start shrinking it to a relatively small area like the tech campus, it changes how you look at things as they become much more detailed,"" he said. 
 now the senior 
 systems support engineer 
 for infrastructure and sustainability, sims' foresight to increase gis application was a catalyst for 
 the data sets that exist today . in his role, sims continues to search for ways to capture additional data points and recognizes that the communal nature of a campus setting can provide opportunities for instantaneous collaboration. 
 ""it's a big paradigm shift. it's putting power in the hands of the people where they can make the changes immediately. whether i'm sitting on campus or 50 miles away, i can make a change. they can hit refresh and see that change immediately. it's changing how we think about and use that data every day,"" he said. 
 a recent project, working alongside the recycling and zero waste department, invited students to identify the location of all trash cans and recycling bins on campus. sims' creation allowed participants to use their phones to pinpoint locations that were added to the map, which has since been used for additional analysis of the institute's sustainability efforts. 
 the ability to connect with data instantaneously has helped sims and his staff, which recently added a new team member -- a tech alumna who worked with the department as an undergraduate -- to expedite work orders across campus. the first widespread application of gis mapping empowers members of the tech community to 
 report landscaping requests to i&s 
 by marking the exact location of the issue, sending photos and any other relevant information directly to an organized dashboard for review. sims hopes to expand this service to additional services in the coming years. 
 keeping campus informed and operating at its most efficient is a point of personal pride for sims, and, wielding what he calls the ""gis hammer,"" he hopes to be a springboard to assist other departments using gis. 
 ""if people want to map something or see what we have, get in touch with me, and let's see if there's a solution we can provide to you,"" he said. ""i'm here to come up with an answer that makes their day easier, makes their job easier, and provides data for other people to share around campus."" 
 sims laments that while he does get the rare request for printed maps, they are often already outdated while they're still warm from the printer due to the speed at which data changes at tech.

 the southeastern united states is a natural laboratory for scientists studying how chemicals emitted by human activities and trees interact with each other and affect air quality and climate. a new study has found that certain emissions from cars and coal-fired power plants promote processes that transform naturally occurring emissions from trees into organic aerosols. organic aerosols make up a substantial fraction of ambient particulate matter (pm) that can affect climate, air quality and human health. combining laboratory studies and ambient measurements from multiple sites in and around atlanta, georgia, and rural alabama, scientists found that sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides directly and substantially mediate the formation of aerosols from the volatile organic compounds produced by trees.    ""this finding is good news for pollution control. if we are able to further reduce sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions, we will not only decrease sulfate aerosols but also organic aerosols, thus lowering the total aerosol burden in the southeast united states,"" said  nga lee (sally) ng , co-author of the study and assistant professor in georgia tech's school of chemical and biomolecular engineering and school of earth and atmospheric sciences. other georgia tech co-authors include professors rodney weber and athanasios nenes, georgia power scholar and cullen peck faculty fellow. the study was sponsored by the national science foundation (nsf), the environmental protection agency (epa), and the national oceanic and atmospheric administration (noaa). the study was published december 22 in the journal 
 proceedings of the national academy of sciences . scientists have known for years that human-made pollutants can interact with vegetation-emitted organic compounds, turning them into airborne particles. those particles may affect air quality, human health and climate. however, to what extent and how exactly human-made pollutants affect aerosol formation from vegetation in the ambient environments are poorly understood. anthropogenic sulfate, produced mainly by coal-fired power plants, and nitrogen oxides, produced mainly by vehicle emissions, control 43 to 70 percent of the total measured organic aerosol load in the southeastern united states during summer months, the study found. according to the study, the formation of aerosols from certain tree emissions is directly controlled by the abundance of sulfate, instead of particle water or particle acidity as suggested by prior studies. this is surprising, but it appears that in the southeastern u.s. the particles have sufficient water and acidity to preclude them from being the controlling factors in aerosol formation. the study further shows that the nighttime aerosol chemistry is more important than previously thought. ""aerosol chemistry does not stop at night,"" ng said. after sunset, the nitrogen oxide compounds and ozone can react with the emissions from trees to produce organic aerosols. the findings may help improve air quality and climate simulations in regions where anthropogenic-biogenic interactions contribute substantially to aerosol formation, ng said. to unravel the complexity of what drives particle formation, researchers collected data in ambient field studies using advanced aerosol mass spectrometry techniques, in combination with particle into liquid sampler, and cloud condensation nuclei counter, which quantified the aerosol chemical composition and its ability to uptake liquid water. the data collected, combined with a state-of the art thermodynamic model 
 isorropia , revealed the contribution of organic species and sulfate to the acidity and water uptake. a comprehensive multivariate linear regression analysis showed that sulfate alone, not its associated water uptake or acidity, was responsible for the organic aerosol levels measured.  this study also used the 
 georgia tech environmental chamber facility 
 to investigate aerosol formation and chemical composition under nighttime conditions in a well-controlled laboratory setting, which was supported by an 
 epa early career award ng received . the study is an outcome of one of the largest u.s. atmospheric chemistry field projects in decades - the 
 southeast atmosphere study (sas) , which took place in alabama's talladega national forest in 2013. the initiative brought together dozens of national and international institutions. the research teams used instrumentation onboard aircraft and ground sites to learn more about the region's atmospheric chemistry. data was also collected from four sites around the atlanta area over two years, as part of the u.s. environmental protection agency (epa) clean air research center at georgia.  ""to study this type of chemistry and understand how man-made pollutants interact with natural emissions, the southeast united states is the best place in the country,"" ng said. ""we have seen evidence for this possible effect in prior studies a number of years ago. results from this study provides a coherent understanding of this interaction and allow us to put together a comprehensive picture,"" weber added. georgia tech is developing a reputation as a hub of clean air research and is home to the 
 southeastern center for air pollution and epidemiology (scape) , a collaborative effort with emory university that has received $8 million in funding for five years. ng, nenes, weber and other researchers at georgia tech were recently awarded a 
 major research instrumentation (mri) program grant 
 from the national science foundation (nsf), totaling approximately $700,000, to purchase a state-of-art, gas-particle high resolution mass spectrometer that can identify the components of gases and aerosol particles in real time. this research is supported by the national science foundation under award number 1242258, the us environmental protection agency (epa) under awards rd-83540301 and r835410, and the national oceanic and atmospheric administration under award na10oar4310102. any conclusions or opinions are those of the authors and do not necessarily represent the official views of the sponsoring agencies. citation : lu xu, et al.

 marilyn brown is the 2022 recipient of the highest honor given to a georgia tech professor, the class of 1934 distinguished professor award. 
 marilyn brown, regents' and brook byers professor of sustainable systems in the school of public policy, and class of 1934 distinguished professor award recipient for 2022. 
 apr 29, 2022 
 - atlanta, ga 
 marilyn brown is a world-leading expert on renewable energy and energy efficiency, a transformative intellectual thinker, and one of the founders of the field of energy and climate policy. 
 her research has shaped energy policy in the u.s. and globally. over the past two years, she has been tapped for several prestigious honors, including being elected to both the u.s. national academy of engineering and the national academy of sciences, and receiving the 
 2021 world citizen prize in environmental performance . now, she is the first woman to receive the georgia tech class of 1934 distinguished professor award in the 38 years of its existence. it is the highest honor given to a georgia tech professor. the award is presented to a professor who has made significant, long-term contributions to teaching, research, and public service. 
 brown is the regents and brook byers professor of sustainable systems in the school of public policy. she joined georgia tech after 22 years at oak ridge national laboratory, where she directed several national climate change mitigation studies and became a leader in the analysis and interpretation of energy futures. 
 at oak ridge national laboratory, she was the joint highest-ranking female manager. brown was attracted to georgia tech after working with a high-level group of scientists from oak ridge, the imperial college of london, and georgia tech on a project involving next-generation energy, including advanced broadband. ""i really liked the people from tech who i worked with on the project,"" said brown. ""they had a can-do attitude. at other universities, they might say, ‘that can't be done.' the people from georgia tech said, ‘we'll find a way.'"" in 2006, she was encouraged to apply for the position of - and was chosen as - a full professor in the school of public policy in georgia tech's ivan allen college of liberal arts. 
 throughout her career, brown has been known for her transdisciplinary, action-based research and linking behavior to policy. ""i started my career in the physical sciences at rutgers. ""from the beginning, i brought sciences into my work and have been quantitative. it has given me the ability to span sciences and related fields,"" said brown. ""i tell my students they have to be quantitative in math and the physical sciences to be effective in energy."" 
 the focus of her research has been on the clean energy transition - bridging engineering, social and behavioral sciences, and policy studies to advance the design, adoption, and diffusion of clean energy technologies and policies. she is particularly interested in energy disparities and work to strengthen energy infrastructure, especially in areas of financial need. ""it is all about the diffusion of innovation to the benefit of all,"" she said. 
 drawdown georgia 
 brown also leads the research program drawdown georgia, which she helped to create with the inspiration and funding of the ray c. anderson foundation. georgia tech alumnus ray c. anderson was founder and chair of interface inc., and a pioneer in sustainability. 
 drawdown georgia was created and is being conducted in partnership with emory university, the university of georgia, and georgia state university, as well as the southface institute, the partnership for southern equity, and greenlink analytics. 
 drawdown georgia has identified a roadmap to significantly cut georgia's greenhouse gas emissions and achieve carbon neutrality. the drawdown georgia study, localized for georgia's urban and rural areas, was published in the 
 proceedings of the national academy of sciences 
 in 2021. the plan identified technology and practices that could resonate with individuals, towns, and corporations throughout the state, including ways to bring more clean energy resources and technologies to rural georgia and help people use limited resources more efficiently. 
 through collaboration with the scheller college of business, 25 georgia ceos from throughout the state agreed to join drawdown georgia. the project includes a dashboard of emissions by georgia's 159 counties, tracked monthly. the next step will be to track implementation of the 20 solutions in the plan, measuring investments by counties, and the use of electric vehicles, rooftop solar systems, alternative transportation, recycling, composting, afforestation, and silvopasture - the integration of trees and livestock operations on the same land. 
 sustainability as a way of life 
 when asked what she wishes people knew about sustainability, brown said, ""sustainable technologies and behaviors are not costly. they can be good for your pocketbook. consider the home refrigerator. twenty-five years ago, it consumed 2,000 kilowatt hours a year. today it requires less than 600 kwh, and they don't cost any more than they used to. people just have to be smart about what they choose and pay attention to cradle-to-grave resource issues."" 
 brown also lives her values. at her home, she grows vegetables and composts, has rooftop solar, a tesla powerwall battery, and uses heat pumps for water heating, air conditioning, and heat. her family has an energy focus. her husband, frank southworth, is an adjunct professor in the school of civil and environmental engineering at tech, and an accomplished transportation planner. their daughter, katie southworth, is an attorney with southface energy institute. 
 working with students 
 brown created and co-leads the climate and energy policy lab in the school of public policy at tech. she developed the master of sustainable energy and environmental management degree. she has advised 19 ph.d. students, many of whom have gone on to leading roles in government agencies, academia, and industry. 
 she is known as an excellent mentor, communicator, and educator, inside and outside of the classroom. she challenges students to expand their knowledge and excel in their project work while developing their confidence and leadership skills. she has been described as generous with her time in providing students with guidance on professional development. as she was one of very few women in her field when she began her career, she has been purposeful about mentoring women. 
 background 
 brown earned her bachelor of arts degree in political science from rutgers university, and a master of regional planning degree from the university of massachusetts. she holds a ph.d. from the ohio state university in geography, with a minor in quantitative methods. before joining oak ridge national laboratory, she was an associate professor of geography at the university of illinois, the first woman to earn tenure in geography there. previously, she was a lecturer in the department of geography and geology at ohio wesleyan university. 
 she has authored six books and more than 250 publications, and contributed to the united nations 2007 intergovernmental panel on climate change (ipcc), a joint winner of the nobel peace prize that year. her work has had significant influence and visibility in the policy arena as evidenced by her impact on policies and programs, such as the kyoto protocol and the u.s. department of energy's weatherization assistance program, and briefings and testimonies before state legislative and regulatory bodies, committees of both the u.s. house of representatives and senate, and numerous international organizations. 
 brown served two terms (2010-2017) as a presidential appointee and u.s. senate-confirmed regulator on the board of directors of the tennessee valley authority (tva), the nation's largest public power provider. at tva, she contributed to reducing tva's co 2 
 emissions by 60% over a 15-year period. she also chaired for eight years the nuclear oversight committee, which was responsible for bringing the most recent nuclear unit into commercial operation in the u.s., in 2016 at watts bar in tennessee. 
 reflecting her commitment to the role of demand-side management, brown co-founded the southeast energy efficiency alliance (seea), chaired its board of directors for several years, hired its first executive director, and provided seea's first office space at georgia tech. 
 quotes from colleagues and former students 
 ""in her work, she conceptualizes the coevolution of technology and society, with an emphasis on how to change unsustainable systems for the provision of energy, food, mobility, water and other areas. rather than adhering to a narrow interpretation and application of geography and economics, her disciplinary background, she uses sociotechnical insights to inform her research and sheds light on the complex processes of societal transformation needed for addressing the climate and biodiversity crises as well as steep inequalities. in short, she draws on science to make extremely compelling, insightful, and even beautiful contributions to addressing contemporary challenges.""

 ivan allen college of liberal arts experts assess the state of the ukraine war on its second anniversary. 
 feb 21, 2024 
 saturday, feb. 24, marks two years since russian forces invaded ukraine. ivan allen college of liberal arts experts have closely tracked the conflict from the frontlines to potential fault lines in western support for ukraine, as well as the potential impact on the global economy. we asked some of these scholars to offer their insights into how the way the war  has evolved in the past year, and what to look out for going forward. 
 our experts: 
 gen. philip breedlove , former nato supreme commander and distinguished professor of the practice in the sam nunn school of international affairs 
 robert bell , former senior civilian representative of the u.s. secretary of defense in europe and the defense advisor to the u.s. ambassador to nato; also a distinguished professor of the practice in the sam nunn school of international affairs 
 dina khapaeva , professor of russian, school of modern languages 
 nikolay koposov , distinguished professor of the practice, school of history and sociology 
 how has russia responded to developments in the last year? 
 breedlove : i probably said last year that they were failing and that they were not adaptive , 
 and they were rather rigid, and they were. they have had bad planning, bad logistics, bad general officership, bad decisions, and brought the wrong people to the battlefield. it's just been horrible. but that now is changing. mr. putin is having to face up to the fact that he can't keep doing that. he's going into an election. support for what even people in russia are now calling a war is beginning to fall. as we say in america, we're running out of money, now we have to think. well, mr. putin is running out of troops, so now he has to think. and we're now starting to see some adaptations in the use of air power and some better tactics more suited to small-unit warfare. 
 what has ukraine done well? 
 breedlove : ukraine has just absolutely rearranged russia in the black sea. they have essentially made the northern 20% of the black sea untenable for russia, and russia has had to relocate major assets to the south and east. and whenever they're trying to move in and out of crimea, especially, ukraine is making them pay and making them pay dearly. they've adapted small, commercial, over-the-counter drones and made them into a very lethal flighting fleet: russia is still losing tanks to $270 drones. and their surface and under-surface naval drone capability is in the middle of defeating the northern part of the black sea fleet. that is beyond astounding. they are really leading the world in that way, and we are learning from them. 
 what military aid does ukraine most need from the west? 
 breedlove : victory is not about any one bright shiny object. what ukraine needs is what the united states would take to this fight if we were involved militarily. they need air superiority to enable modern maneuver warfare, and they need the sensor capabilities to discriminate targets from friends and to command and control. then we can talk about the thing everybody wants to talk about: the ability to shoot, whether it's a 
 patriot , a 
 thaad , or an f-16. you throw a bunch of f-16s out there in the middle of the battlefield, they'd do some pretty good work, but they would do amazing work if they were hooked to a capability to sense, discern, target, shoot. 
 bell : the two most critically needed enhancements in ukraine's military inventory are modern air superiority fighter aircraft (e.g., the f-16s now being delivered, but in larger numbers) and long-range ""deep strike"" fires such as the u.s. 
 atacms 
 system already provided, but in the longer-range missile version, as well as the german-made 
 taurus 
 long-range missile. these systems could alter the course of the war in ukraine's favor, especially if their use were to be concentrated on a deliberate strategy of denying russia any military presence on or access to crimea. 
 were that goal to be achieved, it would constitute a ""strategic defeat"" for putin since russian ambitions have for centuries prioritized control of crimea. that might increase the admittedly long odds that putin might see value in negotiating an acceptable outcome to this conflict. 
 what's the outlook for continued western aid? 
 bell: 
 the eu has just renewed its support for ukraine's economy with a 
 € 54 billion package . whether the u.s. congress can pass the pending supplemental appropriations request from president biden for 
 $60 billion 
 in further military assistance remains to be seen. the domestic argument over securing the u.s. southern border is the primary holdup there. however, u.s. support could also be put at risk if kyiv fails to adequately attack domestic corruption or president zelenskyy begins to rule in an unacceptably autocratic fashion. also, priorities could shift if the u.s. military involvement in the middle east conflicts escalates, or if china were to attempt to reintegrate taiwan by force. 
 koposov : 
 western fatigue is obvious and understandable, but the key thing is that western opinion has not yet appreciated the importance of the problems at stake. we still very much live in a state of post-cold war triumphalism and do not understand that the world has dramatically changed since communism collapsed and that the new challenges to democracy are no less serious than those it had to face in the   20th 
 century. almost all domestic problems should now be postponed, and the west should mobilize all its resources to get rid of putin once and forever. 
 are there any less-often-discussed underlying structural weaknesses in the russian military-industrial complex that could significantly limit its ability to continue fighting? 
 bell : president putin is clearly worried about possible civil disobedience and public resistance were he to order a general mobilization. this is why he has relied on mercenaries, generous pay, and bonus offers to recruits from distant corners of russia, and pardon offers to convicts. nonetheless, if putin must choose between a wider conscription or conceding defeat to ukraine, he will most likely choose the former and amplify his already strong public messaging that suffering and sacrifice for russia are patriotic and good for one's soul. 
 hence no ""tipping point"" is yet in sight. 
 khapaeva : russian volunteers recruited from the most socially and economically disadvantaged groups can expect to receive a payment for their military service that amounts to a lifetime of earnings. the moment putin's administration is cut off from its oil and gas profits, russians may become much less willing to serve as cannon fodder, creating conditions for changing the general political atmosphere in the country. 
 are sanctions having any impact on russia's war effort or domestic morale? 
 khapaeva : the historical memory of the conditions under which generations lived in this country must be taken into consideration. russian history is one of regular famines, starvation, food shortages, and an economy of deficit, all which are alive in the collective memory. living standards in russia remain far below those of its western neighbors, but current sanctions cannot even approach that historical level of poverty. moreover, many russians consider their memories of misery as testifying to national resilience. this goes well with putin's propaganda, which has been successful in presenting state terror as a matter of national pride and heritage. 
 what role can diplomacy play in bringing an end to the conflict? 
 bell : a western diplomatic effort to persuade china and key global south nations to pressure russia might persuade moscow to swiftly end its pursuit of total victory in ukraine, but such a scenario is unlikely. however, some other avenues do exist to hinder russia's war effort. 
 for instance, the u.s. could work with fellow permanent un security council members france and the uk and incoming members japan and south korea on a ""name and shame"" campaign to expose and condemn russia's blatant violation of un security council resolutions that imposed strict sanctions on north korea's military exports and imports related to its illegal and dangerous nuclear and ballistic missile programs. that could help isolate russia and delegitimize its actions. 
 koposov : i do not think there is, or should be, any room for diplomacy at this point. do we need another munich? 
 what are the most concerning ""wildcard"" scenarios you can envision? 
 bell : the assassination of zelenskyy by the russian fsb or his death in a missile strike, or a collapse of morale within the ukrainian military. 
 khapaeva : if the ""vertical of power"" cracks, leaders of the estimated 30 private armies in russia may start acting as independent warlords, fighting for power and resources inside russia. this could eventually lead to the collapse of the russian federation into several states, helping ukraine and the west to win the war. the decentralization of the federation was avoided in 1991 - not without western help - out of fear that nuclear arms would proliferate into the hands of even smaller and less controllable states. judging from today, that looks like shortsighted politics. 
 breedlove : the big wild card is that mr. putin understands how to yank our chain, and if ukraine started winning, the first thing you'd probably hear are new threats around the nuclear power plant in zaporizhia. we told russia before the war what we were afraid of: we are afraid of nukes and we're afraid of the war widening. mr. putin uses those tools constantly to keep us deterred. but if russia ends up killing a bunch of nato people, that's a big wild card and one that is frankly really unsavory to talk about. 
 how will this all turn out? 
 bell : if president biden is re-elected and congress agrees to continue the delivery of u.s. military weaponry at roughly the same level and in the same categories and types as before, we can expect that neither of the two contesting parties will achieve a decisive breakthrough for the foreseeable future. if president trump is elected in november, we can expect some sort of dramatic u.s. proposal for an immediate halt to the fighting.  assuming that is rejected outright by ukraine and trump cuts off all u.s. military assistance in response, then ukraine's ability to continue to prosecute the war for more than a few more months would be at risk, and its incentives, however unwilling, to seek a negotiated settlement would be increased. 
 breedlove : it is my belief that this war will end exactly how western policy leaders decide it's going to end. if we give ukraine what they need to win, and we are not doing that now, they will win. if we stop supporting ukraine, they will lose. and if that happens the fact of the matter is that russia will again subjugate ukraine, and many tens of thousands of ukrainian soldiers and civilians will die in a guerrilla conflict the likes of which russia has never seen. 
 what are the potential long-term geopolitical ramifications of the war? 
 koposov : if putin wins the war, he will most likely continue with other aggressions, and u.s. leadership in the world will be significantly undermined. china will most likely learn the lesson and imitate him, at least to some extent. and the so-called global south will become even more anti-american than it is now. 
 bell : nato's own security is inextricably intertwined in the outcome of this conflict. 
 as the leaders of the alliance themselves agreed at their summit in madrid in 2022, russia's willingness to prosecute this aggression means that it cannot be excluded that it might also decide to commit aggression against a nato ally, nato's article 5 collective security commitments notwithstanding. 
 khapaeva : if putin wins, the war will not end russia's aggression and put to rest its ambitions to restore the russian empire / ussr. an attack on an eastern european or baltic nato state is already avidly discussed by kremlin propagandists. the west showed a feeble and inconsistent response to russia's war against georgia in 2008 and the 2014 annexation of crimea. after russia invaded ukraine, made-up fear of crossing ""putin's red lines"" led to rationing the arms to ukraine and enabled russia to buy time and fortify the front line on the occupied territories. it's going to be hard to persuade the russians that they now must obey the international norms they have been violating for the past two decades. hence, putin will seek to compromise nato. if, at that moment, the u.s. decides to instead focus on its ""domestic agenda,"" nato's collapse will become imminent.

married-phd-and-each-other.txt,"married to the ph.d. - and each other 
 unaiza ahsan and munzir zafar are a married couple in tech's doctoral program. 
 unaiza ahsan is graduating with a ph.d. in computer science, focusing on computer vision. 
 apr 29, 2019 
 - atlanta, ga 
 2012 was a big year for unaiza ahsan. that summer, she married tech student munzir zafar. and, that fall, she began her doctoral studies at georgia tech. 
 ""it was a huge transition, coming from pakistan and having never lived in the u.s.,"" she said. ""it was a complete change of culture. being on my own, managing the house, and the ph.d. on top of that was daunting. when i look back, i'm glad i didn't know a lot of what the ph.d. really required because i would never have gone down the path. i would have been scared off,"" she laughed. 
 but ahsan didn't run away. she is graduating with a ph.d. in computer science, focusing on computer vision, and her husband will graduate this fall with a ph.d. in electrical and computer engineering, specializing in robotics. 
 ahsan and zafar were born in karachi, pakistan, but they didn't know each other. they met briefly as undergraduates, but went their separate ways and graduated from different schools. she earned a bachelor's degree in telecommunications from ned university of engineering & technology. zafar attended the national university of sciences and technology (nust) and earned a degree in electronic engineering. they didn't keep in touch as undergraduates, but he remembered her. years later he looked her up, they reconnected, and became engaged. 
 ahsan said she had always wanted to go into academia and conduct research. she had become interested in computer vision while earning a master's in computer and information systems, also at ned university. so, pursuing a ph.d. was next - and she had just become engaged to zafar, a fulbright scholar at georgia tech. 
 ""so, of course, my top choice for a ph.d. was georgia tech,"" she said. ""it was a seamless transition from the work i had done at the end of my master's study."" 
 ahsan broadly describes computer vision as a way of getting machines to understand the surrounding environment. 
 ""we try to feed, for example, photographs and videos to the computer and teach it to recognize what is happening,"" she said. 
 she defended her thesis last fall, and in february she joined home depot as a data scientist on the core recommendations team. her current project is for the home depot website, designing recommendation algorithms for generating collections of products for customers shopping online. 
 ""they have a huge amount of data, and you can do interesting recommendations based on the data you have,"" ahsan said. ""thankfully, i have the right combination of skills that they needed - computer vision expertise and some natural language processing experience - so, i can combine those skills to help recommend products based on what the customer is shopping for at the moment. so far, i am really enjoying myself!"" 
 zafar studies robotics and is interested in designing control algorithms for generating stable, safe, and useful behaviors of robotic systems. 
 his interest in robotics began during his undergraduate years. he wanted to pursue a field that has direct application and widespread support in pakistan, because he and ahsan plan to establish a working collaboration with their home country through academia and / or entrepreneurship. 
 ""it won't be difficult to have a career in robotics in pakistan,"" he said. 
 ahsan said she dreams of going back into academia someday. 
 ""i have seen successful examples of people who have one foot in academia and one foot in industry. it has worked out wonderfully for some of our faculty,"" she said. ""if that option opens up, i can definitely pursue that."" 
 among the things ahsan will miss most about georgia tech are the aura of campus life and having access to the latest research journals and papers. zafar, who defended his thesis this month and will be hooded in the fall, said he will miss the people he worked with, conducting research, and spending time with the robots. 
 ahsan said she is most excited about the ph.d. hooding ceremony at commencement. 
 ""for me, it's a very big deal because there were so many times during the program that i thought: ‘i'm never going to be able to do it.' so, the hooding ceremony is a formal acknowledgement that i made it."" 
 ahsan's aunt from pakistan will attend the ceremony. her parents and zafar's parents will watch the livestream from pakistan.

 from liquid laundry detergent packaged in cardboard to compostable plastic cups, consumer products these days are increasingly touting their sustainable and renewable origins. 
 now researchers at georgia institute of technology have created a material derived from crab shells and tree fibers that has the potential to replace the flexible plastic packaging used to keep food fresh. 
 the new material, which is described july 23 in the journal 
 acs sustainable chemistry and engineering, 
 is made by spraying multiple layers of chitin from crab shells and cellulose from trees to form a flexible film similar to plastic packaging film. 
 ""the main benchmark that we compare it to is pet, or polyethylene terephthalate, one of the most common petroleum-based materials in the transparent packaging you see in vending machines and soft drink bottles,"" said j. carson meredith, a professor in georgia tech's school of chemical and biomolecular engineering. ""our material showed up to a 67 percent reduction in oxygen permeability over some forms of pet, which means it could in theory keep foods fresher longer."" 
 cellulose, which comes from plants, is the planet's most common natural biopolymer, followed next by chitin, which is found in shellfish, insects and fungi. 
 the team devised a method to create a film by suspending cellulose and chitin nanofibers in water and spraying them onto a surface in alternating layers. once fully dried, the material is flexible, strong, transparent and compostable. 
 ""we had been looking at cellulose nanocrystals for several years and exploring ways to improve those for use in lightweight composites as well as food packaging, because of the huge market opportunity for renewable and compostable packaging, and how important food packaging overall is going to be as the population continues to grow,"" meredith said. 
 the research team also included meisha shofner, an associate professor in the school of materials science and engineering and the interim executive director of the renewable bioproducts institute, john r. reynolds, a professor in the schools of chemistry and biochemistry and materials science and engineering, and chinmay satam, a graduate student at georgia tech. 
 the team had been looking into chitin for an unrelated reason when they wondered if it might have use in food packaging. 
 ""we recognized that because the chitin nanofibers are positively charged, and the cellulose nanocrystals are negatively charged, they might work well as alternating layers in coatings because they would form a nice interface between them,"" meredith said. 
 packaging meant to preserve food needs to prevent oxygen from passing through. part of the reason the new material improves upon conventional plastic packaging as a gas barrier is because of the crystalline structure of the film. 
 ""it's difficult for a gas molecule to penetrate a solid crystal, because it has to disrupt the crystal structure,"" meredith said. ""something like pet on the other hand has a significant amount of amorphous or non-crystalline content, so there are more paths easier for a small gas molecule to find its way through."" 
 environmentalists have long looked for renewable ways to replace petroleum-based materials in consumer products. with the amount of cellulose already produced and a ready supply of chitin-rich byproducts left over from the shellfish food industry, there's likely more than enough material available to make the new films a viable flexible-packaging alternative, meredith said. 
 still, there's more work to be done. to make the new material eventually competitive with flexible packaging film on cost, a manufacturing process that maximizes economy of scale will need to be developed. additionally, while industrial processes to mass produce cellulose are mature, methods to produce chitin are still in their infancy, meredith said. and, more research is also needed to improve the material's ability to block water vapor.

 georgia tech has received two department of defense (dod) 
 2022 multidisciplinary university research initiative (muri) awards 
 totaling almost $14 million. the highly competitive government program supports interdisciplinary teams of investigators developing innovative solutions in dod interest areas. this year, the dod awarded $195 million to 28 research teams across the country. 
 georgia tech's muris are both primarily within the 
 school of physics . first, 
 simon sponberg , a dunn family associate professor of physics and biological sciences, leads a team discovering how animals strategically use sensing and cognition to make decisions in complex environments. the project, 
 fast, lexicographic agile perception integrates decision and control in a spike-resolved, sensorimotor program (flap), 
 specifically addresses the  core dod topic area of understanding neural systems integration for competent autonomy in decision and control. 
 ""we have all these great, sophisticated algorithms for processing big data, but an animal doesn't have time to process a million samples of its environment and then figure out what's a predator,"" said sponberg. 
 studying moths for their agile, sophisticated flying and complex sensing abilities, the team will record electrical activity in the brain to determine how the moths make decisions and use natural language processing techniques to see how a moth derives meaning from sensory cues and movements. the goal is to develop an information processing framework that enables quick, flexible decision-making that could facilitate the next generation of autonomous bio-inspired systems and better integrate living systems with engineered technologies 
 the interdisciplinary nature of the team makes complex research possible. half the team is made of experimentalists: sponberg specializes in sensors connected to motor systems with precisely timed signals; jeff riffell, a professor at the university of washington, studies how the nervous system processes sensory signals to control behavior; and as a vision neuroscientist at florida international university, jamie theobald, determines how animals parse complex environments. the other half of the team will build the framework: duke professor vahid tarokh models complex datasets, georgia tech 
 school of mathematics 
 assistant professor 
 hannah choi 
 focuses on neural networks, and cornell professor silvia ferrari ties it all together as a control theorist embedding control in neural structures. 
 ""muris were originally training grants for the dod to develop the next generation of scientists who would make progress,"" said sponberg. ""this funding will allow us to have postdocs and graduate students across all six labs and disciplines working together tightly and creating a community."" 
 for the second muri, 
 programming multistable origami and kirigami structures via topological design, 
 georgia tech assistant professor 
 zeb rocklin 
 is part of a team exploring a new class of origami- and kirigami-inspired flexible, lightweight structures capable of transitioning between many stable shapes to perform different tasks or adapt to changing environmental conditions. these structures could be used in a range of applications, from multifunctional robots and collapsible antennae to rapidly assembled bridges and temporary structures, and force protection elements like origami-inspired bulletproof shields. 
 the team combines experts in mathematics, physics, material science, mechanics, robotics, numerical modeling, and computation, including harvard university professors katie betoldi, jennifer lewis, l. mahadevan, and robert wood, as well as university of pennsylvania associate professor eleni katifori 
 the researchers will develop mathematical models to characterize and design the complex mechanical behavior of multi-stable origami and kirigami structures; new scale-spanning manufacturing processes that efficiently integrate actuation and sensing; and experimental test beds to serve as a platform for evaluation and optimization of design concepts. 
 ""this project benefits from georgia tech's ability to develop tight, powerful connections between engineering advanced technologies and developing universal, mathematically rigorous physical theories,"" rocklin said. ""we'll be starting from concepts that anyone can get a sense of by looking at or feeling a piece of origami and using robotics and multifunctional 3d printing to create complex, flexible and robust dynamical structures that can do things nobody has ever seen before.""

 the multiyear commitment from the mccamish foundation will drive transformational research that harnesses science, engineering, and technology at georgia tech and emory to better analyze the complexities of the brain and transform the treatment of parkinson's and other disorders of the nervous system. the wallace h. coulter department of biomedical engineering (bme), an academic collaboration between georgia tech and emory, is uniquely positioned to lead this new kind of translational neuroscience discovery driven by engineering innovation. 
 ""for 22 years, georgia tech and emory university have collaborated to improve the lives of individuals diagnosed with many of the world's most challenging diseases. through the sustained support of transformational philanthropy, the coulter department of biomedical engineering has become a national model for academic partnerships,"" said georgia tech president ángel cabrera. ""this visionary and generous commitment from the mccamish foundation will allow us to expand and accelerate collaboration and discovery to the point that an exciting new treatment for parkinson's disease and other neurological disorders could be within our reach."" 
 emory president gregory l. fenves added, ""this generous commitment will enable emory and georgia tech to build on our powerful biomedical partnership as we work to combat parkinson's and other devastating neurological diseases. new treatments and cures require a deep commitment - i am grateful for our friends at the mccamish foundation who will help us make the progress and find the answers that patients and families so urgently need."" 
 gordon beckham jr. has felt the impact of parkinson's personally, with the loss of his father, hank mccamish, to the disease. beckham now sits on the board of directors of the parkinson's foundation and works to raise awareness to beat the disease. he said his goal is to build a strong research community in georgia that will create new frontiers in the treatment of the degenerative disease. 
 ""the mccamish foundation has been in discussions on and off with georgia tech, since my dad's passing, about innovative approaches to dealing with parkinson's,"" said beckham, ceo of the atlanta-based mccamish group llc and president of the mccamish foundation. ""we have always been impressed by the amazing depth of talent at tech."" 
 the mccamish name is well-known at georgia tech. alumnus hank mccamish, im 1950, is the namesake of tech's basketball arena, mccamish pavilion. over the years, the family has supported numerous causes at georgia tech. this commitment is one of the largest in the institute's history and is the first of its kind for the institute. 
 ""more recently, we met susan margulies and learned of the formal biomedical engineering collaboration between tech and emory, two of the top institutions in the country in their respective fields,"" beckham said. ""at the same time, the university of georgia (uga) is making major investments in parkinson's research. given all this momentum within the state of georgia, with bme as a nexus, the mccamish foundation felt the timing was right to try something new at tech and emory while also leveraging the existing powerful collaboration between tech, emory, and uga."" 
 ""we already participate in robust research collaborations with georgia tech and emory,"" said uga president jere w. morehead. ""we look forward to expanding our partnerships in order to leverage the complementary strengths of our three institutions to bring new hope to those who suffer from this terrible disease."" 
 beckham said the mccamish foundation dreams of a day when all parkinson's related conversations begin with, ""remember when."" 
 the mccamish commitment will support faculty research on neurological diseases, including establishing a seed fund to support high-risk, high-reward research ventures. it will also provide fellowships for graduate students and create regular interactions among researchers at tech, emory, and uga, including an annual national conference focused on parkinson's disease. the idea is to give researchers space to collaborate and brainstorm unconventional ideas that hold the greatest promise for significant discoveries. 
 ""our vision is to create the next frontier in neuroscience and neurotechnology by confronting the enormous complexities of the dynamic brain and nervous system,"" said susan margulies, the wallace h. coulter professor and chair in the coulter department of biomedical engineering. ""our brains engage with, adapt to, and are influenced by the world around us. studying the changing chemical and electrical brain dynamics is a direct path to detecting and treating parkinson's disease and other neurological disorders.""

medicaid-unwinding-could-lead-eviction-crisis-new-school-public-policy-research.txt,"medicaid ‘unwinding' could lead to eviction crisis, new school of public policy research suggests 
 the study examined tennessee's 23005 trimming of its medicaid rolls and the impact on evictions. 
 evictions substantially rose in tennessee compared to other southern states after the 2005 removal of 190,000 people from medicaid there, school of public policy assistant professor ashley c. bradford found in a new study published in 
 health affairs . the study offers insights into what might happen after current efforts to return to normal medicaid operations nationally following the covid-19 public health emergency. 
 feb 16, 2024 
 the united states may be in for a significant wave of evictions in a year or so, the unintended consequence of work to trim medicaid rolls expanded during the covid-19 public health emergency, according to new research from georgia tech's 
 school of public policy . 
 the 
 study , 
 authored 
 by assistant professor ashley c. bradford and recently published in 
 health affairs, 
 found that evictions in tennessee rose 24.5 percent between 2005 and 2009 relative to other southern states following the state's 2005 decision to remove approximately 190,000 people from its medicaid rolls. 
 more than 
 16.4 million people 
 nationwide - 86 times the tennessee figure from 2005 - have already been taken off medicaid as states react to a federal law requiring them to return to normal operations after years of expanded eligibility meant to blunt the impact of the pandemic, according to 
 kff health news. 
 as many as 24 million people could eventually lose access to medicaid, according to the outlet. 
 however, 
 bradford 
 warns that many aspects of health care administration and the housing market have changed since 2005, so it's hard to say whether that 24.5% figure in her paper will cleanly translate to the economic and policy environment of 2025. the populations involved in tennessee's downsizing and the 
 current national rollbacks 
 are also different, adding more uncertainty. 
 ""i think it's safe to say that we will see disruptions in housing, but we are not going to be able to see exactly how large those disruptions will be for a few years,"" bradford said. 
 https: / / youtu.be / v7ykdwvwgza?si=fwpklp24paa6i4_a 
 t ransformed health care and housing landscapes may shift impact 
 among other things, where tennessee's 2005 medicaid changes primarily affected working-age childless adults, the researchers say that the current medicaid rollback is expected to disproportionately affect immigrants and people with disabilities - populations whose budgets are often more sensitive to economic shocks like the loss of health insurance. 
 on the other hand, according to the researchers, the affordable care act could also reduce financial shocks and evictions for some families. the program first offered health insurance plans - including low- and zero-premium options - in 2013, well after the period bradford 
 and her co-authors 
 studied in tennessee. 
 another group expected to be affected, older adults, may be somewhat sheltered from evictions due to savings or social security income, according to bradford and her co-authors, mir m. ali of the university of maryland, college park and johanna catherin maclean of george mason university. 
 the link between medicaid loss and evictions 
 so, what precisely is the connection between loss of medicaid and eviction? 
 in the tennessee case, the loss of health coverage - which persisted for most families removed from medicaid in tennessee in 2005 - would likely have added more financial stress to already strapped budgets. it also may have led to a higher incidence of preventable health issues or the undertreatment of existing chronic health conditions that could have made it harder for people to keep working, according to the researchers. either situation could be financially devastating, potentially resulting in eventual eviction. 
 evictions, in turn, often force people into housing located in areas with fewer employment opportunities and higher crime, further elevating the financial stress on vulnerable populations, leading to a cycle that can lock people - especially those affected by health issues or substance misuse - into nearly inescapable poverty, according to the study authors. 
 ""we know evictions are extraordinarily damaging to families and individuals and can cause generational impacts. so we really need to be able to intervene and help vulnerable people before they get into a cycle where they cannot get out of it on their own,"" bradford said. 
 bradford said one policy that could help would be a strong, temporary eviction moratorium similar to the one imposed nationally by the u.s. centers for disease control and prevention in response to the covid-19 pandemic in 2021. policymakers could also consider financial assistance to those being removed from the medicaid rolls to help them stay on their feet during the transition, she said. 
 methodology and limitations 
 to reach their conclusions in the recent paper, bradford and her co-authors used data from the eviction lab at princeton university. they examined county-level eviction data from tennessee and compared it to those of alabama, florida, georgia, kentucky, louisiana, maryland, mississippi, north carolina, oklahoma, south carolina, texas, virginia, washington, d.c., and west virginia. 
 after controlling for variables such as whether political factors could have led to weakened rental protection laws, they found that the average annual eviction filings per tennessee county increased by 27.6% as compared to counties in the other states in the u.s. census bureau's south region. eventual evictions increased by the slightly smaller 24.5% figure. 
 that works out to about 1,000 more annual evictions per tennessee county than in other southern states during the same period. 
 the study does have some limitations in addition to how much has changed since 2005, bradford notes. she said the database has some gaps, lacks individual-level data, and does not track eviction notices or evictions overturned on appeal, although the latter is believed to be rare. 
 probing impact of substance abuse, psychiatric care access, on evictions 
 bradford's earlier research has examined the impact of evictions from other angles. in a 
 2019 paper 
 published in 
 health services research , she also found that a 1% increase in the eviction rate is associated with an up to 0.596% chance of substance-related deaths for the average u.s. county. 
 in a 
 2023 study 
 published in the 
 journal of policy analysis and management 
 with co-author johanna catherin maclean, bradford found that having ten additional psychiatric treatment centers in a county was associated with 2.1% fewer evictions. 
 the researchers hypothesized that increased access to psychiatric care improved the management of mental health disorders, which can lead to higher rates of employment and lower rates of activities likely to lead to eviction - such as nuisance behaviors or criminal activity. 
 it was one of the first papers to make a plausible link explaining the relationship between mental health treatment access and eviction, according to the researchers. 
 bradford's most recent paper, ""tenncare disenrollment led to increased eviction filings and evictions in tennessee relative to other southern states,"" was published on feb. 5, 2024, in 
 health affairs . it is available at

 feb 22, 2024 
 aisha johnson joined the georgia tech library in 2021 as associate dean for academic affairs and outreach. before that she was the master of library science program director for the school of library and information sciences at north carolina central university, the only hbcu with an mls program. she came to tech because she was ready for a new challenge and an opportunity to grow. 
 ""i knew that by coming to georgia tech i would grow as a professional and i would learn a different side of academia,"" she said, having worked in environments ranging from federal offices to public and private universities to hbcus. ""i have learned the business ins-and-outs, navigating not only at a university level, but also at the university system level, as well as state politics and educational policy. for anyone who aspires to be a senior executive leader or an administrator in any form, it's extremely important to learn how to navigate policy and still get things done."" 
 johnson is responsible for four areas at the library 
 - 
 archives, special collections, and data curation; assessment; public programming and community engagement; and academic engagement. ""currently, i have four direct reports 
 - previously 18 - 
 and 25 people within my line. but as a leader i feel responsible for all 94 people in the library."" 
 she describes her role as an educator, advocate, and scholar. she enjoys solving problems and developing people. ""i like giving people enough space to try to figure things out. at the same time, i'm always in a position of encouragement and support, stepping in when heavy lifting and additional guidance are needed."" 
 johnson has a bachelor's in political science, a master's in library and information studies, and a ph.d. in information studies, all from florida state university. she also has an m.b.a. from clark atlanta university. 
 she was recently awarded an individual ala carnegie-whitney grant for the collaborative project, sustainable leadership as a solution for representation and inclusion in lis: a bibliography and toolkit, which will provide library leaders and aspiring leaders with the resources to build sustainable leadership practices. it will be applicable across disciplines. 
 johnson is a prolific writer, from think pieces to research. in 2019 she wrote a book titled 
 the african american struggle for library equality: the untold story of the julius rosenwald fund library program , about the program that established more than 10,000 school, college, and public libraries in the american south, and funded library science programs and institutes that trained african american librarians. she will be featured in an upcoming 
 documentary on black librarians , to be released in summer 2025, highlighting the importance of access to information and the value of black librarianship. ""i'm excited to be a part of the documentary and honored to be one of the interviewees,"" she said. 
 away from work 
 when she isn't working, johnson is a world traveler. ""i try to leave the country about five or six times a year, just to explore the world,"" she said. ""i want to see everything, and i find such comfort in traveling. i'm almost giddy when i'm on the plane because i can't wait to get there."" 
 travel provides a respite when work can feel consuming. ""in academia, we must pay attention to what's happening at the state level, what bills are on the floor and how they will affect us. but also, being a people-leader is selfless. you need an outlet. for me, travel became that outlet a few years ago."" 
 her recent travels have taken her to brazil, fiji, zanzibar, and greece. ""crete, in greece, is one of those places that is what you see on tv. the people are beautiful. the food is organic. it's like a hallmark movie."" she would like to visit ghana and nigeria soon. 
 although travel is a great escape for johnson, she still manages to write, even if she's on a beach. ""i always have a notepad or my phone with me. so, it's work but it's different.""

 gary mcmurray wears two hats at gtri - division chief for the intelligent sustainable technologies division and an associate director for the institute for robotics and intelligent machines (irim).

 feb 19, 2021 
 - atlanta, ga 
 after earning bachelor's and master's degrees in mechanical engineering from georgia tech, gary mcmurray interviewed for a number of jobs. most were in the defense industry, and the job duties were very specific. 
 ""i joke about one job that was to design fuel pumps for the aft section of cargo planes,"" mcmurray recalled. ""i asked, ‘well, what if i want to design fuel pumps for the front section?' they said, ‘no. that's a different skill set.'"" 
 the job sounded too constraining and unappealing to mcmurray, so he continued his job search, interviewing with the georgia tech research institute (gtri) in 1989. he had been working in robotics, a relatively new field at the time. 
 ""i was looking for something in robotics, and gtri was trying to get into robotics,"" he said. ""they didn't have anybody working in that field at all, so i was really the first person hired to work in that area. it gave me an opportunity to start from scratch and develop something unique and different. i really enjoyed that."" 
 three decades later, mcmurray still works at gtri. 
 ""i wear two hats in the organization,"" he said. he is the division chief for the intelligent sustainable technologies division, and an associate director for the institute for robotics and intelligent machines (irim), working with director seth hutchinson. 
 the intelligent sustainable technologies division conducts research to improve the human condition through transforming the agricultural and food systems, sustainable use and access to energy and water, and improving workplace safety and pandemic response. irim is an umbrella under which robotics researchers, educators, and students from across campus can come together to advance a wide variety of robotics activities at the institute. 
 the intelligent sustainable technologies division has approximately 36 research faculty and 40 students. the unit hires about 10% of all the students at gtri and maintains close ties with the academic side of campus. 
 ""one of the things i enjoy in my role as a division chief is the ability to set the vision and mission,"" mcmurray said. ""we're a little bit different from the rest of gtri because we don't do the department of defense work. we work a lot with the campus, but we also work with other universities on sustainability projects regarding food or energy. the projects have the potential to make a big impact. i describe it as having one foot on the basic research side and one foot on the applied side. we have master's and ph.d. students doing cutting-edge basic research, and we're also building systems and applying research and deploying things into the field."" 
 the division's food processing research includes improving yield, food quality, and food safety while minimizing the environmental impact by applying image processing, robotics, biosensors, and environmental treatment technologies. the division also conducts air quality research, including monitoring and reducing the effects of vehicular emissions. 
 so, what's the connection between food processing and auto emissions? 
 ""to solve problems in both of those areas we employ general research technologies - robotics, chemical and biological sensing, data analytics, machine learning, systems engineering, and then energy and materials,"" mcmurray said. ""approaches that work in traditional manufacturing may not work in the food industry. there is no cad drawing for a boneless chicken breast or a chicken leg. each one is different. it's also wet, slippery, and could be spoiled."" 
 that's where sensing and data analytics come into play. the same applies to analyzing vehicular emissions. 
 ""when you look at food processing, our work really brings together all of these different skill sets. and then when you look at the data analytics side of air quality emissions, the team has the longest continuous set of data about air quality in the city. this has been the key database that the epa uses for studying carbon emissions for automobiles,"" mcmurray said. 
 after more than 30 years at gtri, mcmurray still gets excited when a plan comes together. 
 ""the most rewarding part of the work is when you can bring together the basic research and the applied, build a system that does something new and novel, put it into the field and test it, and have somebody come back and say, ‘that's really cool. that worked.'"" 
 away from the office 
 mcmurray and his wife have two sons - a first-year student at kennesaw state university and a high school senior. he recently started playing chess again, which was a passion of his in middle and high school. 
 ""my parents were always afraid i was going to quit school and go play chess professionally,"" he said. ""they were quite worried about that."" 
 but then he got into robotics and work, so chess took a back seat. as his children have grown older, he has gotten back into the game. ""every night i study and play online,"" he said. ""it's always interesting."" 
 he read 
 the queen's gambit, 
 a book about the game that was made into a netflix series, and he said it was required reading for chess enthusiasts. 
 ""chess players are not normal people,"" he said, laughing. ""the game is very obsessive, and you just sit there at the board for hours. my longest game lasted six and a half hours."" 
 mcmurray used to play competitively all over the u.s. ""one of my goals, maybe when i retire, is to try to reach the rank of international master.""

 a senior attorney specialist, yolonda cameron spends her days working on trademarks, copyright, and film location agreements.

 - atlanta, ga 
 when yolonda cameron accepted a job as an attorney in tech's office of legal affairs, it was an entry-level position, and she thought she would work there three to five years. today, 19 years later, cameron is still in legal affairs, but the job has changed. 
 in 1999, her position involved reviewing lots of contracts including nondisclosure agreements, material transfer agreements, software licenses, performing arts agreements, and releases. but, many of these agreements are now handled by georgia tech research corporation (gtrc) or georgia tech purchasing. other agreements are now standard georgia tech template agreements with standardized georgia tech terms that can be used repeatedly without any changes other than updating the administrative details such as the date, company name, address, and such. 
 a senior attorney specialist, cameron now spends her time working on trademarks, copyright, and film location agreements. 
 ""my biggest practice area is trademarks,"" she said. ""we work with institute communications in enforcing georgia tech trademarks. our beloved buzz seems to be the trademark that everyone wants to use [without permission]."" 
 routinely, a notification will come into institute communications, often from a tech alumnus or employee who has spotted a violation of the trademark. 
 ""businesses in the area have used the georgia tech logo on facebook invitations,"" cameron said. ""sometimes the trademark has been used on menus. in response, we send a cease and desist letter. typically, they will stop using the trademark [without further action being taken]."" 
 cameron also gets questions regarding copyrights. for such inquiries, her office works with the georgia tech library and refers employees to the board of regents' copyright policy webpage. 
 ""sometimes when a faculty member is doing a presentation, they will have questions regarding the use of an image. they have to perform a fair-use analysis via the fair use checklist located on the board of regents website,"" she said. 
 copyright questions also come up when faculty are developing online courses that use copyrighted materials. 
 ""film location agreements for filming on georgia tech's campus is another big area,"" she said. ""these requests can be very fast-paced because they have to be turned around quickly."" 
 with atlanta's film industry booming, cameron said location scouts often look to georgia tech. 
 ""we are centrally located. we have a beautiful campus. we have a lot of cool buildings. everybody gravitates here,"" she said. 
 some of the buildings that are frequently requested for filming are clough commons, klaus computing, the student center, the academy of medicine, and the campus recreation center and its obstacle course. 
 several movies or scenes from movies have been filmed on campus, including 
 the internship, the accountant, selma, 
 and an upcoming movie starring melissa mccarthy called 
 superintelligence. 
 ""when the film industry first came calling [for 
 the internship 
 starring vince vaughn and owen wilson], georgia tech had to develop a policy, process, and documents around filming on campus,"" cameron said. 
 legal affairs worked with capital planning and space management (cpsm) to identify the key stakeholders at georgia tech. as a result, a film logistics committee was formed, a filming and photography policy and process developed, and a filming application and standard filming location agreements drafted. 
 ""now, we have a standard agreement for film requests with a large footprint and another agreement for smaller film requests,"" cameron said. ""for the larger film projects, the request must be evaluated by the film logistics committee, which includes cpsm, risk management, legal affairs, institute communications, parking and transportation, environmental health & safety (eh&s), georgia tech police, and building captains for all buildings involved."" 
 cameron said she enjoys the variety that her job brings, including working with departments all over campus and putting faces with names. 
 giving voice to creativity 
 cameron was born in philadelphia, and her family moved to new jersey when she was about two. they then moved to atlanta when she was five, and that's where she grew up. 
 in college, she earned a dual degree: a bachelor of science in mathematics from jackson state university, and a bachelor of science in electrical engineering from georgia tech. 
 ""then i realized, ‘this technical stuff is not for me,'"" she said. ""it's not my passion. my passion is writing, so i thought about how i could marry the two."" 
 after graduating, she took a year off before going to law school at george washington university in washington, dc. she then worked for a solo practitioner in midtown atlanta, primarily doing patent litigation, before coming to georgia tech. 
 she still writes. it gives voice to her creative side. 
 ""of course, like a lot of writers, i want to write the great american novel one day,"" she said. ""i have a couple of ideas. whatever i write will be fiction. poetry also calls to me."" 
 cameron is also a certified yoga instructor, with 200 hours of training. she is a well-being activator (through tech's health initiatives) for ethics, compliance, and legal affairs. once a month, she and a coworker lead a group of colleagues in yoga. and, once a month she volunteers to teach a yoga class for women in the dekalb county jail. 
 photography and book crafting (making and binding books) are other hobbies. she loves taking photos of landscapes and nature, and she enjoys paper crafting of any kind. years ago, she took classes on campus at paper & clay to learn how to develop black and white film. 
 she's also always on the lookout for an art or paper crafts class. she said she feels a need to balance her analytical, logical side with some sort of creative activity or project. 
 lastly, cameron loves to travel. in june, she and her sister enjoyed a one-week vacation in london. 
 ""we did all of the touristy stuff,"" she said. ""we got tickets to see 
 wicked 
 in the west end, and my sister got us tickets to see ed sheeran, her favorite artist.""

mega-millions-odds-arent-ever-your-favor.txt,"mega millions: the odds aren't ever in your favor 
 georgia tech experts explain the lottery likelihoods 
 jul 29, 2022 
 - atlanta, ga 
 want to be a millionaire? what about a 
 billionaire ? 
 you have the chance when the mega millions lottery numbers are drawn tonight, july 29. 
 the problem: chances are you aren't going to win. but we understand that, right? 
 lew lefton, georgia tech mathematician, crunches big calculations for a living. 
 with five white balls out of a drum containing 70 balls, and one red ball drawn from a drum with 25 red balls, lefton says there are an astronomical 302,575,350 possible winning combinations. you'll have to pick the right one to win big. 
 also astronomical is the payout. many would be over the moon with a $1 million payout, but $1 billion? consider this for perspective: 1 million seconds is about 11 days; 1 billion seconds is about 31 years! 
 while you can't do anything to improve your odds of winning, you can decrease the likelihood of having to share that jackpot. 
 ""play numbers higher than 31,"" lefton says. 
 many people play birthday numbers, so choosing higher, less popular numbers means you're less likely to have to split the winnings. 
 also, people statistically choose odd numbers more often. so, choosing high, even numbers may be your best bet, according to lefton. 
 what's even more astronomical? the size of the u.s. economy is $23 trillion. georgia tech economist tibor besedes says a billion-dollar jackpot is a drop in the bucket.  ""about 0.004% of the economy."" 
 because the winner will likely spend their payout on a variety of items, lottery jackpots have little ripple effect on the economy as a whole. 
 ""this wouldn't have the impact on the level of a business investing $1 billion in the state of georgia on a new production facility."" 
 unless this jackpot winner has just that kind of investment in mind.

 - atlanta, ga 
 a new low-temperature solution printing technique allows fabrication of high-efficiency perovskite solar cells with large crystals intended to minimize current-robbing grain boundaries. the meniscus-assisted solution printing (masp) technique boosts power conversion efficiencies to nearly 20 percent by controlling crystal size and orientation. 
 the process, which uses parallel plates to create a meniscus of ink containing the metal halide perovskite precursors, could be scaled up to rapidly generate large areas of dense crystalline film on a variety of substrates, including flexible polymers. operating parameters for the fabrication process were chosen by using a detailed kinetics study of perovskite crystals observed throughout their formation and growth cycle. 
 ""we used a meniscus-assisted solution printing technique at low temperature to craft high quality perovskite films with much improved optoelectronic performance,"" said 
 zhiqun lin , a professor in the 
 school of materials science and engineerin g at the georgia institute of technology. ""we began by developing a detailed understanding of crystal growth kinetics that allowed us to know how the preparative parameters should be tuned to optimize fabrication of the films."" 
 the new technique is reported july 7 in the journal 
 nature communications . the research has been supported by the air force office of scientific research (afosr) and the national science foundation (nsf). 
 perovskites offer an attractive alternative to traditional materials for capturing electricity from light, but existing fabrication techniques typically produce small crystalline grains whose boundaries can trap the electrons produced when photons strike the materials. existing production techniques for preparing large-grained perovskite films typically require higher temperatures, which is not favorable for polymer materials used as substrates - which could help lower the fabrication costs and enable flexible perovskite solar cells. 
 so lin, research scientist ming he and colleagues decided to try a new approach that relies on capillary action to draw perovskite ink into a meniscus formed between two nearly parallel plates approximately 300 microns apart. the bottom plate moves continuously, allowing solvent to evaporate at the meniscus edge to form crystalline perovskite. as the crystals form, fresh ink is drawn into the meniscus using the same physical process that forms a coffee ring on an absorbent surface such as paper. 
 ""because solvent evaporation triggers the transport of precursors from the inside to the outside, perovskite precursors accumulate at the edge of the meniscus and form a saturated phase,"" lin explained. ""this saturated phase leads to the nucleation and growth of crystals. over a large area, we see a flat and uniform film having high crystallinity and dense growth of large crystals."" 
 to establish the optimal rate for moving the plates, the distance between plates and the temperature applied to the lower plate, the researchers studied the growth of perovskite crystals during masp. using movies taken through an optical microscope to monitor the grains, they discovered that the crystals first grow at a quadratic rate, but slow to a linear rate when they began to impinge on their neighbors. 
 ""when the crystals run into their neighbors, that affects their growth,"" noted he. ""we found that all of the grains we studied followed similar growth dynamics and grew into a continuous film on the substrate."" 
 the masp process generates relatively large crystals - 20 to 80 microns in diameter - that cover the substrate surface. having a dense structure with fewer crystals minimizes the gaps that can interrupt the current flow, and reduces the number of boundaries that can trap electrons and holes and allow them to recombine. 
 using films produced with the masp process, the researchers have built solar cells that have power conversion efficiencies averaging 18 percent - with some as high as 20 percent. the cells have been tested with more than 100 hours of operation without encapsulation. ""the stability of our masp film is improved because of the high quality of the crystals,"" lin said. 
 doctor-blading is one of the conventional perovskite fabrication techniques in which higher temperatures are used to evaporate the solvent. lin and his colleagues heated their substrate to only about 60 degrees celsius, which would be potentially compatible with polymer substrate materials. 
 so far, the researchers have produced centimeter-scale samples, but they believe the process could be scaled up and applied to flexible substrates, potentially facilitating roll-to-roll continuous processing of the perovskite materials. that could help lower the cost of producing solar cells and other optoelectronic devices. 
 ""the meniscus-assisted solution printing technique would have advantages for flexible solar cells and other applications requiring a low-temperature continuous fabrication process,"" lin added. ""we expect the process could be scaled up to produce high throughput, large-scale perovskite films."" 
 among the next steps are fabricating the films on polymer substrates, and evaluating other unique properties (e.g., thermal and piezotronic) of the material.

 co-design of antenna and electronics could lead to improved performance in millimeter wave transmitters.

 by integrating the design of antenna and electronics, researchers have boosted the energy and spectrum efficiency for a new class of millimeter wave transmitters, allowing improved modulation and reduced generation of waste heat. the result could be longer talk time and higher data rates in millimeter wave wireless communication devices for future 5g applications. 
 the new co-design technique allows simultaneous optimization of the millimeter wave antennas and electronics. the hybrid devices use conventional materials and integrated circuit (ic) technology, meaning no changes would be required to manufacture and package them. the co-design scheme allows fabrication of multiple transmitters and receivers on the same ic chip or the same package, potentially enabling multiple-input-multiple-output (mimo) systems as well as boosting data rates and link diversity. 
 researchers from the georgia institute of technology presented their proof-of-concept antenna-based outphasing transmitter on june 11 at the 2018 radio frequency integrated circuits symposium (rfic) in philadelphia. their other antenna-electronics co-design work was published at the 2017 and 2018 ieee international solid-state circuits conference (isscc) and multiple peer-reviewed ieee journals. the intel corporation and u.s. army research office sponsored the research. 
 ""in this proof-of-example, our electronics and antenna were designed so that they can work together to achieve a unique on-antenna outphasing active load modulation capability that significantly enhances the efficiency of the entire transmitter,"" said 
 hua wang , an assistant professor in georgia tech's 
 school of electrical and computer engineering . ""this system could replace many types of transmitters in wireless mobile devices, base stations and infrastructure links in data centers."" 
 key to the new design is maintaining a high-energy efficiency regardless whether the device is operating at its peak or average output power. the efficiency of most conventional transmitters is high only at the peak power but drops substantially at low power levels, resulting in low efficiency when amplifying complex spectrally efficient modulations. moreover, conventional transmitters often add the outputs from multiple electronics using lossy power combiner circuits, exacerbating the efficiency degradation. 
 ""we are combining the output power though a dual-feed loop antenna, and by doing so with our innovation in the antenna and electronics, we can substantially improve the energy efficiency,"" said wang, who is the demetrius t. paris professor in the school of electrical and computer engineering.  ""the innovation in this particular design is to merge the antenna and electronics to achieve the so-called outphasing operation that dynamically modulates and optimizes the output voltages and currents of power transistors, so that the millimeter wave transmitter maintains a high energy efficiency both at the peak and average power."" 
 beyond energy efficiency, the co-design also facilitates spectrum efficiency by allowing more complex modulation protocols. that will enable transmission of a higher data rate within the fixed spectrum allocation that poses a significant challenge for 5g systems. 
 ""within the same channel bandwidth, the proposed transmitter can transmit six to ten times higher data rate,"" wang said. ""integrating the antenna gives us more degrees of freedom to explore design innovation, something that could not be done before."" 
 sensen li, a georgia tech graduate research assistant who received the best student paper award at the 2018 rfic symposium, said the innovation resulted from bringing together two disciplines that have traditionally worked separately. 
 ""we are merging the technologies of electronics and antennas, bringing these two disciplines together to break through limits,"" he said. ""these improvements could not be achieved by working on them independently. by taking advantage of this new co-design concept, we can further improve the performance of future wireless transmitters."" 
 the new designs have been implemented in 45-nanometer cmos soi ic devices and flip-chip packaged on high-frequency laminate boards, where testing has confirmed a minimum two-fold increase in energy efficiency, wang said. 
 the antenna electronics co-design is enabled by exploring the unique nature of multi-feed antennas. 
 ""an antenna structure with multiple feeds allows us to use multiple electronics to drive the antenna concurrently. different from conventional single-feed antennas, multi-feed antennas can serve not only as radiating elements, but they can also function as signal processing units that interface among multiple electronic circuits,"" wang explained. ""this opens a completely new design paradigm to have different electronic circuits driving the antenna collectively with different but optimized signal conditions, achieving unprecedented energy efficiency, spectral efficiency and reconfigurability."" 
 the cross-disciplinary co-design could also facilitate fabrication and operation of multiple transmitters and receivers on the same chip, allowing hundreds or even thousands of elements to work together as a whole system. ""in massive mimo systems, we need to have a lot of transmitters and receivers, so energy efficiency will become even more important,"" wang noted. 
 having large numbers of elements working together becomes more practical at millimeter wave frequencies because the wavelength reduction means elements can be placed closer together to achieve compact systems, he pointed out. these factors could pave the way for new types of beamforming that are essential in future millimeter wave 5g systems. 
 power demands could drive adoption of the technology for battery-powered devices, but wang says the technology could also be useful for grid-powered systems such as base stations or wireless connections to replace cables in large data centers. in those applications, expanding data rates and reducing cooling needs could make the new devices attractive. 
 ""higher energy efficiency also means less energy will be converted to heat that must be removed to satisfy the thermal management,"" he said. ""in large data centers, even a small reduction in thermal load per device can add up. we hope to simplify the thermal requirements of these electronic devices."" 
 in addition to those already mentioned, the research team included taiyun chi, huy thong nguyen and tzu-yuan huang, all from georgia tech.

 chemical manufacturers consume a massive amount of energy each year separating and refining feedstocks to make a wide variety of products including gasoline, plastics and food. 
 in a bid to reduce the amount of energy used in chemical separations, researchers at the georgia institute of technology are working on membranes that could separate chemicals without using energy-intensive distillation processes. 
 ""the vast majority of separations out in the field in a variety of industries are thermally-driven systems such as distillation, and because of that we spend an inordinate amount of energy on these separation processes - something like 10 to 15 percent of the global energy budget is spent on chemical separations,"" said ryan lively, an associate professor in georgia tech's school of chemical & biomolecular engineering.  ""separations that avoid the use of heat and a chemical phase-change are much less energy intense. in practice, using them could produce a 90 percent reduction in energy cost."" 
 plastic membranes are already able to separate certain molecules based on size and other differences, such as in seawater desalination. but until now, most membranes have been unable to withstand harsh solvent-rich chemical streams while also performing challenging separation tasks. 
 in a study published july 18 in 
 chemistry of materials 
 and sponsored by the department of defense and the national science foundation, the researchers outline a process for taking a polymer-based membrane and infusing it with a metal oxide network. the resulting membrane is far more effective at standing up to harsh chemicals without degrading. 
 ""after placing the pre-fabricated membrane inside of our reactor, we simply expose it to metal-containing vapors that infuse themselves inside the membrane material,"" said mark losego, an assistant professor in the school of materials science and engineering. ""this process is called vapor phase infiltration, and it creates a uniform network of metal oxide throughout the polymer membrane.  we call it a ‘hybrid' membrane."" 
 not only was the hybrid membrane better able to withstand solvents, its chemical separation capabilities also improved. 
 ""some chemicals that need to be separated are very similar in terms of their size, shape and other properties, which makes them even harder to process using membranes,"" lively said. ""these new hybrid membrane are much more selective.  they can separate chemicals that are more similar to each other."" 
 the research team, which included graduate students fengyi zhang, emily mcguinness and yao ma, tested the new hybrid membranes in harsh chemicals such as tetrahydrofuran, dichloromethane and chloroform, organic solvents that dissolve the pure polymer membrane in minutes. the hybrid membranes remained stable for several months during testing. 
 the researchers also tested separating two chemicals very close in size. the hybrid membranes were able to differentiate aromatic molecules that differed in size by as little as 0.2 nanometers. 
 ""one of the most exciting things about this work was how straightforward this process is from a manufacturing perspective,"" losego said. ""we're essentially taking pre-made membranes and applying a treatment to them. that's something that would be very simple to translate to an industrial scale."" 
 future research on the membranes will involve looking at how to fine tune the oxide infusions and make new types of hybrid membranes capable of separating a variety of other chemicals.

 micro c, a savannah-based medical device startup founded by a georgia tech graduate, said it successfully raised $260,000 in its early-seed funding round. micro c, one of the advanced technology development center's atdc accelerate startup portfolio companies, developed an all-in-one, hand-held x-ray and digital camera for surgeons and physicians treating disorders of the extremities. atdc, an initiative of georgia tech that operates programs in savannah, augusta, and athens, is the state's technology incubator. it is one of the longest-running and largest university-affiliated business incubators in the country. the funds will be put toward prototyping expenses and early marketing initiatives of the wireless device, said dr. greg kolovich, an orthopedic hand and micro-surgeon and company founder. ""this is a novel approach as we currently do not have a hand-held fluoroscopy device in orthopedic surgery or any kind of surgery outside of dental,"" said kolovich, who earned his electrical engineering degree from georgia tech, medical degree from ohio state, and surgical training at harvard. ""this is a bridge between the large c-arms we use in the operating room and smaller ones used by dentists to take x-rays of teeth."" the standard c-arm, first launched in 1955, is a medical imaging device. while the technology has advanced and improved since then, kolovich said there is a great need for a light hand-held device, particularly when dealing with surgeries of the hand and foot. under standard practice with existing c-arms, when the surgeon needs to take an x-ray, they and their medical teams have to stop what they're doing to take the images. ""the innovation is the application of it for intra-operative imaging without having to go ahead and stop what you're doing,"" said evan ruff, ceo of micro c and a graduate of tech with a degree in computer engineering. ""so this can be used while you're performing the surgery."" in addition to ruff and kolovich, kirby sisk, who serves as chief operating officer, also earned a degree in mechanical engineering from tech. ""the reason i came up with the idea, i was reattaching a severed hand with the help of an intern. it was cumbersome and time-consuming to manipulate the c-arm, while you're trying to position a plate on an unstable wrist and confirm that with an x-ray,"" kolovich said. ""so i thought it be awesome if i could freely move the x-ray to the hand by separating the x-ray emitter from the sensor, to give me and other surgeons that extra degree of freedom."" what's more, he sought to create a device that would reduce the amount of unnecessary radiation exposure to both the patient and medical professionals. because of prolonged exposure to radiation, some doctors are prone to developing cataracts or are at risk for certain kinds of cancers. the company's device emits 100 times less radiation than current c-arms. it also takes video and high-resolution, digital images in both natural and infrared wavelengths. ""we created a really cool way of making x-rays in the operating room safer,"" kolovich said, explaining the device is expected to cost between $30,000 and $50,000, as compared with standard c-arms, which can cost three times that amount. that cost difference could help not only rural doctors in the united states who can't afford traditional c-arms, but also medical professionals in developing countries, the executives said. additionally, specialists in other fields, including athletic trainers, the military, and veterinarians, could use the technology, kolovich said. - péralte c. paul

 - atlanta, ga 
 researchers have demonstrated an integrated technique for monitoring specific biomolecules - such as growth factors - that could indicate the health of living cell cultures produced for the burgeoning field of cell-based therapeutics. 
 using microfluidic technology to advance the preparation of samples from the chemically complex bioreactor environment, the researchers have harnessed electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (esi-ms) to provide online monitoring that they believe will provide for therapeutic cell production the kind of precision quality control that has revolutionized other manufacturing processes. 
 ""the way that the production of cell therapeutics is done today is very much an art,"" said 
 andrei fedorov , woodruff professor in the 
 george w. woodruff school of mechanical engineering 
 at the georgia institute of technology. ""process control must evolve very quickly to support the therapeutic applications that are emerging from bench science today. we think this technology will help us reach the goal of making these exciting cell-based therapies widely available."" 
 by measuring very low concentrations of specific compounds secreted or excreted by cells, the technique could also help identify which biomolecules - of widely varying sizes - should be monitored to guide the control of cell health. ultimately, the researchers hope to integrate their label-free monitoring directly into high-volume bioreactors that will produce cells in quantities large enough to make the new therapies available at a reasonable cost and consistent quality. 
 development of the dynamic mass spectrometry probe (dmsp) was supported by the national science foundation (nsf) engineering research center for cell manufacturing technologies (cmat), which is headquartered at georgia tech. the work was reported september 10 in the journal 
 biotechnology and bioengineering . 
 traditional esi-ms techniques have revolutionized analytical chemistry by allowing precise identification of complex biological compounds. because of complex sample preparation requirements, existing approaches to esi-ms require too much time to be useful for continuous monitoring of cell growth in bioreactors, where maintaining narrow parameters for specific indicators of cellular health is critical. biological samples also contain salts, which must be removed before introduction into the esi-ms system. 
 to accelerate the analytical process, fedorov and a team that included graduate research assistant mason chilmonczyk and research engineer peter kottke used microfluidic technology to help separate compounds of interest from the salts. salt removal uses a monolithic device in which a size-selective membrane with nanoscale pores is placed between two fluid flows, one the chemically complex sample drawn from the bioreactors and the other salt-free water with conditioning compounds. 
 the smaller salt molecules readily diffuse out of the sampled bioreactor flow through the nanopores, while the larger biomolecules mostly remain for the subsequent esi-ms analysis. meanwhile, chemical additives are at the same time introduced into the sample mixture through the same membrane nanopores to enhance ionization of the target biomolecules in the sampled mixture for improved esi-ms analysis. 
 ""we have used advanced microfabrication techniques to create a microfluidic device that will be able to treat samples in less than a minute,"" said chilmonczyk. ""traditional sample preparation can require hours to days."" 
 the process can currently remove as much as 99 percent of the salt, while retaining 80 percent of the biomolecules. introduction of the conditioning chemicals allows the molecules to accept a greater charge, improving the capability of the mass spectrometer to detect low concentration biomolecules, and to measure large molecules. 
 ""we can detect really high molecular weight molecules that the mass spectrometer normally wouldn't be able to detect,"" fedorov said. ""the size difference in the molecules of interest can be dramatic, so the improvement in the limit of detection across a broad range of analyte molecular weights will allow this technique to be more useful in cell manufacturing."" 
 because they use state of the art microfabrication techniques, the dmsp devices can be mass produced, allowing sampling to be scaled up to include multiple bioreactors at low cost. the small size of the device channels - which are just five microns tall - allows the system to produce results with samples as small as 20 nanoliters - with the potential for reducing that to as little as a single nanoliter. 
 ""we need to monitor small concentrations of large biomolecules in this messy environment in a production line in such a way that we can check at any point how the cells are doing,"" fedorov said. ""this system could continuously monitor whether certain molecules are excreted or secreted at a reduced or increased rate. by correlating these measurements with cell health and potency, we could improve the manufacturing process."" 
 before the analytical techniques can be applied to quality control, the researchers must first identify biomolecules that indicate health of the growing cells. by sampling the bioreactor content locally in the immediate vicinity of cells and allowing identification of very small quantities of biochemicals, the dmsp technology can help researchers identify changes in molecular concentrations - which range from pico-molar to micro-molar - that may indicate the state of cells in the bioreactors. this would prompt adjustment of conditions in a bioreactor just in time to return to the state of healthy cell growth. 
 ""in this situation, we often can't see the trees for the forest,"" said fedorov. ""there is a lot of material available, but we are looking for just a handful of individual trees that indicate the health of the cells. because the forest is overgrown, the few selected trees we need to examine are hard to find. this is a grand challenge technologically."" 
 the research team also included research scientist hazel stevens and professor robert guldberg, who is now at the university of oregon.

microgel-composite-could-overcome-fibrin-blockade-accelerate-healing.txt,"microgel composite could overcome fibrin blockade to accelerate healing 
 researchers have combined microgels with robust polymer networks to create a new repair material. 
 visualization shows the microgel network architecture in fibrin-microgel composite materials. confocal microscopy images of fluorescently labeled microgels (shown in blue and red) and fibrin (shown in green) demonstrate that at a critical volume fraction, the microgels form an interconnected tunnel network within the fibrous fibrin matrix. microgels are tightly packed and only slightly jiggle around within the microgel domains. (credit: alison douglas)

 - atlanta, ga 
 in regenerative medicine, the ideal repair material would offer properties that seem impossibly contradictory. it must be rigid and robust enough to be manipulated surgically, yet soft and porous enough to allow healing cells to pass through it to launch repair and regeneration processes. 
 now, researchers have taken an important step toward creating such a material by combining water-filled particles known as microgels with robust polymer networks made of natural fibrin. in a remarkable dynamic process, the microgels self-assemble into three-dimensional tunnel-like structures that could allow repair cells to migrate through the polymer network to begin the healing process. 
 the research, resulting from collaboration between biomedical engineers, materials scientists and physicists, could give surgeons a new tool for repairing major injuries and lead to development of a battlefield bandage that soldiers might use to control bleeding - while allowing healing to begin more quickly. supported by the national institutes of health, the department of defense and the national science foundation, the research was reported january 19 in the journal 
 proceedings of the national academy of sciences . 
 ""these composite materials could have a real chance of helping bridge the divide between what the surgeons need and what your body needs during tissue repair and regeneration,"" said thomas barker, a professor in the department of biomedical engineering at the university of virginia and the paper's corresponding author. ""this is a novel demonstration of a biological use for super soft particle systems, which are widely studied in the physics community. they could allow cells to migrate through what is actually a relatively hard material whose strength is provided by the bulk fibrin."" 
 in the fibrin matrix created by the research team, the colloidal hydrogels move slowly, passing by each other as water molecules pass each other as they flow into a sink. but the hydrogel particles move much more slowly than water molecules, taking perhaps an hour to pass by another particle, explained alberto fernandez-nieves, an associate professor in the school of physics at the georgia institute of technology and one the paper's senior authors. 
 ""the softness of the microgel particles allows them to pass by each other, and that is a key ingredient in allowing cells to move into the material,"" fernandez-nieves explained. ""we can control the speed of the cell migration by controlling the time associated with the flow behavior of the microgel suspension."" 
 in real injuries, blood coagulation forms a fibrin mesh from the polymerization of fibrinogen, a natural protein. the mesh stops the bleeding, but repair cells must break down the fibrin network before they can begin the repair and regeneration process. letting cells migrate through the fibrin-microgel material could accelerate the healing process. 
 the researchers were surprised to see that cells known as fibroblasts could migrate through the composite material they made. 
 ""in this new material, cell motility is not restricted in what is otherwise a very tightly packed area,"" barker said. ""conventional wisdom and decades of data would tell us that the cells would not move in these colloidal domains, yet we see the cells moving faster than if there were nothing there. the colloidal domains that form in fibrin comprised of these unique ‘squishy' particles display physical properties that are very different from what people would expect, and are very attractive for biomedical applications."" 
 the research group used microgels developed by andrew lyon, now a professor and dean of schmid college at chapman university. because of the unusual way in which these particles are crosslinked, the poly(n-isopropylacrylamide) particles are very soft - softer than living cells. 
 former georgia tech graduate student alison douglas created the fibrin-microgel composites in the laboratory, varying the composition and examining the resulting network under a microscope. as the fibrin polymerized, the particles formed pockets that continued to rearrange themselves even after the fibrin network was fully formed. the pockets created tunnels that led through the fibrin network. with help from graduate student alexandros fragkopoulos, they used home-built matlab codes to characterize the structure and architecture of the resulting material. 
 living fibroblast cells were applied to the structure, and the researchers found that the cells were able to penetrate into the fibrin-microgel network. the cells were unable to enter a control network made without the microgels. 
 ""the speed of the cells is related to the time required for the microgels to rearrange themselves,"" fernandez-nieves said. ""you get a fibrin network with microgel pockets that percolate through it. there are tunnel-like pockets in the network that are filled with microgels, and the cells are able to exploit the long-time flow behavior of this suspension to get through the fibrin-based material."" 
 in future research, the team hopes to explore factors controlling cell migration in colloidal environments, and evaluate the potential for biomaterials capitalizing on the unique properties they've demonstrated. among the results could be a material that could be applied to wounds sustained by soldiers on the battlefield. the material could help stop the bleeding, but would immediately allow healing cells to enter the injured area. 
 ""this is a significant step toward producing a new material that would be robust, but at the same time permeable and able to allow cells to move through it,"" fernandez-nieves said. ""we want to continue to explore the physical properties of these materials and quantify how cells interact with the surrounding microgel suspension.""

 a new microneedle patch being developed by the georgia institute of technology and the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) could make it easier to vaccinate people against measles and other vaccine-preventable diseases. the microneedle patch is designed to be administered by minimally trained workers and to simplify storage, distribution, and disposal compared with conventional vaccines. the microneedle patch under development measures about a square centimeter and is administered with the press of a thumb. the underside of the patch is lined with 100 solid, conical microneedles made of polymer, sugar, and vaccine that are a fraction of a millimeter long. when the patch is applied, the microneedles press into the upper layers of the skin; they dissolve within a few minutes, releasing the vaccine. the patch can then be discarded. ""each day, 400 children are killed by measles complications worldwide. with no needles, syringes, sterile water or sharps disposals needed, the microneedle patch offers great hope of a new tool to reach the world's children faster, even in the most remote areas,"" said james goodson, ph.d., epidemiologist from the cdc's global immunization division. ""this advancement would be a major boost in our efforts to eliminate this disease, with more vaccines administered and more lives saved at less cost."" getting the measles vaccine to remote areas is expected to be easier because the patch is more stable at varying temperatures than the currently available vaccines and takes up less space than the standard vaccine. because microneedles dissolve in the skin, there is no disposal of needles, reducing the risk of accidental needlesticks. the measles patch is expected be manufactured at a cost comparable to the currently available needle and syringe vaccine. twenty million people are affected by measles each year. unfortunately, global coverage with the measles vaccine has been stagnant for the last few years at around 85 percent, which is well below the coverage of up to 95 percent needed to interrupt transmission of the disease. because measles is vaccine-preventable and the measles virus survives only in human hosts, the world's health officials are aiming for measles elimination. having a simple patch administered by minimally trained vaccinators could help increase vaccination coverage and achieve the goal of measles elimination. georgia tech and cdc's global immunization division and division of viral diseases recently completed a study that showed the new microneedle patch produces a strong immune response in an animal model. no adverse effects or health issues were noted during the study. these findings have cleared the way for developing proposals for human clinical trials, which could begin as early as 2017. ""we think this collaboration with cdc is an excellent example of how advances in engineering can be used to address important public health problems,"" said mark prausnitz, a regents professor in the school of chemical & biomolecular engineering at georgia tech. prausnitz served as one of the principal investigators on the study. world immunization week, celebrated in the last week of april each year, aims to promote the use of vaccines to protect people of all ages against disease. this year's campaign focuses on closing the immunization gap and reaching equity in immunization levels as outlined in the global vaccine action plan (gvap). the plan, endorsed by the 194 member states of the world health assembly in may 2012, is the framework to prevent millions of deaths by 2020 through universal access to vaccines for people in all communities. the gvap aims to: strengthen routine immunization to meet vaccination coverage targets;  accelerate control of vaccine-preventable diseases with polio eradication as the first milestone;  eliminate measles and rubella;  introduce new and improved vaccines; and  spur research and development for the next generation of vaccines and technologies. microneedle technology could move the gvap forward by leading to improved protection against other diseases, including polio, influenza, rotavirus, rubella, tuberculosis and others. cdc is also collaborating with georgia tech to see if microneedles could be used to administer inactivated polio vaccine. additional research is studying microneedle-administration of the influenza, rotavirus and tuberculosis vaccines. to watch a video about microneedle technology please visit

 study finds hydrated salts on mars, suggesting liquid water on the planet.

 a new study 
 led by scientists at the georgia institute of technology provides the strongest evidence yet that there is intermittent flowing liquid water on modern mars. using instruments on board nasa's mars reconnaissance orbiter (mro), researchers measured spectral signatures of hydrated minerals on slopes where mysterious, possibly water-related streaks are found on the red planet. these streaks, known as recurring slope lineae (rsl), form and snake down the planet's steep slopes during warm seasons when temperatures exceed -10 degrees fahrenheit (-23 degrees celsius). they disappear at colder times during the martian year.   lujendra ojha, the georgia tech ph.d. candidate who led the study, first noticed these puzzling features in high resolution imagine science experiment (hirise) images returned by the mro spacecraft as an undergraduate at the university of arizona in 2010. ojha says spectral signatures of hydrated salts were visible in many rsl if they were relatively wide in diameter. the clincher came when the researchers looked at the same locations when rsl weren't visible and the hydration signatures had disappeared. ""something is hydrating these salts, and it appears to be these streaks that come and go with the seasons,"" said ojha. ""this means the water on mars is briny, rather than pure. it makes sense because salts lower the freezing point of water. even if rsl are slightly underground, where it's even colder than the surface temperature, the salts would keep the water in a liquid form and allow it to creep down martian slopes."" up until this point, the recurrence of rsl during the warmest seasons suggested action of a volatile. the still cool ground temperatures suggested brines, but it was difficult to get the footprint of the orbital mapping spectrometers on such narrow features.   the researchers believe that the signatures are caused by hydrated minerals called perchlorates. they state that the hydrated salts most consistent with the chemical signatures are probably a mixture of magnesium perchlorate, magnesium chlorate and sodium perchlorate. some perchlorates have been shown to keep liquids from freezing even when conditions are as cold as -70 degrees celsius. on earth, naturally produced perchlorates are concentrated in deserts, and some types of perchlorates can be used as rocket propellant. perchlorates have previously been discovered on mars. the phoenix lander and curiosity both found them in the planet's soil, and some scientists believe that the viking missions in the 1970s measured signatures of these salts. however, this study of rsl detected perchlorates in entirely different areas from where the landers explored. this is also the first time perchlorates have been identified from orbit. the team - which also included researchers from nasa ames research center, the johns hopkins university applied physics laboratory, university of arizona, southwest research institute and laboratoire de planétologie et géodynamique - used data acquired by mro's compact reconnaissance imaging spectrometer for mars (crism) to identify the spectral signatures. the orbiter began circling the planet in 2006. four years later, rsl were discovered in mro / hirise images, leading some scientists to think that liquid water might be flowing on the present-day martian surface. ""almost 40 years after the viking landers first analyzed the soils on mars, it's exciting that we're able to expand the places where this important resource might be concentrated on the red planet,"" said mary beth wilhelm, another georgia tech ph.d. candidate and nasa researcher who co-authored the paper. their advisor, georgia tech assistant professor james wray, says the current process for observing spectral signatures is a bit limited. because of its fixed orbit, mro sees the same locations of mars at the same time every day. ""we're only able to receive data on these rsl locations in mid-afternoon, when the air is dry and the morning humidity is almost gone,"" wray said. ""when future spacecraft arrive in the planet's orbit, we could see larger, wetter rsl at earlier times of the day. this could just be the tip of the iceberg.""    regardless, for ojha, the new findings are more proof that the mysterious lines he first saw meandering down martian slopes five years ago are indeed current-day water. ""when most people talk about water on mars, they're usually talking about ancient water or frozen water,"" he says. ""but there's more. this is the first spectral detection that unambiguously supports our liquid water-formation hypotheses for rsl."" the paper, "" spectral evidence for hydrated salts in recurring slope lineae on mars ,"" is published in the journal nature geoscience. this work is partially funded by the national science foundation graduate research fellowship program under grant no. dge-1148903. the research was further supported by mdap grant no. nnx13ak01g.

missing-links-brewed-primordial-puddles.txt,"missing links brewed in primordial puddles? 
 researchers have created nucleotides very similar to those in rna in surprisingly simple laboratory reactions in water, under everyday conditions. they have produced what could be good candidates for missing links on the pathway to the code of life. 
 nearly twins and possibly keys to a unlocking the mystery of the evolution of life-coding molecules. nicholas hud holds up uracil, on the right, a nucleobase of rna. barbituric acid, on the left, looks very much like it and could have been part of a proto-rna that preceded rna. 
 apr 25, 2016 
 - atlanta, ga 
 the crucibles that bore out early building blocks of life may have been, in many cases, modest puddles. now, 
 researchers working with that hypothesis 
 have achieved a significant advancement toward unlocking a longstanding evolutionary mystery -- how components of rna and dna formed from chemicals present on early earth before life existed. it could also have implications on how astrobiologists view the probability of life elsewhere in the universe. in surprisingly simple laboratory reactions in water, under everyday conditions, they have produced what could be good candidates for missing links on the pathway to the code of life. and when those components joined up, the result even looked like rna. as the researchers' work progresses, it could reveal that much of the original chemistry that led to life arose not in fiery cataclysms and in scarce quantities, but abundantly and gradually on quiet, rain-swept dirt flats or lakeshore rocks lapped by waves. the research from the 
 nsf / nasa center for chemical evolution , headquartered at the georgia institute of technology, is generously funded through a grant from the national science foundation and nasa. the recent results 
 were published on april 25, 2016 in 
 nature communications. 
 pursuing the origins specifically of rna, the close chemical relative of dna, a research team led by nicholas hud, a professor in the  school of chemistry and biochemistry  at the georgia institute of technology and director of the cce, worked with a pair of potential chemical ancestors of the nucleobases of rna. for roughly half a century, scientists have hypothesized that life, which uses dna to store genetic information, was preceded by life forms that used rna very broadly. and rna may have had a precursor, 
 proto- rna, with different but similar nucleotides (the ""n"" in rna). ""early earth was a messy laboratory where probably many molecules like those needed for life were produced. some survived and prospered, while others eventually vanished,"" hud said. ""that goes for the ancestors of rna, too."" using two molecules known as barbituric acid and melamine, the researchers formed proto-nucleotides so strongly resembling two of rna's nucleotides that it is tempting to speculate that they are indeed their ancestors. the two ingredients would have been readily abundant for reactions on a prebiotic earth, hud said.  ""and they would have been well suited for primitive information coding,"" he added. because of the resemblances and properties, some scientists already have speculated on an ancestral role for melamine and barbituric acid. but the cce scientists are careful not to jump to that conclusion just yet. ""to claim ancestry, we would have to show a mechanism by which these nucleotides we made in the lab could turn into the existing nucleotides in rna,"" said ram krishnamurthy, hud's collaborator from 
 the scripps research institute in la jolla, california .  ""it's a complex path that we'd have to at least design on paper, and we're not there."" nonetheless, he's exited about the results. ""there are umpteen possibilities of how that mechanism could have happened. barbituric acid and melamine may have been place holders that dropped out and allowed adenine and uracil to come together with ribose."" figuring out how adenine and uracil (nucleobases found in rna today) combined with the sugar ribose (corresponding to the ""r"" in rna) could answer one of the great questions of chemical evolution. the formation of nucleotides from possible proto-nucleobases and ribose marks a significant advancement in research on the origin of life. nucleobases have been combined with other sugars in past studies, but the efficiency of the reactions discovered in this study is much greater than those of that past. ""we're getting close to molecules that look the way life may have looked in early stages,"" krishnamurthy said. a series of surprises added to the reactions' scientific significance. first, they occurred quickly and the resulting nucleotides spontaneously paired with each other in water, forming hydrogen bonds like the watson-crick base pairs that create the ""ladder-rung"" pattern inside rna and dna helixes. then the monomers formed long, supramolecular assemblages that look like strands of rna when viewed with a high resolution microscope. there has been no reported chemical reaction so far that has produced existing components of rna under commonplace circumstances that spontaneously form crick-watson pairs in water. and up until now, there had also been no report of a similar pair of nucleotides, like those produced with barbituric acid and melamine, behaving in a like manner, making this another first. ""it works even better then we thought,"" hud said. ""it's almost too easy."" there was one small caveat. ""the reaction does not work as well if barbituric acid and melamine are present in the same solution before reacting with ribose because their strong attraction for each other can cause them to precipitate,"" hud said. so, the scientists completed the reaction involving barbituric acid separately from the one involving melamine. but that should not have proven prohibitive on prebiotic earth. barbituric acid and melamine nucleotides could have been formed in separate locations, even in the same pond. and they could have very well been plentiful. ""these reactions are exceptionally productive, especially if you compare them to analogous reactions with existing rna components, which do not produce any nucleotides under the same conditions,"" hud said. if melamine and barbituric acid formed their respective nucleotides (c-bmp for barbituric acid and mmp for melamine) in separate puddles on the early earth, then rain could have easily washed the components together, where they would have rapidly assembled into what could have been a precursor to proto-rna. ""the question is: can these self-assemblies make the transition into what makes up life today,"" krishnamurthy said. the researchers hope their work will help expand the scientific community's approach to chemical evolution. ""if you want to look at what brought about these properties of life you have to go back and consider all the other molecules that would have been present and see how they would have facilitated the molecules that are present in life today,"" krishnamurthy said. their work also could serve as a basis for important practical applications, such as the creation of dna or rna-like polymers that could spawn production of advanced materials and therapeutic agents. the chemical reactions that produce the barbituric acid and melamine nucleotides don't require the use of enzymes and extreme parameters like high heat and pressure. reminiscent of click chemistry, they could contribute to safe, cost-effective and abundant industrial production. in addition to those already named, the paper's authors include brian j. cafferty, david m. fialho and jaheda khanam, all from georgia tech. this research was supported by the nsf centers for chemical innovation program and the nasa astrobiology program under the nsf / nasa center for chemical evolution under grant number che-1004570. the content is solely the responsibility of the authors and does not necessarily represent the official views of the nsf or nasa. research news georgia institute of technology media relations contacts:

 dna barcoding has landed james dahlman in a list that has previously honored mark zuckerberg, larry page and helen greiner 
 mit technology review's ""35 innovators under 35"" applauded james dahlman as a great inventor in its 2018 annual edition. dahlman is synonymous with dna-barcoding at georgia tech. the method tests hundreds of drug-delivering nanoparticles at once in vivo. credit: mit technology review

 - atlanta, ga 
 when a recognition makes your name fit comfortably into the same sentence with facebook's ""mark zuckerberg"" or google co-founder ""larry page,"" you know it's something special. a shout-out in the 
 mit technology review 's annual roster of ""35 innovators under 35"" did just that for georgia tech biomedical researcher james dahlman. 
 the iconic research magazine applauded dahlman because, as it stated in its headline, "" his method makes it possible to test 300 drugs at once ."" the ""35"" roster is noted for having anticipated the successes of zuckerberg and page, as well as that of helen greiner, co-founder of irobot, jonathan ive, chief designer at apple, and other consummate go-getters in industry, technology, and research. 
 dahlman felt honored to join the list, which was published on june 27, but also humbled. 
 ""i wouldn't put myself in the same category as those people, but research colleagues who have made this list have gone on to make very significant contributions to science,"" said dahlman, an assistant professor at the georgia institute of technology. 
 ""it's hard to get on that list, so i was thrilled, and a little surprised,"" he said. ""it also comes with certain expectations to live up to."" 
 dna-barcoding 
 what dahlman scrutinizes with his methods are, more precisely, nanoparticles designed to deliver a drug or gene therapy. 
 he calls 
 his invention ""dna-barcoding, "" because it tracks hundreds of different nanoparticles at once to see how well they hit targeted tumor cells by loading up each one of the particles with its own custom-coded piece of dna. researchers can inject the particles all at once into a live mouse then later excise the tumor and sequence the dna strands to see which nanoparticles best delivered their payloads to tumor cells. 
 the top nanoparticles could be loaded up with an effective therapy for targeted delivery. 
 ""dna makes for a fantastic tracker,"" dahlman said. ""there are thousands to millions to billions of code combinations. it's nature's way of storing information, so we can exploit that."" 
 dna barcoding has upended other methods of tracking nanoparticles. it has flatly nullified the results of tracking via lab samples, 
 in vitro . and barcoding has left traditional tracking  in vivo, 
 in live mice, which can only follow one or a few particles at a time, in the dust. 
 parkinson's and heart disease 
 the 
 review 
 cited specifically dna barcoding's potential for honing nanoparticles' aim at cancer cells, but there are many possible uses. 
 ""it can be for any cell type. we're also using it for heart disease and for parkinson's,"" dahlman said. 
 dahlman gives the real credit for the ""35"" kudos to the graduate students and postdoctoral researchers in his lab for precision therapies in the 
 wallace h. coulter department of biomedical engineering at georgia tech and emory university . 
 ""they have done a lot of the actual work,"" dahlman said. ""if you don't get good students, you won't be able to do anything, and the school here should get a lot of credit for recruiting them."" 
 the graduate students were jazzed to see their principal investigator on a pedestal. 
 ""we were all super excited and all huddled around the computer looking at james's profile and at the other people on that list to see what they accomplished to get on that list,"" said ph.d. student cory sago, who chose georgia tech largely because of dahlman. 
 past georgia tech honorees 
 past georgia tech researchers named in the ""35"" list include 
 microneedle patch co-inventor 
 mark prausnitz , and microfluidics engineer and genotype-phenotype researcher 
 hang lu . more georgia tech graduates, mainly from master's programs, have appeared on the 
 mit technology review 
 roster for making notable entrepreneurial waves. 
 dahlman's inclusion in the 2018 edition of ""35 innovators under 35"" follows a string of prior acknowledgments and fellowships awarded dahlman by the national science foundation, the defense advanced research projects agency, the national institutes of health and private foundations. 
 the 
 mit technology review 
 was founded at the  massachusetts institute of technology  in 1899, and later became independent but maintains its affiliation with mit. dahlman received his ph.d. jointly from mit and harvard medical school in 2014 and was a postdoctoral researcher at their shared broad institute, which is dedicated to improving human health through genomics.

 century? would he be satisfied with the progress the nation has made to ensure that all americans enjoy the promise of the rights to ""life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness?""

 during georgia tech's mlk lecture on january 11, bakari sellers, cnn political analyst, lawyer, and activist, honored dr. king's legacy while setting the agenda for the next civil rights movement with students, faculty, staff, and community members. during his remarks, sellers asked the audience: ""how far have we come, and where do we go from here?"" 
 ""when you think about the sacrifice of the civil rights leaders like marion barry and julian bond, and you ask yourself, ‘where do we go from here?' there are two choices - chaos or community - as dr. king once outlined,"" said sellers. ""the answer between these choices lies fundamentally in our ability to dream with our eyes open."" 
 according to sellers, ""when you dream with your eyes open, you seek nothing less than excellence."" he gave an example from his own life, when he made history in 2006 as the youngest member of the south carolina state legislature and the youngest african-american elected official in the nation. 
 ""we have to remember the names that are not taught. for example, shirley chisholm helped paved the way for hillary clinton,"" remarked sellers. ""we stand on the shoulders of countless heroes who deserve from us to continue this journey on the race to excellence.""

 when someone you know is wearing an unfamiliar hat, you might not recognize them. georgia institute of technology researchers are using just such a disguise to sneak biomaterials containing peptide signaling molecules into living animals. when the disguised peptides are needed to launch biological processes, the researchers shine ultraviolet light onto the molecules through the skin, causing the ""hat"" structures to come off. that allows cells and other molecules to recognize and interact with the peptides on the surface of the material. this light-activated triggering technique has been demonstrated in animal models, and if it can be made to work in humans, it could help provide more precise timing for processes essential to regenerative medicine, cancer treatment, immunology, stem cell growth, and a range of other areas. the research represents the first time biological signals presented on biomaterials have been activated by light through the skin of a living animal, and could provide a broader platform technology for launching and controlling biological processes in living animals. ""many biological processes involve complex cascades of reactions in which the timing must be very tightly controlled,"" said andrés garcía, a regents professor in the george w. woodruff school of mechanical engineering at georgia tech and principal investigator for the project. ""until now, we haven't had control over the sequence of events in the response to implanted materials. but with this technique, we can deliver a drug or particle with its signal in the ‘off' position, then use light to turn the signal ‘on' precisely when needed."" supported by the national science foundation and the national institutes of health, the research was reported december 15, 2014, in the journal 
 nature materials . it resulted from collaboration between scientists from georgia tech and the max-planck institute in germany through the materials world network program. when biomaterials are introduced into the body, they normally stimulate an immune system response immediately. but the researchers used molecular cages like hats to cover binding sites on the peptides that are normally recognized by cell receptors, preventing recognition by the animal's cells. the cages were designed to detach and reveal the peptides when they encounter specific wavelengths of light. during the five-year project, the research team - which included ted lee and jose garcia from georgia tech and aranzazu del campo from max-planck - modified peptides that normally trigger cell adhesion to present the molecular cage in order to disguise them. they showed that disguised peptides introduced into animal models on biomaterials could trigger cell adhesion, inflammation, fibrous encapsulation, and vascularization responses when activated by light. they also showed that the location and timing of activation could be controlled inside the animal by simply shining light through the skin. the work involved numerous controls to ensure that the triggering observed by the researchers was actually done by exposure of the peptides - not the light, or the removal of the protective cage. the researchers also had to demonstrate that the ""hats"" were stable enough that they didn't come off spontaneously, but only when the link between the molecular cage and the peptide was severed by the ultraviolet light. among the experiments was use of the peptide to attract cells that would attach themselves to the biomaterial. ""we showed that if we left the hat on, there would be few cells attracted to the material, garcía said. ""but when we take the hat off, we recruited a lot of cells to the material. that shows we can activate the peptide, and that the activation has a biological consequence."" another experiment showed that the timing of peptide activation could affect the quantity of fibrosis, an immune system response that builds a protective capsule around an implanted biomaterial. by delaying the exposure of the peptides until after the bulk of the inflammation reaction had taken place, the thickness of the fibrosis capsule was significantly reduced, allowing it to be better incorporated into the body. in another experiment, the researchers showed that removing the hats could trigger the growth of blood vessels into the material. this vascularization is critical in regenerative medicine, but must take place at the right time to be successful. ""we showed that if you keep the hat on, you get no vessel in-growth into the material,"" explained garcía. ""but if we turn on the light, we get growth of new blood vessels into the material. we can control what happens and when it happens by when we expose the protective cages to light."" in the future, photochemists at the max-planck institute will be working on alternative cages that would be triggered by different wavelengths of light. as much as 90 percent of the ultraviolet light used in the experiments was lost in passing through the skin of the animal model, limiting the use of that wavelength to locations immediately below the skin. development of alternate ""hats,"" the molecular cages that protect the peptides, could allow sequential activation by light, and light activation of molecules at locations deeper inside the body. light, heat, and electricity have been used to trigger biological processes in vitro, garcía noted. light is especially useful because it can be patterned to control processes spatially, which is also important because the processes must occur not only at the right time, but also the right place. ""the technique we developed is a general strategy that we can apply to other biological signals to see if they have similar spatio-temporal effects,"" said garcía. ""we see this as a beginning. from here, there are many, many applications that we can follow."" in addition to those already mentioned, the research involved ankur singh, edward phelps and asha shekaran from georgia tech, and julieta paez, simone weis and zahid shafiq from the max-planck institute. lee now works for dexcom, a san diego-based company that focuses on continuous glucose monitoring systems for use by people with diabetes, and singh is currently an assistant professor at cornell university. the research was supported by the materials world network program of the national science foundation under grants dfg aobj 569628 and nsf dmr-0909002, by the national institutes of health under grants r01-ar062368 and r01-ar062920, and by the nih cell and tissue nih biotechnology training grant t32-gm008433. the content is solely the responsibility of the authors and does not necessarily represent the official views of the national science foundation or the national institutes of health. citation : lee, ted, et al., ""light-triggered in vivo activation of adhesive peptides regulates cell adhesion, inflammation and vascularization of biomaterials,"" nature materials 2014. research news georgia institute of technology 177 north avenue atlanta, georgia  30332-0181  usa media relations contacts : john toon (404-894-6986) ( jtoon@gatech.edu ) or brett israel (404-385-1933) ( brett.israel@comm.gatech.edu ). writer : john toon

 student organizations have had to find new ways to operate this semester, from holding virtual meetings to changing the formatting of their events. mobilizing opportunities for volunteer experiences, or move, is one such organization; this fall, they've been working to find safe ways to connect students to volunteer and community service opportunities. 
 that's why they recently launched 
 movements , a podcast where students, student organizations, and local nonprofits can talk about the work they do in getting people involved in their communities. episodes range from approximately 35 minutes to an hour in length and are released biweekly. move decided on a podcast for this project because it allows them to go in-depth with their interviews, and allows listeners to hear these stories at any time. 
 each episode of movements focuses on a topic covered by one of move's six committees: animal welfare, stem and education, hunger and homelessness, sustainability, medical assistance, and special projects. past guests have included representatives from the 
 students' temporary assistance and resources 
 (star) program, 
 books not bombs , and 
 hands on atlanta . any organization whose work fits into one of those categories can apply to appear on the podcast 
 here . interviews for movements are conducted virtually. 
 move believes that community service and civic engagement are especially important right now, because they allow people to stay engaged with their communities when regular interactions can be hard to come by. 
 ""covid-19 has affected a lot of lives this year, and there are so many organizations and projects designed to help them,"" said sydney blakeney, logistics director of move and the host of movements. ""whether it's donating clothes or money to a center fighting to end homelessness or writing a thank you note to essential workers, those actions can make a huge difference in someone's life."" 
 students can get involved with move at any point in the semester. visit their 
 engage page 
 for a list of upcoming events (none of which requires move membership to attend) and rolling committee member application. organizations looking for funding for their own service projects can also apply for the move service grant there, but they must do so at least three weeks in advance. 
 ""there are a lot more forms of civic engagement and service than people realize, and i hope we can introduce people to them,"" blakeney said.

 a musical, interactive tabletop teaches the basics of computer coding. 
 coasters can be moved along tunetable's projection surface to make music using elements of computer programming 
 dec 14, 2016 
 - atlanta, ga 
 museums are the next places k-12 students will have a chance to learn about computer programming. as part of a $3 million grant from the national science foundation, researchers at the georgia institute of technology and northwestern university have built a musical, interactive tabletop exhibit that teaches the basics of computer coding. 
 it's called tunetable . students move coasters along the table's projection surface to make a musical piece using elements of computer programming.  then they tap the surface to play a series of beats, beeps and samples. the table will be installed at the museum of design atlanta in early 2017 and chicago's museum of science and industry in the summer. 
 the project addresses a national need to make major strides in computer programming literacy for k-12 students. 
 ""it's also about changing the attitude about computation and exposing it to people that might not have sought it out otherwise,"" said project lead brian magerko, an associate professor in georgia tech's ivan allen college of liberal arts. ""hopefully some of them will think it is a cool, new way to express themselves."" 
 the table includes basic computing programming elements that people would use when learning programming formally for the first time, such as iteration and go-to statements. 
 tunetable's interactive surface uses computer vision to detect printed markers - officially they're called fiducials -  on the coasters. each coaster is assigned a sound or programming command, such as a splitter or repeater. people link them together to form a chain of electronic and hip hop sounds. 
 ""manipulating notes, chords and rests requires a lot of music theory knowledge,"" said magerko, who also leads georgia tech's 
 adaptive digital media lab . ""instead, we're opting to manipulate music samples with code. and certain genres, such as electronic and hip hop, map very well computationally."" 
 magerko said they're also very appealing to underserved populations, such as women, african-americans and latinos. he and georgia tech college of design professor jason freeman learned that after designing a software program called 
 earsketch 
 that teaches python and javascript at nearly 200 high schools across the country. earsketch students use digital audio workstations and the programming languages to manipulate loops and compose music. tunetable reimagines this experience within a museum exhibit. 
 ""the table allows us bring the basics of computer programming out of the classroom and into more informal settings such as museums,"" said freeman, a co-principal investigator on the nsf grant. ""kids can be playful and social, just by walking up and giving it a try."" 
 once the exhibit arrives in museums, people will be able to create their own music and email it to themselves. they can continue tinkering with the code when they get home using earsketch or a tablet version of the software, which is being designed by northwestern's mike horn. 
 ""we see the tablet app as a crucial connection point between what kids experience at the museum with tunetable and what they learn in school with earsketch,"" said horn. ""we want it to give kids space and time to build up foundational computational literacy skills before the deep dive into learning python or javascript."" 
 the project is supported in part by nsf grant aisl-1612644 . any opinions, findings, and conclusions or recommendations expressed in this material are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of the sponsors.

mycorrhizal-types-control-biodiversity-effects-productivity.txt,"mycorrhizal types control biodiversity effects on productivity 
 an international, collaborative team of researchers shed light on how fungi and plant roots work together to gather nutrients - and how the diversity of plant species may impact the process. 
 fungi growing on plants in a forest 
 feb 23, 2023 
 - atlanta, ga 
 this news release first appeared in the 
 chinese academy of sciences  newsroom, and has been tailored for georgia tech readers. 
 mycorrhizal symbiosis - a symbiotic relationship that can exist between fungi and plant roots - helps plants expand their root surface area, giving plants greater access to nutrients and water. although the first and foremost role of mycorrhizal symbiosis is to facilitate plant nutrition, scientists have not been clear how mycorrhizal types mediate the nutrient acquisition and interactions of coexisting trees in forests. 
 to investigate this crucial relationship,  lingli liu , a professor at the institute of botany of the chinese academy of sciences (ibcas) led an international, collaborative team, which included  school of biological sciences professor  lin jiang . the team studied nutrient acquisition strategies of arbuscular mycorrhizae (am) and ectomycorrhizal (ecm) trees in the biodiversity-ecosystem functioning (bef) experiment in a subtropical forest in china, where trees of the two mycorrhizal types were initially evenly planted in mixtures of two, four, eight, or 16 tree species. 
 the researchers found that as the diversity of species increased, the net primary production (npp) of ecm trees rapidly decreased, but the npp of am trees progressively increased, leading to the sheer dominance (>90%) of am trees in the highest diversity treatment. 
 the team's analyses further revealed that differences in mycorrhizal nutrient-acquisition strategies, both nutrient acquisition from soil and nutrient resorption within the plant, contribute to the competitive edge of am trees over ecm ones. 
 in addition, analysis of soil microbial communities showed that ecm-tree monocultures have a high abundance of symbiotic fungi, whereas am-tree monocultures were dominated by saprotrophic and pathogenic fungi. 
 according to the researchers, as tree richness increased, shifts in microbial communities, particularly a decrease in the relative abundance of agaricomycetes (mainly ecm fungi), corresponded with a decrease in the npp of ecm subcommunities, but had a relatively small impact on the npp of am subcommunities. 
 these findings suggest that more efficient nutrient-acquisition strategies, rather than microbial-mediated negative plant-soil feedback, drive the dominance of am trees in high-diversity ecosystems. 
 this study, based on the world's largest forest bef experiment, provides novel data and an alternative mechanism for explaining why and how am trees usually dominate in high-diversity subtropical forests. 
 these findings also have practical implications for species selection in tropical and subtropical reforestation-suggesting it is preferable to plant mixed am trees, as they have a more efficient nutrient-acquisition strategy than ecm trees. 
 this study was published as an online cover article in  sciences advances  on jan. 19 and was funded by the strategic priority research program of cas and the national natural science foundation of china.

 a detailed nano-mechanical study of mechanical degradation processes in silicon structures containing varying levels of lithium ions offers good news for researchers attempting to develop reliable next-generation rechargeable batteries using silicon-based electrodes. anodes - the negative electrodes - based on silicon can theoretically store up to ten times more lithium ions than conventional graphite electrodes, making the material attractive for use in high-performance lithium-ion batteries. however, the brittleness of the material has discouraged efforts to use pure silicon in battery anodes, which must withstand dramatic volume changes during charge and discharge cycles. using a combination of experimental and simulation techniques, researchers from the georgia institute of technology and three other research organizations have reported surprisingly high damage tolerance in electrochemically-lithiated silicon materials. the work suggests that all-silicon anodes may be commercially viable if battery charge levels are kept high enough to maintain the material in its ductile state. supported by the national science foundation, the research was reported september 24 in the journal 
 nature communications . ""silicon has a very high theoretical capacity, but because of the perceived mechanical issues, people have been frustrated about using it in next-generation batteries,"" said 
 shuman xia , an assistant professor in the 
 george w. woodruff school of mechanical engineering 
 at georgia tech. ""but our research shows that lithiated silicon is not as brittle as we may have thought. if we work carefully with the operational window and depth of discharge, our results suggest we can potentially design very durable silicon-based batteries."" lithium ion batteries are used today in a wide range of applications from hand-held mobile devices up to laptop computers and electric vehicles. a new generation of high-capacity batteries could facilitate expanded transportation applications and large-scale storage of electricity produced by renewable sources. the challenge is to get more lithium ions into the anodes and cathodes of the batteries. today's lithium batteries use graphite anodes, but silicon has been identified as an alternative because it can store substantially more lithium ions per atom. however, storing those ions produces a volume change of up to 280 percent, causing stress that can crack anodes made from pure silicon, leading to significant performance degradation. one strategy is to use a composite of silicon particles and graphite, but that does not realize the full potential of silicon for boosting battery capacity. in an effort to understand what was happening with the materials, the research team used a series of systematic nano-mechanical tests, backed up by molecular dynamics simulations. to facilitate their study, they used silicon nanowires and electrochemical cells containing silicon films that were about 300 nanometers in thickness. the researchers studied the stress produced by lithiation of the silicon thin films, and used a nanoindenter - a tiny tip used to apply pressure on the film surface - to study crack propagation in these thin films, which contained varying amounts of lithium ions. lithium-lean silicon cracked under the indentation stress, but the researchers were surprised to find that above a certain concentration of lithium, they could no longer crack the thin film samples. using unique experimental equipment to assess the effects of mechanical bending on partially lithiated silcon nanotires, researchers led by professor scott mao at the university of pittsburgh studied the nanowire damage mechanisms in real-time using a transmission electron microscope (tem). their in-situ testing showed that the silicon cores of the nanowires remained brittle, while the outer portion of the wires became more ductile as they absorbed lithium. ""our nanoindentation and tem experiments were very consistent,"" said xia. ""both suggest that lithiated silicon material becomes very tolerant of damage as the lithium concentration goes above a certain level - a lithium-to-silicon molar ratio of about 1.5. beyond this level, we can't even induce cracking with very large indentation loads."" ting zhu , a professor in woodruff school of mechanical engineering at georgia tech, conducted detailed molecular dynamics simulations to understand what was happening in the electrochemically-lithiated silicon. as more lithium entered the silicon structures, he found, the ductile lithium-lithium and lithium-silicon bonds overcame the brittleness of the silicon-silicon bonds, giving the resulting lithium-silicon alloy more desirable fracture strength. ""in our simulation of lithium-rich alloys, the lithium-lithium bonds dominate,"" zhu said. ""the formation of damage and propagation of cracking can be effectively suppressed due to the large fraction of lithium-lithium and lithium-silicon bonds. our simulation revealed the underpinnings of the alloy's transition from a brittle state to a ductile state."" using the results of the studies, the researchers charted the changing mechanical properties of the silicon structures as a function of their lithium content. by suggesting a range of operating conditions under which the silicon remains ductile, xia hopes the work will cause battery engineers to take a new look at all-silicon electrodes. ""our work has fundamental and immediate implications for the development of high-capacity lithium-based batteries, both from practical and fundamental points of view,"" he said. ""lithiated silicon can have a very high damage tolerance beyond a threshold value of lithium concentration. this tells us that silicon-based batteries could be made very durable if we carefully control the depth of discharge."" in future work, xia and zhu hope to study the mechanical properties of germanium, another potential anode material for high-rate rechargeable lithium-ion batteries. they will also look at all-solid batteries, which would operate without a liquid electrolyte to shuttle ions between the two electrodes. ""we hope to find a solid electrolyte with both high lithium ion conductivity and good mechanical strength for replacing the current liquid electrolytes that are highly flammable,"" zhu said. ""the research framework we have developed here is of general applicability to a very wide range of electrode materials,"" xia noted. ""we believe this work will stimulate a lot of new directions in battery research."" this research was supported by the national science foundation through grants cmmi-1300458, cmmi-1100205 and nsf-dmr-1410936. the content is solely the responsibility of the authors and does not necessarily represent the official views of the national science foundation. citation : xueju wang, et al., "" high damage tolerance of electrochemically lithiated silicon ,"" (nature communications, 2015).

 tiny silica bottles filled with medicine and a special temperature-sensitive material could be used for drug delivery to kill malignant cells only in certain parts of the body.

 tiny silica bottles filled with medicine and a special temperature-sensitive material could be used for drug delivery to kill malignant cells only in certain parts of the body, according to a study published recently by researchers at the georgia institute of technology. 
 the research team devised a way to create silica-based hollow spheres around 200 nanometers in size, each with one small hole in the surface that could enable the spheres to encapsulate a wide range of payloads to be released later at certain temperatures only. 
 in the study, which was published on june 4 in the journal  angewandte chemie international edition , the researchers describe packing the spheres with a mixture of fatty acids, a near-infrared dye, and an anticancer drug. the fatty acids remain solid at human body temperature but melt a few degrees above. when an infrared laser is absorbed by the dye, the fatty acids will be quickly melted to release the therapeutic drug. 
 ""this new method could allow infusion therapies to target specific parts of the body and potentially negating certain side effects because the medicine is released only where there's an elevated temperature,"" said younan xia, professor and brock family chair in the wallace h. coulter department of biomedical engineering at georgia tech and emory university. ""the rest of the drug remains encapsulated by the solid fatty acids inside the bottles, which are biocompatible and biodegradable."" 
 the researchers also showed that the size of the hole could be changed, enabling nanocapsules that release their payloads at different rates. 
 ""this approach holds great promise for medical applications that require drugs to be released in a controlled fashion and has advantages over other methods of controlled drug release,"" xia said. 
 an earlier method for achieving controlled drug release involves loading the temperature-sensitive material into low-density lipoproteins, which is often referred to as ""bad cholesterol."" another method involves loading the mixture into gold nanocages. both have disadvantages in how the material used to encapsulate the drugs interact with the body, according to the study. 
 to make the silica-based bottles, the research team started by fabricating spheres out of polystyrene with a small gold nanoparticle embedded in its surface. the spheres are then coated with a silica-based material everywhere except where the gold nanoparticle is embedded. once the gold and polystyrene are removed, only a hollow silica sphere with a small opening remains. to adjust the size of the opening, the researchers simply changed the size of the gold nanoparticle. 
 the process to load the bottles with their payload involves soaking the spheres in a solution containing the mixture, removing the trapped air, then washing away the excess material and payload with water. the resulting nanocapsules contain an even mixture of the temperature-sensitive material, the therapeutic drug, and the dye. 
 to test the release mechanism, the researchers then put the nanocapsules in water and used a near-infrared laser to heat the dye while tracking the concentration of the released therapeutic. the test confirmed that without the use of the laser, the medicine remains encapsulated. after several minutes of heating, concentrations of the therapeutic rose in the water. 
 ""this controlled release system enables us to deal with the adverse impacts associated with most chemotherapeutics by only releasing the drug at a dosage above the toxic level inside the diseased site,"" said jichuan qiu, a postdoctoral fellow in the xia group.

 nanotextured surface on stainless steel appears to kill bacteria.

 - atlanta, ga 
 by using an electrochemical etching process on a common stainless steel alloy, researchers have created a nanotextured surface that kills bacteria while not harming mammalian cells. if additional research supports early test results, the process might be used to attack microbial contamination on implantable medical devices and on food processing equipment made with the metal. 
 while the specific mechanism by which the nanotextured material kills bacteria requires further study, the researchers believe tiny spikes and other nano-protrusions created on the surface puncture bacterial membranes to kill the bugs. the surface structures don't appear to have a similar effect on mammalian cells, which are an order of magnitude larger than the bacteria. 
 beyond the anti-bacterial effects, the nano-texturing also appears to improve corrosion resistance. the research was reported december 12 in the journal 
 acs biomaterials science & engineering 
 by researchers at the georgia institute of technology. 
 ""this surface treatment has potentially broad-ranging implications because stainless steel is so widely used and so many of the applications could benefit,"" said 
 julie champion , an associate professor in georgia tech's school of chemical and biomolecular engineering. ""a lot of the antimicrobial approaches currently being used add some sort of surface film, which can wear off. because we are actually modifying the steel itself, that should be a permanent change to the material."" 
 champion and her georgia tech collaborators found that the surface modification killed both gram negative and gram positive bacteria, testing it on 
 escherichia coli 
 and 
 staphylococcus aureus . but the modification did not appear to be toxic to mouse cells - an important issue because cells must adhere to medical implants as part of their incorporation into the body. 
 the research began with a goal of creating a super-hydrophobic surface on the stainless steel in an effort to repel liquids - and with them, bacteria. but it soon became clear that creating such a surface would require the use of a chemical coating, which the researchers didn't want to do. postdoctoral fellows yeongseon jang and won tae choi then proposed an alternative idea of using a nanotextured surface on stainless steel to control bacterial adhesion, and they initiated a collaboration to demonstrate this effect. 
 the research team experimented with varying levels of voltage and current flow in a standard electrochemical process. typically, electrochemical processes are used to polish stainless steel, but champion and collaborator 
 dennis hess 
 - a professor and thomas c. deloach, jr. chair in the school of chemical and biomolecular engineering - used the technique to roughen the surface at the nanometer scale. 
 ""under the right conditions, you can create a nanotexture on the grain surface structure,"" hess explained. ""this texturing process increases the surface segregation of chromium and molybdenum and thus enhances corrosion resistance, which is what differentiates stainless steel from conventional steel."" 
 microscopic examination showed protrusions 20 to 25 nanometers above the surface. ""it's like a mountain range with both sharp peaks and valleys,"" said champion. ""we think the bacteria-killing effect is related to the size scale of these features, allowing them to interact with the membranes of the bacterial cells."" 
 the researchers were surprised that the treated surface killed bacteria. and because the process appears to rely on a biophysical rather than chemical process, the bugs shouldn't be able to develop resistance to it, she added. 
 a second major potential application for the surface modification technique is food processing equipment. there, the surface treatment should prevent bacteria from adhering, enhancing existing sterilization techniques. 
 the researchers used samples of a common stainless alloy known as 316l, treating the surface with an electrochemical process in which current was applied to the metal surfaces while they were submerged in a nitric acid etching solution. 
 application of the current moves electrons from the metal surface into the electrolyte, altering the surface texture and concentrating the chromium and molybdenum content. the specific voltages and current densities control the type of surface features produced and their size scale, said hess, who worked with choi - then a ph.d. student - and associate professor victor breedveld in the school of chemical and biomolecular engineering, and professor preet singh in the school of materials science and engineering, to design the nanotexturing process. 
 to more fully assess the antibacterial effects, jang engaged the expertise of andrés garcía, a regents' professor in georgia tech's woodruff school of mechanical engineering, and graduate student christopher johnson. in their experiments, they allowed bacterial samples to grow on treated and untreated stainless steel samples for periods of up to 48 hours. 
 at the end of that time, the treated metal had significantly fewer bacteria on it. that observation was confirmed by removing the bacteria into a solution, then placing the solution onto agar plates. the plates receiving solution from the untreated stainless steel showed much larger bacterial growth. additional testing confirmed that many of the bacteria on the treated surfaces were dead. 
 mouse fibroblast cells, however, did not seem to be bothered by the surface. ""the mammalian cells seemed to be quite healthy,"" said champion. ""their ability to proliferate and cover the entire surface of the sample suggested they were fine with the surface modification."" 
 for the future, the researchers plan to conduct long-term studies to make sure the mammalian cells remain healthy. the researchers also want to determine how well their nanotexturing holds up when subjected to wear. 
 ""in principle, this is very scalable,"" said hess. ""electrochemistry is routinely applied commercially to process materials at a large scale.""

 georgia tech will begin a national search for the position of vice president and director of the 
 enterprise innovation institute 
 (ei2) to replace chris downing, who has announced his retirement effective june 1, 2019. an interim vice president and director will be named for the position. 
 downing, who has served georgia tech for 31 years, will leave behind a legacy of leadership in technology-based economic development, university outreach and technical assistance, entrepreneurship and start-up support. 
 ""i feel very fortunate for such a diverse and challenging career and to have shared so many good years with the georgia tech family, and i am very appreciative of the many faculty, staff and students who have made my time at georgia tech so interesting and inspiring,"" 
 downing 
 said. ""although i am leaving my full-time duties, i look forward to staying connected to georgia tech and supporting its mission of progress and service."" 
 the enterprise innovation institute is nation's largest and most comprehensive university-based program of business and industry assistance, technology commercialization and economic development. 
 with state and federal support, for example, it operates a statewide network of assistance to georgia manufacturers through the 
 manufacturing extension partnership , and supports startup companies through the 
 advanced technology development center . other ei2 programs help faculty members commercialize technology developed in georgia tech labs, serve minority businesses, support economic development activities, and provide a connection to georgia tech's talent and resources. 
 ""the enterprise innovation institute is critical component of georgia tech's service to our state,"" said 
 chaouki abdallah , georgia tech's executive vice president for research. ""during his tenure, chris has expanded our economic development initiatives and increased collaboration among these programs while more closely aligning them with the needs of the state, region and nation."" 
 georgia tech president 
 g. p. ""bud"" peterson 
 praised downing's long service to georgia tech and the state of georgia. 
 ""chris has been a tireless champion and supporter of our economic development initiatives, working to maintain strong partnerships across the state while creating new collaborations,"" peterson said. ""we appreciate his leadership role as georgia tech partners with the state to strengthen georgia's economy."" 
 after leaving ibm, where he was a mechanical facilities engineer, downing joined georgia tech in 1988 as a senior research engineer with the georgia tech research institute. 
 in 1996, he joined ei2 - then called the economic development institute - as the griffin regional office manager and provided industrial extension and economic development services to the south metro atlanta region. 
 in 2005, he was tapped to lead the industry services group of the newly-organized enterprise innovation institute. that role included several key outreach programs: the georgia manufacturing extension partnership, the energy and environmental management center, the georgia tech procurement assistance center (gtpac), the southeast trade adjustment assistance center (setaac), and the georgia tech regional office network. 
 downing was named ei2's associate vice president in 2013 and vice president in 2016. 
 in that time, he spearheaded the three-fold expansion of the advanced technology development center (atdc) and created the venture center space that has helped to attract fortune 100 corporate innovation centers to technology square. 
 his technology-based economic development efforts helped georgia tech and the ei2 win the prestigious ""2014 innovation award"" from the association of public and land-grant universities, and the ""2014 outstanding research park award"" from the association of research parks. 
 most recently, downing led the feasibility study for the expansion of georgia tech's second research park, technology enterprise park, into a broader life sciences and technology innovation district. 
 downing is a graduate of the university of florida, where he earned his bachelor's and master's degrees in mechanical engineering. 
 the national search process will be led by the evpr office, which will also name the interim vice president and director by may 30, 2019.

network-traffic-provides-early-indication-malware-infection.txt,"network traffic provides early indication of malware infection 
 analyzing network traffic going to suspicious domains could give security administrators earlier warning of malware infections. 
 top domains queried by 27 million samples of malware studied by cybersecurity researchers at the georgia institute of technology. (credit: georgia tech) 
 may 22, 2017 
 - atlanta, ga 
 by analyzing network traffic going to suspicious domains, security administrators could detect malware infections weeks or even months before they're able to capture a sample of the invading malware, a new study suggests. the findings point toward the need for new malware-independent detection strategies that will give network defenders the ability to identify network security breaches in a more timely manner. 
 the strategy would take advantage of the fact that malware invaders need to communicate with their command and control computers, creating network traffic that can be detected and analyzed. having an earlier warning of developing malware infections could enable quicker responses and potentially reduce the impact of attacks, the study's researchers say. 
 ""our study shows that by the time you find the malware, it's already too late because the network communications and domain names used by the malware were active weeks or even months before the actual malware was discovered,"" said 
 manos antonakakis , an assistant professor in the 
 school of electrical and computer engineering 
 at the georgia institute of technology. ""these findings show that we need to fundamentally change the way we think about network defense."" 
 traditional defenses depend on the detection of malware in a network. while analyzing malware samples can identify suspicious domains and help attribute network attacks to their sources, relying on samples to drive defensive actions gives malicious actors a critical time advantage to gather information and cause damage. ""what we need to do is minimize the amount of time between the compromise and the detection event,"" antonakakis added. 
 the research, which will be presented may 24 at the 38th ieee security and privacy symposium in san jose, california, was supported by the u.s. department of commerce, the national science foundation, the air force research laboratory and the defense advanced research projects agency. the project was done in collaboration with eurecom in france and the imdea software institute in spain - whose work was supported by the regional government of madrid and the government of spain. 
 in the study, antonakakis, graduate research assistant chaz lever and colleagues analyzed more than five billion network events from nearly five years of network traffic carried by a major u.s. internet service provider (isp). they also studied domain name server (dns) requests made by nearly 27 million malware samples, and examined the timing for the re-registration of expired domains - which often provide the launch sites for malware attacks. 
 ""there were certain networks that were more prone to abuse, so looking for traffic into those hot spot networks was potentially a good indicator of abuse underway,"" said lever, the first author of the paper and a student in georgia tech's school of electrical and computer engineering. ""if you see a lot of dns requests pointing to hot spots of abuse, that should raise concerns about potential infections."" 
 the researchers also found that requests for dynamic dns also related to bad activity, as these often correlate with services used by bad actors because they provide free domain registrations and the ability to add quickly add domains. 
 the researchers had hoped that the registration of previously expired domain names might provide a warning of impending attacks. but lever found there was often a lag of months between when expired domains were re-registered and attacks from them began. 
 the research required development of a filtering system to separate benign network traffic from malicious traffic in the isp data. the researchers also conducted what they believe is the largest malware classification effort to date to differentiate the malicious software from potentially unwanted programs (pups). to study similarities, they assigned the malware to specific ""families."" 
 by studying malware-related network traffic seen by the isps prior to detection of the malware, the researchers were able to determine that malware signals were present weeks and even months before new malicious software was found. relating that to human health, antonakakis compares the network signals to the fever or general feeling of malaise that often precedes identification of the microorganism responsible for an infection. 
 ""you know you are sick when you have a fever, before you know exactly what's causing it,"" he said. ""the first thing the adversary does is set up a presence on the internet, and that first signal can indicate an infection. we should try to observe that symptom first on the network because if we wait to see the malware sample, we are almost certainly allowing a major infection to develop."" 
 in all, the researchers found more than 300,000 malware domains that were active for at least two weeks before the corresponding malware samples were identified and analyzed. 
 but as with human health, detecting a change indicating infection requires knowledge of the baseline activity, he said. network administrators must have information about normal network traffic so they can detect the abnormalities that may signal a developing attack. while many aspects of an attack can be hidden, malware must always communicate back to those who sent it. 
 ""if you have the ability to detect traffic in a network, regardless of how the malware may have gotten in, the action of communicating through the network will be observable,"" antonakais said. ""network administrators should minimize the unknowns in their networks and classify their appropriate communications as much as possible so they can see the bad activity when it happens."" 
 antonakakis and lever hope their study will lead to development of new strategies for defending computer networks. 
 ""the choke point is the network traffic, and that's where this battle should be fought,"" said antonakakis. ""this study provides a fundamental observation of how the next generation of defense mechanisms should be designed. as more complicated attacks come into being, we will have to become smarter at detecting them earlier."" 
 in addition to those already mentioned, the study included davide balzarotti from eurecom, and platon kotzias and juan caballero from imdea software institute.

neuroscientists-team-engineers-explore-how-brain-controls-movement.txt,"neuroscientists team with engineers to explore how the brain controls movement 
 emory and georgia tech researchers recently received a $200,000 technological innovations in neuroscience award from the mcknight foundation 
 a prototype of the proposed device has 16 electrodes that can record data from a single muscle. the mcknight award will allow the researchers to scale up to a device with more than 1,000 electrodes that can record from 10 or more muscles. 
 aug 07, 2018 
 - atlanta, ga 
 scientists have made remarkable advances into recording the electrical activity that the nervous system uses to control complex skills, leading to insights into how the nervous system directs an animal's behavior. 
 ""we can record the electrical activity of a single neuron, and large groups of neurons, as animals learn and perform skilled behaviors,"" says  samuel sober , an associate professor of biology at emory university who studies the brain and nervous system. ""what's missing,"" he adds, ""is the technology to precisely record the electrical signals of the muscles that ultimately control that movement."" 
 the sober lab is now developing that technology through a collaboration with the lab of  muhannad bakir , a professor in georgia tech's school of electrical and computer engineering. the researchers recently received a $200,000 technological innovations in neuroscience award from the mcknight foundation to create a device that can record electrical action potentials, or ""spikes"" within muscles of songbirds and rodents. the technology will be used to help understand the neural control of many different skilled behaviors to potentially gain insights into neurological disorders that affect motor control. 
 ""our device will be the first that lets you record populations of spikes from all of the muscles involved in controlling a complex behavior,"" sober says. ""this technique will offer unprecedented access to the neural signals that control muscles, allowing previously impossible investigations into how the brain controls the body."" 
 ""by combining expertise in the life sciences at emory with the engineering expertise of georgia tech, we are able to enter new scientific territory,"" bakir says. ""the ultimate goal is to make discoveries that improve the quality of life of people."" 
 the sober lab previously developed a prototype device - electrodes attached to flexible wires - to measure electrical activity in a breathing muscle used by bengalese finches to sing. the way birds control their song has a lot in common with human speech, both in how it is learned early in life and how it is produced in adulthood. the neural pathways for birdsong are also well known, and restricted to that one activity, making birds a good model system for studying nervous system function. 
 ""in experiments using our prototype, we discovered that, just like in brain cells, precise spike timing patterns in muscle cells are critical for controlling behavior - in this case breathing,"" sober says. 
 the prototype device, however, is basic. its 16 electrodes can only record activity from a single muscle - not the entire ensemble of muscles involved in birdsong. in order to gain a fuller picture of how neural signals control movement, neuroscientists need a much more sophisticated device. 
 the mcknight funding allowed sober to team up with bakir. their goal is to create a micro-scale electromyography (emg) sensor array, containing more than 1,000 electrodes, to record single-cellular data across many muscles. 
 the engineering challenges are formidable. the arrays need to be flexible enough to fit the shape of small muscles used in fine motor skills, and to change shape as the muscles contract. the entire device must also be tiny enough not to impede the movement of a small animal. 
 ""our first step is to build a flexible substrate on the micro-scale that can support high-density electrodes,"" bakir says. ""and we will need to use microchips that work in parallel with 1,000 electrodes, and then attach them to that substrate."" 
 to meet that challenge, the bakir lab will create a 3d integrated circuit. ""essentially, it's building a miniature skyscraper of electrical circuits stacked vertically atop one another,"" bakir says. this vertical design will allow the researchers to minimize the size of the flexible substrate. 
 ""to our knowledge, no one has done what we are trying to do in this project,"" bakir says. ""that makes it more difficult, but also exciting because we are entering new space."" 
 the sober lab will use the new device to expand its songbird vocalization studies. and it will explore how the nervous system controls the muscles involved when a mouse performs skilled movements with its forelimbs. 
 an early version of the technology will also be shared with collaborators of the sober lab at three different universities. these collaborators will further test the arrays, while also gathering data across more species. 
 ""we know so little about how the brain organizes skilled behaviors,"" sober says. ""once we perfect this technology, we will make it available to researchers in this field around the world, to advance knowledge as rapidly as possible."" 
 the mission of the mcknight foundation's technological innovations in neuroscience award, as described on its website, is ""to bring science closer to the day when diseases of the brain and behavior can be accurately diagnosed, prevented and treated.""

new-12-million-nsf-grant-aims-improve-treatment-ptsd-patients.txt,"new $1.2 million nsf grant aims to improve treatment for ptsd patients 
 the grant -- which includes georgia tech, emory, and the university of rochester -- will fund the development of a computational assessment toolkit for patients and clinicians. 
 oct 02, 2019 
 - atlanta, ga 
 post-traumatic stress disorder (ptsd), particularly among veterans returning from combat zones or other troubling situations, is a devastating mental condition with tremendous individual and societal costs. about 12 percent of gulf war veterans and 15 percent of vietnam veterans suffer from ptsd according to a 2019 article in 
 u.s. news and world report . while recovery is possible, it requires intensive therapeutic engagement that less than 50 percent of affected veterans actually seek out. 
 a new four-year, $1.2 million grant 
 from the 
 national science foundation 
 to a team of researchers from georgia tech, emory university, and the university of rochester will help bridge this gap by funding the development of a computational assessment toolkit for ptsd patients and clinicians, called pe collective sensing system (pecss). pecss, which will sit atop the pe coach app developed by the veterans health administration and the department of defense, will aim to improve current treatment practices and increase the number of veterans who seek treatment. 
 ""pecss will allow clinicians to use automated predictions to deliver better therapeutic treatment and individualized feedback, and patients to better understand the progress they are making and how to improve their exposure exercises,"" said 
 rosa arriaga , a senior research scientist in 
 georgia tech's school of interactive computing 
 and the principal investigator on the project. 
 [the interaction hour podcast: is technology a game changer for care of ptsd patients?, featuring dr. rosa arriaga] 
 currently, the most common and empirically-supported treatment for ptsd is ""prolonged exposure"" (pe) therapy. the treatment consists of imaginal exposure, where patients imagine themselves and narrate their traumatic event, and in-vivo exposure to real-world stimuli in safe but challenging environments. 
 there are, however, challenges in data collection and extraction, which is often subjective and narrow. this project will address those challenges by developing a novel, user-tailored sensing system that can record and transfer information from exercises, continuously monitoring patients and clinicians 
 ""clinicians are in urgent need of methods, tools, and data to efficiently track, assess, and respond to mental health needs throughout the treatment process,"" arriaga said. 
 the project will involve insights from experts in multiple fields - ubiquitous computing, human-computer interaction, applied machine learning, psychology, and more. when complete, the system will be deployed at the 
 emory healthcare veterans program , a nationally-renowned initiative that treats members of the military suffering from ptsd. 
 ""the trauma and anxiety recovery program that includes the emory veterans program has been on the cutting edge in using technology to advance the care of people suffering with anxiety since it was founded by dr. 
 barbara rothbaum 
 over 25 years ago,"" said 
 sheila rauch , an associate professor in emory's department of psychiatry and behavioral sciences and a co-principal investigator on the project. 
 ""as a team of international experts in ptsd treatment, we integrate technology to speed response to treatment and help patients to visualize the changes as they respond to care. our aim is to use this real-time data to find tune practice for the individual patient and learn across patients how we can improve care."" 
 ""mental health clinicians and their patients are in urgent need of 21 st -centural methods, tools, and objective data to optimize therapy,"" added emory assistant professor 
 andrew sherrill , another co-principal investigator. ""this partnership will bring together innovators in hci and evidence-based psychotherapy to transform mental health care for ptsd patients.""

 nsf smart and connect health funding program 
 in its

 researchers have developed a new technique for investigating phase transitions in materials by examining the acoustic response at the nanoscale.

 understanding where and how phase transitions occur is critical to developing new generations of the materials used in high-performance batteries, sensors, energy-harvesting devices, medical diagnostic equipment and other applications. but until now there was no good way to study and simultaneously map these phenomena at the relevant length scales. now, researchers at the georgia institute of technology and oak ridge national laboratory (ornl) have developed a new nondestructive technique for investigating these material changes by examining the acoustic response at the nanoscale. information obtained from this technique - which uses electrically-conductive atomic force microscope (afm) probes - could guide efforts to design materials with enhanced properties at small size scales. the approach has been used in ferroelectric materials, but could also have applications in ferroelastics, solid protonic acids and materials known as relaxors. sponsored by the national science foundation and the department of energy's office of science, the research was reported december 15 in the journal 
 advanced functional materials . ""we have developed a new characterization technique that allows us to study changes in the crystalline structure and changes in materials behavior at substantially smaller length scales with a relatively simple approach,"" said nazanin bassiri-gharb, an associate professor in georgia tech's woodruff school of mechanical engineering. ""knowing where these phase transitions happen and at which length scales can help us design next-generation materials."" in ferroelectric materials such as pzt (lead zirconate titanate), phase transitions can occur at the boundaries between one crystal type and another, under external stimuli. properties such as the piezoelectric and dielectric effects can be amplified at the boundaries, which are caused by the multi-element ""confused chemistry"" of the materials. determining when these transitions occur can be done in bulk materials using various techniques, and at the smallest scales using an electron microscope. the researchers realized they could detect these phase transitions using acoustic techniques in samples at size scales between the bulk and tens of atoms. using band-excitation piezoresponse force microscopy (be-pfm) techniques developed at ornl, they analyzed the resulting changes in resonant frequencies to detect phase changes in sample sizes relevant to the material applications. to do that, they applied an electric field to the samples using an afm tip that had been coated with platinum to make it conductive, and through generation and detection of a band of frequencies. ""we've had very good techniques for characterizing these phase changes at the large scale, and we've been able to use electron microscopy to figure out almost atomistically where the phase transition occurs, but until this technique was developed, we had nothing in between,"" said bassiri-gharb. ""to influence the structure of these materials through chemical or other means, we really needed to know where the transition breaks down, and at what length scale that occurs. this technique fills a gap in our knowledge."" the changes the researchers detect acoustically are due to the elastic properties of the materials, so virtually any material with similar changes in elastic properties could be studied in this way. bassiri-gharb is interested in ferroelectrics such as pzt, but materials used in fuel cells, batteries, transducers and energy-harvesting devices could also be examined this way. ""this new method will allow for much greater insight into energy-harvesting and energy transduction materials at the relevant length sales,"" noted rama vasudeven, the first author of the paper and a materials scientist at the center for nanophase materials sciences, a u.s. department of energy user facility at ornl. the researchers also modeled the relaxor-ferroelectric materials using thermodynamic methods, which supported the existence of a phase transition and the evolution of a complex domain pattern, in agreement with the experimental results. use of the afm-based technique offers a number of attractive features. laboratories already using afm equipment can easily modify it to analyze these materials by adding electronic components and a conductive probe tip, bassiri-gharb noted. the afm equipment can be operated under a range of temperature, electric field and other environmental conditions that are not easily implemented for electron microscope analysis, allowing scientists to study these materials under realistic operating conditions. ""this technique can probe a range of different materials at small scales and under difficult environmental conditions that would be inaccessible otherwise,"" said bassiri-gharb. ""materials used in energy applications experience these kinds of conditions, and our technique can provide the information we need to engineer materials with enhanced responses."" though widely used, relaxor-ferroelectrics and pzt are still not well understood. in relaxor-ferroelectrics, for example, it's believed that there are pockets of material in phases that differ from the bulk, a distortion that may help confer the material's attractive properties. using their technique, the researchers confirmed that the phase transitions can be extremely localized. they also learned that high responses of the materials occurred at those same locations. next steps would include varying the chemical composition of the material to see if those transitions - and enhanced properties - can be controlled. the researchers also plan to examine other materials. ""it turns out that many energy-related materials have electrical transitions, so we think this is going to be very important for studying functional materials in general,"" bassiri-gharb added. ""the potential for gaining new understanding of these materials and their applications are huge."" this research was supported by the national science foundation (nsf) through grant dmr-1255379. a portion of this research was conducted at the center for nanophase materials sciences, which is a doe office of science user facility at ornl. the content is solely the responsibility of the authors and does not necessarily represent the official views of the nsf or doe. citation : rama k. vasudevan, et al., ""acoustic detection of phase transitions at the nanoscale,"" (advanced functional materials, 2015).

 - atlanta, ga 
 like transformers, toy cars that change into robots and back, researchers have made a material that can transform its deep structure at the flick of a switch to take on different physical properties. or it can transition smoothly between those properties. 
 architected materials are comprised of micron and nanoscale structures like crossbeams, arches, domes, and spirals, much like the elements of a building's architecture. researchers from the california institute of technology, the georgia institute of technology, and eth zurich have made an architected material that shifts the shapes of these structures. 
 when a slight current is applied, nanoscale beams thicken and bend into arches that increasingly bow as the current is boosted. the material maintains the new shape even when the current is off, and the shape can be changed back by reversing the current. both are novel characteristics. 
 most materials that are designed to change their internal structure require a persistent external stimulus to remain in the new form. the new nanomaterial deforms through an electrochemical silicon-lithium alloy reaction that holds its form without applied current. 
 the study's authors describe the material and its variable properties in detail in a 
 study published in the journal 
 nature 
 on sept. 12, 2019. the research was funded by the office of naval research and the national science foundation. 
 battery chemistry 
 ""at the core of this accomplishment, you're changing the geometry not by a little, which would be easy to do, but by a lot and variably, which is hard. and you're doing it by electrochemistry that works the way a battery does,"" said claudio di leo, 
 an assistant professor in the daniel guggenheim school of aerospace engineering at georgia tech . 
 di leo's team modeled the architectures' nanoscale mechanics, which are driven by lithium ions and silicon, for the research, which was led by 
 caltech materials science professor julia greer . her lab then created the material using an innovative ultra-high-resolution 3d printing process called 
 two-photon lithography 
 and tested it. 
 [ready for graduate school?  here's how to apply to georgia tech. ] 
 architectures of this class of materials can be periodic - uniformly tiled or stitched like a lattice - or non-periodic, that is, a tailored knit that molds physical properties. they can also be applied creatively, as the study's first author, caltech graduate research assistant xiaoxing xia, demonstrated by working structural ""defects"" into the material. the defects formed caltech's logo when current was applied. 
 ""the most intriguing part of this work to me is the critical role of defects in such dynamically responsive architected materials,"" xia said. 
 ""i have always had a particular liking for defects, and this time xiaoxing managed to first uncover the effect of different types of defects on these metamaterials and then used them to program a particular pattern that would emerge in response to electrochemical stimulus,"" greer said. 
 in the future, materials like this could make batteries and other energy storage devices lighter, safer, and more durable. also, waves of 
 phonons 
 - special excitations in certain materials that help determine their conductivity - propagate through one architecture in the material, but then the shift in architecture blocks the waves. this was not the study's main achievement, but still a promising feature and possible opportunity for expanded research.

 quantum computers are in theory capable of simulating the interactions of molecules at a level of detail far beyond the capabilities of even the largest supercomputers today. such simulations could revolutionize chemistry, biology and materials science, but the development of quantum computers has been limited by the ability to increase the number of quantum bits, or qubits, that encode, store and access large amounts of data. in a paper published in the 
 journal of applied physics , a team of researchers at the 
 georgia tech research institute 
 (gtri) and honeywell international have demonstrated a new device that allows more electrodes to be placed on a chip - an important step that could help increase qubit densities and bring us one step closer to a quantum computer that can simulate molecules or perform other algorithms of interest. ""to write down the quantum state of a system of just 300 qubits, you would need 2^300 numbers, roughly the number of protons in the known universe, so no amount of moore's law scaling will ever make it possible for a classical computer to process that many numbers,"" said nicholas guise, a gtri research scientist who led the research. ""this is why it's impossible to fully simulate even a modest sized quantum system, let alone something like chemistry of complex molecules, unless we can build a quantum computer to do it."" while existing computers use classical bits of information, quantum computers use ""quantum bits"" or qubits to store information. classical bits use either a 0 or 1, but a qubit, exploiting a weird quantum property called superposition, can actually be in both 0 and 1 simultaneously, allowing much more information to be encoded. since qubits can be correlated with each other in a way that classical bits cannot, they allow a new sort of massively parallel computation, but only if many qubits at a time can be produced and controlled. the challenge that the field has faced is scaling this technology up, much like moving from the first transistors to the first computers. one leading qubit candidate is individual ions trapped inside a vacuum chamber and manipulated with lasers. the scalability of current trap architectures is limited since the connections for the electrodes needed to generate the trapping fields come at the edge of the chip, and their number are therefore limited by the chip perimeter. the gtri / honeywell approach uses new microfabrication techniques that allow more electrodes to fit onto the chip while preserving the laser access needed. the team's design borrows ideas from a type of packaging called a ball grid array (bga) that is used to mount integrated circuits. the ball grid array's key feature is that it can bring electrical signals directly from the backside of the mount to the surface, thus increasing the potential density of electrical connections. the researchers also freed up more chip space by replacing area-intensive surface or edge capacitors with trench capacitors and strategically moving wire connections. the space-saving moves allowed tight focusing of an addressing laser beam for fast operations on single qubits. despite early difficulties bonding the chips, a solution was developed in collaboration with honeywell, and the device was trapping ions from the very first day. the team was excited with the results. ""ions are very sensitive to stray electric fields and other noise sources, and a few microns of the wrong material in the wrong place can ruin a trap. but when we ran the bga trap through a series of benchmarking tests we were pleasantly surprised that it performed at least as well as all our previous traps,"" guise said. working with trapped ion qubits currently requires a room full of bulky equipment and several graduate students to make it all run properly, so the researchers say much work remains to be done to shrink the technology. the bga project demonstrated that it's possible to fit more and more electrodes on a surface trap chip while wiring them from the back of the chip in a compact and extensible way. however, there are a host of engineering challenges that still need to be addressed to turn this into a miniaturized, robust and nicely packaged system that would enable quantum computing, the researchers say. in the meantime, these advances have applications beyond quantum computing. ""we all hope that someday quantum computers will fulfill their vast promise, and this research gets us one step closer to that,"" guise said. ""but another reason that we work on such difficult problems is that it forces us to come up with solutions that may be useful elsewhere. for example, microfabrication techniques like those demonstrated here for ion traps are also very relevant for making miniature atomic devices like sensors, magnetometers and chip-scale atomic clocks."" this work was funded by the intelligence advanced research projects activity (iarpa). the article, ""ball-grid array architecture for microfabricated ion traps,"" is authored by nicholas d. guise, spencer d. fallek, kelly e. stevens, k. r. brown, curtis volin, alexa w. harter, jason m. amini, robert e. higashi, son thai lu, helen m. chanhvongsak, thi a. nguyen, matthew s. marcus, thomas r. ohnstein and daniel w. youngner. it appears in the journal of applied physics and can be accessed at:

 cancer spreads via circulating tumor cells (ctcs) that travel through the blood to other organs, and they are nearly impossible to track. now, researchers at the georgia institute of technology have found a detection method that could revolutionize cancer treatment by showing how cancers metastasize and what stage they are. this could lead to earlier and more targeted treatment, beginning with a simple blood test. 
 when a tumor starts metastasizing, it sheds its cell into the blood. an individual cell often doesn't survive the bloodstream on its own, but clusters of cells are much more robust and can travel to other organs, effectively pushing the cancer to a metastatic state. 
 ctcs have proven difficult to study, let alone treat. blood contains billions of cells per milliliter, and only a handful of those cells would be ctcs in a patient with metastatic cancer. such intense filtration has been inaccessible using conventional lab methods. most traditional filtration is too aggressive and would break the cluster back into single cells and ruin the ability to study the effect of a cluster. 
 ""that's what got engineers like me interested in this because we are really good at creating sensors, or small devices that actually do sensitive analysis,"" said 
 school of electrical and computer engineering 
 associate professor 
 fatih sarioglu . ""we started developing technologies to catch these precious cells to help manage cancer better."" 
 sarioglu presented the research in "" high throughput, label-free isolation of circulating tumor cell clusters in meshed microwells ,"" recently published in 
 nature 
 co mmunications. 
 creating the cluster-well 
 sarioglu's lab invented a new type of chip called the cluster-well, combining the precision of microfluidic chips with the efficiency of membrane filtration to find ctc clusters. using micron-sized features, microfluidic chips can precisely locate each cell in a blood sample and determine if it's cancerous. 
 ""microfluidic chips give you more control as a designer to actually ask whatever question that you want to ask those cells,"" sarioglu said. ""it increases the precision and sensitivity, which is what you need for an application like this because you want to find that single cell out of many blood cells."" 
 to rapidly process a clinically relevant volume of blood, the researchers relied on membrane filtration to make the chip operation more scalable. in effect, the chip looks like a standard membrane filter, but under an electron microscope the microfluidic chip reveals its delicate structure used to capture clusters while letting other blood cells pass through. 
 practicality was just as important as functionality to the researchers. although the chip is initially fabricated with silicon just like a central processing unit in a computer, it is later transferred to polymers to make it accessible, affordable, and single-use, while still retaining its delicacy and precision. 
 ""we really created only the traps that we need to have for recognizing the clusters with the microfluidic chip, and the rest is just a standard filter holder,"" sarioglu said. ""compared to a conventional microfluidic chip, you will get a much more practical assay with orders of magnitude improvement in throughput and a higher sensitivity."" 
 analyzing patient tumor cell clusters 
 the researchers used the chip to screen blood samples from patients with ovarian or prostate cancers through a partnership with the emory and northside hospitals. they isolated ctc clusters ranging from two to 100 or more cells from prostate and ovarian cancer patients and used rna sequencing to analyze a subset. 
 the chip's unique design means ctc clusters are filtered in microwells and can later be accessed for further analysis. even a single ctc can contain a significant amount of data on the patient and their specific cancer, which can be critical for managing the disease. for example, the researchers noted hundreds of ctcs in clusters in the blood of ovarian cancer patients, some still alive, a finding that could be consequential to the spread of the disease. 
 also, by sequencing the rna in prostate ctc clusters isolated by the chip, the researchers identified specific genes expressed by these metastasizing cells. importantly, ctc clusters from different patients were shown to express different genes, which can be potentially utilized to develop personalized, targeted therapies. sarioglu envisions cluster-wells as being a routine part of the treatment process to determine what stage the cancer is at from a simple blood draw. 
 ""finding these clusters was very elusive,"" sarioglu said. ""but this is a technology that allows these precious circulating tumor cell clusters virtually in any cancer to be accessed with precision and practicality that has not been possible before.""

 nano-electric technology may improve the drug development process.

 oct 24, 2018 
 - atlanta, ga 
 finding ways to improve the drug development process - which is currently costly, time-consuming and has an astronomically high failure rate - could have far-reaching benefits for health care and the economy. researchers from the georgia institute of technology have designed a cellular interfacing array using low-cost electronics that measures multiple cellular properties and responses in real time. this could enable many more potential drugs to be comprehensively tested for efficacy and toxic effects much faster. that's why hua wang, associate professor in the 
 school of electrical and computer engineering 
 at georgia tech, describes it as ""helping us find the golden needle in the haystack."" 
 pharmaceutical companies use cell-based assays, a combination of living cells and sensor electronics, to measure physiological changes in the cells. that data is used for high-throughput screening (hts) during drug discovery. in this early phase of drug development, the goal is to identify target pathways and promising chemical compounds that could be developed further - and to eliminate those that are ineffective or toxic - by measuring the physiological responses of the cells to each compound. 
 phenotypic testing of thousands of candidate compounds, with the majority ""failing early,"" allows only the most promising ones to be further developed into drugs and maybe eventually to undergo clinical trials, where drug failure is much more costly. but most existing cell-based assays use electronic sensors that can only measure one physiological property at a time and cannot obtain holistic cellular responses. 
 that's where the new cellular sensing platform comes in. ""the innovation of our technology is that we are able to leverage the advance of nano-electronic technologies to create cellular interfacing platforms with massively parallel pixels,"" said wang. ""and within each pixel we can detect multiple physiological parameters from the same group of cells at the same time."" the experimental quad-modality chip features extracellular or intracellular potential recording, optical detection, cellular impedance measurement, and biphasic current stimulation. 
 wang said the new technology offers four advantages over existing platforms: 
 multimodal sensing: 
 the chip's ability to record multiple parameters on the same cellular sample gives researchers the ability to comprehensively monitor complex cellular responses, uncover the correlations among those parameters and investigate how they may respond together when exposed to drugs. ""living cells are small but highly complex systems. drug administration often results in multiple physiological changes, but this cannot be detected using conventional single-modal sensing,"" said wang. 
 large field of view: 
 the platform allows researchers to examine the behavior of cells in a large aggregate to see how they respond collectively at the tissue level. 
 small spatial resolution: 
 not only can researchers look at cells at the tissue level, they could also examine them at single-cell or even sub-cellular resolution. 
 low-cost platform: 
 the new array platform is built on standard complementary metal oxide semiconductor (cmos) technologies, which is also used to build computer chips, and can be easily scaled up for mass production. 
 wang's team worked closely with hee cheol cho, associate professor and the urowsky-sahr scholar in pediatric bioengineering, whose heart regeneration lab is part of the 
 wallace coulter department of biomedical engineering 
 at georgia tech and emory university. they used neonatal rat ventricular myocytes and cardiac fibroblasts to illustrate the multi-parametric cell profiling ability of the array for drug screening. 
 the recent results 
 were published in the royal society of chemistry's journal 
 lab on a chip 
 on august 31, 2018. 
 monitoring cellular responses in multi-physical domains and holistic multi-parametric cellular profiling should also prove beneficial in screening out chemical compounds that could have harmful effects on certain organs, said jong seok park, a post-doctoral fellow in wang's lab and a leading author of the study. many drugs have been withdrawn from the market after discoveries that they had toxic effects on the heart or liver, for example. this platform should enable researchers to comprehensively test for organ toxicity and other side effects at the initial phases of drug discovery. 
 the experimental chip may be useful for other applications, including personalized medicine - for example, testing cancer cells from a particular patient. ""patient to patient variation is huge, even with the same type of drug,"" said wang. the cellular interface array could be used to see which combination of existing drugs would give the best response and to find the optimum dose that is most effective with minimum toxicity to healthy cells. 
 the chip is capable of actuation as well as sensing. in the future, wang said that cellular data from the chip could be uploaded and processed, and based on that, commands for new actuation or data acquisition could be sent to the chip automatically and wirelessly. he envisions rooms and rooms containing culture chambers with millions of such chips in fully automated facilities, ""just automatically doing new drug selection for us,"" he said. 
 beyond these applications, wang noted the scientific value of the research itself. integrated circuits and nanoelectronics are some of the most sophisticated technology platforms created by humans. living cells, on the other hand, are complex products produced through billions of years of natural selection and evolution. 
 ""the central theme of our research is how we can leverage the best platform created by nature with the best platform created by humans,"" he said. ""can we let them work together to create hybrid systems that achieve capabilities beyond biology only or electronics only systems? the fundamental scientific question we are addressing is how we can let inorganic electronics better interface with organic living cells."" 
 these researchers also participated in the related studies: doohwan jung, adam wang, taiyun chi, sensen li and moez k. aziz from the school of electrical and computer engineering at georgia tech; and sandra i. grijalva and michael n. sayegh from the department of biomedical engineering at emory university. the research was funded in part by the national science foundation career award and eccs ccss program, national science foundation graduate research fellowship grant numbers dge-1148903 and dge-1650044, office of naval research, and semiconductor research corporation ssb roadmap consortium. any opinions, findings, and conclusions or recommendations expressed in this material are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of the funding agencies.

 a team of researchers at georgia institute of technology and university of notre dame has created a new computing system that aims to tackle one of computing's hardest problems in a fraction of the time. 
 a graph with six nodes and three colors

 - atlanta, ga 
 some problems are so challenging to solve that even the most advanced computers need weeks, not seconds, to process them. 
 now a team of researchers at georgia institute of technology and university of notre dame has created a new computing system that aims to tackle one of computing's hardest problems in a fraction of the time. 
 ""we wanted to find a way to solve a problem without using the normal binary representations that have been the backbone of computing for decades,"" said arijit raychowdhury, an associate professor in georgia tech's school of electrical and computer engineering. 
 their new system employs a network of electronic oscillators to solve graph coloring tasks - a type of problem that tends to choke modern computers. 
 details of the study were published april 19 in the journal 
 scientific reports .  the research was conducted with support from the national science foundation, the office of naval research, the semiconductor research corporation and the center for low energy systems technology. 
 ""applications today are demanding faster and faster computers to help solve challenges like resource allocation, machine learning and protein structure analysis - problems which at their core are closely related to graph coloring,"" raychowdhury said. ""but for the most part, we've reached the limitations of modern digital computer processors. some of these problems that are so computationally difficult to perform, it could take a computer several weeks to solve."" 
 a graph coloring problem starts with a graph - a visual representation of a set of objects connected in some way. to solve the problem, each object must be assigned a color, but two objects directly connected cannot share the same color. typically, the goal is to color all objects in the graph using the smallest number of different colors. 
 in designing a system different from traditional transistor-based computing, the researchers took their cues from the human brain, where processing is handled collectively, such as a neural oscillatory network, rather than with a central processor. 
 ""it's the notion that there is tremendous power in collective computing,"" said suman datta, chang family professor in notre dame's college of engineering and one of the study's co-authors. ""in natural forms of computing, dynamical systems with complex interdependencies evolve rapidly and solve complex sets of equations in a massively parallel fashion."" 
 the electronic oscillators, fabricated from vanadium dioxide, were found to have a natural ability that could be harnessed for graph coloring problems. when a group of oscillators were electrically connected via capacitive links, they automatically synchronized to the same frequency - oscillating at the same rate. meanwhile, oscillators directly connected to one another would operate at different phases within the same frequency, and oscillators in the same group but not directly connected would sync in both frequency and phase. 
 ""if you suppose that each phase represents a different color, this system was essentially mimicking naturally the solution to a graph coloring problem,"" said raychowdhury, who is also the on semiconductor junior professor at georgia tech. 
 the researchers were able to create a small network of oscillators to solve graph coloring problems with the same number of objects, which are also referred to as nodes or vertices. but even more significant, the new system theoretically proved that a connection existed between graph coloring and the natural dynamics of coupled oscillatory systems. 
 ""this is a critical step because we can prove why this is happening and that it covers all possible instances of graphs,"" raychowdhury said. ""this opens up a new way of performative computation and constructing novel computational models. this is novel in that it's a physics-based computing approach, but it also presents tantalizing opportunities for building other customized analog systems for solving hard problems efficiently."" 
 that could be valuable to a range of companies looking for computers to help optimize their resources, such as a power utility wanting to maximize efficiency and usage of a vast electrical grid under certain constraints. 
 ""this work provides one of the first constructive ways to build continuous time dynamical system solvers for a combinatorial optimization problem with a working demonstration using compact scalable post-cmos devices,"" said abhinav parihar, a georgia tech student who worked on the project. 
 the next step would be building a larger network of oscillators that could handle graph coloring problems with more objects at play. 
 ""our goal is to reach a system with hundreds of oscillators, which would put us in striking distance of developing a computing substrate that could solve graph coloring problems whose optimal solutions are not yet known to mankind,"" datta said. 
 this material is based upon work supported by the national science foundation under grant no. 1640081, the semiconductor research corporation under research task nos. 2698.001 and 2698.002, and the office of naval research under award no. n00014-11-1-0665. any opinions, findings, and conclusions or recommendations expressed in this material are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of those agencies.

 a new microfluidic device for capturing rare circulating tumor cells (ctcs) is the first designed specifically to capture clusters of two or more cells.

 - atlanta, ga 
 the latest version of a microfluidic device for capturing rare circulating tumor cells (ctcs) is the first designed specifically to capture clusters of two or more cells, rather than single cells. the new device, called the cluster-chip, was developed by the same massachusetts general hospital (mgh) research team that created previous microchip-based devices. recent studies by mgh investigators and others have suggested that ctc clusters are significantly more likely to cause metastases than single circulating tumor cells. the device is described in a 
 nature methods 
 paper that was published online may 18. among the members of the research team is 
 fatih sarioglu , now an assistant professor in the 
 school of electrical and computer engineering 
 at georgia tech. ""early theories of cancer metastasis were based on clumps of tumor cells traveling through the bloodstream, but given that ctc clusters are even rarer in the blood than single ctcs, they have attracted minimal attention for several decades,"" explained mehmet toner, phd, director of the biomicroelectromechanical systems resource center in the mgh center for engineering in medicine, the paper's senior author. ""the ability to isolate intact clusters will enable is to investigate carefully their role in the metastatic process, and understanding metastasis really is the ‘holy grail' of cancer research."" ctcs are living solid tumor cells found in the bloodstream at extremely low levels - about one in a billion cells. starting in 2007, mgh researchers have developed three microchip-based devices that capture ctcs in ways that preserve molecular information that can help guide clinical treatment. the first two versions used antibodies directed at specific proteins on the surface of tumor cells, which limited the ability to capture cells that may have lost those marker proteins during the process of metastasis. the third version, developed in 2013, uses antigen-independent methods of isolating ctcs, which is also the case for the cluster-chip. ""cancer is an extremely heterogeneous disease, and even within the same tumor you can find cells with different surface antigens,"" said sarioglu, co-lead author of the 
 nature methods 
 paper. ""since we are capturing clusters because of their physical properties, this chip is directly applicable to all types of cancer."" sarioglu explained that the strategy behind the design of the chip is based on the physical properties of clusters of cells. the 3- by 1 ½-inch plastic chip through which a blood sample is passed consists of rows of triangular microposts arranged in such a way that clusters passing between two posts will become trapped on the apex of a third central post and held in place by the balanced flow of fluid on either side. single ctcs and blood cells will pass right through without being captured. in addition, passing the sample through the device at a slow rate minimizes the possibility that clusters will be broken, distorted or escape. initial testing of the cluster-chip with blood samples to which artificially formed tumor cell clusters had been introduced helped to determine the optimal flow rate to capture the most clusters in the least time. the researchers then compared the new device to the second-generation hbctc-chip, which relies on known cell-surface markers and was the first to isolate ctc clusters. the cluster-chip proved to be 40 to 50 percent better at finding clusters of cells expressing targeted markers and 100 percent better at capturing cells without target antigens. while initial attempts to release captured clusters from the device by simply reversing the fluid flow had limited success, the investigators found that reducing the temperature of the device itself to 4 degrees celsius (39 f) not only released 80 percent of clusters, but also improved the purity of the captured material by reducing the undesired capture of white blood cells. use of the cluster-clip to test blood samples from 60 patients with either breast cancer, melanoma or prostate cancer successfully captured ctc clusters in from 30 to 40 percent of samples. analysis of captured clusters revealed they consisted of cells with significant molecular differences, some actively proliferating and other relatively quiescent, and were often accompanied by immune cells, an observation that could have important implications with the increased attention to immune-system-based cancer therapies. ""testing of patient blood samples also revealed that there were significantly more ctc clusters in the blood than was previously believed,"" said toner. ""we now are looking at ways to improve further the release of captured clusters, but we are only at the beginning of our quest to understand the role and biology of ctc clusters. eventually we could develop ways to target clusters therapeutically as well as using them as a source of diagnostic information."" toner is the the benedict professor of surgery at harvard medical school. ""this new isolation device will be particularly useful in isolating clusters of ctcs, which seem to be the most malignant and metastasis-prone types of cancer cells in the blood,"" said daniel haber, md, director of the mgh cancer center and a co-author of the nature methods paper. ""i'm particularly excited by the way in which the device was created - starting from a clinical and biological observation about the importance of these ctc clusters and then designing a specific microfluidic device to capture these cells, which will make it possible to study them in greater detail."" nicola aceto, phd, of the mgh cancer center is co-lead author of the nature methods paper. support for the current study includes grants from the national institutes of health, the national institute of biomedical imaging and bioengineering, a ""dream team"" grant from stand up to cancer, the howard hughes medical institute, the prostate cancer foundation, the charles evans foundation, and johnson and johnson. the mgh has filed a patent application for the cluster-chip. the

 falls are a serious public health issue, resulting in tens of thousands of deaths annually and racking up billions of dollars in healthcare costs. while there has been extensive research into the biomechanics of falls, most current approaches study how the legs, joints, and muscles act separately to respond, rather than as a system. the ability to measure how these different levels relate to each other could paint a much clearer picture of why someone falls and precisely how their body compensates. until recently, however, an integrated measuring approach has been elusive.

 journal of the royal society interface , lays the groundwork for using mechanical energetics to understand the roles of joints and muscles during unsteady locomotion. the paper also contributed to golyski's selection as this year's recipient of the 
 american society of biomechanics' 
 (asb) 
 pre-doctoral achievement award 
 - a prestigious honor that considers a candidate's entire portfolio of publications. 
 golyski, a graduating member of sawicki's 
 physiology of wearable robotics (power) lab , previously worked as a research scientist with individuals with lower-limb amputation at 
 walter reed national military medical center . for his graduate work at georgia tech, his aim was to develop an understanding of how devices and the human body work together, specifically at the intersection of three elements: muscle mechanics, wearable exoskeletons, and stability during walking. 
 each of the three elements relates to the others. exoskeletons affect a person's stability while also affecting how their muscles work, and vice versa. but to examine how muscles both interact with exoskeletons and affect stability makes for an interesting challenge, golyski says. because, while one can observe how muscle dynamics change with the use of an exoskeleton, how those changes relate to stability is not understood. to understand how all three pillars work together to help humans compensate during a fall, golyski and sawicki needed to come up with a new framework to measure stability. 
 energy accountants 
 the researchers knew that for a person walking at a steady speed on level ground, the net mechanical energy of the person and each leg over one stride - from the heel strike of one leg to the next heel strike of that same leg - is zero. they also knew that energy needed to be equal to mechanical energy at all levels of description of the leg, specifically the joints and muscles. 
 ""the idea is that if we can relate stability to a demand in energy, then we can become accountants, and track how the energy - our currency - changes at the level of the person, muscle, and exoskeleton,"" golyski said. ""that provides a really powerful framework to relate all three of those areas."" 
 golyski and sawicki designed an experiment with a person walking on a treadmill. using a split-belt treadmill, they applied short, quick disturbances, known as perturbations, in the form of increases in belt speed to one leg during walking. the purpose was to inject or extract energy during a stride, so that they could then measure how the person's leg and joint energies change. 
 for the experiment they used georgia tech's 
 caren 
 (computer assisted rehabilitation environment) - an integrated system used to study stability during movement. it features cameras mounted above a treadmill to track a person's movement using motion capture markers attached to the person. using an algorithm designed by golyski, sawicki, power lab ph.d. student jennifer leestma, and a high school mentee, esmeralda vazquez, the caren can execute perturbations based on a person's movements - enabling the researchers to initiate perturbations at specific times in the gait cycle. by combining the force of the treadmill with the positional data collected by the caren, golyski and sawicki can calculate the changes in energy in a person's individual joints. 
 their new framework could assist in determining which part of a person's body manages responses to destabilizing energy, pointing to specific muscles or joints to target with rehabilitation therapy. it could also open doors to advanced exoskeletons and prostheses that target specific joints to restore stabilizing responses in individuals with impaired balance. 
 ""the body of research that pawel completed during his doctoral studies is nothing short of impressive. he broke new ground by developing new experimental techniques and a new hip exoskeleton assistive device, making first-of-a-kind muscle imaging measurements, and ultimately answering the question of how exoskeletons modify joint and muscle dynamics to influence human walking stability,"" sawicki said. ""i was thrilled that pawel's outstanding contributions as a scientist-engineer were recognized by asb, and i'm even more thrilled that he will return to walter reed - his dream job - to apply his new skillset to help people get from here to there."" 
 this summer, as part of this recognition, golyski will deliver a research talk during an awards session at the 
 north american congress on biomechanics 
 in ottawa, ontario. he will also be graduating from georgia tech and resuming his work with veterans and active service members at walter reed.

new-master-science-urban-analytics-launch-fall.txt,"new master of science in urban analytics to launch in the fall 
 urban planning, computing, and industrial and systems engineering combine to fix big city problems 
 atlanta skyline 
 may 25, 2021 
 - atlanta, ga 
 georgia tech is launching a new interdisciplinary degree this fall: the master of science in urban analytics (msua). the 
 school of city and regional planning 
 will administer the degree in partnership with the 
 h. milton stewart school of industrial and systems engineering 
 (isye), the 
 school of computational science and engineering 
 (cse), and the 
 school of interactive computing 
 (ic). 
 urban analytics is an emerging field that incorporates smart cities, urban informatics, and urban science. the goal of urban analytics is to leverage data science in addressing major issues cities continue to face, including air, water, and land pollution; carbon emissions; traffic congestion; inadequate housing options; and disparities in access to services. the skills and knowledge necessary to tackle such challenges require an integrated multidisciplinary approach, which this degree is designed to provide. 
 it is aimed at students who are interested in solving urban problems through the acquisition, integration, and analysis of various forms of data. undergraduate preparation for this degree can include a range of fields such as engineering, planning, computing, and various social science disciplines. 
 georgia tech is the only university in the university system of georgia offering an urban analytics degree. programs of this kind are quickly gaining national relevancy - similar graduate programs exist at carnegie mellon university, new york university, northeastern university, and the university of california at berkeley. 
 subhro guhathakurta , chair of the school of city and regional planning and the director of the 
 center for spatial planning analytics and visualization , noted that tech's urban analytics program stands out from the others given its strategic partnership with top-ranked programs in engineering and computing to offer this multidisciplinary degree. 
 ""the objective is to harness georgia tech's recognized strengths and expertise in data analytics to focus on the critical problems facing urban regions,"" he said. 
 read also: gulsah akar appointed new school of city and regional planning chair 
 additionally, there are many aspects of industrial engineering that can be applied to urban analytics, 
 pascal van hentenryck , associate chair for innovation and entrepreneurship and a. russell chandler iii chair and professor in isye, said. 
 ""many supply chain logistics concepts and solutions can be applied to address the inefficiencies in public transportation, accessibility, and the relationship between mobility and the built environment. this program is pioneering in that it links many viewpoints holistically, from the concepts to the mathematical and computational tools, and their applications to problems faced by our growing cities,"" he said. 
 georgia tech's isye program is ranked as the no. 1 graduate program in in the industrial, manufacturing, and systems specialty and has held the top rank for 31 years. 
 advances in computation are also essential to ensure the sustainable development of modern cities and guarantee that they operate effectively, 
 haesun park , regents' professor and chair of cse, said. 
 ""understanding and planning for the interdependent and interactive quality of city infrastructures require computational models and tools of increasing complexity and scale. this is where data, computing, and networks are ubiquitous, with computation playing unprecedented new roles in the management and operation of cities,"" she said. 
 besides new introductory courses, several existing classes in the degree-participating schools are available as part of a well-rounded curriculum. these courses are carefully selected to meet four core competencies: urban systems, spatial analysis, computational statistics including machine learning, and modeling and visualization. 
 the curriculum will place special emphasis on social end-values such as sustainability, justice, and resilience, and on individual data rights including: permission for collection; privacy through aggregation; and transparency through open data. 
 ""one of the most exciting aspects of this new degree is the diversity of academic programs working together on this topic of urban analytics. it will unite faculty and students from across campus to work on solving many important challenges,"" 
 john stasko , regents' professor and interim chair of ic, said. 
 specialization within the degree is encouraged. the one-year program spans fall and spring semesters, with a summer workshop. 
 applications for the fall 2021 cohort open this summer. for more information,

new-patent-mapping-system-helps-find-innovation-pathways.txt,"new patent mapping system helps find innovation pathways 
 a new patent mapping system may help researchers spot innovation trends. 
 the full patent map shows 466 technology categories and 35 technological areas. each node color represents a technological area; lines represent relationships between technology categories; labels for technological areas are placed close to the categories with largest number of patent applications in each area.

 what's likely to be the ""next big thing?"" what might be the most fertile areas for innovation? where should countries and companies invest their limited research funds? what technology areas are a company's competitors pursuing? to help answer those questions, researchers, policy-makers and r&d directors study patent maps, which provide a visual representation of where universities, companies and other organizations are protecting intellectual property produced by their research. but finding real trends in these maps can be difficult because categories with large numbers of patents - pharmaceuticals, for instance - are usually treated the same as areas with few patents. now, a new patent mapping system that considers how patents cite one another may help researchers better understand the relationships between technologies - and how they may come together to spur disruptive new areas of innovation. the system, which also categorizes patents in a new way, was produced by a team of researchers from three universities and an atlanta-based producer of data-mining software. ""what we are trying to do is forecast innovation pathways,"" said alan porter, professor emeritus in the 
 school of public policy 
 and the 
 school of industrial and systems engineering 
 at the georgia institute of technology and the project's principal investigator. ""we take data on research and development, such as publications and patents, and we try to elicit some intelligence to help us gain a sense for where things are headed."" patent maps for major corporations can show where those firms plan to diversify, or conversely, where their technological weaknesses are. looking at a nation's patent map might also suggest areas where r&d should be expanded to support new areas of innovation, or to fill gaps that may hinder economic growth, he said. innovation often occurs at the intersection of major technology sectors, noted jan youtie, director of policy research services in georgia tech's 
 enterprise innovation institute . studying the relationships between different areas can help suggest where the innovation is occurring and what technologies are fueling it. patent maps can also show how certain disciplines evolve. ""you can see where the portfolio is, and how it is changing,"" explained youtie, who is also an adjunct associate professor in the georgia tech school of public policy. ""in the case of nanotechnology, for example, you can see that most of the patents are in materials and physics, though over time the number of patents in the bio-nano area is growing."" the patent mapping research, which was supported by the national science foundation, will be described in a paper to be published in an upcoming issue of the 
 journal of the american society for information science and technology 
 (jasist). in addition to youtie and porter, the research was conducted by former georgia tech graduate student luciano kay, now a postdoctoral scholar at the center for nanotechnology in society at the university of california santa barbara. ""the goal for this research was to create a new type of global patent map that was not tied into existing patent classification systems,"" kay said. ""we also wanted an approach that would classify patents into categories or clusters in a graphical representation of interrelated technologies even though they may be located in different sections and levels of the standard patent classification."" the international patent classification (ipc) system is based on a hierarchy of eight top-level classes such as ""human necessity"" and ""electricity."" patent applications are further classified into 600 or so sub-classes beneath the top-level classes. critics note that the ipc brings together technologies such as drugs and hats under the ""human necessity"" class -- technologies that are not really closely related. the system also puts technologies that are closely related - pharmaceuticals and organic chemistry, for instance - into different classes. the new patent overlay mapping system does away with this hierarchy, and instead considers the similarity between technologies by noting connections between patents - which ones are cited by other patents.   ""we completely disaggregated the patient classification system and looked at all the categories with at least a thousand patents,"" youtie explained. ""we think our map gets closer to measuring the ideas of technological similarity and distance."" maps produced by the system provide visual information relating the distances between technologies. the maps can also highlight the density of patenting activity, showing where investments are being made. and they can show gaps where future r&d investments may be needed to provide connections between related technologies. the researchers produced a series of patent maps by applying their new system to 760,000 patent records filed in the european patent office between 2000 and 2006. the data came from the patstat database, and was analyzed using a variety of tools, including the vantagepoint software developed by search technology of norcross, along with georgia tech and intelligent information services corporation. one surprise in the work was the interdisciplinary nature of many of the 35 patent factors the researchers identified. for instance, the classification ""vehicles"" included six of the eight sections defined by the ipc system.  only five of the 35 factors were confined to a single section, youtie said. because the researchers adopted a new classification system, other researchers wanting to follow their approach will have use a thesaurus that translates existing ipc classes to the new system. that conversion system is available online. in addition to those already mentioned, the research team also included ismael rafols of universitat politecnica de valencia in spain and nils newman of intelligent information services corp. this research was supported by the national science foundation (nsf) through the center for nanotechnology in society at arizona state university (award no. 0531194) and nsf award no. 1064146. the research was also undertaken in collaboration with the center for nanotechnology in society, university of california santa barbara (nsf awards no. 0938099 and no. 0531184). the findings and observations contained in this paper are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of the nsf. research news georgia institute of technology 177 north avenue atlanta, georgia  30332-0181 media relations contacts : john toon ( jtoon@gatech.edu ) (404-894-6986) or brett israel ( brett.israel@comm.gatech.edu ) (404-385-1933). writer : john toon

new-research-may-improve-communications-during-natural-disasters.txt,"new research may improve communications during natural disasters 
 new research from georgia tech research demonstrates the ability to gather and share data during natural disasters during internet outages. 
 sep 08, 2017 
 - atlanta, ga 
 storms like hurricane irma and other natural disasters bring with them lots of uncertainty: where will they go, how much damage will they cause. what is certain is that no matter where they strike, natural disasters knock out power. 
 and, no power means no internet for thousands of people in affected areas. 
 however, georgia tech researchers are proposing a new way of gathering and sharing information during natural disasters that does not rely on the internet. 
 using computing power built into mobile phones, routers, and other hardware to create a network, emergency managers and first responders will be able to share and act on information gathered from people impacted by hurricanes, tornados, floods, and other disasters. 
 ""increasingly, data gathered from passive and active sensors that people carry with them, such as their mobile phones, is being used to inform situational awareness in a variety of settings,"" said 
 kishore ramachandran , computer science professor at georgia tech. 
 ""in this way, humans are providing beneficial social sensing services. however, current social sensing services depend on internet connectivity since the services are deployed on central cloud platforms."" 
 communicating on the 'edge' 
 in a 
 paper 
 presented earlier this year at the 
 2 nd 
 international workshop on social sensing , the georgia tech research team detailed how it may be possible to access these centralized services using a decentralized network that leverages the growing amount of computing power at the ""edge"" of the internet. 
 this ability will give a huge advantage to first responders. 
 in a flooded area, for example, search and rescue personnel using a geo-distributed network would be able to continuously ping enabled phones, sensors, and other devices in an area to determine their exact locations. the data is used to create density maps of people in that search region. these maps are then used to prioritize and guide emergency response teams. 
 the georgia tech proposal takes advantages of edge computing. also known as fog computing, edge computing places more processing capabilities in sensing devices - like surveillance cameras, embedded pavement sensors, and others, as well as in consumer devices like cell phones, readers, and tablets - in order to improve network latency between sensors, apps, and users. 
 rather than just being able to communicate through the internet with central cloud platforms, the georgia tech team has demonstrated that by harnessing edge computing resources, sensing devices can be enabled to identify and communicate with other sensors in an area. 
 decentralizing social sensing services 
 ""we believe fog computing can become a potent enabler of decentralized, local social sensing services that can operate when internet connectivity is constrained,"" said ramachandran. 
 ""this capability will provide first responders and others with the level of situational awareness they need to make effective decisions in emergency situations."" 
 the team has proposed a generic software architecture for social sensing applications that is capable of exploiting the fog-enabled devices. the design has three components - a central management function that resides in the cloud, a data processing element placed in the fog infrastructure, and a sensing component on the user's device. 
 the researchers say that it is not enough to simply run a centralized social sensing service on a number of parallel fog nodes. 
 ""rather, the social sensing service has to become a distributed service capable of discovering available fog nodes and building a network that aggregates and shares information between social sensors that are connected to different fog nodes,"" said computer science ph.d. student 
 harshit gupta . 
 what's next? 
 beyond emergency response during natural disasters, the team believes its proposed fog architecture can also benefit communities with limited or no internet access. these include applications for public transportation management, job recruitment, and housing. 
 another possible application of the new approach is monitoring sensing devices in remote areas. 
 to monitor far-flung devices in areas with no internet access, a bus could be outfitted with fog-enabled sensing capabilities. as it travels in remote areas it would collect data from sensing devices. once in range of internet connectivity, the ""data mule"" bus would upload the information to the centralized cloud-based platforms. 
 ""in places that did not benefit from the first wave of cloud-based social sensing services, our hope is that these communities can leapfrog having to rely solely on the internet and directly use fog-based services,"" said ramachandran.

new-study-reveals-racial-ethnic-disparities-use-increasingly-popular-prostate.txt,"new study reveals racial, ethnic disparities in use of increasingly popular prostate cancer test 
 the study found that black men were at least 23.6% less likely than their white counterparts to receive an mri exam following an elevated prostate-specific antigen blood test. 
 nov 08, 2021 
 - atlanta, ga 
 black, hispanic, and asian men whose results on a common prostate cancer screening test indicated a need for additional testing were less likely than their white counterparts to receive an increasingly used follow-up test that can eliminate the need for an invasive biopsy, according to researchers in the 
 health economics and analytics lab 
 (heal) at georgia tech's school of economics. 
 their 
 study , published nov. 8, 2021, in 
 jama network open, 
 found that black men were at least 23.6% less likely than their white counterparts to receive an mri exam following a prostate-specific antigen (psa) blood test, a common initial screening for men between the ages of 55 and 69. the study also found that hispanic and asian men with elevated psa results were significantly less likely to be referred for mri evaluation. 
 while biopsies have long been the next treatment step for some men with elevated psa results, prostate mris are increasingly being used to reduce the need for that invasive procedure. 
 while the reason for the disparities is beyond the scope of the paper, the results are nevertheless concerning, particularly in light of previous research that has shown disparities in how physicians treat patients of color when compared to their white patients, said 
 danny hughes , professor in the ivan allen college of liberal arts 
 school of economics . 
 ""we can't say definitively if the reason black, hispanic, and asian men did not receive this particular test is that physicians did not refer them for it, or if the patients opted themselves out of further testing,"" hughes said. ""regardless, these disparities do highlight the need to understand what is happening and how to ensure patients of all races and ethnicities receive the best possible care."" 
 the findings are particularly troubling in light of the 
 elevated risk 
 black men face from prostate cancer - previous studies have found black men are 
 more likely 
 to get prostate cancer, often get the disease earlier in life, and are more likely to die from it. 
 black, asian, hispanic men from 23.6% to 67.6% less likely to receive mris 
 the study was conducted as part of a long-term heal research collaboration between hughes and dr. richard duszak, a professor at emory university's school of medicine. former heal postdoctoral researcher nino abashidze, now of the university of wyoming, chad stecher of arizona state university, and dr. andrew b. rosenkrantz of the nyu langone medical center also collaborated on the project. 
 hughes' lab, heal, uses big-data analytics to reveal emerging patterns in healthcare utilization with the aim of benefitting patients and providers. such work is an increasing emphasis in the 
 ivan allen college of liberal arts , of which the 
 school of economics i s a unit. 
 for the study, the authors examined anonymous health insurance claims data covering 50 u.s. states looking for men who took psa blood tests. they identified 794,809 psa tests that had laboratory results available. they then looked for matching records indicating whether or not the men received a follow-on mri based on varying levels of psa identified in each man's blood. higher levels are associated with potential cancer. 
 although medical standards for the use of prostate mris continue to emerge, studies have revealed thresholds that warrant further investigation, and those are the levels the heal study examined. they are 4 ng / ml, historically considered the threshold for recommending prostate biopsy; 2.5 ng / ml, a more recently recognized threshold for the early detection of prostate cancer; and 10 ng / ml, a level that has been associated with higher rates of biopsies and cancer diagnoses. 
 the researchers found that: 
 black patients between the ages of 40 and 54 with a psa above 4 ng / ml were 39.8% less likely to get a prostate mri than white patients. black men between 65 and 74 whose psa results were above 4 ng / ml were 23.6% less likely to get a follow-up mri. those above 10 ng / ml were 43.9% less likely. 
 black men between the ages of 65 and 74 with results above the 4 ng / ml threshold were 23.6% less likely to get an mri when compared to white patients. men in this age group with scores above 10 ng / ml were 43.9% less likely to get the mri exam. 
 asian patients between 55 and 64 with results above 2.5 ng / ml were 57.3 percent less likely to receive a prostate mri as compared to white patients. asian men with scores above 4 ng / ml were 62.9% less likely. 
 hispanic men from 55 to 64 with psa results above 10ng / ml - the level most closely associated with biopsies and cancer diagnoses - were 67.6% less likely to get the mri test. 
 understanding the cause of the disparities 
 hughes and his colleagues are now turning their attention to understanding the cause of the disparities. the data used in the study do not reveal the reasons men did, or did not, receive referrals for mris. 
 it could be that patients who did not get the mris opted out of the tests, including some who may have instead been referred to receive the invasive biopsy test, despite the problems that can be associated with those tests. or, hughes said, the results may be further confirmation of previous studies that have shown significant biases among physicians in how they care for black, hispanic, and asian patients compared to their white patients. 
 previous studies have shown, for instance, that doctors are less likely to discuss treatment options and side effects with black patients when compared to their white counterparts. 
 ""we need to understand more about the role of decision-making biases in physicians, as well as other potential factors in the health care system that could account for the disparities we are seeing in this study,"" hughes said. 
 the study, ""racial / ethnic disparities in the use of prostate mri following an elevated prostate-specific antigen test,"" was published nov. 8, 2021. it is available at http: / / doi.org / 10.1001 / jamanetworkopen.2021.32388.

new-study-shows-hybrid-learning-led-significant-reduction-covid-19-spread.txt,"new study shows hybrid learning led to significant reduction in covid-19 spread 
 as communities continue a shift toward normalcy in the wake of the covid-19 pandemic, georgia tech researchers have helped quantify the effectiveness of school closures on community spread reduction.

 as communities continue a shift toward normalcy in the wake of the covid-19 pandemic, researchers in georgia tech's h. milton stewart school of industrial and systems engineering have helped quantify the effectiveness of one of the most commonly-debated mitigation measures taken across the country. 
 a new study published in  bmc public health  shows that hybrid learning utilizing alternating school days for children offers a significant reduction in community disease spread. total closure in favor of remote learning, however, offers little additional advantage over that hybrid option. 
 this research will help decision-makers in the event of another covid-19 outbreak or one from a similar infectious disease. 
 ""early in the pandemic when school closures were becoming the norm, many debated the pros and cons of this measure,"" said  pinar keskinocak , the william w. george chair and professor in isye and the principal investigator on the study. ""do we get enough benefit to offset the social costs and impacts on education? this research shows that there is a benefit in infection reduction, especially in the absence of effective pharmaceutical interventions, and most of the benefits can be attained with a hybrid approach."" 
 this study is particularly relevant for the early days of an infectious disease outbreak when policymakers face the difficult decision of enacting school closures in their respective districts. using an agent-based simulation model of covid-19 spread, researchers projected the impact of various school reopening strategies: complete closure, alternating school days where one cohort attended in person twice a week and another cohort on the opposite days, younger children only, and regular (i.e. all students return to in-person learning). 
 results showed that compared to schools reopening with regular attendance, the percentage of the population infected reduced by 13, 11, 9, and 6 percent with each respective strategy. the conclusions were that some level of closure - younger children only, alternating days, and completely remote - offers significant reduction in community-wide infections. the benefit of complete closure over a hybrid approach, however, was minimal. 
 the assumption in all cases was that individuals who contracted the virus would remain at home. 
 ""the additional benefit of complete school closure compared to hybrid was relatively small,"" keskinocak said. ""the implementation of an alternating day model can be challenging but could have public health benefits early in the pandemic or during a new wave, providing social and learning benefits as well."" 
 other challenges remain that were not investigated in this particular research - costs on families in the event of school closures, learning tradeoffs, properly equipping students for virtual learning, and others. this is just one element of many for policymakers to consider, keskinocak said.

 a georgia institute of technology research team has devised a novel way to help keep a driverless vehicle under control as it maneuvers at the edge of its handling limits. the approach could help make self-driving cars of the future safer under hazardous road conditions. researchers from georgia tech's daniel guggenheim school of aerospace engineering (ae) and the school of interactive computing (ic) have assessed the new technology by racing, sliding, and jumping one-fifth-scale, fully autonomous auto-rally cars at the equivalent of 90 mph. the technique uses advanced algorithms and onboard computing, in concert with installed sensing devices, to increase vehicular stability while maintaining performance. the work, tested at the georgia tech autonomous racing facility, is sponsored by the u.s. army research office. a paper covering this research was presented at the recent international conference on robotics and automation (icra), held may 16-21. ""an autonomous vehicle should be able to handle any condition, not just drive on the highway under normal conditions,"" said panagiotis tsiotras, an ae professor who is an expert on the mathematics behind rally-car racing control. ""one of our principal goals is to infuse some of the expert techniques of human drivers into the brains of these autonomous vehicles."" traditional robotic-vehicle techniques use the same control approach whether a vehicle is driving normally or at the edge of roadway adhesion, tsiotras explained. the georgia tech method - known as model predictive path integral control (mppi) - was developed specifically to address the non-linear dynamics involved in controlling a vehicle near its friction limits. 
 utilizing advanced concepts ""aggressive driving in a robotic vehicle - maneuvering at the edge - is a unique control problem involving a highly complex system,"" said evangelos theodorou, an ae assistant professor who is leading the project. ""however, by merging statistical physics with control theory, and utilizing leading-edge computation, we can create a new perspective, a new framework, for control of autonomous systems."" the georgia tech researchers used a stochastic trajectory-optimization capability, based on a path-integral approach, to create their mppi control algorithm, theodorou explained. using statistical methods, the team integrated large amounts of handling-related information, together with data on the dynamics of the vehicular system, to compute the most stable trajectories from myriad possibilities. processed by the high-power graphics processing unit (gpu) that the vehicle carries, the mppi control algorithm continuously samples data coming from global positioning system (gps) hardware, inertial motion sensors, and other sensors. the onboard hardware-software system performs real-time analysis of a vast number of possible trajectories and relays optimal handling decisions to the vehicle moment by moment. in essence, the mppi approach combines both the planning and execution of optimized handling decisions into a single highly efficient phase. it's regarded as the first technology to carry out this computationally demanding task; in the past, optimal- control data inputs could not be processed in real time. fully autonomous vehicles the researchers' two auto-rally vehicles - custom built by the team - utilize special electric motors to achieve the right balance between weight and power. the cars carry a motherboard with a quad-core processor, a potent gpu, and a battery. each vehicle also has two forward-facing cameras, an inertial measurement unit, and a gps receiver, along with sophisticated wheel-speed sensors. the power, navigation, and computation equipment is housed in a rugged aluminum enclosure able to withstand violent rollovers. each vehicle weighs about 48 pounds and is about three feet long. these rolling robots are able to test the team's control algorithms without any need for off-vehicle devices or computation, except for a nearby gps receiver. the onboard gpu lets the mppi algorithm sample more than 2,500, 2.5-second-long trajectories in under 1 / 60 of a second. an important aspect in the team's autonomous-control approach centers on the concept of ""costs"" - key elements of system functionality. several cost components must be carefully matched to achieve optimal performance. in the case of the georgia tech vehicles, the costs consist of three main areas: the cost for staying on the track, the cost for achieving a desired velocity, and the cost of the control system. a sideslip-angle cost was also added to improve vehicle stability. the cost approach is important to enabling a robotic vehicle to maximize speed while staying under control, explained james rehg, a professor in the georgia tech school of interactive computing who is collaborating with theodorou and tsiotras. it's a complex balancing act, rehg said. for example, when the researchers reduced one cost term to try to prevent vehicle sliding, they found they got increased drifting behavior. ""what we're talking about here is using the mppi algorithm to achieve relative 
 entropy minimization - and adjusting costs in the most effective way is a big part of that,"" he said. ""to achieve the optimal combination of control and performance in an autonomous vehicle is definitely a non-trivial problem."" research news georgia institute of technology 177 north avenue atlanta, georgia 30332-0181 usa media relations contacts : jason maderer ( jason.maderer@comm.gatech.edu ) (404-385-2966) or john toon ( jtoon@gatech.edu ) (404-894-6986). writer : rick robinson

 college of computing researchers control smartwatches with breaths and taps.

 smartwatches aren't the easiest things to control, with their small screens and owners' bulky fingers. georgia institute of technology researchers have invented new ways to interact that provide a little more control. among their enhancements using lg and sony watches: 
 scrolling through apps running your fingers along the watch band 
 launching eight smartwatch apps by tapping key points on the watch case (or bezel) 
 rejecting phone calls by blowing on the screen or tapping the side of the watch 
 editing dictated text message errors by breathing on the screen 
 transferring on-screen information from the watch to a phone with breaths 
 selecting numbers by tapping the back of your hand 
 the research was presented at several conferences in the fall, most recently in niagara falls at the 
 2016 acm international conference on interactive surfaces and spaces 
 in november. 
 ph.d. student 
 cheng zhang 
 oversaw watchout, an interaction technique that uses taps and scrolling gestures on the case and watchband, ""outside"" the watch screen. they're possible because of the watch's gyroscope and accelerometer sensors. 
 ""other techniques that improve control of smartwatches have included 3d gestures above the screen, bigger screens or adding an extra armband,"" zhang said. ""we wanted to show it could be done with existing technology already common on today's devices."" 
 one demo app allows wearers to scroll up, down, left and right by swiping on the watchband. according to zhang it makes it easier to interact with gps maps or menus. his study showed that scrolling on rubber watchbands was more accurate than leather bands due to the different friction of the materials. 
 they also created an app that creates eight touchpoints on the device's bezel. rather than scrolling through a long list of apps, the user simply hits one of eight spots on the case to launch facebook, for example. hitting the sides of the watch can also control incoming calls. 
 ""smartwatches aren't very convenient when you're carrying something,"" zhang said. ""that's why we wanted to create a technique that allows the user to tap the watch to accept or deny phone calls. hitting the right side answers the call; the left side ignores it."" 
 hands-free control is exactly what the other georgia tech team, led by ph.d. student 
 gabriel reyes , had in mind. one day he watched his wife blow a piece of fuzz off her phone while holding their newborn son. he and a team of students later created whoosh, a technique that allows a person to control the watch by blowing, exhaling, shushing, sipping or puffing on the screen. the watch uses its microphone and machine learning to identify the breath patterns of each acoustic event, then assigns an action to each. 
 for example, a wearer can shush the watch to ignore a call or blow on it twice to accept. in another scenario, the watch can be locked or unlocked using a correct combination of short or long breaths. voice recognition sometimes produces incorrect words when dictating a text message. blowing quickly on the watch can erase words, while blowing on it longer will send the text message when ready. finally, the technique also works with smartphones. a user can transfer content from the watch to a smartphone simply by sipping it off the watch and puffing it on the phone. 
 reyes and his team are excited that they've proven the technology works. he says it could have potential for people with disabilities. ""the sip and puff technique has been used to control wheelchairs,"" he said. ""perhaps whoosh could be the foundation for developers looking for ways that allow more control for those who can't easily interact with their mobile and wearable devices."" 
 dingtian zhang , a ph.d. student and labmate of reyes, also designed a 3d-printed case that snaps onto the watch. the attachment has eight holes around the bezel, each with varying lengths. when a wearer blows into each of the holes, unique frequencies are generated much like a flute. the watch's microphone and the whoosh system detects the subtle differences in the frequencies produced and identifies the intended target. each target is linked to a specific action within applications. 
 the final project, tapskin, allows users to tap on the back of their hand to input numbers 0-9 or commands into the watch. the technique uses the watch's microphone and inertial sensors to detect a total of 11 different tapping locations on a person's skin around the watch.

 from his office five stories above fifth street, gee-kung chang looked out over the ever-growing collection of office buildings that comprise georgia tech's technology square in midtown atlanta. 
 every lobby, office, and hallway in the area could someday host numerous ­internet-connected sensors, cameras, or control systems as businesses begin to roll out more and more internet of things devices and systems. 
 ""in tech square alone, you could have hundreds of thousands of sensors, measuring the temperature of each room, turning on and off lights and cameras, locking and unlocking doors,"" said chang, a professor in the school of electrical and computer engineering. 
 during the next five years, internet of things products will grow in number to account for more than half of the world's 27.1 billion internet-connected devices, according to a recent forecast from cisco. in fact, at some point, it may be easier to count the objects not connected to the internet than the ones that are, said alain louchez, managing director of georgia tech's center for the development and application of internet of things technologies (cdait). 
 ""this is what i mean when i say that the internet of things will give rise to a pulsating world - devices all over constantly sending and receiving data,"" he said. 
 as that internet of things wave approaches, georgia tech researchers are exploring the implications of a connected world - from finding ways to keep hackers at bay to developing the next-generation of wireless and cellular networks capable of supporting so many new devices.

new-technology-sorts-cells-stiffness-may-help-spot-disease.txt,"new technology that sorts cells by stiffness may help spot disease 
 researchers have developed a new technology to sort human cells according to their stiffness, which might one day help doctors identify certain diseases in patients, according to a new study.

 the mechanical properties of cells are often an indicator of disease. cancer cells are typically soft and squishy. when the malaria parasite is inside a red blood cell, for example, the cell is stiffer than normal. sickle cells also vary in stiffness.  research into the stiffness of diseased cells is lacking, in part due to limits in technology. researchers have developed a new technology to sort human cells according to their stiffness, which might one day help doctors identify certain diseases in patients, according to a new study. the research team, from the georgia institute of technology, hopes that their technology might one day aid doctors in the field to rapidly and more accurately diagnose disease. the new technology is being tested in a small device, about 1 inch wide by 1.5 inches long. cells are injected into a microfluidic channel on one side of the device. as the cells move through the channel, they are forced to squeeze over a series of ridges that are fabricated at an angle to the channel. if the cells are very flexible, they will easily squeeze over the ridges and follow the fluid stream. but if the cells are stiffer, when they hit a ridge, they will slide along the angled ridge before squeezing over, causing the cells to move to one side, separating them from the softer cells. these ridges eventually separate a single stream of cells into two streams depending on the cells' stiffness, which in some cases can be an indicator of a disease. ""if you imagine a microfluidic channel that is focusing a stream of cells, you'll push the cells in different directions based on their mechanical properties,"" said study co-author todd sulchek, an assistant professor in the george w. woodruff school of mechanical engineering at georgia tech. sulchek specializes in studying the mechanical properties of cells. the new research was published oct. 16 in the journal 
 plos one. 
 the research was sponsored by the national science foundation. the researchers also have a patent on this technology. ""there are no real techniques to sort cells by stiffness right now in large numbers,"" said alexander alexeev, an assistant professor in georgia tech's george w. woodruff school of mechanical engineering. alexeev is an expert in fluid mechanics and a co-author on the study a few other research groups are working on microfluidic approaches to sorting cells by stiffness, but sulchek and alexeev believe their technology will be quite sensitive. ""there are several microfluidic approaches, but there's not a real device yet,"" alexeev said. ""the main problem is how to sort cells very rapidly because if we are looking at cancer cells, there are very, very few of them. so we need to look at thousands of millions of cells to capture maybe a hundred cancer cells."" their technology can sort cells at speeds similar to other cell sorting devices, such as a fluorescently activated cell sorter machine, which is a commonly device used in research labs. to show that their device can successfully sort cells based on stiffness, the researchers made some cells artificially soft, then labeled them with a different color so they could find them later. after running the cells through their device and analyzing the separated cells by color, they found that the artificially soft cells were separated from the other cells. then the researchers used atomic force microscopy to probe the cells' mechanical properties to make sure they were actually different. ""we show that we separate by stiffness, not by other factors,"" sulchek said. the researchers tested four different commercially available cell lines. white blood cells sort by stiffness particularly well, the researchers reported. the research team will now work on using their device to separate cancer cells, malaria-infected cells, and sickle cells, and to sort stem cells. ""we're assured the device is very sensitive to say that the soft cells are all soft, but what we don't know is whether all the disease cells are soft,"" sulchek said. aside from testing for disease, the cell stiffness sorter could also be used in as a method for purifying and enriching an undifferentiated stem cell population from the differentiated cells, which would be useful for laboratory scientists. ""this is also a useful tool for just basic research and understanding what the effect of specific disease is on cell mechanics,"" alexeev said. gonghao wang, a phd student in sulchek's lab, is the first author of the study. this research is supported by the national science foundation under award cbet-0932510. any conclusions or opinions are those of the authors and do not necessarily represent the official views of the sponsoring agencies. citation : g wang, et al., ""stiffness dependent separation of cells in a microfluidic device,"" ( plos one , 2013).

 combining a new hydrogel material with a protein that boosts blood vessel growth could improve the success rate for transplanting insulin-producing islet cells.

 combining a new hydrogel material with a protein that boosts blood vessel growth could improve the success rate for transplanting insulin-producing islet cells into persons with type 1 diabetes. in an animal model, the technique enhanced the survival rate of transplanted insulin-producing cells, restoring insulin production in response to blood glucose levels and curing these diabetic animals. 
 the technology could also help patients who must have their pancreas removed because of severe pancreatitis, an inflammatory disease. using the material and protein combination, the researchers evaluated multiple locations for implanting the islet cell clusters, the first time such a direct comparison of transplant sites has been made. 
 ""we have engineered a material that can be used to transplant islets and promote vascularization and survival of the islets to enhance their function,"" said andrés garcía, a regents' professor in the woodruff school of mechanical engineering at the georgia institute of technology. ""we are very excited about this because it could have immediate patient benefits if this proves successful in humans."" 
 the research, supported by the juvenile diabetes research foundation and the national institutes of health, was reported june 2 in the journal science advances. 
 type 1 diabetes affects millions 
 about 1.25 million americans have type 1 diabetes, also known as juvenile diabetes, a disease characterized by the body's inability to produce insulin. to control the disease, patients must frequently test their glucose levels and inject insulin to maintain the proper balance. but some patients suffer life-threatening hypoglycemic episodes, and the disease has other serious health consequences. 
 using cells from cadavers, doctors have been experimentally transplanting pancreatic islets into humans for decades, but as many as 60 percent of the transplanted islets die immediately because they are cut off from their blood supply and are killed by an immune response due to direct injection into the bloodstream, and those that survive the transplant usually die within several months. in testing done so far, the islets have been placed into the vasculature of the liver, which has significant blood supply - but might not be the ideal location because of the hostile immune environment. 
 engineering a new solution 
 so garcía and collaborators, including georgia tech postdoctoral researcher and first author jessica weaver, set out to engineer a new approach to transplanting the cells. they developed a new degradable polymer hydrogel material used to deliver the cells as they are injected into the body. and they incorporated into the gel a protein known as vascular endothelial growth factor (vegf), which encourages the growth of blood vessels into the transplanted cells. 
 ""the transplanted islets need a lot of oxygenation and a connection to the body's circulatory system to sense the glucose levels and transport the insulin,"" noted garcía, who is also the rae and frank h. neely endowed chair in mechanical engineering. ""in addition to protecting the islets, our engineered material promotes the formation of new blood vessels to nourish the cells."" 
 vegf has been tried before, but in quantities too large, it stimulates the growth of leaky blood vessels that don't provide long-term oxygenation. too little vegf doesn't grow vessels rapidly enough to maintain the transplanted islets, which are clusters containing hundreds of cells. without sufficient vasculature in the clusters, the cells in the center don't survive. 
 weaver used diabetic mice to compare locations in the body where the transplanted cells could be placed. she studied locations in the liver, under the skin, in the mesentery regions near the intestines and in an epididymal fat pad in the abdomen. 
 potentially treating more patients 
 ""we were able to study the transplant sites in parallel and really look at the pros and cons of each to compare the survival rates of the cells in each area,"" said weaver. ""islet cells are very precious because we get so few from each donor. we need them all to survive to help a patient with type 1 diabetes get off insulin."" 
 in the liver location, as many as three donors are now required to get enough transplantable islets to provide glucose control in a single patient. if researchers could reduce the loss of cells, they could one day treat two or even three times as many patients from the limited number of cadaver donors available, garcía noted. 
 evaluating the technique 
 weaver studied the animal models for as long as 100 days, and found that the islet clusters transplanted with the hydrogel and vegf developed many blood vessels and engrafted into their new locations. as expected, the hydrogel material disappeared and was replaced by new tissue which grew around the islets. 
 to track the long-term viability of the islet cells, she used cells with a gene that produces a green luminescence when excited by certain wavelengths of light. by measuring the signal returned from the transplant locations, she was able to determine how many of the cells survived. introducing a dye into the bloodstream then allowed her to image the growing vasculature around the islets. 
 the abdominal fat pad turned out to provide the most optimal transplant location. in humans, the equivalent structure is called the omentum, a blood vessel-rich region that other researchers are evaluating as an islet transplant location. should the technique be used in humans, the cells could be placed there laparoscopically in a minimally-invasive procedure. the hydrogel would be injected in liquid form and would polymerize in the transplant site, creating a flexible gel that would conform to bodily structures to improve both blood vessel connections and tissue integration. 
 what's next 
 as a next step, garcía and weaver would like to study the technique in larger animals. after that, human clinical trials would be required to show whether the combination of hydrogel material and protein will benefit patients with type 1 diabetes. ultimately, the researchers hope stem cells might provide a source of islets that could be transplanted without the need of cadaveric donor islets and immune system suppression. 
 weaver, a researcher at the diabetes research institute before joining georgia tech, said she was surprised at how well the new technology worked. the imaging provided a clear view of the growing vascular system surrounding the islet clumps. 
 ""when we first started doing the imaging, i'm pretty sure i screamed the first time i saw it,"" said weaver. ""it was so beautiful to see the vasculature. i wasn't expecting to see such perfect blood vessel growth into the islets.""

 when most people think of vending machines, they think of snacks. but this year a team of georgia tech librarians and staff brought in one that dispenses something very different: works of art. 
 clark whittington, an artist from north carolina, took an old, discontinued cigarette vending machine and filled it with his art. after seeing how successful his machine was, he decided to spread what he called art-o-mats throughout the country and fill them with the work of local artists. 
 once alison valk, a librarian at georgia tech, found out about the project, she immediately wanted to bring it to tech's campus. 
 ""one of my passion projects is exposing students to the arts, especially public art,"" valk said. ""i'm always looking out for opportunities to bring more arts to campus."" the effects of the machine are already being seen. just while loading it, multiple people talked to valk about their experiences with art-o-mats. there is something about the space-themed, vintage vending machine that draws people in. students walk by to get coffee and stop to observe the new machine, located on the first floor of the price gilbert library near blue donkey coffee. 
 the artwork in the machines ranges from circuit board jewelry to small paintings or prints, and all artwork can be sent to the company that maintains art-o-mats. they will review the work and determine if it will be placed in machines across the globe. valk is hopeful this library initiative will inspire students to think creatively. it is a way to promote the humanities on campus and allow students to showcase their talents, and the broad range of art lets any student combine their passions with the art-o-mat. 
 in time, the library will offer workshops encouraging students to create their own prototypes. this is part of a larger initiative to bring new programming to the library. 
 ""the art-o-mat is a concept that started small and grew to something with a much larger reach,"" valk said. ""the library hopes this resonates with tech students. the machine is already inspiring new programming here through upcoming workshops in spring 2022."" though the art is small, it could have a big impact.

new-water-treatment-approach-helps-avoid-harmful-chemicals.txt,"new water treatment approach helps to avoid harmful chemicals 
 georgia institute of technology researchers developed the minus approach to handle these harmful byproducts. 
 sep 11, 2023 
 the water coming out of your faucet is safe to drink, but that doesn't mean it's completely clean. chlorine has long been the standard for water treatment, but it often contains trace levels of disinfection byproducts and unknown contaminants. georgia institute of technology researchers developed the minus approach to handle these harmful byproducts. 
 instead of relying on traditional chemical addition (known as the plus approach), the minus approach avoids disinfectants, chemical coagulants, and advanced oxidation processes typical to water treatment processes. it uses a unique mix of filtration methods to remove byproducts and pathogens, enabling water treatment centers to use ultraviolet light and much smaller doses of chemical disinfectants to minimize future bacterial growth down the distribution system. 
 ""the minus approach is a groundbreaking philosophical concept in water treatment,"" said 
 yongsheng chen , the bonnie w. and charles w. moorman iv professor in the school of civil and environmental engineering. ""its primary objective is to achieve these outcomes while minimizing the reliance on chemical treatments, which can give rise to various issues in the main water treatment stream."" 
 chen and his student elliot reid, the primary author, presented the minus approach in the paper, "" the minus approach can redefine the standard of practice of drinking water treatment ,"" in 
 the american chemical society . 
 the minus approach physically separates emerging contaminants and disinfection byproducts from the main water treatment process using these already proven processes: 
 bank filtration withdraws water from naturally occurring or constructed banks like rivers or lakes. as the water travels through the layers of soil and gravel, it naturally filters out impurities, suspended particles, and certain microorganisms. 
 biofiltration uses biological processes to treat water by passing it through filter beds made of sand, gravel, or activated carbon that can support the growth of beneficial microorganisms, which in turn can remove contaminants. 
 adsorption occurs when an adsorbent material like activated carbon is used to trap contaminants. 
 membrane filtration uses a semi-permeable membrane to separate particles and impurities from the main treatment process. 
 the minus approach is intended to engage the water community in designing safer, more sustainable, and more intelligent systems. because its technologies are already available and proven, the minus approach can be implemented immediately. 
 it can also integrate with artificial intelligence (ai) to improve filtration's effectiveness. ai can aid process optimization, predictive maintenance, faulty detection and diagnosis, energy optimization, and decision-support systems. ai models have also been able to reliably predict the origin of different types of pollution in source water, and models have also successfully detected pipeline damage and microbial contamination, allowing for quick and efficient maintenance. 
 ""this innovative philosophy seeks to revolutionize traditional water treatment practices by providing a more sustainable and environmentally friendly solution,"" chen said. ""by reducing the reliance on chemical treatments, the minus approach mitigates the potential risks associated with the use of such chemicals, promoting a safer water supply for both human consumption and environmental protection.""

new-wearable-device-measures-changing-size-tumors-below-skin.txt,"new wearable device measures the changing size of tumors below the skin 
 engineers at the georgia institute of technology and stanford university have created a small, autonomous device with a stretchable / flexible sensor that can be adhered to the skin to measure the changing size of tumors below. 
 sep 16, 2022 
 - atlanta, ga 
 engineers at the georgia institute of technology and stanford university have created a small, autonomous device with a stretchable / flexible sensor that can be adhered to the skin to measure the changing size of tumors below. the non-invasive, battery-operated device is sensitive to one-hundredth of a millimeter (10 micrometers) and can beam results to a smartphone app wirelessly in real-time with the press of a button. 
 in practical terms, the researchers say, their device-dubbed fast for ""flexible autonomous sensor measuring tumors""-represents a wholly new, fast, inexpensive, hands-free, and accurate way to test the efficacy of cancer drugs. on a grander scale, it could lead to promising new directions in cancer treatment. 
 each year researchers test thousands of potential cancer drugs on mice with subcutaneous tumors. few make it to human patients, and the process for finding new therapies is slow because technologies for measuring tumor regression from drug treatment take weeks to read out a response. the inherent biological variation of tumors, the shortcomings of existing measuring approaches, and the relatively small sample sizes make drug screenings difficult and labor-intensive. 
 ""in some cases, the tumors under observation must be measured by hand with calipers,"" says  alex abramson , first author of the study and a recent post-doc in the lab of  zhenan bao  at the stanford school of engineering and now an assistant professor at georgia tech. the use of metal pincer-like calipers to measure soft tissues is not ideal, and radiological approaches cannot deliver the sort of continuous data needed for real-time assessment. fast can detect changes in tumor volume on the minute-timescale, while caliper and bioluminescence measurements often require weeks-long observation periods to read out changes in tumor size. 
 fast's sensor is composed of a flexible and stretchable skin-like polymer that includes an embedded layer of gold circuitry. this sensor is connected to a small electronic backpack designed by former post-docs and co-authors  yasser khan  and  naoji matsuhisa . the device measures the strain on the membrane-how much it stretches or shrinks-and transmits that data to a smartphone. using the fast backpack, potential therapies that are linked to tumor size regression can quickly and confidently be excluded as ineffective or fast-tracked for further study. 
 the researchers say that the new device offers at least three significant advances. first, it provides continuous monitoring, as the sensor is physically connected to the mouse and remains in place over the entire experimental period. second, the flexible sensor enshrouds the tumor and is therefore able to measure shape changes that are difficult to discern with other methods. third, fast is both autonomous and non-invasive. it is connected to the skin, not unlike a band-aid, battery operated and connected wirelessly. the mouse is free to move unencumbered by the device or wires, and scientists do not need to actively handle the mice following sensor placement. fast packs are also reusable, cost just $60 or so to assemble and can be attached to the mouse in minutes. 
 the breakthrough is in fast's flexible electronic material. coated on top of the skin-like polymer is a layer of gold, which, when stretched, develops small cracks that change the electrical conductivity of the material. stretch the material and number of cracks increases, causing the electronic resistance in the sensor to increase as well. when the material contracts, the cracks come back into contact and conductivity improves. 
 both abramson and co-author naoji matsuhisa, an associate professor at the university of tokyo, characterized how these crack propagation and exponential changes in conductivity can be mathematically equated with changes in dimension and volume. 
 one hurdle the researchers had to overcome was the concern that the sensor itself might compromise measurements by applying undue pressure to the tumor, effectively squeezing it. to circumvent that risk, they carefully matched the mechanical properties of the flexible material to skin itself to make the sensor as pliant and as supple as real skin. 
 ""it is a deceptively simple design,"" abramson says, ""but these inherent advantages should be very interesting to the pharmaceutical and oncological communities. fast could significantly expedite, automate and lower the cost of the process of screening cancer therapies.""

 grant is third nih award for health technology startup. 
 apr 19, 2024 
 atlanta -  annoviant inc. a health technology company and member startup in the  center for medtech excellence  at georgia tech's  enterprise innovation institute , is receiving a $2.99 million national institutes of health (nih) grant to further scale the development and commercialization of its txguard™ pulmonary-valved conduit for pediatric heart disease. the award follows two phase i nih grants the company received, the most recent being in 2021. annoviant's patented txguard™ stands at the forefront of technological innovation in conduit replacements for treating congenital heart disease (chd), the most prevalent birth defect globally and a leading cause of birth-related mortality, the company said. chd encompasses a broad range of abnormalities that disrupt blood flow to and from the heart. it affects approximately 40,000 newborns annually - or 1% of births in the u.s. - and 1.35 million worldwide. with an estimated 2.9 million chd patients in the u.s. alone, the need for advanced solutions is paramount. ""this marks a significant milestone for annoviant as we accelerate our pursuit of impactful innovation to save lives,"" said annoviant ceo and co-founder ajay houde, ph.d. ""it validates our hypothesis and shows the nih's confidence in our ability to make good progress. because we are a small startup, it gives private investors the confidence to invest with us and more companies working with us across the broader ecosystem."" addressing critical shortcomings observed in current commercial devices, txguard™ offers clinical advantages, notably its resistance to calcification, thrombosis, infection, and the host cell integration. this cutting-edge technology marks a new era in pediatric cardiac interventions, providing durable pulmonary valved grafts that adapt and regenerate alongside patients, minimizing the need for multiple re-operations over their lifetimes. ""heart disease is the leading killer of men and women in the u.s. and is the most common birth defect in our newborns,"" said center for medtech excellence director nakia melecio, who worked with annoviant to help it scale and reviewed its federal funding submissions. the center for medtech excellence, which launched in 2022, works with early-stage life sciences startups that have specific obstacles that young tech companies in other sectors don't face. ""this is a critical milestone for the company, and validates its research and work, thus far,"" melicio said. ""annoviant's technology is tackling several challenges that the market currently faces and elevating the possibility for better patient outcomes in management of congestive heart failure."" pediatric patients with chd often undergo multiple cardiovascular surgeries throughout their lives, with associated costs totaling billions for the u.s. healthcare industry. txguard™ offers a transformative solution to this ongoing challenge, promising extended durability and reduced healthcare burden for patients and providers alike. he credited the company's work with the center for medtech excellence and being a health tech startup in the  advanced technology development center (atdc) , the enterprise innovation institute's startup incubator, as being pivotal in annoviant's growth. atdc sbir / sttr catalyst connie casteel, who works with the incubator's portfolio companies to help the prepare for these federal, non-dilutive funding grants, had worked with annoviant on its federal funding approach and strategy. ""we went through the 16-week program with the medtech center and it really helped us think through the various aspects of the commercialization process and operational challenges we would face,"" houde said. ""greg jungles at atdc was also instrumental in helping us.  i'm really thankful for nakia and his work with the medtech center and greg and the team at atdc.""

(credit: rob felt, georgia tech) 
 oct 06, 2015 
 - atlanta, ga 
 the national institutes of health (nih) has announced a $3.5 million transformative research award to 
 thomas barker , an associate professor in the 
 wallace h. coulter department of biomedical engineering 
 at georgia tech and emory university. the five-year grant will support research into new approaches for tracking and treating pulmonary fibrosis, a disease that claims 40,000 lives per year. pulmonary fibrosis is an incurable disease in which the uncontrolled growth of scar tissue severely damages the ability of the lungs to bring oxygen into the body. researchers plan to hijack the cellular mechanisms that normally worsen the disease, causing them to instead produce a chemical compound that would reduce the cross-linking associated with the fibrosis. the award is one of 13 transformative research awards announced by the nih on october 6. each year, the exclusive nih initiative funds a small number of ""high-risk, high-reward"" research proposals designed to advance innovative approaches to major contemporary challenges in biomedical research. ""fibrosis is wound healing that just won't quit,"" explained barker. ""cells continually repair the same tissue over and over again until you get this dense, biophysically restricted scar tissue. that scar tissue not only impairs the ability to bring in oxygen, but at the cellular level that increased stiffness also provides a dominant signal that continues to drive this aberrant process."" barker, whose lab studies how cells respond biochemically and biophysically to the microenvironment around them, wants to tap into the signaling that occurs between the cells and their environment to co-opt the cellular response to stiffness of the extracellular matrix. instead of creating more scar, the cells would instead respond by releasing a protease to dissolve some of the crosslinks that create the stiffness. ""in the disease process, as more extracellular matrix is deposited and more cross links are created, the stiffness of the tissue increases,"" barker explained. ""if we can have that stiffness inherently drive the production of proteases, which are enzymes that break down the extracellular matrix, then there's the potential to create a feedback loop in which these enzymes would come in and cleave the unwanted matrix proteins. that would relieve some of the crosslinks and begin to soften the tissue."" the researchers plan to use conventional gene therapy techniques to insert a mechanism into the cells that would activate only when the fibrotic process was occurring. when not needed, the mechanism would lie dormant, allowing it to be distributed broadly among both normal and abnormal lung cells. ""it would be a self-limiting therapy that's controlled locally at the cellular level,"" barker said. while treatment is the ultimate goal, barker also wants to develop a signaling mechanism that could be used to track progress of the disease. a small number of sentinel cells affected by the stiffening extracellular matrix would express a fluorescent protein, allowing clinicians to see where conditions are changing. currently, there is no way to measure changing stiffness in the lungs of living organisms. barker doesn't expect to attain all of the project goals within the grant period, but he does hope to build a foundation for research, which could have applications to other diseases such as cancer that also have biomechanical signaling components. ""the idea that we can target the biomechanics of a tissue as a tractable target for gene therapy has not been explored,"" barker said. ""it is ripe for exploration at this time because the last decade or so has seen a flurry of research into how biomechanics drives disease and different cellular processes. scientists have made some significant strides in understanding the mechanisms of how cells sense mechanics, how those things go awry, and how the environment can drive some significant biology."" the proposal was developed in collaboration with md / phd student dwight chambers. barker also plans to work with associate professors melissa kemp and phil santangelo from the department of biomedical engineering, and with a research team at the university of michigan. under the high-risk, high-reward research program supported by the nih common fund, awards support exceptional investigators pursuing bold research projects that span the broad mission of the nih, including developing methods for cells to synthesize their own drugs, using cell phones to identify and track disease-carrying mosquitoes in their natural habitats, stopping depression by monitoring and altering brain cell states, and exploring how socially learned behavior can be passed on biologically to future generations. ""this program has consistently produced research that revolutionized scientific fields by giving investigators the freedom to take risks and explore potentially groundbreaking concepts,"" said nih director francis s. collins, m.d., ph.d. ""we look forward to the remarkable advances in biomedical research the 2015 awardees will make."" the nih common fund encourages collaboration and supports a series of exceptionally high-impact, trans-nih programs. common fund programs are designed to pursue major opportunities and gaps in biomedical research that no single nih institute could tackle alone, but that the agency as a whole can address to make the biggest impact possible on the progress of medical research. barker's award will also be supported through the national heart, lung and blood institute (nhlbi). the transformative research award, established in 2009, promotes cross-cutting, interdisciplinary approaches and is open to individuals and teams of investigators who propose research that could potentially create or challenge existing paradigms. research news georgia institute of technology 177 north avenue atlanta, georgia 30332-0181 usa media relations contact : john toon ( jtoon@gatech.edu ) (404-894-6986) write r: john toon

 researchers have demonstrated proof-of-concept wearable thermoelectric generators that can harvest energy from body heat.

 - atlanta, ga 
 using flexible conducting polymers and novel circuitry patterns printed on paper, researchers have demonstrated proof-of-concept wearable thermoelectric generators that can harvest energy from body heat to power simple biosensors for measuring heart rate, respiration or other factors. 
 because of their symmetrical fractal wiring patterns, the devices can be cut to the size needed to provide the voltage and power requirements for specific applications. the modular generators could be inkjet printed on flexible substrates, including fabric, and manufactured using inexpensive roll-to-roll techniques. 
 ""the attraction of thermoelectric generators is that there is heat all around us,"" said akanksha menon, a ph.d. student in the 
 woodruff school of mechanical engineering 
 at the georgia institute of technology. ""if we can harness a little bit of that heat and turn it into electricity inexpensively, there is great value. we are working on how to produce electricity with heat from the body."" 
 the research, supported by pepsico, inc. and the air force office of scientific research, was reported online in the 
 journal of applied physics 
 on september 28th. 
 thermoelectric generators, which convert thermal energy directly into electricity, have been available for decades, but standard designs use inflexible inorganic materials that are too toxic for use in wearable devices. power output depends on the temperature differential that can be created between two sides of the generators, which makes depending on body heat challenging. getting enough thermal energy from a small contact area on the skin increases the challenge, and internal resistance in the device ultimately limits the power output. 
 to overcome that, menon and collaborators in the laboratory of assistant professor 
 shannon yee 
 designed a device with thousands of dots composed of alternating p-type and n-type polymers in a closely-packed layout. their pattern converts more heat per unit area due to large packing densities enabled by inkjet printers. by placing the polymer dots closer together, the interconnect length decreases, which in turn lowers the total resistance and results in a higher power output from the device. 
 ""instead of connecting the polymer dots with a traditional serpentine wiring pattern, we are using wiring patterns based on space filling curves, such as the hilbert pattern - a continuous space-filling curve,"" said kiarash gordiz, a co-author who worked on the project while he was a ph.d. student at georgia tech. ""the advantage here is that hilbert patterns allow for surface conformation and self-localization, which provides a more uniform temperature across the device."" 
 the new circuit design also has another benefit: its fractally symmetric design allows the modules to be cut along boundaries between symmetric areas to provide exactly the voltage and power needed for a specific application. that eliminates the need for power converters that add complexity and take power away from the system. 
 ""this is valuable in the context of wearables, where you want as few components as possible,"" said menon. ""we think this could be a really interesting way to expand the use of thermoelectrics for wearable devices."" 
 so far, the devices have been printed on ordinary paper, but the researchers have begun exploring the use of fabrics. both paper and fabric are flexible, but the fabric could be easily integrated into clothing. 
 ""we want to integrate our device into the commercial textiles that people wear every day,"" said menon. ""people would feel comfortable wearing these fabrics, but they would be able to power something with just the heat from their bodies."" 
 with the novel design, the researchers expect to get enough electricity to power small sensors, in the range of microwatts to milliwatts. that would be enough for simple heart rate sensors, but not more complex devices like fitness trackers or smartphones. the generators might also be useful to supplement batteries, allowing devices to operate for longer periods of time. 
 among the challenges ahead are protecting the generators from moisture and determining just how close they should be to the skin to transfer thermal energy - while remaining comfortable for wearers. 
 the researchers use commercially-available p-type materials, and are working with chemists at georgia tech to develop better n-type polymers for future generations of devices that can operate with small temperature differentials at room temperatures. body heat produces differentials as small as five degrees, compared to a hundred degrees for generators used as part of piping and steam lines. 
 ""one future benefit of this class of polymer material is the potential for a low-cost and abundant thermoelectric material that would have an inherently low thermal conductivity,"" said yee, who directs the lab as part of the woodruff school of mechanical engineering. ""the organic electronics community has made tremendous advances in understanding electronic and optical properties of polymer-based materials. we are building upon that knowledge to understand thermal and thermoelectric transport in these polymers to enable new device functionality."" 
 among the other prospects for the materials being developed are localized cooling devices that reverse the process, using electricity to move thermal energy from one side of a device to another. cooling just parts of the body could provide the perception of comfort without the cost of large-space air conditioning, yee said.

 the national science foundation (nsf) has named competency catalyst, an initiative focused on innovative tools for workforce reskilling and led by partners including eduworks corporation (eduworks), georgia tech, and the university system of georgia (usg), as 
 one of nine teams selected to receive phase ii convergence accelerator funding . over two years, competency catalyst will receive $5 million in funding from the nsf convergence accelerator. 
 the phase i convergence accelerator cohort was announced in 2019 and included the competency catalyst team as one of 43 projects to receive phase i funding. the phase ii cohort includes just nine teams of the original 43 and will provide competency catalyst with up to $5 million in funding for prototype development and pilot projects. during the two years of phase ii funding, the competency catalyst team, which includes eduworks, georgia tech's center for 21st century universities (c21u), usg, and the credential engine, will develop prototypes of digital tools to support critical workforce reskilling in the united states. 
 ""the unpredictability of the job market over the past year has prompted many people to consider their current career trajectory and skills,"" said 
 ashok goel , co-pi and chief scientist for c21u. ""it is critical that we leverage technology to develop better tools to sync up employers and educators so that job seekers have clear paths to reskilling. this type of tool is exactly what we hope to develop through the competency catalyst project."" 
 over the next two years, competency catalyst will create two digital resources to support reskilling - a skillsync application and a c2 platform. the skillsync application enables companies to succinctly express reskilling needs for their workforce. this information is then distilled to colleges and universities so that they can design accelerated educational programs with the needed skills as specific learning outcomes. the skillsync application is built on the c2 platform, which is designed to better describe and align job requirements and opportunities for reskilling in specific knowledge, skill, and ability (ksa) terminology. georgia tech's jill watson ai-based educational assistant, the credential engine's open data infrastructure, and eduworks' digital competency extraction tools and open-source competency and skills system (cass) will provide the framework for these two innovative new tools. 
 ""the pairing of c2 and skillsync will empower direct, real-time communication between companies and education providers through an ai-powered digital tool,"" said 
 matt lisle , director of digital learning technologies for c21u and member of the competency catalyst development team. ""we believe that this will have an immediate and positive impact on the efficiency and effectiveness of reskilling america's workforce."" 
 this convergence accelerator phase ii grant is overseen by the national science foundation's convergence accelerator program in the office of integrative activities and is associated with the convergence accelerator topic area of ai and future jobs, and national talent ecosystem.

 during the weekslong battle against wildfires in california this fall, thousands of firefighters worked around the clock to save lives and property. 
 it's not hard to imagine those crews toiling past the point of exhaustion. many likely did. 
 that's exactly the kind of scenario the creators of 
 firehud 
 want to prevent. the georgia tech graduates have developed a wearable device that helps commanders keep track of firefighters' vital signs while they work. it's an idea with enough merit to have won two new grants this fall, 
 including a second round of seed funding from the national science foundation (nsf). 
 the 
 phase ii small business innovation research grant 
 means alumni zack braun, tyler sisk, and joe boettcher have $750,000 to continue refining their biotrac platform, and it's a big vote of confidence in the platform's technical and commercial viability. that brings the total investment from the nsf to nearly a million dollars. 
 ""with our phase i grant from nsf, we learned a lot very quickly,"" said braun, a 2016 computer science graduate and co-founder of firehud. 
 those lessons included realizing that their initial concept - a heads-up display of environmental and biometric data for firefighters - wasn't what they actually needed. 
 ""based on feedback from the first responders, we learned that firefighters themselves are focused on the job at hand and too busy to use a heads-up display. really, the commander needs the [biometric] data so that they can best decide how to allocate their resources."" 
 braun said the team learned fire chiefs needed a system that was easy to use, passive, and rugged. as a result, their product has evolved into a 
 body-worn band, a long-range radio transceiver, and a real-time software dashboard . it allows on-scene commanders to make sure their crews aren't overexerting themselves while they battle a blaze. 
 braun called it the first commercially viable physiological monitoring platform tailored to first responders. 
 braun and sisk won the 
 2016 inventure prize 
 for the original firehud idea. they also participated in 
 create-x , an initiative to support entrepreneurship among georgia tech students. sisk finished his bachelor's in electrical engineering in 2016, and he and braun went to work full-time on the concept. they subsequently brought in boettcher, another electrical engineering graduate from tech, as chief development officer. 
 ""user feedback has been crucial to the evolution of our system,"" he said. ""that is something that has been instilled in our company since the beginning of the create-x program at georgia tech."" 
 meanwhile, the trio also has received $750,000 to outfit a u.s. air force base with the system they developed with the first round of nsf funding. 
 ""the platform will be used to monitor the health of all their recruits in real time as well as show the overall fitness trends of the recruits while they are at the air force base,"" braun said. 
 through the nsf seed funding program, boettcher, braun, and sisk will continue to receive mentoring, feedback from experts, and time to scale their product. braun said they're already in conversations with a manufacturer in georgia to produce more of their devices, which they'll market to first responders, the military, and industrial facilities.

nsf-rapid-response-earthquakes-turkey.txt,"nsf rapid response to earthquakes in turkey 
 zhigang peng and graduate students phuc mach and chang ding are using small seismic sensors to better understand just how, why, and when certain earthquakes are occurring. 
 jul 28, 2023 
 in february, a 
 major earthquake event 
 devastated the south-central region of the republic of türkiye (turkey) and northwestern syria . two earthquakes, one magnitude 7.8 and one magnitude 7.5, occurred nine hours apart, centered near the heavily populated city of gaziantep. the total rupture lengths of both events were up to 250 miles . 
 the president of turkey has called it the ""disaster of the century,"" and the threat is still not over - aftershocks could still affect the region. 
 now, 
 zhigang peng , a professor in the 
 school of earth and atmospheric sciences 
 at georgia tech and graduate students 
 phuc mach 
 and 
 chang ding , 
 alongside researchers at the scientific and technological research institution of türkiye (tübi̇tak) and researchers at the university of missouri, are using small seismic sensors to better understand just how, why, and when these earthquakes are occurring. 
 funded by an nsf rapid grant, the project is unique in that it aims to actively respond to the crisis while it's still happening. 
 national science foundation (nsf) rapid response research (rapid) grants 
 are used when there is a severe urgency with regard to availability of or access to data, 
 facilities or specialized equipment, including quick-response research on natural or anthropogenic disasters and other similar unanticipated events. 
 in an effort to better map the aftershocks of the earthquake event - which can occur weeks or months after the main event - the team placed approximately 120 small sensors, called nodes, in the east anatolian fault region this past may. their deployment continues through the summer. 
 it's the first time sensors like this have been deployed in turkey, says peng. 
 ""these sensors are unique in that they can be placed easily and efficiently,"" he explains. ""with internal batteries that can work up to one month when fully charged, they're buried in the ground and can be deployed within minutes, while most other seismic sensors need solar panels or other power sources and take much longer time and space to deploy."" each node is about the size of a 2-liter soda bottle, and can measure ground movement in three directions. 
 ""the primary reason we're deploying these sensors quickly following the two mainshocks is to study the physical mechanisms of how earthquakes trigger each,"" peng adds. mainshocks are the largest earthquake in a sequence. ""we'll use advanced techniques such as machine learning to detect and locate thousands of small aftershocks recorded by this network. these newly identified events can provide new important clues on how aftershocks evolve in space and time, and what drives foreshocks that occur before large events."" 
 unearthing fault mechanisms 
 the team will also use the detected aftershocks to illuminate active faults where three tectonic plates come together - a region known as the maraş triple junction. ""we plan to use the aftershock locations and the seismic waves from recorded events to image subsurface structures where large damaging earthquakes occur,"" says mach, the georgia tech graduate researcher. this will help scientists better understand why sometimes faults ‘creep' without any large events, while in other cases faults lock and then violently release elastic energy, creating powerful earthquakes. 
 getting high-resolution data of the fault structures is another priority. ""the fault line ruptured in the first magnitude 7.8 event has a bend in it, where earthquake activity typically terminates, but the earthquake rupture moved through this bend, which is highly unusual,"" peng says. by deploying additional ultra-dense arrays of sensors in their upcoming trip this summer, the team hopes to help researchers ‘see' the bend under the earth's surface, allowing them to better understand how fault properties control earthquake rupture propagation. 
 the team also aims to learn more about the relationship between the two main shocks that recently rocked turkey, sometimes called doublet events. doublet events can happen when the initial earthquake triggers a secondary earthquake by adding extra stress loading. while in this instance, the doublet may have taken place only 9 hours after the initial event, these secondary earthquakes have been known to take place days, months, or even years after the initial one - a famous example being the sequence of earthquakes that spanned 60 years in the north anatolian fault region in northern turkey. 
 ""clearly the two main shocks in 2023 are related, but it is still not clear how to explain the time delays,"" says peng. the team plans to work with their collaborators at tübi̇tak to re-analyze seismic and other types of geophysical data right before and after those two main shocks in order to better understand the triggering mechanisms. 
 ""in our most recent trip in southern türkiye, we saw numerous buildings that were partially damaged during the mainshock, and many people will have to live in temporary shelters for years during the rebuilding process,"" peng adds. ""while we cannot stop earthquakes from happening in tectonically active regions, we hope that our seismic deployment and subsequent research on earthquake triggering and fault imaging can improve our ability to predict what will happen next - before and after a big one - and could save countless lives.""

observing-cosmic-symphony-using-gravitational-wave-astronomy.txt,"observing a ""cosmic symphony"" using gravitational wave astronomy 
 research from a team of astrophysicists presents a compelling roadmap for capturing four- to 10-year snapshots of intermediate-mass black hole activity. 
 a snapshot of the 3d gravitational waveform from a general relativistic simulation of binary black holes. gravitational waves from such binary mergers are routinely observed by ligo. with space missions such as lisa, the evolution of these binaries can be monitored years in advance, allowing multi-frequency constraints on astrophysical formations and tests of general relativity.  (credit: jani, k., kinsey, m., clark, m., center for relativistic astrophysics, georgia institute of technology.)

 shrouded in mystery since their discovery, the phenomenon of black holes continues to be one of the most mind-boggling enigmas in our universe. 
 in recent years, many researchers have made strides in understanding black holes using observational astronomy and an emerging field known as gravitational wave astronomy, first hypothesized by albert einstein, which directly measures the gravitational waves emitted by black holes. 
 through these findings on black hole gravitational waves, which were first observed in 2015 by the laser interferometer gravitational-wave observatories (ligo) in louisiana and washington, researchers have learned exciting details about these invisible objects and developed theories and projections on everything from their size to their physical properties. 
 still, limitations in ligo and other observation technologies have kept scientists from grasping a more complete picture of black holes, and one of the largest gaps in knowledge concerns a certain type of black hole: those of intermediate mass, or black holes that fall somewhere between supermassive (at least a million times greater than our sun) and stellar (think: smaller, though still five to 50 times greater than the mass of our sun). 
 that could soon change thanks to new research from a team of astrophysicists from the georgia institute of technology, vanderbilt university, the california institute of technology, and the jet propulsion laboratory at nasa. the study, which was sponsored by nasa and the national science foundation and published nov. 18 in 
 nature 
 astronomy , presents a compelling roadmap for capturing four- to 10-year snapshots of intermediate-mass black hole activity. 
 ""the possibility that intermediate-mass black holes exist but are currently hidden from our view is both tantalizing and frustrating,"" said deidre shoemaker, a professor in georgia tech's school of physics. ""fortunately, there is hope, as these black holes are ideal sources for future multiband gravitational wave astronomy."" 
 the new research, led by karan jani at vanderbilt, looks at the future of ligo detectors alongside the proposed laser interferometer space antenna (lisa) space mission, which would help humans get a step closer to understanding what happens in and around black holes. 
 ""like a symphony orchestra emits sound across an array of frequencies, the gravitational waves emitted by black holes occur at different frequencies and times,"" jani said. ""some of these frequencies are extremely high bandwidth, while some are low bandwidth, and our goal in the next era of gravitational wave astronomy is to capture multiband observations of both of these frequencies in order to ‘hear the entire song,' as it were, when it comes to black holes."" 
 lisa, a mission jointly led by the european space agency and nasa and planned for launch in the year 2034, would improve detection sensitivity for low-frequency gravitational waves. as the first dedicated space-based gravitational wave detector, lisa would provide a critical measurement of a previously unattainable frequency and enable the more complete observation of intermediate-mass black holes. in 2018, vanderbilt physics and astronomy professor kelly holley-bockelmann was appointed by nasa as the inaugural chair of the lisa study team. 
 ""inside black holes, all known understanding of our universe breaks down,"" jani, who holds a ph.d. in physics from georgia tech, said. ""with the high frequency already being captured by ligo detectors and the low frequency from future detectors and the lisa mission, we can bring these data points together to help fill in many gaps in our understanding of black holes.""

 - atlanta, ga 
 georgia tech will play host to many of the leading minds in ocean science and technology this week during a four-day summit that will begin laying the foundation for establishing a united community of researchers focused on preserving a global resource. the summit will be 
 streamed live 
 via the web. 
 oceanvisions2019: climate  is the first public-facing forum for ocean visions, an initiative 
 announced last year 
 with the stated intention of using advances in science and engineering to maintain healthy oceans for all inhabitants of earth and for all users and uses of the open seas. today, ocean visions announced the formation of a consortium: four regional hubs that will foster, review, and evaluate research and development in pursuit of healthy oceans. 
 ""ocean visions provides much-needed optimism for the future of our oceans,"" said emanuele di lorenzo, professor in tech's school of earth and atmospheric sciences and director of the 
 ocean science and engineering 
 program. ""it establishes a playground for innovative solutions by bringing together the leading minds in ocean conservation who are dedicated to sharing experiences as well as brainstorming and supporting better solutions."" 
 in addition to tech, founding partners include the smithsonian institution, stanford university, the scripps institution of oceanography at the university of california san diego, skidaway institute of oceanography, the university of georgia, monterey bay aquarium research institute, the georgia aquarium, monterey bay aquarium, and the birch aquarium at scripps. 
 summit participants will hear from 
 researchers, conservationists, and entrepreneurs 
 on ocean-based science and engineering successes in the areas of resilience, adaptation, mitigation, and sustainability. business leaders will learn more about proposed solutions, ranging from advanced concepts to those that are market ready. 
 georgia tech president emeritus g. wayne clough will open the summit and introduce the consortium. 
 ""addressing the challenges facing our oceans will take an ambitious effort that brings together the best talent in our nation,"" said clough, who served as secretary of the smithsonian institution from 2008-14. ""ocean visions is unique because it is led by trusted institutions and top scientists and researchers in ocean conservation working together to formulate a call to action to foster, support, and advance innovative and viable solutions that can make a difference.""

 minda monteagudo is a one-of-a-kind student, literally. she is the first student to ever graduate with a ph.d. in ocean sciences and engineering from georgia tech. this program was established in 2014 as an interdisciplinary study integrating biology, civil engineering, and earth and atmospheric sciences. monteagudo was approached due to her interest in climate change and how it affects the ocean. 
 ""it is a home that brings together people who work on ocean science,"" monteagudo said. there are many events with students in the program that have made it feel like a home for monteagudo on campus that extends beyond the classroom. she has found close friends during her time in the program while receiving support from her faculty mentors. 
 ""tech was defined by the people in my department,"" she said. that is why she is excited to see what future cohorts will accomplish. next year will be the first full group of students graduating, and many are already writing their dissertations. monteagudo recently finished hers on fossil shells in ocean sediment. she used chemistry to reconstruct ocean temperatures from the geological past. these findings can be used to bolster current models of future temperature changes by seeing if they match past records. during monteagudo's time at tech, she was a teaching assistant for eas 2600, which enabled her to use her love of teaching while interacting with undergraduate students. 
 ""students saw connections from earth and atmospheric sciences to their own majors, so i was able to learn many things from their personal experiences,"" monteagudo said. she was also asked to join a task force for racial equality with 12 other students. this was a rare opportunity that she did not take lightly. over her short few years at tech, minda monteagudo has blazed many trails and helped shape a better future for all students. currently, she is seeking jobs and will likely start working in the coming months.

 - atlanta, ga 
 in fiscal year 2021, georgia tech's research enterprise - with grants, contracts, and other sponsored activities - totaled a record $1.2 billion, and we are currently on track to break that record in fiscal year 2022. 
 to create a stronger business and service model to support initiatives, investigators, and continued growth, the institute is undertaking steps to structure and scale its research support functions to enable best-in-class research stewardship and ensure best practices around compliance. 
 the effort reflects the institute's and the executive vice president for research (evpr) office's commitment to strengthen service and support functions as the research enterprise continues to grow. this commitment translates into streamlining processes and roles, and hiring additional employees at all levels, including 19 new positions for fiscal year 2023 in research administration, grants and contracts accounting, and research integrity and compliance. additional positions may be added in coming years as the need arises. a more robust workforce with improved levels of servicing will allow georgia tech to better implement the strategic goals set by the commission on research next, as well as further the institute's mission to develop leaders who advance technology and improve the human condition. 
 ""the investments being made in the people and processes that drive research forward here at tech will enable us to fully serve the strategic research endeavors of the institute and ensure our enterprise can innovate and scale to its full potential,"" said tech's executive vice president for research chaouki abdallah. ""i am confident that the positive changes we are enacting will help the whole research enterprise to grow at a healthy rate."" 
 following recent internal reviews, the evpr's team worked in partnership with the office of the general counsel and the office of the vice president for administration and finance to review the institute's research administration functions. consulting firm deloitte also conducted an assessment that covered research administration, grants and contracts accounting, contracting, compliance, and pre- and post-award functions - centrally and across units - to help inform how to support growth of the research enterprise. 
 to increase the visibility of research, ensure research integrity, streamline processes, and improve the functionality of the evpr office overall - and in addition to the 19 positions mentioned above - a new leadership reporting structure and corresponding positions will be created. 
 a chief research operations officer (croo) will join the evpr office. that role will manage the newly created associate vice president of research integrity assurance and the vice president of research development and operations. the current position of vice president and general manager of the georgia tech research corporation (gtrc) and georgia tech applied research corporation (gtarc) will be split into two positions: associate vice president of research administration (also reporting to the croo) and general manager for gtrc and gtarc (reporting to the institute vice president for finance and planning). 
 ""at georgia tech, it's our people that make the innovative and groundbreaking research possible,"" said abdallah. ""by investing in our research infrastructure and creating more efficient processes, we ensure that all faculty and staff are fully supported as they carry on the work to improve the human condition."" 
 searches for the newly created positions will be announced in the coming weeks.

 on june 18, the 
 office of minority educational development 
 (omed) and three campus black student organizations partnered to host what are believed to be the first juneteenth recognition events at georgia tech, which included a virtual discussion and afternoon celebration on tech green. one day prior, just days after the u.s. senate passed a unanimous bill to establish june 19 as juneteenth national independence day, president joseph biden jr. signed it into law, making juneteenth the country's twelfth federal holiday. 
 juneteenth is the oldest nationally celebrated commemoration of the ending of slavery in the united states. on june 19, 1865, a union general rode into galveston, texas, to announce that the civil war had ended -- and black slaves had been freed. though the emancipation proclamation became law in january 1863, it could not be enforced in places still under confederate control. 
 juneteenth has been celebrated across texas and other parts of the country for years. however, following nationwide protests in 2020 over police brutality and the deaths of george floyd, breonna taylor, ahmaud arbery, and other black americans, there has been a renewed interest in the day that celebrates freedom for the last of black american slaves. 
 the virtual conversation featured a keynote and presentation entitled  juneteenth and the black digital  by 
 andré brock , associate professor in the school of literature, media, and communication. 
 ""i've been invited to discuss juneteenth and its importance on the occasion of its first-ever federal holiday to mark the event,"" brock opened. ""today, using my research on blackness and digital media, i'd like to offer a way to contextualize where we find ourselves as we begin this double-holiday weekend,"" he continued, offering a nod to father's day which followed the day after juneteenth. 
 brock's scholarship includes published articles on racial representations in videogames, blackness, and digital technoculture, as well as groundbreaking research on "" black twitter ."" he recently 
 received a sub-grant to further interdisciplinary research 
 into issues of race, difference, and computation. 
 ""we should also remember it [juneteenth] is black folks making something out of nothing; a moment of rest to mark the dismantling of an apartheid state -- and its love for slave labor -- and we have continued to celebrate that moment, even as our ancestors endured reconstruction, the nadir [considered a particularly brutal period in african american history, spanning the end of reconstruction in 1877 through the early 20th century] and the piece-by-piece construction of jim crow laws."" 
 brock's rousing presentation was followed by a question-answer session between the scholar and his virtual audience. 
 later that afternoon, omed hosted a celebration on tech green complete with food, games, comradery, faculty, staff, and students - including several georgia tech men's basketball and football team members -- and tabling by organizations including delta sigma theta and zeta phi beta sororities and omega psi phi and phi beta sigma fraternities. 
 the day was supported by partnership with the african student association, the georgia tech caribbean student organization, and the 
 african american student union , the institute's oldest black student organization.

 the selection of a first-line chemotherapy drug to treat many types of cancer is often a clear-cut decision governed by standard-of-care protocols, but what drug should be used next if the first one fails? 
 that's where georgia institute of technology researchers believe their new open source decision support tool could come in. using machine learning to analyze rna expression tied to information about patient outcomes with specific drugs, the open source tool could help clinicians chose the chemotherapy drug most likely to attack the disease in individual patients. 
 in a study using rna analysis data from 152 patient records, the system predicted the chemotherapy drug that had provided the best outcome 80 percent of the time. the researchers believe the system's accuracy could further improve with inclusion of additional patient records along with information such as family history and demographics. 
 ""by looking at rna expression in tumors, we believe we can predict with high accuracy which patients are likely to respond to a particular drug,"" said 
 john mcdonald , a professor in the georgia tech 
 school of biological sciences 
 and director of its 
 integrated cancer research center . ""this information could be used, along with other factors, to support the decisions clinicians must make regarding chemotherapy treatment."" 
 the research, which could add another component to precision medicine for cancer treatment, was reported november 6 in the journal 
 scientific reports . the work was supported in part by the atlanta-based ovarian cancer institute, the georgia research alliance, and a national institutes of health fellowship. 
 as with other machine learning decision support tools, the researchers first ""trained"" their system using one part of a data set, then tested its operation on the remaining records. in developing the system, the researchers obtained records of rna from tumors, along with with the outcome of treatment with specific drugs. with only about 152 such records available, they first used data from 114 records to train the system. they then used the remaining 38 records to test the system's ability to predict, based on the rna sequence, which chemotherapy drugs would have been the most likely to be useful in shrinking tumors. 
 the research began with ovarian cancer, but to expand the data set, the research team decided to include data from other cancer types - lung, breast, liver and pancreatic cancers - that use the same chemotherapy drugs and for which the rna data was available. ""our model is predicting based on the drug and looking across all the patients who were treated with that drug regardless of cancer type,"" mcdonald said. 
 the system produces a chart comparing the likelihood that each drug will have an effect on a patient's specific cancer. if the system were to be used in a clinical setting, mcdonald believes doctors would use the predictions along with other critical patient information. 
 because it measures the expression levels for genes, analysis of rna could have an advantage over sequencing of dna, though both types of information could be useful in choosing a drug therapy, he said. the cost of rna analysis is declining and could soon cost less than a mammogram, mcdonald said. 
 the system will be made available as open source software, and mcdonald's team hopes hospitals and cancer centers will try it out. ultimately, the tool's accuracy should improve as more patient data is analyzed by the algorithm. he and his collaborators believe the open source approach offers the best path to moving the algorithm into clinical use. 
 ""to really get this into clinical practice, we think we've got to open it up so that other people can try it, modify if they want to, and demonstrate its value in real-world situations,"" mcdonald said. ""we are trying to create a different paradigm for cancer therapy using the kind of open source strategy used in internet technology."" 
 open source coding allows many experts across multiple fields to review the software, identify faults and recommend improvements, said 
 fredrik vannberg , an assistant professor in the georgia tech 
 school of biological sciences . ""most importantly, that means the software is no longer a black box where you can't see inside. the code is openly shared for anybody to improve and check for potential issues."" 
 vannberg envisions using the decision-support tool to create ""virtual tumor boards"" that would bring together broad expertise to examine rna data from patients worldwide. 
 ""the hope would be to provide this kind of analysis for any new cancer patient who has this kind of rna analysis done,"" he added. ""we could have a consensus of dozens of the smartest people in oncology and make them available for each patient's unique situation."" 
 the tool is available on the open source github repository for download and use. hospitals and cancer clinics may install the software and use it without sharing their results, but the researchers hope organizations using the software will help the system improve. 
 ""the accuracy of machine learning will improve not only as the amount of training data increases, but also as the diversity within that data increases,"" said evan clayton, a ph.d. student in the georgia tech school of biological sciences. ""there's potential for improvement by including dna data, demographic information and patient histories. the model will incorporate any information if it helps predict the success of specific drugs."" 
 in addition to those already mentioned, the research team included cai huang, lilya matyunina, and deette mcdonald from the georgia tech school of biological sciences, and benedict benigno from the georgia tech integrated cancer research center and the ovarian cancer institute. 
 support for the project came from the ovarian cancer institute, and equipment used was provided by the georgia research alliance. in addition, the national institutes of health supported a graduate fellowship.

optimizing-energy-29-million-award-will-help-reduce-fuel-use-forward-operating.txt,"optimizing energy: $2.9 million award will help reduce fuel use in forward operating bases 
 georgia tech researchers have received a $2.9 million award to help the department of defense reduce its use of fuel. 
 the u.s. marine corps is evaluating the use of alternative energy sources to provide power for its operations. this image shows an evaluation of photovoltaic panels in 2010. (photo: lance cpl. m.c. nerl) 
 jan 16, 2014 
 - atlanta, ga 
 delivering liquid fuel to energy-hungry forward operating bases can be both costly to the u.s. military and risky to those who transport the fuel. for those reasons, the u.s. department of defense (dod) wants to reduce liquid fuel consumption at these bases, by expanding the use of alternative energy sources and by improving energy efficiency. a $2.9 million cooperative agreement with the georgia institute of technology will advance that goal by developing information that military resource planners can use to optimize energy consumption depending on mission needs and local conditions. by developing, evaluating and integrating dynamic modeling and simulation tools for this task, the researchers will help the dod meet energy needs while reducing liquid fuel consumption and logistics support. the four-year project is part of the consortium for optimally resource-secure outposts (corso), a first-of-its-kind research consortium involving academia, industry and government laboratories. ""our role is to develop physics-based simulation approaches for a number of promising technologies that support heating, ventilation and air conditioning needs at these forward operating bases,"" said 
 yogendra joshi , a professor in georgia tech's 
 george w. woodruff school of mechanical engineering 
 and the project's principal investigator. ""these applications are the largest non-propulsion consumers of liquid fuels, though we will also look at other uses of energy."" supported by the dod's operational energy capabilities improvement fund through the office of naval research (onr), the project will also involve researchers at the national renewable energy laboratory (nrel), oak ridge national laboratory (ornl), dod laboratories, and a number of companies that are producing energy-related technologies. the consortium won't be developing new hardware, but will instead focus on how best to integrate existing technologies - including renewables where they meet other mission criteria. ""better energy options make our forces more flexible and adaptive in combat,"" said sharon e. burke, assistant secretary of defense for operational energy plans and programs. ""tapping academia and the national labs will give us access to a greater range of expertise in this dynamic area."" forward operating bases are typically located in remote areas far from reliable power grids. to carry out military missions and support the personnel there, u.s. marines in afghanistan consume 200,000 gallons of fuel per day, 
 sea power 
 magazine recently reported. air conditioning in the summer months can consume as much as 60 percent of a base's fuel. the consortium will focus a broad range of expertise on addressing these energy needs. ""this is a unique collaboration between the department of defense and the georgia institute of technology to develop modeling approaches to enhance the operational effectiveness and resource security of expeditionary outposts by reducing battlefield fuel consumption,"" said mark s. spector, program officer in the ship systems and engineering division of the office of naval research (onr). ""a key aspect of the georgia tech consortium will be their engagement with innovators who have not previously worked directly with the government. this effort is a critical piece of a larger effort led by the office of naval research in partnership with the department of energy's office of energy efficiency & renewable energy to determine the optimal balance of energy resources in an operational environment."" beyond heating, ventilation and air-conditioning, the bases typically need power for weapons systems. those systems often require large amounts of energy for short periods of time, while the hvac needs are more consistent over time. fresh water production and waste disposal also require energy. in optimizing the energy use, the researchers will have to take into account unique aspects of the forward operating bases. wind turbines, for example, might be attractive from an energy perspective in certain locations, but could attract unwanted attention. highly efficient hvac systems use less energy, but might be more difficult to transport because of their weight. ""the key issue is that these bases are off-grid, so you have to be able to store energy and supply it when needed,"" joshi noted. ""there is a lot of good work going on in terms of technologies that are already in the commercial world that might be useful in these unique conditions."" at georgia tech, the research team will include four faculty members from the college of engineering. in addition to joshi, who specializes in energy efficiency, they include: sam graham , a professor in the woodruff school of mechanical engineering, who will contribute expertise in solid-state lighting, photovoltaics and hybrid systems; paul kohl , a professor in the school of chemical and biomolecular engineering who specializes in energy storage systems and fuel cells, and satish kumar , a professor in the school of mechanical engineering who specializes in heat transfer, combustion and energy systems. among the technologies that will be studied are ground-coupled heat pumps. these devices take advantage of relatively constant subsurface temperatures to provide heating and cooling. because they take advantage of natural differences between surface and subsurface conditions, they can be more efficient than the liquid-fueled hvac systems the military has used. the team will also examine renewables, such as solar, and how they could be integrated with other energy sources. information about these energy sources will be integrated into large-scale system models already developed by nrel, joshi said. beyond academic and national lab resources, the consortium will identify and collaborate with companies that are developing energy technologies that may help the dod reach its goals. in particular, the consortium is seeking innovative ideas from small businesses and non-traditional defense contractors. ""we will find companies that have really compelling technologies for these outposts and we will then be able to provide test data on their technologies,"" joshi explained. ""the companies will also help with validating the models we develop."" the project will also include an educational component to share energy optimization information with dod planners and engineers through curriculum being developed by the naval postgraduate school. technology transfer could also use short-term moocs, which would reduce the need for dod personnel to travel to centralized classes. while the primary goal will be improved support for military bases, the project could also benefit large-scale humanitarian relief missions, which also must operate without grid electricity. ultimately, reducing the energy required to operate remote bases could impact the way future missions are carried out. ""optimizing energy consumption in these forward bases is an issue that could have major impacts going forward,"" joshi said. ""the mix of technologies that could be useful will shift and the overall approaches will shift. that's the kind of exciting research and development framework that we intend to bring to bear on this challenge."" research news georgia institute of technology 177 north avenue atlanta, georgia 30332-0181 media relations contacts : john toon ( jtoon@gatech.edu ) (404-894-6986) or brett israel ( brett.israel@comm.gatech.edu ) (404-385-1933) writer : john toon

 by merging the ancient art of origami with 21st century technology, researchers have created a one-step approach to fabricating complex origami structures whose light weight, expandability, and strength could have applications in everything from biomedical devices to equipment used in space exploration. until now, making such structures has involved multiple steps, more than one material, and assembly from smaller parts. 
 ""what we have here is the proof of concept of an integrated system for manufacturing complex origami. it has tremendous potential applications,"" said 
 glaucio h. paulino , the raymond allen jones chair and professor at the 
 school of civil and environmental engineering 
 at the georgia institute of technology and a leader in the growing field of origami engineering, or using the principles of origami, mathematics and geometry to make useful things. last fall georgia tech became the first university in the country to offer a course on origami engineering, which paulino taught. 
 the researchers used a relatively new kind of 3d printing called digital light processing (dlp) to create groundbreaking origami structures that are not only capable of holding significant weight but can also be folded and refolded repeatedly in an action similar to the slow push and pull of an accordion. when paulino first reported these structures, or ""zippered tubes,"" in 2015, they were made of paper and required gluing. in the current work, the zippered tubes - and complex structures made out of them - are composed of one plastic (a polymer) and do not require assembly. 
 the work was reported in a recent issue of 
 soft matter , a journal published by the royal society of chemistry. the primary authors are paulino; 
 h. jerry qi , the woodruff faculty fellow in georgia tech's 
 george w. woodruff school of mechanical engineering ; and daining fang of peking university and the beijing institute of technology. other authors are zeang zhao, a visiting student at georgia tech now at peking university; qiang zhang of peking university; and xiao kuang and jiangtao wu of georgia tech. 
 an emerging technology 
 there are many different types of 3d printing technologies. the most familiar, inkjet, has been around for some 20 years. but until now, it has been difficult to create 3d-printed structures with the intricate hollow features associated with complex origami because removing the supporting materials necessary to print these structures is challenging. further, unlike paper, the 3d-printed materials could not be folded numerous times without breaking. 
 enter dlp and some creative engineering. according to qi, a leader in the emerging field collaborating with fang's group at peking university, dlp has been in the lab for a while, but commercialization only began about five years ago. unlike other 3d printing techniques, it creates structures by printing successive layers of a liquid resin that is then cured, or hardened, by ultraviolet light. 
 for the current work, the researchers first developed a new resin that, when cured, is very strong. ""we wanted a material that is not only soft, but can also be folded hundreds of times without breaking,"" said qi.  the resin, in turn, is key to an equally important element of the work: tiny hinges. these hinges, which occur along the creases where the origami structure folds, allow folding because they are made of a thinner layer of resin than the larger panels of which they are part. (the panels make up the bulk of the structure.) 
 together the new resin and hinges worked. the team used dlp to create several origami structures ranging from the individual origami cells that the zippered tubes are composed of to a complex bridge composed of many zippered tubes. all were subjected to tests that showed they were not only capable of carrying about 100 times the weight of the origami structure, but also could be repeatedly folded and unfolded without breaking. ""i have a piece that i printed about six months ago that i demonstrate for people all the time, and it's still fine,"" said qi. 
 what's next? 
 what's next? among other things, qi is working to make the printing even easier while also exploring ways to print materials with different properties. meanwhile, paulino's team recently created a new origami pattern on the computer that he is excited about but that he has been unable to physically make because it is so complex. ""i think the new system could bring it to life,"" he said. 
 the principal funders of the work were the air force office of scientific research (fa9550-16-1-0169), the national science foundation (cmmi-1462894, cmmi-1462895, and cmmi-1538830), the raymond allen jones chair at georgia tech, the national natural science foundation of china, and the national materials genome project of china.

 ever search desperately for something, then realize you were looking straight at it the whole time? research indicates that vision is controlled by the part of the brain associated with thinking. and in sight, too, it can be absent minded. 
 brain image from a functional mri scan during tests on the role of the frontal cortex in vision. it's the part of the brain known for being the ""thinking cap.""

 a sportscaster lunges forward and blurts out, ""interception! drew brees threw the ball right into the opposing linebacker's hands! like he didn't even see him!"" the quarterback likely actually did not see the defender standing right in front of him, said dobromir rahnev, a psychologist at the georgia institute of technology.  rahnev leads a research team making new discoveries about how the brain organizes visual perception, including how it leaves things out even when they're plainly in sight. rahnev and researchers from the university of california, berkeley have come up with a rough map of the frontal cortex's role in controlling vision. they published their findings on monday, may 9, 2016 
 in the journal proceedings of the national academy of sciences . thinking cap the frontal cortex is often seen as our ""thinking cap,"" the part of the brain scientists associate with thinking and making decisions. but it's not commonly connected with vision. ""some people believe that the frontal cortex is not involved,"" said 
 rahnev, an assistant professor at the school of psychology . the new research adds to previous evidence that it is, he said. the lack of association with that part of the brain may have to do with the fact it's other parts that transform information coming from the eyes into sight and others still that make sense of it by doing things like identifying objects in it. but the thinking cap of the brain controls and oversees this whole process, making it as essential to how we see as those other areas, rahnev said. how that works also accounts for why we sometimes miss things right in front of us. a camera it's not ""we feel that our vision is like a camera, but that is utterly wrong,"" rahnev said.  ""our brains aren't just seeing, they're actively constructing the visual scene and making decisions about it.""  sometimes the frontal cortex isn't expecting to see something, so although it's in plain sight, it blots it out of consciousness. to test out the fontal cortex's involvement in vision, the researchers ran a two-part experiment. first, they observed which regions of the brain -- in particular the frontal cortex -- lit up with activity while healthy volunteers completed visual tasks corresponding to three basic stages of conscious visual perception. second, they inhibited those same regions using magnetic stimulation to confirm their involvement in each visual stage. believing is part of seeing the first stage of the visual perception the researchers tested for was selection, rahnev said. that's when the brain picks out part of the vast array of available visual stimuli to actually pay attention to. in the case of the football quarterback, this might mean focusing on the route the receiver takes. the second stage is combination, he said. the brain merges the visual information it processed with other material. ""the quarterback's brain is putting what he actually sees together with expectations based on the play he called,"" rahnev said. then comes evaluation. the quarterback needs to decide whether to release the ball given everything he has processed. expecting a blocker to stop the defending player (which didn't happen), he may have blotted him out of perception and thrown the ball right at him. interception. ""the frontal cortex sends a signal to move your attention onto the object you select,"" rahnev said. ""it does some of the combining with other information, and then it's probably the primary evaluator of what you think you saw."" simple vision brain map in experiments, during a functional mri scan, different parts of the frontal cortex of the participants lit up, corresponding to each vision function. the back of the frontal cortex activated during selection; its midsection lit up during combination, and the front, or anterior, part cranked up during evaluation. that's how the researchers arrived at a kind of vision map of the frontal cortex. ""it's a rudimentary map,"" rahnev said. ""a very simple one that just says, ‘this is the back. this in the middle. this is the front.'"" the critical evidence the critical evidence for this map came from the use of magnetic stimulation. when the researchers used it to inhibit the back and middle of the frontal cortex separately, subjects became less able to complete the corresponding functions of selection and combination. when they stimulated the front, the opposite happened. subjects were slightly but significantly better able to evaluate the accuracy of what they think they saw. ""this is a really clear demonstration of the role that the frontal cortex, which is usually seen as the seat of thought, plays in controlling vision."" sorry, officer! and there is a practical takeaway for health and safety. instead of the quarterback telling the coach, ""i swear i didn't see that coming,"" often it's motorists telling police officers the same thing after a car accident. distraction is often the culprit, because it overtaxes the organization of perception, rahnev said. these three functions are going on all the time in multiple scenarios in our brains while they process the world around us. but add too much to the pile, like texting behind the wheel, rahnev said, and ""you can run right into a parked car without ever seeing it."" derek evan nee, justin riddle, alina sue larson and mark d'esposito from the university of california, berkeley, co-authored the research paper. the national institutes of health funded the research under grants mh63901 and ns79698.

 researchers have developed a paper-based flexible supercapacitor that could be used to help power wearable devices.

 using a simple layer-by-layer coating technique, researchers from the u.s. and korea have developed a paper-based flexible supercapacitor that could be used to help power wearable devices. the device uses metallic nanoparticles to coat cellulose fibers in the paper, creating supercapacitor electrodes with high energy and power densities - and the best performance so far in a textile-based supercapacitor. 
 by implanting conductive and charge storage materials in the paper, the technique creates large surface areas that function as current collectors and nanoparticle reservoirs for the electrodes. testing shows that devices fabricated with the technique can be folded thousands of times without affecting conductivity. 
 ""this type of flexible energy storage device could provide unique opportunities for connectivity among wearable and internet of things devices,"" said 
 seung woo lee , an assistant professor in the 
 woodruff school of mechanical engineering 
 at the georgia institute of technology. ""we could support an evolution of the most advanced portable electronics. we also have an opportunity to combine this supercapacitor with energy-harvesting devices that could power biomedical sensors, consumer and military electronics, and similar applications."" 
 the research, done with collaborators at korea university, was supported by the national research foundation of korea and reported september 14 in the journal 
 nature communications . 
 energy storage devices are generally judged on three properties: their energy density, power density and cycling stability. supercapacitors often have high power density, but low energy density - the amount of energy that can be stored - compared to batteries, which often have the opposite attributes. in developing their new technique, lee and collaborator jinhan cho from the department of chemical and biological engineering at korea university set out to boost energy density of the supercapacitors while maintaining their high power output. 
 they began by dipping paper samples into a beaker of solution containing an amine surfactant material designed to bind the gold nanoparticles to the paper. next they dipped the paper into a solution containing gold nanoparticles. because the fibers are porous, the surfactants and nanoparticles enter the fibers and become strongly attached, creating a conformal coating on each fiber. 
 by repeating the dipping steps, the researchers created a conductive paper on which they added alternating layers of metal oxide energy storage materials such as manganese oxide. the ligand-mediated layer-by-layer approach helped minimize the contact resistance between neighboring metal and / or metal oxide nanoparticles. using the simple process done at room temperatures, the layers can be built up to provide the desired electrical properties. 
 ""it's basically a very simple process,"" lee said. ""the layer-by-layer process, which we did in alternating beakers, provides a good conformal coating on the cellulose fibers. we can fold the resulting metallized paper and otherwise flex it without damage to the conductivity."" 
 though the research involved small samples of paper, the solution-based technique could likely be scaled up using larger tanks or even a spray-on technique. ""there should be no limitation on the size of the samples that we could produce,"" lee said. ""we just need to establish the optimal layer thickness that provides good conductivity while minimizing the use of the nanoparticles to optimize the tradeoff between cost and performance."" 
 the researchers demonstrated that their self-assembly technique improves several aspects of the paper supercapacitor, including its areal performance, an important factor for measuring flexible energy-storage electrodes. the maximum power and energy density of the metallic paper-based supercapacitors are estimated to be 15.1 mw / cm2 and 267.3 uw / cm2, respectively, substantially outperforming conventional paper or textile supercapacitors. 
 the next steps will include testing the technique on flexible fabrics, and developing flexible batteries that could work with the supercapacitors. the researchers used gold nanoparticles because they are easy to work with, but plan to test less expensive metals such as silver and copper to reduce the cost. 
 during his ph.d. work, lee developed the layer-by-layer self-assembly process for energy storage using different materials. with his korean collaborators, he saw a new opportunity to apply that to flexible and wearable devices with nanoparticles. 
 ""we have nanoscale control over the coating applied to the paper,"" he added. ""if we increase the number of layers, the performance continues to increase. and it's all based on ordinary paper."" 
 in addition to those already mentioned, the research team included yongmin ko and minseong kwon from korea university, wan ki bae from the photoelectronic hybrids research center at the korea institute of science and technology, and byeongyong lee from georgia tech. 
 this work was supported by national research foundation (nrf) grants funded by the korean government (nrf-2015r1a2a1a01004354 and nrf-2016m3a7b4910619).

 georgia tech employees, like jerushia graham, often contribute their time and talents to the greater atlanta community. graham, museum coordinator for the 
 robert c. williams museum of papermaking , recently created a digital billboard as part of 
 local stories , an initiative that presents lesser-known facts about downtown atlanta's rich history. 
 graham's work honors the leadership and legacy of john wesley dobbs, a political activist and the unofficial ""mayor"" of atlanta's auburn avenue during the first half of the 20th century, through papercutting and animation. 
 ""the graphic quality of papercuts requires a whittling down of visual information to the essential details,"" she said. ""after careful consideration, i settled on directing the viewer's attention to dobbs' role in mobilizing the black vote because his voter registration efforts made concrete and lasting changes."" 
 graham's digital billboard, entitled 
 legacy: john wesley dobbs, 
 is reminiscent of vintage postcards and posters. the design choice is an intentional nod by graham to dobbs' many years of service as a postal officer. the u.s. postal service, one of the few institutions in the u.s. with an integrated workforce at the time, was arguably one of the largest employers of african americans. dobbs would ultimately be promoted to a supervisory role over both black and white employees. 
 ""although 
 legacy 
 is technically a digital billboard, i personally think of it as a postcard from me to each and every viewer reminding them and myself that our lives leave an impact,"" graham said. ""i ask that we invest in one another, engage with the history of atlanta, and participate in the decisions that govern our lives by voting."" 
 local stories are displayed monthly on the digital sign at margaret mitchell square (140 peachtree st. nw).

 from shipping and construction to outer space, origami could put a folded twist on structural engineering. researchers from the university of illinois at urbana-champaign, the georgia institute of technology and the university of tokyo have developed a new ""zippered tube"" configuration that makes paper structures stiff enough to hold weight yet able to fold flat for easy shipping and storage. their method could be applied to other thin materials, such as plastic or metal, to transform structures ranging from furniture and buildings to microscopic robots. illinois graduate researcher evgueni filipov, georgia tech professor glaucio paulino and university of tokyo professor tomohiro tachi published their work september 7 in the journal 
 proceedings of the national academy of sciences . origami structures would be useful in many engineering and everyday applications, such as a robotic arm that could reach out and scrunch up, a construction crane that could fold to pick up or deliver a load, or pop-up furniture. paulino sees particular potential for quick-assembling emergency shelters, bridges and other infrastructure in the wake of a natural disaster. ""origami became more of an objective for engineering and a science just in the last five years or so,"" filipov said. ""a lot of it was driven by space exploration, to be able to launch structures compactly and deploy them in space. but we're starting to see how it has potential for a lot of different fields of engineering. you could prefabricate something in a factory, ship it compactly and deploy it on site."" the researchers use a particular origami technique called miura-ori folding. they make precise, zig-zag folded strips of paper, then glue two strips together to make a tube. while the single strip of paper is highly flexible, the tube is stiffer and does not fold in as many directions. the researchers tried coupling tubes in different configurations to see if that added to the structural stiffness of the paper structures. they found that interlocking two tubes in zipper-like fashion made them much stiffer and harder to twist or bend. the structure folds up flat, yet rapidly and easily expands to the rigid tube configuration. ""the geometry is what really plays a role,"" paulino said. ""we are putting two tubes together in a strange way. what we want is a structure that is flexible and stiff at the same time. this is just paper, but it has tremendous stiffness."" the zipper configuration works even with tubes that have different angles of folding. by combining tubes with different geometries, the researchers can make many different three-dimensional structures, such as a bridge, a canopy or a tower. ""the ability to change functionality in real time is a real advantage in origami,"" filipov said. ""by having these transformable structures, you can change their functionality and make them adaptable. they are reconfigurable. you can change the material characteristics: you can make them stiffer or softer depending on the intended use."" the team uses paper prototypes to demonstrate how a thin, flexible sheet can be folded into functional structures, but their techniques could be applied to other thin materials, filipov said. larger-scale applications could combine metal or plastic panels with hinges. next, the researchers plan to explore new combinations of tubes with different folding angles to build new structures. they also hope to apply their techniques to other materials and explore applications from large-scale construction to microscopic structures for biomedical devices or robotics. ""all of these ideas apply from the nanoscale and microscale up to large scales and even structures that nasa would deploy into space,"" paulino said. ""depending on your interest, the applications i think are endless. we have just scratched the surface. once you have a powerful concept, which we think the zipper coupling is, you can explore applications in many different areas."" the national science foundation supported this work. research news georgia institute of technology 177 north avenue atlanta, georgia 30332-0181 usa media relations contacts : georgia tech: john toon ( jtoon@gatech.edu ) (404-894-6986) or university of illinois: liz ahlberg, ( eahlberg@illinois.edu ) (217-244-1073). writer : liz ahlberg, university of illinois at urbana-champaign

 ""i'm excited to have this wonderful group join the i&s team,"" said maria cimilluca, vice president of i&s. ""this move is a great fit with the i&s portfolio of services, and pts will be a strong partner as we work together to implement strategic, sustainable, and resilient transit operations across campus."" 
 pts moves from student engagement and well-being to i&s to better align departments and services with the institute's strategic goals in sustainability. transit is critical to the future of georgia tech, which aims to provide more sustainable service offerings to the campus community. the addition of pts to the i&s portfolio complements and advances several of the institute's strategic goals and efforts for which i&s is responsible. these include the sustainability next plan, the comprehensive campus plan, and the living campus initiative. in addition, pts leadership values operational strategies that prioritize sustainability, exceptional service, and responsible fiscal stewardship. this is evident with their transition one year ago to a self-operation model and the recent addition of fuel-efficient, hybrid vehicles to the stinger bus fleet. 
 as the pts team transitions to i&s, they will report temporarily to jerel harris, assistant vice president for environmental health and safety, until a permanent reporting structure is established. to help ensure a smooth transition, no changes to pts's organizational structure or service offerings will happen until the pts team is fully integrated and is able to take part in long-term visioning and goal-setting.

 - warner robins, ga 
 the  partnership for inclusive innovation , a public-private organization designed to position georgia as the leader for innovation, opportunity, and shared economic success, today announced the winners of the 2022  georgia smart communities challenge , at central georgia technical college in warner robins. 
 the award-winning georgia smart communities challenge supports teams of applied researchers, municipalities, and nonprofit groups to work together over the course of the year on locally driven priorities ranging from installing sea level sensors for hurricane resilience to building digital twins for public safety and transportation. 
 the 2022 theme, smart resilience, sought projects that address topics including disaster response, energy efficiency, and public safety. 
 ""this year, we add four communities from across georgia, spanning three economic development districts and including multi-disciplinary researchers from georgia tech, the university of georgia, kennesaw state university, morehouse school of medicine, middle georgia state university, clayton state university, and augusta university,"" said stephanie broxton, the partnership's community research manager. 
 ""the selected communities submitted strong multi-disciplinary, multi-university research project proposals that aim to advance innovation by leveraging technology and data. communities from throughout georgia were selected to ensure impact across the state."" 
 each of the projects will receive financial and technical assistance to support and continue the work of implementing applied research from university partners, as well as assistance from the partnership for monthly meetings, community engagement, and promotion of project outcomes. 
 ""georgia tech is a proud member of the partnership for inclusive innovation,"" ángel cabrera, president of georgia tech, said. ""we're truly committed to creating opportunities for all georgians to drive innovation and to make georgia the tech capital of the east coast. 
 cabrera congratulated the georgia smart winners and added, ""this work is sure to create lasting transformative change, not just for the winning communities, but also for their neighbors and everyone who benefits from this research in the future."" 
 the 2022 cohort communities and projects are: 
 city of atlanta : the project will use innovative diagnostic techniques to perform energy audits in atlanta's thomasville heights community, with the goal of achieving significant cost savings compared to traditional building energy auditing practices. the audits are done with minimally invasive drones equipped with remote sensing instruments to analyze building exteriors. the method holds promise for overcoming homeowner hesitancy about weatherization programs and can be replicated in distressed neighborhoods throughout the city. the project is especially timely in the thomasville heights community, where ongoing challenges such as acute unemployment and poverty will soon be compounded by the closure of long-neglected subsidized housing. researchers from georgia tech and morehouse college, and representatives from focused community strategies will work with the city of atlanta on this project. 
 ""we are currently supporting neighborhood stabilization in thomasville heights,"" said dr. latrice rollings, assistant professor for community health and preventive medicine at morehouse school of medicine. this project will allow ""us to use utility rebates and bulk purchasing as solutions for poverty amelioration and will reduce the cost of energy."" 
 athens-clarke county : the climate resilience project through technology and transportation innovation will evaluate and improve community preparedness in response to the growing severity of environmental disaster and the region's increasing population. the project will include the development and deployment of a survey to gauge existing disaster preparedness and resident interest in improving preparedness in their communities. leaders will engage with the community to create an all-hazards mitigation plan, neighborhood disaster playbook template, and strengthened neighborhood-level resource and relationship network. the goal is to minimize risk and work toward providing equitable outcomes for all members of the community in the event of a catastrophic disaster. researchers from the university of georgia, augusta university, and kennesaw state university will work with athens-clarke county on this project. 
 ""athens-clarke county is dedicated to building a culture of readiness and resiliency for all of our residents,"" said mayor kelly girtz. ""through this partnership, i believe we will make athens-clarke county a safer, strong, and adaptable place to live."" 
 the  henry county  smart resilience decision support tool (dst) will be an interactive web-based tool to assist county planners, policymakers, and county officials as they assess and explore the impact and potential of new greenspace, warehousing, and freight-related infrastructure projects. the tool will help county officials answer the question: how can henry county reconcile community economic development objectives with quality of life and energy resilience concerns? researchers from georgia tech and clayton state university will work with henry county on this project. 
 ""we are so excited and honored that henry county has been chosen to receive the georgia smart award,"" said carlotta harrell, chair of the henry county board of commissioners. ""we continue to look for ways to improve and enhance transportation for henry county residents and this continued partnership with georgia smart allows us to do just that."" 
 city of warner robins :  the project will develop and test a citizen safety digital twin for community resilience through the integration of a dynamic license plate reader solution with police department investigation practices. the project team will build on previous work to refine an interface that enables the police department to see where crimes are predicted to occur and suggest placement of license plate readers to detect them. the team will engage with the community and key stakeholders to collect and analyze feedback about the system. this project will help warner robins to maximize both deterrence and detection, with the aim of lowering crime rates across the city. researchers from georgia tech and middle georgia state university will work with the city of warner robins on this project. 
 ""police departments are under-resourced and understaffed around the nation,"" warner robins mayor larhonda patrick said. ""the use of technology has been a force multiplier to reduce crime. this grant will give chief [john] wagner and the entire police department team the tools they need to provide public safety for our city. this is proactive crime prevention."" 
 the georgia smart communities challenge has a strong track record of success. alumni have implemented their projects and garnered additional funding and technical assistance to continue projects beyond the two-year program period, allowing them to continue serving their residents and meeting community goals. 
 ""as an initial georgia smart partner and long-time supporter of the partnership, georgia power is proud to support innovation across the state through this announcement of a new cohort of georgia smart communities,"" chris womack, chair, president and ceo of georgia power said at the event. ""this cohort of georgia smart community projects is unique because it is inclusive, it supports multi-disciplinary and multi-university projects, and it fosters collaboration, with all communities working toward smart resilience initiatives.""

 warner robins, woodstock, and columbus, georgia, recognized with smart community awards 
 mar 28, 2024 
 warner robins' 
 citizen safety digital twin for community resilience and 
 woodstock's 
 smart master plan and smart corridor study were recognized at the 
 2024 taipei smart city summit and expo 
 with the intelligent community forum's 
 smart21 community award . 
 at the same time, 
 columbus 
 was named a 
 smart 20 award 
 winner by smart cities connect for the 
 digital twin river safety project . that award will be presented in may. 
 ""these accolades are a testament to the partnership's pivotal role in developing, nurturing, steering, and funding these projects from conception to triumphant completion,"" said debra lam, the partnership's director. the partnership is comprised of several private and public sector entities and is supported by georgia tech's 
 enterprise innovation  institute . 
 the warner robins project to develop and test a citizen safety digital twin for community resilience integrated a dynamic license plate reader solution with police department investigation practices to help lower crime rates in the community. working with researchers from 
 georgia tech 
 and 
 middle georgia state university , the warner robins police department used historical crime data to determine the optimal location and direction to place license plate reader cameras. during the six-month pilot phase of the project, the data helped recover 27 stolen vehicles and solve three major crimes - a shooting and two homicides. 
 ""it's one of the best investments i think we can make as a city because it brings the peace of mind of safe streets, safe communities, safe shopping experience. the fact that we have our flock cameras in different areas in our city with the smart technology to expand the footprint of our police department helps us solve crime and also helps deter crime, which is even more beneficial."" warner robins mayor larhonda patrick said. 
 the woodstock project dates back to 2020, when the city worked with the partnership on a master plan and smart corridor study to help alleviate the traffic and lack of parking in the city, following a doubling of the population since 2010. 
 in that first part of the project, the city collected data from gridsmart installations, which document minute-by-minute traffic and turning movements. in the second phase, interns from the partnership examined the data to find ways to integrate it with previously collected traffic volume flows to show historical patterns. the goal is to determine the best way to amalgamate the data for use in making smart decisions about new transportation projects. 
 ""woodstock is honored to be among this diverse list of communities, and we are proud to represent the state of georgia with fellow honoree warner robins,"" said mayor michael caldwell. ""the city of woodstock is committed to improving its citizens' quality of life through smart technology programs. from transportation systems to innovative infrastructure technology, the city has been boldly pursuing the initiatives of its smart master plan since 2020."" 
 the 
 columbus 
 project's goal is to make the world's longest manmade urban whitewater course safer for swimmers and boaters. scheduled and unscheduled dam releases have caused flooding, limited time for evacuations, and drownings. a digital twin created for the river allowed georgia tech and columbus state university researchers to collaborate and develop technology that can predict changing water levels, detect humans in the water, and alert authorities. 
 ""i think to win the award is awesome, but the impetus was to promote river safety and provide real-time smart solutions that save lives,"" said james forrest toelle, ph.d., information technology director for columbus consolidated government, and the project manager for the digital twin project. ""none of it would have been possible without the tremendous partnership with georgia tech, the partnership, and our local fire department."" 
 it was an incredibly valuable opportunity to develop public safety digital twins together with collaborators in columbus and warner robins, said john taylor, frederick law olmsted professor in georgia tech's school of civil and environmental engineering, ""it is particularly rewarding to see the research being implemented to help save 
 lives and reduce crimes in real communities. these smart community awards are important recognition of the forward thinking vision and dedication to public safety of these communities."" 
 t hese three international wins follow the selection of valdosta as a finalist in the 
 2021 world smart cities awards in the mobility category 
 for its 
 traffic monitoring and communication system to improved safety, connectivity, and efficiency 
 project that has reduced the time it takes for first responders to travel the city. 
 ""these projects exemplify the transformative power of technology and community engagement in creating safer, more enjoyable, and more resilient communities,"" lam said. ""this remarkable success rate is a clear indicator of our role in nurturing a vibrant ecosystem for innovations-placing georgia firmly on the map for smart cities.""

 growing up, rohan sohani dreamed of becoming a pilot. while a heart murmur impeded the outgoing sga president's plans, he didn't let it stop him from finding his way into the skies. 
 may 03, 2023 
 for some, commencement may feel like a plane's wheels hitting the runway, signaling an end to a journey. but, for rohan sohani, it's just the beginning of a flight plan. 
 growing up, the johns creek, georgia, native was awestruck as he traveled with his family. not by the destination but by the travel itself - from navigating the airport to sitting in the window seat looking out from 30,000 feet. as a college student picking a major, sohani was guided by his love for flying, math, and science to choose 
 aerospace engineering . 
 this week, he will graduate from georgia tech before moving to washington to become an aircraft-level integration engineer for boeing's 777 program. ""georgia tech has always been a shining light and represents what i see as the gold standard, especially in the aerospace industry, and once i got in, it was a no-brainer to come back home,"" he said. 
 when he arrived here as a second-year transfer student from purdue university, sohani was searching for a sense of community. he quickly found what he was looking for, joining the undergraduate student government association (sga) as a member of the finance committee. 
 drawing on his own experience, sohani worked to improve community building and academic resources for transfer students. he rose through the organization's ranks as vice president of academic affairs before being elected as the sga president his senior year -- the first transfer student to serve in the role. during his tenure, sga exceeded pre-pandemic levels of funding allocations to student groups, while also expanding georgia tech's crisis housing center. 
 he may be elated to pass the baton to the incoming sga president, but sohani never took his opportunity for granted as he worked behind the scenes to advocate on behalf of the student body and strived to elevate as many voices as he could along the way. 
 ""i hope my legacy at sga will be that i always prioritized students,"" he said. ""i had the privilege of being in meetings that most students won't see, so it was important to me to think of who is missing from the table and what perspectives are missing."" 
 sohani worked with the office of institute relations to convey students' priorities to the state legislature as well as georgia's representatives in congress during a trip to the nation's capital earlier this year. in addition to his work with student organizations, sohani spent his summers interning with nasa developing exercise software for the artemis program, and with tesla as an interior designer. 
 while his day job after graduation will keep him on the ground, sohani has proven that he'll find his way into the sky. born with a heart murmur, sohani's dream of becoming a professional pilot was thwarted at a young age, but that didn't stop him from chasing the thrill of flying. beginning in middle school, sohani attended aviation camps at the university of georgia. by 16, he was flying on his own, having earned his private pilot's license, and through centennial aviation, sohani regularly takes to the skies to unwind. 
 ""as soon as i take off, whether i'm just flying around atlanta or to the beach, that's the only thing that i'm focused on. i get to forget about everything else that's on the ground and just put that to the side. i'll put some music and sunglasses on and just cruise through the air,"" he said. 
 sohani underwent a heart valve replacement nearly a year ago. as he emerged from the surgery, he was reminded of the community that surrounds him at georgia tech. his parents received a call from president ángel cabrera, along with an outpouring of support from members of his cabinet as well as classmates and faculty members. 
 ""the support that i got from the administration and faculty was something that i really appreciate, and i think it goes to show just how much georgia tech cares about its students,"" he said. 
 before he begins his work at boeing in june, sohani will have plenty of time to peer out of airplane windows when he travels to europe for two weeks, visiting 16 cities and over 100 locations. 
 when sohani arrived at tech, he had to reach outside of his comfort zone to find the community he was looking for. his advice to incoming students or those still searching for ways to get involved is to try everything that tech has to offer - because the sky is the limit.

 peanut growers could someday identify emerging threats such as drought, pests or disease by testing a plant's ""chemical breath.""

 peanut growers could someday identify emerging threats such as drought, pests or disease by testing a plant's ""chemical breath."" 
 from dawn to dusk, peanut plants emit volatile organic compounds (vocs) that vary in types and patterns depending on how they respond to various stresses. growers typically rely on indirect monitoring methods such as soil moisture testing to assess the health of plants in their fields. but directly testing stress response could be faster more accurate and offer a wider range of diagnoses. now scientists are working on gas-collection devices that growers could deploy in fields or on plants. 
 ""we want to learn the best ways to detect and measure gases that could correlate to various plant conditions such as drought,"" said wayne daley, associate division chief and principal research engineer with the 
 agricultural technology research program 
 at the 
 georgia tech research institute 
 (gtri). 
 about 1.67 million acres of peanuts were harvested in the u.s. in 2017, according to the u.s. department of agriculture - 160,000 in florida and 850,000 in georgia. peanuts are a $2.2 billion crop in georgia, accounting for 23 percent of the state's row and forage crop income, according to the georgia peanut commission. 
 daley and his co-investigators are collaborating with diane rowland, barry tillman and alina zare, all affiliated faculty of the university of florida's center for stress resilient agriculture, to identify and design collection methods for vocs in an outdoor field site, an environmental chamber and a greenhouse in florida. the gtri team includes chemists judy song and dan sabo and data scientists olga kemenova and milad navaei. 
 ""this type of advanced technology is what is critically needed for our growers to remain economically viable,"" said rowland, professor of physiology at the university of florida. ""resource use efficiency in farming, including rapidly responding to counteract stress events such as drought, is the key not only to environmental stewardship, but also for remaining profitable under rising input costs."" 
 still, detecting relevant gases in the field remains a giant challenge. 
 ""peanut plants release vocs at very low concentrations that are difficult to measure,"" said daley. ""we want to learn which vocs are significant and tell us about stresses that are of interest to growers."" in a previous study, daley and other gtri scientists learned that voc signatures are different among peanut plants at various degrees of drought intensity. 
 during the 2017 growing season, gtri researchers placed glass rods coated with gas-absorbent material near peanut plants. the rods were taken to the lab and excited to release the absorbed gases, which were identified and measured. but a field site is a complex environment with many confounding factors. 
 now the researchers are evaluating this gas-measurement technique to study peanut plants grown in controlled lab conditions. 
 during the 2017 growing season, researchers from university of florida collected the field data from peanut plants using polydimethylsiloxane-coated stir bars (twisters). the collected gases were sent to gtri for identification and analysis using a thermal desorption unit. 
 now the researchers are evaluating this gas-measurement technique to study peanut plants grown in controlled lab conditions. 
 a peanut plant's seasonal growth stages affect the amounts and types of vocs it releases. even the time of day affects these emissions. 
 ""we are building an environmental chamber in which we can mimic the humidity, lighting, and nutrients of a natural field on a florida day from the morning to evening with appropriate humidity,"" said daley. ""this is the first step to test and evaluate the gas measurement technique in controlled conditions. once we know more about its performance and how to apply it, then we'll take it to the university of florida to be studied with plants in a greenhouse."" 
 the team is developing a baseline of peanut voc ""families"" that could be identified in the environmental chamber. each peanut stressor also could be associated with a distinct family of vocs. for instance, researchers could simulate a drought in the chamber to study the associated vocs. but there may be background families of vocs that compete with or confuse a drought gas test. 
 ""we need to understand how the peanut plant responds to both health and stress conditions to be able to fully utilize vocs for drought detection"" said sabo, a gtri research scientist. 
 ""we are investigating how interference gases compete for space on the absorbent material,"" said song, a gtri senior research engineer. ""the experiment in the environmental chamber will be able to help us gain an understanding of how these interference gases and stressed-based vocs interact and interfere with one another. with this knowledge we will be able to make accurate and meaningful measurements."" 
 once researchers understand the ambient complexity of an outdoor peanut field, they could develop and refine a specialized gas test for peanut drought stress indicators, which could help farmers improve irrigation scheduling or prevent aflatoxins, which are potential carcinogens. 
 ""you could probably develop and instrument the field with reliable compact sensors that allow for quick and convenient voc collection and assessment,"" said daley. ""or we could envision robots manually taking samples.""

perception-workers-creativity-affects-their-network-and-standing-within.txt,"perception of a worker's creativity affects their network and standing within an organization 
 employees tend to align with creative workers, particulary from different genders and demographics, in the workplace. 
 oct 27, 2023 
 we work with coworkers every day to help us solve problems. for example, we may exchange ideas when discussing ways to increase revenue or when rolling out a new product or service. as we develop closer relationships with colleagues, we may notice a coworker who often thinks outside the box or is always teeming with ideas to help improve the organization. you might even be the person with all the ideas. 
 a recent study looked at the influence of coworker creativity on work relationships and discovered something interesting: participants sought a closer relationship with coworkers they perceived as being more creative. moreover, the subjects were more inclined to establish a closer relationship with a creative coworker of the opposite sex or from a different demographic than them. 
 the researchers 
 christina e. shalley , sharon m. and matthew r. price chair and professor of organizational behavior at the georgia tech scheller college of business; 
 amy p. breidenthal , assistant professor of business management 
 at agnes scott college; and 
 gamze koseoglu , 
 senior lecturer in management at the university of melbourne, examined whether the number and strength of a creative coworker's relationships increased over time as more colleagues sought them out. their paper "" when perceiving a coworker as creative affects social networks over time: a network theory of social capital perspective "" was recently published in the 
 journal of organizational behavior. 
 if a creative coworker's network did increase, they posited that the coworker would also be seen as a high performer and given a more favorable position within the organization, especially if the organization valued and encouraged creativity. in other words, in an organization that encouraged creativity, the more coworkers developed relationships with a creative coworker, the more others sought to do the same, which increased the creative person's network and standing within the organization. 
 perhaps most surprising is that among their hypotheses, a creative coworker in a minority group and from a different demographic was viewed as more creative and experienced more popularity within the network. this is due to a perception among coworkers - and in previous research - that minorities and those from different demographics tend to offer distinctive points of view, different ways of thinking, and, therefore, more significant creative insights. 
 ""besides improving relationship opportunities for minority employees, this also provides advantages for employees in the majority since they can potentially benefit from learning from diverse other perspectives and acquiring resources from them,"" said shalley. 
 based on their findings, creative individuals within the workplace are viewed in high regard, prompting others to work on establishing a closer relationship with these colleagues. furthermore, when a creative employee's network is expanded, they may be offered more opportunities in an organization, particularly if the organization encourages creativity. in addition, their work suggests that being seen as a creative employee boosts confidence in their abilities with themselves and their coworkers. 
 shalley et al. believe organizations would do well to encourage creativity in the workplace. the researchers suggest organizations can accomplish this by providing development opportunities that help introduce colleagues who may not know each other and encourage them to discuss potential solutions to organizational problems. holding brainstorming meetings can also promote creativity among workers as long as organizations ensure that all ideas are treated equally. 
 ""our findings highlight practical opportunities for both employees and managers to enhance relationships closeness, especially for employees who are dissimilar from their coworkers, by being creative at work,"" said shalley.

perking-and-crimping-bristles-polyelectrolyte-brushes-0.txt,"perking up and crimping the ‘bristles' of polyelectrolyte brushes 
 a brush that's like a shoe brush on a micron scale can have great potential uses for industry and medicine -- but only if it works right. 
 polyelectrolyte brushes illustration: in the foreground, powerful ions in solution, shown as spheres, cause the brush's bristles to collapse like sticky spaghetti. in the background, gentler ions in solution cause the bristles to stand back straight. credit: peter allen university of california santa barbara for this study 
 dec 12, 2017 
 - atlanta, ga 
 if the bristles of a brush abruptly collapsed into wads of noodles, the brush would, of course, become useless. when it's a micron-scale brush called a ""polyelectrolyte brush,"" that collapse could put a promising experimental drug or lubricant out of commission. 
 but now 
 a new study reveals, in fine detail , things that make these special bristles collapse -- and also recover. the research increases understanding of these chemical brushes that have many potential uses. 
 what are polyelectrolyte brushes? 
 polyelectrolyte brushes look a bit like soft bushes, such as shoeshine brushes, but they are on the scale of large molecules and the ""bristles"" are made of 
 polymer chains . polyelectrolyte brushes have a backing, or substrate, and the polymer chains tethered to the backing like soft bristles have chemical properties that make the brush potentially interesting for many practical uses. 
 but polymers are stringy and tend to get tangled or clumped, and keeping them straightened out, like soft bristles, is vital to the function of these micron brushes. researchers at the georgia institute of technology, the university of chicago, and the argonne national laboratory devised experiments that caused polyelectrolyte brush bristles to collapse and then recover from the collapse. 
 they imaged the processes in detail with highly sensitive 
 atomic force microscopy , and they constructed simulations that closely matched their observations. principal investigator blair brettmann from georgia tech and the study's first authors jing yu and nicholas jackson from the university of chicago 
 published their results on december 8, 2017, in the journal 
 science advances . 
 their research was supported by the u.s. department of energy, the national science foundation, and the argonne national laboratory. 
 from faux dna to lubricants 
 the potential future payoff for the researchers' work spans industrial materials to medicine. 
 for example, polyelectrolyte brushes make for surfaces that have their own built-in lubrication. ""if you attach the brushes to opposing surfaces, and the bristles rub against each other, then they have really low friction and excellent lubrication properties,"" said blair brettmann, who led the study and recently joined georgia tech from the university of chicago. 
 polyelectrolyte brushes could also one day find medical applications. their bristles have been shown to simulate dna and encode simple proteins. other brushes could be engineered to repel bacteria from surfaces. some polyelectrolyte brushes already exist in the body on the surface of some cells. 
 polyelectrolyte brushes can do so many different things because they can be engineered in so many variations. 
 ""when you build the brushes, you have a lot of control,"" said brettmann, who is an 
 assistant professor in georgia tech's school of materials science and engineering . ""you can control on the nanoscale how far apart the polymer chains (the bristles) are spaced on the substrate and how long they are."" 
 they're intricate and sensitive 
 for all their great potential, polyelectrolyte brushes are also complex and sensitive, and a lot of research is needed to understand how to optimize them. 
 the polymer chains have positive and negative ionic, or electrolytic, charges alternating along their lengths, thus the name ""polyelectrolyte."" chemists can string the polymers together using various chemical building blocks, or monomers, and design nuanced charge patterns up and down the chain. 
 there's more complexity: backing and bristles are not all that make up polyelectrolyte brushes. they're bathed in solutions containing gentle electrolytes, which create a balanced ionic pull from all sides that props the bristles up instead of letting them collapse or entangle. 
 ""often these mixtures have a bunch of other stuff in them, so the complexity of this makes it really hard to understand fundamentally,"" brettmann said, ""and thus hard to be able to predict behavior in real applications."" 
 invading impurities 
 when other chemicals enter into these well-balanced systems that make up polyelectrolyte brushes, they can make the bristles collapse. for example, the addition of very powerful electrolytes can act like a flock of wrecking balls. 
 in their experiment, brettmann and her colleagues used a powerful ionic compound built around yttrium, a rare earth metal with a strong charge. (the ion was trivalent, or had a valence of 3.) the ionic forces from just a low dose of the yttrium electrolyte made the polymer bristles curl up like clumps of sticky spaghetti. 
 then the researchers increased the concentration of the gentler ions, which restored support, propping the bristles back up. atomic force microscope imaging revealed highly regular patterns of collapse and re-extension. 
 these patterns were reflected well in the simulations; the reliability of the effects of the ions on collapse and recovery even more so. the ability to build such an accurate simulation reflects the strong consistency of the chemistry, which is good news for potential future research and practical applications. 
 useless becomes useful 
 for all the dysfunction that bristle collapses can cause, the ability to collapse them on purpose can be useful. ""if you could collapse and reactivate the bristles systematically, you could adjust the degree of lubrication, for example, or turn lubrication on and off,"" brettmann said. 
 the brushes also could regulate chemical reactions involving micro- and nanoparticles by extending and collapsing the bristles. 
 ""coatings and films are often made by carefully combining engineered particles, and you can use these brushes to keep these particles suspended and separate until you're ready to let them meet, bond, and form the product,"" brettmann said. 
 when the polyelectrolyte brush's bristles are extended, they act as a barrier to hold the particles apart. collapse the bristles out of the way on purpose, and the particles can come together. 
 it's a nasty world 
 the experiments were performed with very clean, robust, and uniform compounds unlike the jumble of chemicals that can exist in natural or even industrial systems. 
 ""the bristles we used were polystyrene sulfonate, which is a very strong polyelectrolyte, not sensitive to ph or much else,"" brettmann said. ""biopolymers like polysaccharides, for example, are a lot more sensitive."" 
 like many experiments, this one was a departure from real-world conditions. but by creating a foundation for understanding how these systems work, brettmann wants eventually to be able to move on to sensitive scenarios to realize more of polyelectrolyte brushes' practical potential.

 if a driver is traveling to new york city, i-95 might be their route of choice. but they could also take i-78, i-87 or any number of alternate routes. most cancers begin similarly, with many possible routes to the same disease. a new study found evidence that assessing the route to cancer on a case-by-case basis might make more sense than basing a patient's cancer treatment on commonly disrupted genes and pathways.  the study found little or no overlap in the most prominent genetic malfunction associated with each individual patient's disease compared to malfunctions shared among the group of cancer patients as a whole. 
 ""this paper argues for the importance of personalized medicine, where we treat each person by looking for the etiology of the disease in patients individually,"" said 
 john mcdonald , a professor in the school of biology at the georgia institute of technology in atlanta. ""the findings have ramifications on how we might best optimize cancer treatments as we enter the era of targeted gene therapy."" the research was published february 11 online in the journal 
 pancreas 
 and was funded by the georgia tech foundation and the st. joseph's mercy foundation. in the study, researchers collected cancer and normal tissue samples from four patients with pancreatic cancer and also analyzed data from eight other pancreatic cancer patients that had been previously reported in the scientific literature by a separate research group. 
 mcdonald's team compiled a list of the most aberrantly expressed genes in the cancer tissues isolated from these patients relative to adjacent normal pancreatic tissue. 
 the study found that collectively 287 genes displayed significant differences in expression in the cancers vs normal tissues. twenty-two cellular pathways were enriched in cancer samples, with more than half related to the body's immune response. the researchers ran statistical analyses to determine if the genes most significantly abnormally expressed on an individual patient basis were the same as those identified as most abnormally expressed across the entire group of patients. 
 the researchers found that the molecular profile of each individual cancer patient was unique in terms of the most significantly disrupted genes and pathways. 
 ""if you're dealing with a disease like cancer that can be arrived at by multiple pathways, it makes sense that you're not going to find that each patient has taken the same path,"" mcdonald said. 
 although the researchers found that some genes that were commonly disrupted in all or most of the patients examined, these genes were not among the most significantly disrupted in any individual patient. 
 ""by and large, there appears to be a lot of individuality in terms of the molecular basis of pancreatic cancer,"" said mcdonald, who also serves as the director of the integrated cancer research center and as the chief scientific officer of the ovarian cancer institute. though the study is small, it raises questions about the validity of pinpointing the most important gene or pathway underlying a disease by pooling data from multiple patients, mcdonald said. he favors individual profiling as the preferred method for initiating treatment. the cost of a molecular profiling analysis to transcribe the dna sequences of exons - the parts of the genome that carry instructions for proteins - is about $2,000 (exons account for about two percent of a cell's total dna). that's about half the cost of this analysis five years ago, mcdonald said, and a $1,000 molecular profiling analysis might not be far off. 
 ""as costs continue to come down, personalized molecular profiling will be carried out on more cancer patients,"" mcdonald said. yet cost isn't the only limiting factor, mcdonald said. scientists and doctors have to shift their paradigm on how they use molecular profiling to treat cancer. 
 ""are you going to believe what you see for one patient or are you going to say, ‘i can't interpret that data until i group it together with 100 other patients and find what's in common among them,'"" mcdonald said. ""for any given individual patient there may be mutant genes or aberrant expression patterns that are vitally important for that person's cancer that aren't present in other patients' cancers."" future work in mcdonald's lab will see if this pattern of individuality is repeated in larger studies and in patients with different cancers. the group is currently working on a genomic profiling analysis of patients with ovarian and lung cancers. 
 ""if there are multiple paths, then maybe individual patients are getting cancer from alternative routes,"" mcdonald said. ""if that's the case, we should do personalized profiling on each patient before we make judgments on the treatment for that patient."" loukia lili, of georgia tech's integrated cancer research center, school of biology, and parker h. petit institute of bioengineering and biosciences, was the study's first author. co-authors included lilya matyunina and deette walker of georgia tech, and george daneker, md, of the cancer treatment centers of america se regional facility in newnan, ga. this research is supported by the georgia tech foundation and the st. joseph's mercy foundation. any conclusions or opinions are those of the authors and do not necessarily represent the official views of the sponsoring agencies. citation : loukia n. lili, et al., ""evidence for the importance of personalized molecular profiling in pancreatic cancer,"" ( pancreas , february 2014).

physicists-solve-mysteries-microtubule-movers.txt,"physicists solve mysteries of microtubule movers 
 physicists have developed a new model and clearer picture of molecular movements within active matter - bringing science a step closer to designing specific functions into new materials, and understanding emergent behaviors. 
 roman grigoriev 
 sep 01, 2023 
 active matter 
 is any collection of materials or systems composed of individual units that can move on their own, thanks to self-propulsion or autonomous motion. they can be of any size - think clouds of bacteria in a petri dish, or schools of fish. 
 roman grigoriev 
 is mostly interested in the emergent behaviors in active matter systems made up of units on a molecular scale - tiny systems that convert stored energy into directed motion, consuming energy as they move and exert mechanical force. 
 ""active matter systems have garnered significant attention in physics, biology, and materials science due to their unique properties and potential applications,"" grigoriev, a professor in the 
 school of physics 
 at georgia tech, explains. 
 ""researchers are exploring how active matter can be harnessed for tasks like designing new materials with tailored properties, understanding the behavior of biological organisms, and even developing new approaches to robotics and autonomous systems,"" he says. 
 but that's only possible if scientists learn how the microscopic units making up active matter interact, and whether they can affect these interactions and thereby the collective properties of active matter on the macroscopic scale. 
 grigoriev and his research colleagues have found a potential first step by developing a new model of active matter that generated new insight into the physics of the problem. they detail their methods and results in a new 
 study 
 published in 
 science advances , ""physically informed data-driven modeling of active nematics."" 
 school of physics graduate researcher 
 matthew golden 
 is the study's lead author. co-authors are graduate researcher 
 jyothishraj nambisan 
 and 
 alberto fernandez-nieves , professor in the department of condensed matter physics at the 
 university of barcelona 
 and a former associate professor of physics at georgia tech. 
 a two-dimensional 'solution?' 
 the research team focused on one of the most common examples of active matter, a suspension of self-propelled particles, such as bacteria or synthetic microswimmers, in a liquid medium. these particles cluster, swarm, and otherwise form dynamic patterns due to their ability to move and interact with each other. 
 ""in our paper, we use data from an experimental system involving suspensions of microtubules, which provide structural support, shape, and organization to eukaryotic cells (any cell with a clearly defined nucleus),"" grigoriev explains. 
 microtubules, as well as actin filaments and some bacteria, are examples of nematics, rod-like objects whose ""heads"" are indistinguishable from their ""tails."" 
 the motion of microtubules is driven by molecular motors powered by a protein, kinesin, which consumes adenosine triphosphate (atp) dissolved in the liquid to slide a pair of neighboring microtubules past one another. the researcher's system used microtubules suspended between layers of oil and water, which restricted their movement to two dimensions. 
 ""that makes it easier to visualize the microtubules and track their motion. by changing the kinesin or atp concentrations, we could control the motion of the microtubules, making this experimental setup by far one of the most popular in the study of active nematics and even more generally, active matter,"" grigoriev said. 
 ‘this is where the story gets interesting' 
 getting a clearer picture of microtubular movements was just one discovery in the study. 
 another was learning more about the relationships between the characteristic patterns describing the orientation and motion of nematic molecules on a macroscopic scale. those patterns, or topological defects, determine how the nematics orient themselves at the oil-water interface, that is in two spatial dimensions. 
 ""understanding the relationship between the flow - the global property of the system, or the fluid - and the topological defects, which describe the local orientation of microtubules, is one of the key intellectual questions facing researchers in the field,"" grigoriev said. ""one needs to correctly identify the dominant physical effects which control the interaction between the microtubules and the surrounding fluid."" 
 ""and this is where the story gets interesting,"" grigoriev adds. ""for over a decade, it was believed that the key physics were well understood, with a large number of theoretical and computational studies relying on a generally accepted first principles model"" - that is, one based on established science - ""that was originally derived for active nematics in three spatial dimensions."" 
 in the georgia tech model, though, the dynamics of active nematics - more specifically, the length and time scales of the emerging patterns - are controlled by a pair of physical constants describing those assumed dominant physical effects: the stiffness of the microtubules (their flexibility), and the activity describing the stress, or force, generated by the kinesin motors. 
 ""using a data-driven approach, we inferred the correct form of the model demonstrating that, for two-dimensional active nematics, the dominant physical effects are different from what was previously assumed,"" grigoriev says. ""in particular, the time scale is set by the rate at which bundles of microtubules are stretched by kinesin."" it is this rate, rather than the stress, that is constant. 
 the danger of confirmation bias 
 grigoriev said the results of the study have important implications for understanding of active nematics and their emergent behaviors, explaining that they help rationalize a number of recent experimental results that were previously unexplained, such as how the density of topological defects scales with the concentration of kinesin and the viscosity of the fluid layers. 
 ""more importantly, our results demonstrate the danger associated with traditional assumptions that established research communities often land on and have difficulty overcoming,"" grigoriev said. ""while data-driven methods may have their own sources of bias, they offer a perspective which is different enough from more traditional approaches to become a valuable research tool in their own right.""

 researchers have shown that the relative softness of white blood cells determines whether they remain in a dormant state. 
 researchers at georgia tech and emory university fabricated model blood vessel systems that include artificial blood vessels with diameters as narrow as the smallest capillaries in the body. the systems were used to study the activity of white blood cells as they were affected by drugs that tend to make them softer, which facilitates their entry into blood circulation. (credit: rob felt, georgia tech)

 - atlanta, ga 
 simple physics may play a larger role than previously thought in helping control key bodily processes - such as how the body fights infection. using a model blood vessel system built on a polymer microchip, researchers have shown that the relative softness of white blood cells determines whether they remain in a dormant state along vessel walls or enter blood circulation to fight infection. changes in these cell mechanical properties - from stiff to soft - can be triggered as a side effect of drugs commonly used to fight inflammation or boost blood pressure. other researchers have found that blood flow affects the cells that line arteries and that particles within cells tend to congregate near cell walls. better understanding the role of physics in fine-tuning such biological processes could give researchers new approaches for both diagnosing and treating disease. the work, believed the first to show how biophysical effects can control where white blood cells are located within the blood circulation, was reported february 8 in the journal 
 proceedings of the national academy of sciences . the research was supported by the national heart, lung, and blood institute of the national institutes of health (nih), the national science foundation (nsf), and the american heart association. ""we are showing that white blood cells, also known as leukocytes, respond physically to these drugs and that there is a biological consequence to that response,"" said 
 wilbur lam , an assistant professor in the 
 wallace h. coulter department of biomedical engineering 
 at georgia tech and emory university. ""this may suggest new ways to treat disease, and new places to look for diagnostic information. there may be physics-based disease biomarkers that we can use in addition to the common biological and biochemical markers we have been using."" lam's research group began studying the issue to better understand a common side effect of glucocorticoid drugs such as hydrocortisone used to treat inflammatory disorders such as asthma and allergic reactions. these hormonal drugs prompt an increase in white blood cell counts, a change that had been attributed to biological processes, including a reduced ""stickiness"" between the cells and blood vessel walls. the increase in white cell count is also seen with drugs that support blood pressure, such as epinephrine, also known as adrenaline. ""the biological explanation for this seemed to fall short, so we thought maybe some of what was happening could be attributed to other factors - such as physical and mechanical issues,"" said lam, who is also a physician in the aflac cancer and blood disorders center at children's healthcare of atlanta and the department of pediatrics at the emory university school of medicine. to examine the theory, graduate student meredith fay and postdoctoral researcher david myers fabricated model blood vessel systems that include artificial blood vessels with diameters as narrow as the smallest capillaries in the body. to isolate effects attributable only to physics, the systems - which were fabricated in georgia tech's 
 institute for electronics and nanotechnology 
 - did not include the endothelial cells that normally line blood vessels in the body. using blood samples taken from a healthy human volunteer, they studied the behavior of white blood cells in the presence - and absence - of the drugs dexamethasone - a glucocorticoid drug - and epinephrine. working with georgia tech professor of mechanical engineering todd sulchek, they also used atomic force microscopy to characterize the stiffness of individual white blood cells before and after they had been exposed to the drugs, and determined that the drugs cause the cells to become significantly softer than before exposure. ""when we fluorescently label the white blood cells and perfuse them into the artificial vessels, the white blood cells are always flowing along the edge, on the walls of these artificial blood vessels,"" said lam. ""but when they are exposed to the drugs, they go to the center of the channel and enter the main blood flow. then, we discovered that the drugs cause the cells to remodel actin, which comprises the ‘skeleton' of all mammalian cells."" the group's overall hypothesis is that the body uses the mechanical properties of these cells to help control their activity and where they are located within the circulation. the relative softness or stiffness of the cells, which collide constantly with billions of other cells in the bloodstream, including red and white blood cells, causes the cells to self-sort and determines where they end up physically within both the model blood vessels and in the human body. ""the soft cells are always flowing in the middle of the bloodstream, while the stiff ones are sequestered on the edges,"" lam said. ""we believe this is how white blood cells traffic in the body and get to the site of an infection. this may be a way that the body very efficiently sorts and directs its white blood cells to get them where they're needed."" as a next step, lam hopes to study how physical properties affect the movement of hematopoietic stem cells used in bone marrow transplants. once injected intravenously into the body, the cells quickly move from the circulation to bone marrow sites where they belong, and he believes mechanical properties may also play a role in this homing process. ""whenever there is a change in some cellular activity or physiological activity, we tend to try to explain everything at the genetic level - which genes turn off and which genes turn on,"" he said. ""gene expression is a relatively complex process, and our hypothesis is that there are probably a lot of cellular processes that are much simpler and more efficient than the typical paradigm of dna expression, then rna translation, and then protein production. a little tweak of a white blood cell's actin will allow it to change from stiff to soft, and that small change, in and of itself, may have profound physiologic consequences and enable it to be transported from one part of the body to another."" in addition to those already mentioned, the research also included amit kumar and michael graham from the department of chemical and biological engineering at the university of wisconsin-madison; cory turbyfield, rebecca byler and kaci crawford from the wallace h. coulter department of biomedical engineering at georgia tech and emory university and the george w. woodruff school of mechanical engineering at georgia tech; robert mannino, alvin laohapant, erika tyburski, yumiko sakurai and micahel rosenbluth from the coulter department, the aflaccancer center and blood disorders service of children's healthcare of atlanta, emory university school of medicine, the winship cancer institute at emory university, the parker e. petit institute for bioengineering and bioscience at georgia tech, and the institute for electronics and nanotechnology at georgia tech; and neil switz of the evergreen state college. this research was supported by the national heart, lung and blood institute of the national institutes of health (nih) under grant 5r01hl121264-03, the national science foundation (nsf) under grant cbet-1436082 and the american heart association. any opinions, findings, and conclusions or recommendations expressed in this material are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the views of the sponsors. citation : meredith e. fay, et al., ""cellular softening mediates leukocyte demargination and trafficking, thereby increasing clinical blood counts,"" (pnas 2016).

pilot-project-will-use-campus-wastewater-grow-vegetables.txt,"pilot project will use campus wastewater to grow vegetables 
 $5 million grant funds project to test sustainable hydroponic farming in urban areas. 
 post-doctoral fellow bopeng zhang, professor yongsheng chen and graduate research assistant thomas igou from the school of civil and environmental engineering will pilot a project to use wastewater nutrients to grow lettuce, tomatoes and other fruits and vegetables. 
 oct 30, 2018 
 - atlanta, ga 
 even if you do your best to eat local, chances are most of the fruits and vegetables you consume come from far away -- especially if you live in a big city. water and land for growing crops are hard to come by in urban areas. finding more sustainable methods for growing produce in urban areas would have enormous benefits. a pilot project by georgia tech's 
 yongsheng chen, 
 a professor in the 
 school of civil and environmental engineering , aims to use wastewater from the campus to do just that. 
 ""the overarching goal is trying to figure out a way to use wastewater nutrients to grow produce in urban areas so we can decentralize vegetable production,"" chen said. a grant provides $5 million over five years from the u.s. department of agriculture's national institute of food and agriculture (nifa) to create and operate a hydroponic growing system using domestic wastewater extracted from the georgia tech campus sewer system. it is the largest usda award georgia tech has received. 
 ""currently we treat wastewater by taking all the nutrients from it,"" said chen. ""then we have to use an energy-intensive process to synthesize and add fertilizer to the food production process."" 
 the proposed anaerobic membrane biological treatment process will transfer organic contaminants into biogas and remove pathogens such as e. coli to ensure food safety, but the nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium, for example) will remain. by using a smart membrane or nanomaterials to extract trace contaminants like endocrine disruptors, heavy metals and pharmaceuticals, the nutrients that are left can be pumped through a vertical hydroponic system to grow produce without adding fertilizer. the project will monitor water and produce quality and measure contamination from chemicals and microbes continuously. 
 the overall goal, said chen, is to show that using the nutrients and water resources from domestic wastewater (dww) in an urban controlled environment agriculture system (ceas) is socially, environmentally and financially sustainable and can easily be replicated in other cities. the project will closely track nutrient requirements, energy needed to produce, handle and transport the fruits and vegetables, and water needs to determine what resources are needed to support this kind of cea system (dww-ceas). 
 ecological network analysis for dww-cea coupling will track material and energy flows across components that produce, consume and recycle food. using a geodesign approach, chen's team will then compare data from traditional agriculture and dww-ceas to see how the system performs and how it could be designed to perform better in terms of water, energy and nutrient needs. 
 ""our model will have options to calculate energy consumption for the system, water consumption, water balance and nutrient balance,"" said chen. ""we'll conduct a life-cycle analysis and techno-economic analysis to evaluate whether this type of system will be commercially feasible or profitable in different locations, not just atlanta."" 
 chen will use machine learning in the controlled growing environment to seek a ""recipe"" for each plant type: the ideal amount of nutrients, growing temperature and humidity needed for lettuce, for example, so that each head of greens will taste the same. the project also provides an opportunity to test a number of other technologies, such as using solar power for cooling or biogas extracted from the wastewater and discarded food to power a micro chiller. 
 of course, showing that such a dww-cea system is feasible and profitable is one hurdle - another is getting consumers on board with the way the produce is produced. ""if we are going to decentralize this system, what are the implications for policy related issues?"" chen asked. ""will people buy products produced by wastewater?"" the project will involve working with a number of collaborators at georgia tech and in atlanta, including kaye husbands fealing, professor and chair of the school of public policy at georgia tech, and the mayor's office of sustainability. 
 ""we want to change the current wastewater treatment practice, step back a little bit and think outside the box,"" chen said. ""this could have a big impact locally, regionally or even nationally and internationally."" 
 this research is supported by the u.s. department of agriculture's (usda) national institute of food and agriculture (nifa), agriculture and food research initiative (afri) water for food production systems (grant 2018-68011-28371).

 as the coronavirus pandemic (also known as covid-19) continues to spread in u.s. cities and around the world, experts are sharing their advice to help determine a safe path forward. one such expert at the h. milton stewart school of industrial and systems engineering (isye) is pinar keskinocak, william w. george chair and professor in isye, college of engineering advance professor, and co-founder and director of the 
 center for health and humanitarian systems . 
 keskinocak has focused her career on heath and humanitarian systems, including hospital operations management, infectious disease modeling, and evaluating the effectiveness of intervention strategies. since the initial coronavirus outbreak, she has worked on developing a comprehensive agent-based disease spread model, in collaboration with isye professor nicoleta serban and ph.d. students buse eylul oruc, arden baxter, and others. the model estimates the spread of the disease geographically and over time; resource needs such as hospital beds, icu beds, and ventilators; and enables the team to evaluate the impact of various intervention scenarios to determine the best course of action. 
 in a recent cnn interview, keskinocak discusses the impact of social distancing and current shelter in place orders. she cautions that a careful, gradual approach is needed as society plans to go back to work and social life, a balancing act between public health and the economy. she emphasizes the importance of the need to continue social distancing to slow down covid-19 spread, flatten the curve, and save lives.

 the rolling hills of mars or the moon are a long way from the nearest tow truck. that's why the next generation of exploration rovers will need to be good at climbing hills covered with loose material and avoiding entrapment on soft granular surfaces. 
 built with wheeled appendages that can be lifted and wheels able to wiggle, a new robot known as the ""mini rover"" has developed and tested complex locomotion techniques robust enough to help it climb hills covered with such granular material - and avoid the risk of getting ignominiously stuck on some remote planet or moon. 
 using a complex move the researchers dubbed ""rear rotator pedaling,"" the robot can climb a slope by using its unique design to combine paddling, walking, and wheel spinning motions. the rover's behaviors were modeled using a branch of physics known as terradynamics. 
 ""when loose materials flow, that can create problems for robots moving across it,"" said 
 dan goldman , the dunn family professor in the 
 school of physics 
 at the georgia institute of technology. ""this rover has enough degrees of freedom that it can get out of jams pretty effectively. by avalanching materials from the front wheels, it creates a localized fluid hill for the back wheels that is not as steep as the real slope. the rover is always self-generating and self-organizing a good hill for itself."" 
 the research was reported on may 13 as the cover article in the journal 
 science robotics . the work was supported by the nasa national robotics initiative and the army research office. 
 a robot built by nasa's johnson space center pioneered the ability to spin its wheels, sweep the surface with those wheels and lift each of its wheeled appendages where necessary, creating a broad range of potential motions. using in-house 3d printers, the georgia tech researchers collaborated with the johnson space center to re-create those capabilities in a scaled-down vehicle with four wheeled appendages driven by 12 different motors. 
 ""the rover was developed with a modular mechatronic architecture, commercially available components, and a minimal number of parts,"" said siddharth shrivastava, an undergraduate student in georgia tech's 
 george w. woodruff school of mechanical engineering . ""this enabled our team to use our robot as a robust laboratory tool and focus our efforts on exploring creative and interesting experiments without worrying about damaging the rover, service downtime, or hitting performance limitations."" 
 the rover's broad range of movements gave the research team an opportunity to test many variations that were studied using granular drag force measurements and modified resistive force theory. shrivastava and school of physics ph.d. candidate andras karsai began with the gaits explored by the nasa rp15 robot, and were able to experiment with locomotion schemes that could not have been tested on a full-size rover. 
 the researchers also tested their experimental gaits on slopes designed to simulate planetary and lunar hills using a fluidized bed system known as scatter (systematic creation of arbitrary terrain and testing of exploratory robots) that could be tilted to evaluate the role of controlling the granular substrate. karsai and shrivastava collaborated with yasemin ozkan-aydin, a postdoctoral research fellow in goldman's lab, to study the rover motion in the scatter test facility. 
 ""by creating a small robot with capabilities similar to the rp15 rover, we could test the principles of locomoting with various gaits in a controlled laboratory environment,"" karsai said. ""in our tests, we primarily varied the gait, the locomotion medium, and the slope the robot had to climb. we quickly iterated over many gait strategies and terrain conditions to examine the phenomena that emerged."" 
 in the paper, the authors describe a gait that allowed the rover to climb a steep slope with the front wheels stirring up the granular material - poppy seeds for the lab testing - and pushing them back toward the rear wheels. the rear wheels wiggled from side-to-side, lifting and spinning to create a motion that resembles paddling in water. the material pushed to the back wheels effectively changed the slope the rear wheels had to climb, allowing the rover to make steady progress up a hill that might have stopped a simple wheeled robot. 
 the experiments provided a variation on earlier robophysics work in goldman's group that involved moving with legs or flippers, which had emphasized disturbing the granular surfaces as little as possible to avoid getting the robot stuck. 
 ""in our previous studies of pure legged robots, modeled on animals, we had kind of figured out that the secret was to not make a mess,"" said goldman. ""if you end up making too much of a mess with most robots, you end up just paddling and digging into the granular material. if you want fast locomotion, we found that you should try to keep the material as solid as possible by tweaking the parameters of motion."" 
 but simple motions had proved problematic for mars rovers, which got stuck in granular materials. goldman says the gait discovered by shrivastava, karsai and ozkan-aydin might be able to help future rovers avoid that fate. 
 ""this combination of lifting and wheeling and paddling, if used properly, provides the ability to maintain some forward progress even if it is slow,"" goldman said. ""through our laboratory experiments, we have shown principles that could lead to improved robustness in planetary exploration - and even in challenging surfaces on our own planet."" 
 the researchers hope next to scale up the unusual gaits to larger robots, and to explore the idea of studying robots and their localized environments together. ""we'd like to think about the locomotor and its environment as a single entity,"" goldman said. ""there are certainly some interesting granular and soft matter physics issues to explore."" 
 though the mini rover was designed to study lunar and planetary exploration, the lessons learned could also be applicable to terrestrial locomotion - an area of interest to the army research laboratory, one of the project's sponsors. 
 ""this basic research is revealing exciting new approaches for locomotion in complex terrain,"" said dr. samuel stanton, program manager, army research office, an element of the u.s. army combat capabilities development command's army research laboratory. ""this could lead to platforms capable of intelligently transitioning between wheeled and legged modes of movement to maintain high operational tempo.""

 films of platinum only two atoms thick supported by graphene could enable fuel cell catalysts with unprecedented catalytic activity and longevity, according to a study published recently by researchers at the georgia institute of technology. 
 platinum is one of the most commonly used catalysts for fuel cells because of how effectively it enables the oxidation reduction reaction at the center of the technology. but its high cost has spurred research efforts to find ways to use smaller amounts of it while maintaining the same catalytic activity. 
 ""there's always going to be an initial cost for producing a fuel cell with platinum catalysts, and it's important to keep that cost as low as possible,"" said faisal alamgir, an associate professor in georgia tech's school of materials science and engineering. ""but the real cost of a fuel cell system is calculated by how long that system lasts, and this is a question of durability. 
 ""recently there's been a push to use catalytic systems without platinum, but the problem is that there hasn't been a system proposed so far that simultaneously matches the catalytic activity and the durability of platinum,"" alamgir said. 
 the georgia tech researchers tried a different strategy. in the study, which was published on september 18 in the journal  advanced functional materials 
 and supported by the national science foundation, they describe creating several systems that used atomically-thin films of platinum supported by a layer of graphene - effectively maximizing the total surface area of the platinum available for catalytic reactions and using a much smaller amount of the precious metal. 
 most platinum-based catalytic systems use nanoparticles of the metal chemically bonded to a support surface, where surface atoms of the particles do most of the catalytic work, and the catalytic potential of the atoms beneath the surface is never utilized as fully as the surface atoms, if at all. 
 additionally, the researchers showed that the new platinum films that are at least two atoms thick outperformed nanoparticle platinum in the dissociation energy, which is a measure of the energy cost of dislodging a surface platinum atom. that measurement suggests those films could make potentially longer-lasting catalytic systems. 
 to prepare the atomically-thin films, the researchers used a process called electrochemical atomic layer deposition to grow platinum monolayers on a layer of graphene, creating samples that had one, two or three atomic layers of atoms. the researchers then tested the samples for dissociation energy and compared the results to the energy of a single atom of platinum on graphene as well as the energy from a common configurations of platinum nanoparticles used in catalysts. 
 ""the fundamental question at the heart of this work was whether it was possible that a combination of metallic and covalent bonding can render the platinum atoms in a platinum-graphene combination more stable than their counterparts in bulk platinum used commonly in catalysts that are supported by metallic bonding,"" said seung soon jang, an associate professor in the school of materials science and engineering. 
 the researchers found that the bond between neighboring platinum atoms in the film essentially combines forces with the bond between the film and the graphene layer to provide reinforcement across the system. that was especially true in the platinum film that was two atoms thick. 
 ""typically metallic films below a certain thickness are not stable because the bonds between them are not directional, and they tend to roll over each other and conglomerate to form a particle,"" alamgir said. ""but that's not true with graphene, which is stable in a two-dimensional form, even one atom thick, because it has very strong covalent directional bonds between its neighboring atoms. so this new catalytic system could leverage the directional bonding of the graphene to support an atomically-thin film of platinum."" 
 future research will involve further testing of how the films behave in a catalytic environment. the researchers found in earlier research on graphene-platinum films that the material behaves similarly in catalytic reactions regardless of which side - graphene or platinum - is the exposed active surface. 
 ""in this configuration, the graphene is not acting as a separate entity from the platinum,"" alamgir said. ""they're working together as one. so we believe that if you're exposing the graphene side, you get the same catalytic activity and you could further protect the platinum, potentially further enhancing durability.""

poetrytech-works-increase-diversity-literary-criticism-publishing.txt,"poetry@tech works to increase diversity in literary criticism, publishing 
 poetry@tech is partnering with poets and scholars in the uk on a program meant to increase diversity among poetry critics in the united states. 
 nov 04, 2019 
 - atlanta, ga 
 by michael pearson 
 internationally acclaimed poets and poetry critics will take part in the georgia institute of technology launch of a national program designed to increase diversity among critics, writers whose reviews can help or hinder a poet's career. 
 the ""emerging critics"" workshop, scheduled nov. 4-6 at georgia tech, is the result of a partnership between the poetry@tech program and the ledbury emerging poetry critics program in the u.k. 
 ""the school of literature, media, and communication (lmc) at the ivan allen college of liberal arts prides itself on its interest in collaboration and on its far reach into many aspects of cultural and social life, bringing together many different disciplines,"" said ilya kaminsky, lmc professor and director of poetry@tech. ""as such, the collaborative nature of this program is perfect for lmc."" 
 the event will feature two days of immersive workshops for fellows chosen by organizations including letras latinas, a national organization that supports latinx poets, and universities and community centers. 
 georgia tech program offered in partnership with ledbury emerging critics program 
 each fellow will receive individualized instruction from top writers, editors, and publishers, and will be mentored for at least one year by a member of the program faculty, according to travis denton, academic professional and assistant director of poetry@tech. 
 the program is in partnership with  the guardian,  the  los angeles review of books ,  times literary supplement, the poetry review ,  poetry  magazine,  american poet ,  the georgia review, poetry international, poetry review (uk), terminus magazine,  and others. 
 ""a major bonus is that not only do these critics see their work published, but also more books by poets of color get reviewed, as well, meaning their work has a greater chance of gaining more readers,"" denton said. 
 the program is an extension of a similar program in the uk founded by sandeep parmar, a professor at the university of liverpool, and sarah howe, a lecturer in poetry at kings college, london. since the founding of that uk program in 2017, representation of reviewers of color has more than doubled in two years. the alumni went on to place their work in such publications as the 
 times literary supplement, the guardian, the telegraph, 
 and 
 the new statesman. 
 ""but improving the numbers is only part of the program's aim to generate a critical culture that is not only inclusive but also knowledgeable and representative of the diversity of poetry being written today,"" said parmar, who, along with howe, will serve as faculty at the workshop. 
 program aligns with ivan allen college mission to promote social good 
 in addition to parmar and howe, the faculty will include the  new york times  book critic parul sehgal,  poetry 
 editor don share,  the georgia review  associate editor soham patel, tupelo press editor jeffrey levine; and vidyan ravinthiran, a poet and critic who teaches american literature at harvard university. 
 other sponsors and collaborators include harvard university, the university of liverpool's centre for new and international writing, letras latinas at the university of notre dame's institute for latino studies, ucla english department, king's college, london and the georgia tech library. 
 it makes sense for such an effort to be taken on in the ivan allan college of liberal arts, where the mission statement calls for ""socially and ethically conscious strategies for positive action,"" denton said. 
 ""this program seeks to raise up traditionally underserved groups in our community, local and nationally, and provide them with the tools to be positive change makers in our world,"" denton said.

 will ratcliff is having a moment in the spotlight for getting yeast and algae to jump through hoops to new evolutionary heights. the 
 magazine 
 popular science 
 has heaved the researcher from the georgia institute of technology into 
 its annual list ""the brilliant 10,"" a select roster 
 of ""the 10 most innovative young minds in science and technology.""  ratcliff was praised for advancing the study of cellular evolution. popsci 
 cited his work demonstrating how single-cell organisms may have transitioned into simple multicellular organisms ages ago.  it's widely seen as an arduous evolutionary leap, since single cells had to forfeit a lot of their own fitness for the greater good of creating viable cell groups. ""william ratcliff revealed surprising insights into what might have been necessary for this transition to occur,"" 
 popular science 
 wrote in its september / october edition. he has illuminated ""one of the greatest mysteries of life."" the needs of the many ratcliff, an assistant professor 
 in georgia tech's 
 school of biological sciences , has put thousands of generations of yeast and many generations of algae cells through stresses in the lab devised to get them to evolve better survival strategies around forming cohesive groups. ""we're figuring out kind of clever ways to get them to form groups and then for those groups to become more complex,"" he said. the idea is to end up with a rudimentary multicellular being with cells taking on specialized roles, a very early step on the pathway to organ development.  but the first advantage to group formation is simple -- size. bigger is often better. ""a lot of small predators have small mouths that are great at eating single-cells,"" ratcliff said.  but 
 big multicellular cell clusters are too big for these predators 
 to get their mouths around. clustered cells survive to pass on their genes. race to the bottom to accelerate the evolution of yeast from individuals cells into 
 cell groups called ""snowflakes,"" one of his signature achievements , ratcliff has selected for yeast cells that sink more quickly.  there, again, big clusters sink better than single cells. once clusters are done outcompeting the unicells, they compete against each other. ""it's remarkable how quickly snowflake yeast clusters evolve new traits that let them win this race,"" he said. while the group gains various strengths, it sacrifices the viability of individual cells.  ""they evolve a division of labor in the group, in which some of them commit suicide,"" ratcliff said.  that changes reproductive patterns, which makes the clusters' progeny more competitive. the loss of individual cell fitness is extensive. the more robust a cluster gets, the less likely its individuals are to survive if they are caused to revert back to individual cells.  it's like an odd twist on the traditional marriage vows: part, and you will die. much of ratcliff's research is funded by nasa's exobiology program and the national science foundation. felt it coming before 
 popular science 
 called for an interview for its four-paragraph nod, ratcliff had sensed something was coming.  for a few months, while the magazine cemented its list, it asked around at scientific societies about noteworthy up-and-coming researchers. as a result, ratcliff received some veiled tips. ""a couple of colleagues of mine said, ‘hey man, i got a call from a reporter. i can't tell you anything about it, but you may be hearing something soon,'"" he said. when 
 popsci 
 called, a reporter told ratcliff that many scientists had mentioned him, strongly influencing the decision to name him one of ""the brilliant 10.""  ""that was very touching that people within the research community said to them they should look at my lab,"" ratcliff said. hail mary pass life's small coincidences have helped guide ratcliff's academic strivings down the path of evolutionary research. his career in biology spawned from childhood, when his parents carted him and his brother felix off in their summers to woodland family cabins next to craggy pacific coast cliffs near mendocino, california.  ""there was really nothing to do except to run around the forest and the ocean checking out the lives of plants and animals,"" ratcliff said. they got hooked; both brothers became biologists. plants became ratcliff's passion at an early age, which led to a bachelor of science in plant biology from the university of california, davis, but that threw his career a serendipitous curve. ""i thought it would have a lot to do with ecology, but it turned out to be mostly cellular biology."" the decision to see if yeast cells could be coaxed into making the leap to multicellularity was also slightly capricious.  ""there was a lot of doubt surrounding it, but i thought, ‘why not just give it a try and see,'"" said ratcliff, whose ph.d. is in ecology. he was astonished when that longshot worked.  ""it was a kind of hail mary pass,"" he said. it led to a dedicated research specialization and a notable body of continuing work. ------- read about a tiny mutation triggering massive evolutionary change

 - atlanta, ga 
 for researchers pursuing the primordial history of oxygen in earth's atmosphere, a new study might sour some ""eureka!"" moments. a contemporary tool used to trace oxygen by examining ancient rock strata  can produce false positives, according to the study , and the wayward results can mask as exhilarating discoveries. 
 common molecules called  ligands  can bias the results of a popular chemical tracer called the chromium (cr) isotope system, which is used to test sedimentary rock layers for clues about atmospheric oxygen levels during the epoch when the rock formed. researchers at the georgia institute of technology have demonstrated in the lab that many ligands could have created a signal very similar to that of molecular oxygen. 
 ""there are some geographical locations and ancient situations where measurable signals could have been generated that had nothing to do with how much oxygen was around,"" said  chris reinhard , one of the study's lead authors. though the new research may impact how some recent findings are assessed, that doesn't mean the tool isn't useful overall. 
 rock record tool 
 ""we're not trying to revolutionize the way the tool is viewed,"" said  yuanzhi tang , who co-led the study. ""this is about understanding its possible limitations to make discerning use of it in particular cases."" 
 tang and reinhard, both assistant professors of biogeochemistry in georgia tech's school of earth and atmospheric sciences,  published their team's results in a study on november 17, 2017, in the journal  nature communications . their work was funded by the nasa astrobiology institute, the nasa exobiology program, and the agouron institute. 
 ""on a global level, the chromium isotope system is still a great indicator of atmospheric oxygen levels through the ages,"" tang said. ""the issue we exposed in the lab is more local with isolated samples, especially during eras when there wasn't much atmospheric oxygen."" 
 leaping ligands 
 without a dominant oxygen presence,  ligands  likely made a great reactive substitute, as the researchers demonstrated in reactions with chromium. like oxygen, ligands strongly attract electron pairs, which is what characterizes them as a chemical group. 
 and like reactions with oxygen, reactions with ligands enable metals like chromium to move around more easily in the world. in this case, the researchers were interested in organic ligands, ligands that contain carbon. 
 they were more apt to match oxygen's mobility effect on chromium that made it end up as the signals in sedimentary rock that scientists, today, look for as a sign of  ancient atmospheric oxygen . 
 here's roughly how the chromium isotope system works, followed by how organic ligands could make for false positives. 
 chromium rollercoaster 
 the earth is an enormous chemical laboratory performing reactions in conditions varying from arctic cold to volcanic heat, and from crushing ocean depths to no-pressure upper atmospheres. winds and waves sweep around materials like turbulent conveyor belts, depositing some in sediments that later turn to stone. 
 chromium's ticket for the rollercoaster ride into sedimentary rock was usually an oxidizing agent that made it more soluble and better able to float, and  atmospheric oxygen was an ideal oxidizer . the chemical reaction,  which can be found in the study  and involved manganese oxide handing off oxygens to chromium, would be a little like adding pontoons to chromium compounds. 
 for billions of years, earth's atmosphere was nearly devoid of o 2 , but after oxygen began increasing, especially  in the last 800 million years ,  it became the domineering oxidizer. and characteristics of chromium deposits in ancient layers of rock became a great indicator of how much o 2  was in the atmosphere. 
 today, researchers test deep rock layer samples for the relation between two chromium isotopes,  52 cr, by far the most common cr isotope, and  53 cr, to get a read on oxygen presence  across geological eras . 
 ""you powder the rock up; you dissolve it with acid, and then you measure the ratio of  53 cr to  52 cr in the material by using mass spectrometry,"" reinhard said. ""it's the ratio that matters, and it will be controlled by a range of complex processes, but generally speaking, elevated  53 cr in ocean sediment rock tends to indicate oxygen in the atmosphere."" 
 by the way, these cr isotopes are stable and don't undergo radioactive decay, thus the system does not work the way  radiocarbon dating does, which relies on the decay of carbon 14. 
 chemical imposter 
 in the lab, with a small assortment of organic ligands, tang's group showed that reactions of chromium with ligands led to  53 cr / 52 cr signals that closely mimicked those stemming from oxygen-chromium reactions. 
 ""ligands have the capability to mobilize chromium as well,"" tang said. ""in fact, ligands might be a significant factor in controlling chromium isotope signals in certain rock records."" 
 organic ligands were probably around long before earth's atmosphere filled up with o 2 . and today, hundreds of millions of years after the reactions occurred, it's basically impossible to find out if oxygen or ligands were at work. 
 little discrepancies 
 if not accounted for, ligand reactions can distort small details in rock records about atmospheric oxygen, and they may have already. 
 like paleontologists, who catalog ancient animal bones and other fossils, geologists keep  massive, digitized archives of rock that they study to learn more about earth's ancient geological history . scientists began testing physical samples of them with the cr isotope system around 2009 and adding the results to the records. 
 ""since then, some discrepancies have turned up,"" reinhard said. ""ancient soil layers were showing evidence of oxygen when it probably shouldn't have been there. other samples from the same period weren't showing that signal."" 
 but some researchers confronted with odd cr signals have thought they had perhaps stumbled upon a radical find, and they developed explanations for how o 2  may have been surprisingly bountiful on the lonesome spot where a particular rock layer formed, while molecular oxygen was scant on the rest of the globe. others puzzled that atmospheric o 2  levels may have risen much earlier than overwhelmingly broad evidence has indicated. 
 ""a lot of that could be chalked up to other chemical processes and not to interactions with oxygen,"" reinhard said. 
 the study may serve as a cautionary tale about how to view cr isotope data, especially when they leap off the page.

 portable disinfection chambers that use ultraviolet (uv) light to inactivate virus particles could allow ppe to be quickly disinfected. 
 the portable uv disinfection chamber was designed to accommodate at least one face shield, along with multiple face masks. mercury vapor tubes on both sides provide ultraviolet light to disinfect the ppe. (credit: robert harris)

 portable disinfection chambers that use ultraviolet (uv) light to inactivate virus particles could allow emergency medical technicians, police officers, healthcare workers, pharmacy technicians, and others to quickly disinfect their personal protective equipment (ppe) as they need it. 
 researchers at the 
 georgia tech research institute 
 (gtri) have built two prototype chambers to evaluate ppe disinfection using different sources of uv-c light: mercury vapor lamps and light-emitting diodes (leds). they used the prototypes to evaluate different power levels and disinfection times with a variety of face shields and face masks used to protect workers from the coronavirus. 
 ""there are tradeoffs in terms of cost, lifetime, and potential heat generated,"" said t. robert harris, a gtri research engineer. ""we wanted to evaluate these issues so that when others use uv-c for disinfecting ppe, they will have information to make good choices."" 
 the goal was to provide disinfection chambers as small as possible to allow portability. the chambers were built to accommodate face masks and at least one face shield - a curved sheet of clear plastic that covers the entire face and protects against large droplets that could contain coronavirus. the portability of the chambers could allow them to be used anywhere ppe disinfection is needed. 
 ""we wanted a box that would fit on an ambulance or in a police car so that public service staff who are coming into contact with a lot of people on a regular basis would be able to disinfect their ppe,"" harris said. ""this method offers an advantage over chemical disinfection because it doesn't require drying time or risk of chemical absorption."" 
 originally, the project aimed at disinfecting ppe while it was being worn by having healthcare workers walk past an ultraviolet source while going from one hospital room to another. that idea was dropped because the wavelengths needed to inactivate the virus - 280 nanometers - can cause skin and eye damage in humans. 
 for that reason, the prototype portable disinfection chambers include a safety interlock to prevent the door from being opened while the uv light is on. disinfection takes about eight minutes, depending on the intensity of uv emissions, which vary by the lighting source. the chambers are designed to be cleaned between uses. 
 ""healthcare workers would put their face masks and face shields into the box, close the lid, and set the timer,"" harris explained. ""they would swap out one set of ppe while the other set was being disinfected."" 
 ultraviolet light can damage plastic items, but harris and his colleagues didn't attempt to evaluate how many disinfection cycles the ppe could withstand. ""you would expect uv to ultimately degrade ppe materials in the same way that sunlight slowly degrades polymer materials,"" he said. 
 the research team designed the chambers to provide the level of uv exposure that earlier studies had shown would inactivate the closely related sars-cov virus by damaging its outer shell and rna. the researchers did not attempt to evaluate the ability of the uv light to inactivate the sars-cov-2 virus that causes covid-19. 
 other engineering considerations included the need for cooling the uv sources, providing consistent exposure of the ppe to uv light using reflective walls in the chambers, and protecting the mercury vapor lamps from damage during use. 
 ultraviolet light is now used in water and wastewater sanitation, food disinfection, killing pathogens in hvac systems, and other purposes. because of the growing number of applications, finding enough mercury vapor lamps and led sources was a challenge for the research program, which was funded by gtri's independent research and development program. 
 harris hopes the project will encourage others to further develop uv-based portable disinfection systems to supplement other methods for protecting people who encounter the coronavirus. 
 ""this work is part of a realization that multiple tools - including handwashing, surface disinfection, face masks, uv disinfection, social distancing, and other steps - are important and much more powerful when done together,"" he said. ""we should all use every tool we have at our disposal to combat this virus and really think about things carefully to break every link in the chain of contagious transmission."" 
 beyond harris, the research team included roger campbell, ashton hattori, eric brown, christopher hollis, max schureck, howard atchley, john stone, michael grady, and benjamin yang.

 a new technique could give women and their oncologists more personalized information for choosing breast cancer treatment options. 
 georgia tech / emory university biomedical engineering associate professor manu platt (standing) and graduate student keon-young park examine gels that display the activity levels of cathepsins, which are protein-degrading enzymes. in a new study, the researchers are studying levels of cathepsins and other signaling chemicals in an effort to predict the invasiveness of breast cancer in individual patients. (credit: gary meek, georgia tech)

 - atlanta, ga 
 biomedical engineers have demonstrated a proof-of-principle technique that could give women and their oncologists more personalized information to help them choose options for treating breast cancer. thanks to diagnostic tests, clinicians and patients can already know the type of breast cancer they're up against, but one big question remains: how likely is it that the cancer will invade other parts of the body? answering that question could help guide the choice of treatment options, from aggressive and difficult therapies to more conservative ones. by studying chemical signals from specific cells that are involved in helping cancer invade other tissues in each woman's body, researchers have developed a predictive model that could provide an invasiveness index for each patient. ""we want women to have more information to make a personal decision beyond the averages calculated for an entire population,"" said 
 manu platt , an associate professor in the 
 department of biomedical engineering at georgia tech and emory university . ""we are using our systems biology tools and predictive medicine approaches to look at potential markers we could use to help us understand the risk each woman has. this would provide information for a more educated discussion of treatment options."" the research, sponsored with funds from the georgia research alliance and the giglio family donation to the department of biomedical engineering, was reported september 9 in the journal scientific reports. beyond breast cancer, the technique could offer similar decision-making assistance for men with prostate cancer, where treatment also requires making difficult choices about the risk of metastasis. platt's research team is examining chemical signals produced by the macrophages that can help aggressive tumors invade new tissues. macrophages normally clean up foreign particles and harmful microorganisms in the body, but aggressive tumors can enlist macrophages in helping them metastasize. tumor associated macrophages contribute significantly to tumor invasion, with cysteine cathepsin proteases - enzymes that break down proteins in the body - important contributors. to develop their predictive index, platt's research team used variability in macrophage expression of four types of cathepsin, the cathepsin inhibitor cystatin c, and kinase activation levels. the model, which has been under development for two years, was produced by studying macrophages from a population of women who didn't have breast cancer. platt and colleagues keon-young park and gande li co-cultured a standard breast cancer cell line (mcf-7) with macrophages produced from monocytes donated by these cancer-free women. next, they measured the level of invasiveness facilitated by macrophages from each individual donor, exposing the cancer cells and macrophages to a collagen gel designed to simulate breast tissue and measuring how many cells invaded it. while the breast is composed of many other tissues, collagen makes up the largest proportion and provided a good measure of how aggressively the cells would invade, platt said. platt's team correlated the level of invasion through the gel to the chemical signals being expressed by the macrophages. the researchers were surprised at the large amount of patient-to-patient variability in macrophage activity - variability that could account for the outcome differences in the patients receiving similar cancer treatments. the signaling levels and related invasion measurements were used to train a computational model developed by platt's team. the researchers next obtained blood samples containing monocytes from nine patients being treated for breast cancer at dekalb medical center, a major atlanta-area hospital. they measured signals from these macrophages and used their model - which had been trained on macrophage signaling and resulting invasiveness - to predict which of the cancer patients would be expected to have more invasive types of cancer. they compared their predications to what the clinician - dr. john kennedy - provided as their initial diagnosis. ""based on the cells we got from the clinic, the ones that had been predicted to have the greatest potential for invasion were the ones that had produced the most invasive form of breast cancer in the patients,"" platt said. while the study could not account for possible differences in the length of time the cancers had been growing, they did correlate well with observations. in future research, platt hopes to follow the women for five years to determine if the model's predictions are related to cancer recurrence. he also plans to expand the model with additional macrophage data, and test it against additional blood samples. ""the more information you give the model, the closer you get to the prediction,"" he said. ""we think this is a very big start."" the strength of this technique, platt believes, is that it measures what's happening at the level where cancer is metastasizing. ""we are measuring at the level of activity of these intracellular enzymes and the ultimate activity of the proteases they produce that are not only the biomarkers of the tumor, but also help the tumor grow,"" he said. ""everything about us is different. our genetics are different and our lifestyles are different, so clinicians have to make decisions in all that variability. all of those differences can be measured and captured in this output."" platt believes the technique could one day lead to a simple blood test that would provide information useful in making therapy recommendations. the test might also help determine which women should be monitored more closely to detect the beginnings of a cancer. ""together, this establishes proof-of-principle that personalized information acquired from minimally invasive blood draws may provide useful information to inform oncologists and patients of invasive / metastatic risk, helping to make decisions regard radical mastectomy or milder, conservative treatments to save patients from hardship and surgical recovery,"" he wrote in the paper. citation : keon-young park, gande li and manu o. platt, ""monocyte-derived macrophage assisted breasat cancer cell invasion as a personalized, predictive metric to score metastatic risk,"" (scientific reports 2015).

 president barack obama received a report today from a bipartisan commission that 
 addresses 
 cybersecurity challenges facing government and industry. annie antón, professor and chair of the georgia tech school of interactive computing, served on the commission on enhancing national cybersecurity. she said the report includes opportunities for new research and advances in engineering. 
 the commission 
 issued its consensus report 
 addressing six imperatives and offering action items that can be implemented by president-elect donald trump and his team. 
 antón highlighted recommended steps that would be of special interest to georgia tech students, faculty and researchers. 
 the commission declared that cybersecurity should be a basic requirement for the accreditation of any programs in engineering and computing disciplines. 
 ""more than 1.5 million cybersecurity professionals are needed globally by 2020,"" antón said. 
 she also emphasized the recommendation that all iot (internet of things) devices should be secure by default. these devices include everything from refrigerators to fitness trackers to the drill of an oil rig. 
 ""this is a game changer because it takes the burden off the end users and places it on the engineers and manufacturers who design and create iot products,"" she said. 
 another action item calls on the federal government to make the development of usable, affordable and inherently secure resilient systems its top priority for cybersecurity research and development. 
 antón also stressed a recommendation for the federal government to support cybersecurity-focused research in traditionally underfunded areas such as policy, law and the social impacts of privacy and security technologies, as well as issues specific to small and medium-sized businesses. 
 ""this highlights the need for more interdisciplinary classes and research,"" she said. ""it became clear to the commission that the human factors of cybersecurity are not well understood and require focused research nationally."" 
 georgia tech is already working in the area through programs such as the institute's privacy technology, policy and law course, antón said. 
 the commission was created in february by presidential executive order as part of the cybersecurity national action plan. the group, which has been working since april, was tasked with making detailed recommendations on ways to strengthen cybersecurity in public and private sectors. 
 the 12-person nonpartisan commission included cybersecurity experts from government, academia and industry. 
 ""the quality of thoughtful deliberation and debate among the commissioners was inspiring throughout this past year,"" antón said. ""debates were not held along party lines, but instead were constructive and focused solely on determining what was best for our nation and for securing the digital economy."" 
 antón, an expert on software compliance with federal privacy and security regulations, has served on a number of privacy and security advisory boards, including for the u.s. department of homeland security and the national institute of standards and technologies.

 a team of researchers is now using what they've learned about bio-circuits to lay the groundwork for the future of programmable medicine.

 - atlanta, ga 
 in the world of synthetic biology, the development of foundational components like logic gates and genetic clocks has enabled the design of circuits with increasing complexity, including the ability to solve math problems, build autonomous robots, and play interactive games. a team of researchers at the georgia institute of technology is now using what they've learned about bio-circuits to lay the groundwork for the future of programmable medicine. 
 looking like any other small vial of clear liquid, these programmable drugs would communicate directly with our biological systems, dynamically responding to the information flowing through our bodies to automatically deliver proper doses where and when they are needed. these future medicines might even live inside us throughout our lives, fighting infection, detecting cancer and other diseases, essentially becoming a therapeutic biological extension of ourselves. 
 we are years away from that, but the insights gained from research in gabe kwong's lab are moving us closer with the development of ‘enzyme computers' - engineered bio-circuits designed with biological components, with the capacity to expand and augment living functions. 
 ""the long-term vision is this concept of programmable immunity,"" said 
 kwong , associate professor in the 
 wallace h. coulter department of biomedical engineering 
 at georgia tech and emory university, who partnered with fellow researcher brandon holt on the paper, "" protease circuits for processing biological information ,"" published oct. 6 in the journal 
 nature communications . the research was sponsored by the national institutes of health. 
 the story of this paper begins two years ago when, holt said, ""our lab has a rich history of developing enzyme-based diagnostics; eventually we started thinking about these systems as computers, which led us to design simple logic gates, such as and gates and or gates. this project grew organically and we realized that there were other devices we can build, like comparators and analog-digital convertors. eventually this led to the idea of taking an analog-to-digital converter and using that to digitize bacterial activity."" 
 ultimately, they assembled cell-free bio-circuits that can combine with bacteria-infected blood, ""with the basic idea that it would quantify the bacterial infection - the number of bacteria - then calculate and release a selective drug dose, essentially in real time,"" said holt, a ph.d. student in kwong's 
 laboratory for synthetic immunity 
 and lead author of the paper. 
 the researchers sought to construct bio-circuits that use protease activity to process biological information under a digital or analog framework (proteases are enzymes that break down proteins into smaller polypeptides and amino acids). the team built its analog-to-digital converter with a tiny device, made only of biological materials, that changed signals from bacteria into ones and zeroes. then, the circuit used these numbers to choose the proper dosage of drugs needed to kill the bacteria without overdosing. 
 that's the traditional approach - bio-circuits digitizing molecular signals, allowing operations to be carried out by boolean logic. the second part of the team's new paper takes a more nuanced approach, with a focus on analog circuits as opposed to digital. ""we treat protease activity as multi-valued, signals between one and zero,"" holt said. 
 that multi-valued approach led to yet another idea, and ultimately to the bigger picture of analog bio-circuits. 
 ""we got tempted by this idea of fuzzy logic, where you can think about what happens if there's a signal between zero and one,"" he added. ""that's more like an analog circuit. we were really inspired by this concept, so we decided to build analog bio-circuits with the same basic materials as before - proteases and peptides. and we were able to solve a mathematical oracle problem, learning parity with noise."" 
 the ability to process information from the biomolecular environment with an analog framework is critical, according to kwong. 
 ""fuzzy logic is interesting because biology doesn't think in zeroes and ones,"" he said. ""biology operates as a spectrum. so if you think about enzymatic activity, it's never just on and off. it's on, and the activity can be anywhere between zero and one. so the long term goal is to recognize that biology is not as simple as a digital electronic circuit. you actually need some capacity to work with analog signals.""

promising-fingerprint-extraterrestrial-life.txt,"a promising fingerprint of extraterrestrial life 
 scientists are developing the use of dynamic biosignatures - based on seasonal changes in the earth's atmosphere - in the search for life in distant planets. 
 may 21, 2018 
 - atlanta, ga 
 for the foreseeable future, the only real tool to find life on potentially habitable planets that are light years away from earth is to probe their atmospheres for biological fingerprints of life, called biosignatures. 
 this approach has two drawbacks, according to school of earth and atmospheric sciences assistant professor christopher reinhard. ""some biosignatures can be made by abiotic processes, leading to false positives. others can be masked by processes that consume biosignatures, leading to false negatives."" 
 to overcome these problems, reinhard and colleagues in the nasa astrobiology institute alternative earths and virtual planetary laboratory teams are proposing use of dynamic biosignatures based on seasonal changes in earth's atmosphere. the approach - described recently in 
 astrophysical journal letters 
 - uses the seasonal variation of biologically important gases as a way to deal with false positives and false negatives, reinhard says. 
 seasonality of atmospheric gases 
 as earth orbits the sun, its tilted axis means different regions receive more rays at different times of the year. the most visible signs of this phenomenon are changes in the weather and length of the days, but atmospheric composition is also affected. for example, in the northern hemisphere, which contains most the world's vegetation, plant growth in summer results in noticeably lower levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. the reverse is true for oxygen. 
 ""atmospheric seasonality is a promising biosignature because it is biologically modulated on earth and is likely to occur on other inhabited worlds,"" says lead author stephanie olson, a graduate student in the 
 department of earth sciences 
 of the university of california, riverside (ucr). ""inferring life based on seasonality wouldn't require a detailed understanding of alien biochemistry because it arises as a biological response to seasonal changes in the environment, rather than as a consequence of a specific biological activity that might be unique to earth."" 
 in the study - funded by the nasa astrobiology institute and the national science foundation frontiers in earth system dynamics - the researchers identify the opportunities and pitfalls in monitoring the seasonal ebbs and flows of oxygen, carbon dioxide, methane, and ozone. they also modeled fluctuations of atmospheric oxygen on a life-bearing planet with low oxygen content, just as earth was billions of years ago. ""based on these evaluations,"" reinhard says, ""seasonal variations in ozone could be a sensitive biosignature on planets with undetectable levels of oxygen in their atmospheres."" 
 ozone as indicator of life 
 at georgia tech, the reinhard research group develops comprehensive models for the production and maintenance of robust atmospheric biosignatures on habitable planets, and it played a key role in developing the concept of ozone seasonality as a fingerprint for life on low-oxygen planets. the idea emerged in part as an answer to the ""biosignature blind spot"" problem reinhard and colleagues posed in the 2017 
 astrobiology 
 paper "" false negatives for remote life detection on ocean-bearing planets: lessons from early earth ."" 
 ""we are particularly excited about the prospect of characterizing oxygen fluctuations at the low levels we would expect to find on an early version of earth,"" says timothy lyons, a professor of biogeochemistry in ucr's department of earth science and director of the 
 alternative earths astrobiology center . ""seasonal variations as revealed by ozone would be most readily detectable on a planet like earth was billions of years ago, when most life was still microscopic and ocean dwelling."" 
 ""although we think the conceptual framework for this approach is robust,"" reinhard says, ""observing and quantifying seasonality represents a daunting challenge. research will need to take into account modulation of seasonal signals by the angle at which we observe a planet and the shape of its orbit, among other factors. nevertheless, seasonality represents a potentially powerful approach toward finding life beyond our solar system.""

 if you've spent even an hour or two on chatgpt or another generative ai model, you know that getting it to generate the content you want can be challenging and even downright frustrating. 
 prompt engineering is the process of crafting and refining a specific, detailed prompt - one that will get you the response you need from a generative ai model. this kind of ""coding in english"" is a complex and tricky process. fortunately, our faculty at the ivan allen college of liberal arts at georgia tech are engaged in teaching and research in this exciting emerging field. 
 i met with assistant professor 
 yeqing kong 
 in the school of literature, media, and communication to talk about prompt engineering. she shared three approaches to crafting a prompt that she has collected from leading experts, and invited me to try them out on a prompt.

 more than 60 research groups worldwide are now developing variations of the triboelectric nanogenerator (teng), which converts ambient mechanical energy into electricity for powering wearable electronics, sensor networks, implantable medical devices and other small systems. to provide a means for both comparing and selecting these energy-harvesting nanogenerators for specific applications, the georgia institute of technology research group that pioneered the teng technology has now proposed a set of standards for quantifying device performance. the proposal evaluates both the structural and materials performance of the four major types of teng devices. ""triboelectric nanogenerators are a new energy technology that has shown phenomenal potential,"" said 
 zhong lin wang , a regents professor in the georgia tech 
 school of materials science and engineering. 
 ""here, we have proposed standards by which the performance of these devices can be quantified and compared. these standards will be useful for academic researchers developing the devices and for future industrial applications of the nanogenerators."" the proposed standards are described in an article published september 25 in the journal 
 nature communications . triboelectric nanogenerators use a combination of the triboelectric effect and electrostatic induction to generate small amount of electrical power from mechanical motion such as rotation, sliding or vibration. the triboelectric effect takes advantage of the fact that certain materials become electrically charged after they come into moving contact with a surface made from a different material. the electricity generated by teng devices could replace or supplement batteries for a broad range of potential applications. developed over the past several years, the technology has advanced to the point where it can power small electronic devices, potentially enabling widespread sensing and infrastructure systems - as well as powering wearable consumer devices. ""because of the large number of devices being developed, people need to have a standard for judging the performance of these nanogenerators,"" wang said. he noted that standards have allowed technologies such as photovoltaics and thermoelectric devices to advance, though the performance of teng devices is more difficult to quantify because of the different design and materials options available. in their paper, wang's team proposes a general figure of merit which can be used to quantify the potential energy output of the teng devices. the general figure of merit is made up of information from two other sources: the capabilities of the specific teng structure used, and the surface charge density provided by the specific materials chosen to construct the device. the output is compared to the mechanical energy inputs to provide an efficiency comparison. these measurements are based on plots of the build-up of voltage and total transferred electrical charges from each device. the structural figures of merit are derived from theoretical calculations for each of the four major nanogenerator modes, plus experimental results produced by teng devices placed into a circuit with a switch and an electrical load. the materials figure of merit depends on experimental measurements of the surface charge density done with an experimental set-up that uses liquid metal to collect the surface charge. variations in teng structures allow a variety of applications depending on the source of mechanical energy. the four major groups include (1) vertical contact-separation mode, (2) lateral sliding mode, (3) single-electron mode, and (4) freestanding triboelectric-layer mode. there are also hybrid combinations of these major structural modes. the contact-separation mode, for example, is powered by a periodic driving force that causes repeated contact, and then separation, between two dissimilar materials that have coated electrodes on the top and bottom surfaces. the lateral sliding model uses two surfaces that briefly slide together, then separate, generating a charge. ""we can calculate for the four modes what are the best sizes and shapes, and the best power output you can expect for a specific structural figure of merit,"" wang explained. material choices tested include fluorinated ethylene propylene, kapton, polarized polyvinylidene fluoride, polyethylene, natural rubber and cellulose. the measurement and theoretical techniques were developed by postdoctoral fellow yunlong zi and graduate student simiao niu, both members of wang's research team. in developing their proposed standards, the researchers considered what had already been done in setting standards for heat engines and other technologies. ""for triboelectric generators, because the mechanical input is varied, you have different kinds of measurements to evaluate the performance,"" said zi. ""these figures of merit are considerably more complicated than would be needed for characterizing solar cell performance, for example."" publishing the proposed standards is a first step in what wang expects to be a long process of gaining acceptance. he plans to spend the next several months explaining the standards to other research groups developing teng devices. he estimates that there could be 60 research groups around the world working on teng devices, and he expects that number to grow as the nanogenerators become more sophisticated and powerful. ""as wearable electronics become more popular and fashionable, we will need a better way to power them,"" wang said. ""triboelectric nanogenerators can play a large role in that. we have spent a lot of time improving the power efficiency, and the field is quickly expanding."" ultimately, he said, the standards could also be modified for piezoelectric generators and other systems designed to produce electricity from mechanical motion. citation : yunlong zi, et al., ""standards and figures of merit for quantifying the performance of triboelectric nanogenerators,"" (nature communications, 2015).

 stargazers are invited to the georgia tech observatory for public nights this semester. the next event is thursday, march 10, from 7 to 9 p.m. on the grounds between the howey and mason buildings. several telescopes will be set up for viewing, or you may bring your own telescope. 
 jim sowell, principal academic professional and director of the georgia tech observatory, is excited that public nights have returned after a break during the pandemic. ""i describe my role these days as a tour guide, and i greatly enjoy hearing the squeals and gasps as people see craters on the moon, or the rings of saturn, or moons orbiting jupiter,"" he said. ""a clear evening with some celestial objects visible is as much a delight for me as it is for the visitors."" 
 sowell and members of the georgia tech astronomy club will be available to answer questions. the viewing targets for march 10 are the moon and orion nebula. successful viewing depends on clear weather, so visitors should check for updates on the 
 astronomy website . the event is free but remember to pay for parking if you use a visitor lot. 
 two more public nights will be held this spring, on april 7 from 8:30 to 10:30 p.m. and on may 5 from 9 to 11 p.m.

 daren hubbard talks about the role of it at a research university.

 - atlanta, ga 
 daren hubbard is georgia tech's new chief information officer (cio) and vice president for information technology. he came from wayne state university, where he was the cio and associate vice president for computing and information. 
 at tech hubbard provides vision, leadership, and oversight in the development and implementation of information technology. he also is a member of the institute's recovery task force and he was recently asked to direct all covid-19-related infrastructure and technology activities. 
 at his office in the coda building, hubbard recently sat for a conversation that ranged from how he views the role of it at a research university to his love of corvettes, novelty socks, and donuts. 
 what attracted you to georgia tech? 
 the reputation of the institution, at a national and international level, is attractive in and of itself. it's the kind of place where you want to take your career. 
 the whole interview process really got me excited about the opportunity. knowing where you're going to be working and who you're going to be working with is more important to me than some of the other environmental aspects. after talking to kelly fox [executive vice president for administration and finance] and to president cabrera - i don't think there's anybody who can talk to president cabrera and not get excited about georgia tech - and meeting everyone else on the search committee virtually, it was a done deal. 
 i also had the benefit of visiting atlanta probably every summer for the last 25 years. i have friends here, and my godsons attended centennial place elementary school. i remember atlantic station being built, and i had a membership to the georgia aquarium prior to moving here. no one had to sell me on atlanta. also, you can't ask anybody from the state of michigan if they are sad about leaving the michigan winters. 
 you have only been at georgia tech for about five weeks. is it what you expected, or is it different? 
 any early takeaways regarding opportunities or challenges? 
 i have reflected on this a lot. it is both new and strangely familiar. some of the problems may be a little different in a scale, obviously, but challenges at georgia tech are the same as at wayne state - really trying to align the mission of the institution with the conditions on the ground. people have many competing ideas about how to do things. resources may not necessarily be distributed equitably, leaving our team working to balance that out. 
 the early takeaways are the consistent themes that have really forged my career. i have been doing this type of work for more than 20 years. during that time, i have developed a personal set of core values that work really well, and i am able to apply them over and over again. 
 at georgia tech i am trying to build great partnerships across campus. we are coming to the table to support you, not necessarily to create something that's just cool and has a wow factor. it's about creating an excellent experience. i think that applies to everyone on the campus, entire communities of students, faculty, and staff - making sure that the work they need to do is as effortless as possible. 
 i want to make sure we have a great work environment for our team. if you feel good about what you're doing, it shows in your work and enables you to create an excellent experience for the people you support. 
 the last thing we do is to really focus on continuous improvement. make sure that people don't see the same problem again, and try to make the experience better the next time. we want to make sure that people have the tools to do what they do. 
 you started at tech during the coronavirus pandemic 
 - 
 when the majority of students, faculty, and staff were working remotely and depending on tech's technology infrastructure to stay connected. how was that experience? 
 our ability to transition from having a fully on-campus experience to a remote experience didn't happen the day the pandemic started. those are investments that were made over time. it was the good work of people in this division and across campus, making those choices, investing in tools, and really getting folks up to speed before the pandemic. we didn't know everyone was going to have to work from home. but we did know that some people would need to be able to collaborate and have meetings in a remote fashion, so we were building the infrastructure just in case. tech is now seeing the dividends of investments made three or four years ago. we have to continue to make investments and strategically select tools that are going to be here today and hopefully here for us tomorrow. 
 one thing that we're going to see coming out of this pandemic is that our workforce may not need to be physically here in atlanta. that means we can compete with either coast or globally for the best talent. it presents a new opportunity for universities. 
 it is often seen as a support function. how do you view it? 
 i don't believe it's necessarily a bad thing to be a support function. for example, this building has big pillars that support the floors. they have to be here or the building will fall. however, another way to view it is as a facilitator of some of the innovation that's coming from the subject matter experts who we are fortunate to work with. it always has the opportunity to help people accelerate what they're doing at its core. that is what all this stuff is intended to do - to enable people to be more productive, creative, and innovative. as long as we have an opportunity to be a partner with folks, to listen to what they want to do and what they can do, we can bring all the different tools and capabilities we have to the table. 
 what keeps you awake at night? 
 there is always a - and it's not even existential anymore - real and present danger surrounding data security of the intellectual property assets that a place like georgia tech generates on a daily basis. i wrote a paper in graduate school about how the very nature of universities makes them a target for bad guys. if you are looking to steal something, you want something new. universities literally create new ideas and opportunities every day. that data has a high value, and it's part of our job to help facilitate the protection of those assets. but, in general, the thing that keeps me up at night is the question of whether we are doing enough. are we communicating well enough? are we creating a culture that enables people to collaborate. 
 what do you enjoy doing when you're not working? 
 being from detroit, i grew up following the auto industry the way some people follow sports. so, there's an automotive enthusiast lurking inside of me. i drive a practical car now, but right before i moved down here i sold my 2017 corvette stingray. while it was fun, that car is not just a car. it's a whole lifestyle. 
 i did a little photography in high school and college, and i recently started getting back into it, mainly photographing cars and buildings. i had initially gone to college to become an architect. i still love buildings and studying the use of space, but now i just photograph them. 
 tell me something that most people don't know about you. 
 i have been collecting and wearing novelty socks for 30 years. i have all kinds, for every occasion. yesterday was ‘taco tuesday' so i wore my taco socks. 
 it began in college. i wanted to express myself beyond wearing the standard ‘preppy' clothes. i bought a pair of fun socks, and i started saving them for a special occasion. but once you start saving something it becomes this mythical thing, so you can't just pull them out and wear them any time. about three years after i bought the socks i still had not worn them. then i met someone and had a date planned for the weekend. i told my friends i was excited about the date, and they asked if i thought she was worthy of my socks. i said yes. i wore my special socks, and the date was great. my date, tanya, later became my wife. we just celebrated our 25th wedding anniversary in august. 
 another thing most people don't know is that i really love donuts. but donuts don't love me, so i have constructed a framework for how i can enjoy them. i call it oktoberfest because my birthday is oct. 3. so, for the month of october i eat as many donuts as i want, but i don't eat them the rest of the year. last weekend i went to revolution donuts, and i also like sublime donuts. i want to live as long as i can, so this framework allows me to enjoy donuts while minimizing the health risk.

qcells-expansion-puts-focus-georgia-techs-iworks-program.txt,"qcells expansion puts focus on georgia tech's iworks program 
 offering connects employers and community leaders with resources to drive economic development success 
 lisa nash is qcells' senior director of human resources; environmental, health, and safety; and general affairs. 
 jan 27, 2023 
 - atlanta, ga 
 the good news: northwest georgia is slated to get a big economic development boost following a major announcement and planned company expansion that promises to create 3,500 new jobs. the challenge: in this still-tight job market, where's a company to start? 
 when the company in question is dalton-based solar-panel manufacturer  qcells , which has a 1,000-employee dalton expansion set to begin manufacturing in august and a second expansion bringing 2,500 employees to bartow county in 2024, a logical place to start is georgia tech's  enterprise innovation institute . 
 specifically:  iworks . 
 the organization - technically named igniting workforce opportunities and reinforcing knowledge and skills - operates in northwest georgia and launched in 2017 out of former gov. nathan deal's high demand career initiative (hdci). that initiative brought together the university system of georgia, technical college system of georgia, k-12 school systems in georgia, and the private sector to help fill workforce gaps in high demand fields like advanced manufacturing in the northwest part of the state. 
 ""we see ourselves in a facilitator role making connections,"" said leigh hopkins, the iworks project manager and senior project manager for  center for economic development research  (cedr). 
 iworks is a program of cedr, which is housed in the enterprise innovation institute, georgia tech's comprehensive economic development unit. iworks is able to connect the dots in northwest georgia because cedr has been working on projects including strategic plans and workforce development there since 2012. for example, iworks recently sponsored a job fair, where 106 people found employment, including several who went to work at qcells. 
 ""we also had a webinar in november called after the ribbon cutting, that addressed what happens after these big announcements like the one from qcells are made,"" hopkins said. ""how is the community supposed to find people to fill the jobs that are coming?"" 
 it's an important topic for the region of about 700,000 people, and just one reason the iworks board includes representatives from local manufacturers such as qcells, economic and workforce developers, technical college representatives, and others, who work in concert to help deliver a growing and educated workforce to the region. one key to ensuring that new industry and new expansions can be successful. 
 ""iworks is a trusted partner and conduit in helping our member companies and organizations work together to address common issues,"" said candice mckie, cedr project manager. ""we have the ability to have all of the key players in one room to discuss some of the same shared workforce challenges, and to be able to relay that information to the development authorities, the chambers, and the school systems, instead of having to go to those groups individually."" 
 lisa nash, the senior director of human resources; environmental, health, and safety; and general affairs at qcells, echoed mckie's sentiments. 
 ""being a part of iworks puts at my fingertips the tools that i need to understand the region,"" nash said, explaining why she is so committed to the organization's mission. ""as an hr professional in this labor market, i have to understand what everyone else is doing. i need to know what other company is expanding, what other company is maybe not doing so well, what's going to impact our labor market, and what's happening from a wage perspective."" 
 iworks gives her a place to learn all of that in one monthly meeting. 
 ""iworks understands the industry and they understand this region, and the needs of the business leaders in order to be successful,"" nash said. ""being a part of iworks gives me a bird's eye view of what i need or what countermeasures i need to put in place to be prepared for obstacles or challenges."" 
 while iworks is many things, it isn't a problem solver, she said. ""they give you the ideas and the connections for you to solve your problems, for you to be able to come up with resources, they connect you with so many resources."" 
 some of those resources are the webinars iworks has facilitated. in addition to after the ribbon cutting, the organization as focused on topics such as affordable housing, another key component of a successful workforce, and nontraditional hiring, which includes successful second-chance programs for people who have been released from prison. 
 ""what we hear from manufacturers is that they're beating their heads against the wall trying to find employees,"" said hopkins. ""we've found that people who come from a second chance background, people who are really targeted with employment opportunities, are much more successful and the employers are better able to retain them than folks who just fill out an application."" 
 iworks also puts together tours of manufacturing facilities, including qcells, for area high school students, who may not know what they want to do after graduation. ""just getting exposure to industry has been very helpful for the students,"" says hopkins. 
 other programs include be pro be proud, an initiative led by the cherokee county office of economic development that introduces high school students to a variety of industries through a hands-on mobile lab. iworks sponsored the mobile workshop's visits to 10 high schools across the region. ""we had a total of 963 students visit the mobile workshop, and 86% of those signed up to receive information and career opportunities that are related to their industry of interest,"" said mckie. 
 iworks is also working to help expand project purpose, a summer program that connects high school students to companies in the area. 
 the goal of all these programs is to help local companies and those that are moving into the region find the well-trained workforce they need. and while the work just got 3,500 times harder, the iworks board is excited about the expansion of qcells. 
 ""it's important for our board to stay flexible and fluid,"" said john zegers, co-chair of the iworks board and northwest georgia regional manager for the enterprise innovation institute's  georgia manufacturing extension partnership . ""that flexibility allows us to move where the need is and where the trends go. i think the makeup of our board is perfect for that, because we're all on the front lines, we know what's going on, and we'll be able to keep our group relevant for what's needed out there."" 
 despite her extremely busy schedule as the dalton expansion barrels toward august, nash says she isn't about to give up her seat on iworks' board. 
 ""iworks is committed to connecting education and the workforce so that we have a sustainable workforce for the future of manufacturing,"" she said. ""they're starting younger and younger getting these kids interested in industry. i think iworks does a really good job of balancing the current workforce and the future workforce.""

rare-genetic-spotlight-health-disparities-ibd.txt,"a rare genetic spotlight on health disparities for ibd 
 in a new study, georgia tech researchers investigated whether 25 rare gene variants known to be associated with inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) play a role in risk for african americans. 
 greg gibson and courtney astore 
 nov 15, 2023 
 the advent of whole genome sequencing technology has prompted an explosion in research into how genetics are associated with disease risk. but the vast majority of genetics research has been done on people of european ancestry, and genetics researchers have realized that in order to address health disparities, more needs to be done. 
 in a new study, georgia tech researchers investigated whether 25 rare gene variants known to be associated with inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) play a role in risk for african americans. while the rare variant associations were recently discovered in individuals of european ancestry, contributing to about 15% of cases, it was unknown if and how those same rare gene variants might affect risk for african americans. 
 led by 
 greg gibson , regents' professor and tom and marie patton chair in the school of 
 biological sciences , the study highlights the importance of considering genetic diversity and the mixing of ancestry in genetics research. the findings were 
 published 
 in the journal 
 genome medicine . 
 ""because of major advancements in the last decade, we now know that most diseases are far more complex than we originally thought, in terms of genetics,"" said gibson, who is also director of the 
 center for integrative genomics 
 at georgia tech. ""understanding whether genetic differences contribute to health disparities is a major point of focus for current genetics research, and we had an opportunity to test one idea with this study."" 
 today, african americans have a similar prevalence of various types of ibd as european americans. but progression is often much worse: african americans are more likely to progress to severe disease requiring colectomies and other major interventions. 
 courtney astore, a ph.d. student in gibson's lab and first author on the paper, wanted to assess whether those same rare variants would have a similar effect on ibd risk in african americans. in a collaboration with subra kugathasan from emory university and the nih's ibd genetics consortium, gibson's lab had analyzed the complete genome sequences of over 3,000 genomes of african americans, half with ibd. astore used that database to conduct her analysis. 
 she started by plotting the difference in frequency of the rare variants, and quickly realized that there was a significant reduction in prevalence of the variants in african americans. through further computations, she estimated that european ancestry variants actually only made a very small contribution to ibd in african americans (around 44 additional cases per 100,000 people), fourfold less than americans of european ancestry. 
 ""prior to our analysis, we suspected that admixture may play a role in the presence of ibd-associated rare variants in african americans,"" astore said. ""when i saw the differences, that was when i realized that there was something important there that we needed to discover."" 
 astore then used a method known as chromosome painting, which is a tool for visualizing where each segment of the genome comes from. she showed that the rare variants found in african americans were almost always located on segments of european ancestry genomes. 
 in simple terms, the location of the variants indicated that the genes resulted from admixture - a scientific term for mixing of genetic backgrounds throughout ancestry - which enabled astore to show that the mutations had arisen outside of africa, and only began to appear in people of african ancestry over the last dozen generations. 
 to conclude the study, gibson and astore assessed the presence of other rare variants associated with a dozen other diseases, which similarly confirmed that the presence of the variants contributes to african americans generally through admixture. 
 the findings are important for several reasons. first, they highlight the value of considering genetic diversity and admixture in all genetics research, and especially when investigating rare variants and their associations with complex disease. while they showed that the european variants were rare in african americans, there are almost certainly rare variants that contribute to ibd in african americans that have yet to be discovered and may point to biological mechanisms. 
 ""doing more genetic studies on diverse populations, and especially those that have admixture, is going to be pivotal for therapeutic discovery,"" astore said. 
 precision medicine will eventually be tailored to a person's genome, which means that in some cases knowing the identity of rare variants will help guide therapy. if that is the case, knowing the context of ancestry will be beneficial. it also means that if more research on diverse ancestry groups isn't done, then new treatments might not be effective for all people. the team also emphasizes that genetics is not the only factor contributing to risk for complex diseases like ibd, and their study simply highlights that it cannot be assumed that genetic discoveries are risk factors for all people. 
 ""our study emphasizes that in order to move in the direction of greater health equity, it is absolutely crucial to do large-scale genetic sequencing for african americans and all ancestry groups,"" gibson said. ""we hope our work will encourage more research on both social determinants of health and the genetics of ibd across ancestries."" 
 note: the 
 ibd genetics consortium , of which gibson is a part, organized the cohort of african americans with ibd, and their samples were gathered at institutes across the country, including emory university, johns hopkins university, rutgers university, cedars sinai los angeles, and mt. sinai new york.

 - atlanta, ga 
 last summer, georgia tech launched a program that brought nearly 40 high-school students face-to-face with real, goal-oriented university research. known as the science, technology and engineering pipeline (step), the ambitious program is returning for a second year, having won praise from both participating students and their teachers. all step projects directly contribute to ongoing undergraduate- or graduate-level research work. this year, the program is conducted under the auspices of the georgia tech aerospace systems design laboratory (asdl) and the nasa georgia space grant consortium (gsgc). the two-month program is free to those who are accepted. the atlanta-area students work in teams, advised by georgia tech research scientists and graduate students who serve as mentors. ""interest in the program has been strong all spring, and applications have come in at a pretty high rate,"" said kelly griendling, a georgia tech research engineer who designed and directed the step program. ""i've gotten a lot of emails that basically say, ‘i heard from my friend that this was a great program, and i'd like to do it.' "" last summer's two-month program, she explained, dropped a wide range of knotty aerospace and vehicle related problems into the laps of student teams. the teams worked on portions of these real-world projects, and what the students achieved went to advance those projects. the students could ask for help from their mentors when necessary, but most of the time they worked on their own. kelly ingle, a teacher at kennesaw mountain high school who is familiar with step, believes that the students who participated in last summer's program experienced ""real life,"" gaining independence, improving problem-solving abilities, and learning to be team players in actual research. ""i have two students in my current classes who attended step last summer,"" ingle said. ""watching their approach to research this semester, it's evident to me that the step experience was beneficial."" the atmosphere in the step research laboratories last summer seemed both highly enthusiastic and very serious. on one late-july afternoon, a visitor to step found a 10th grade student working at a computer developing robotic-vision capability software for a u.s. navy autonomous boat concept. a few feet away, two 10th grade students were using a cad workstation to explore a nasa project that aims to move an asteroid millions of miles through space to a moon orbit. nearby, an 11th grader was trouble-shooting a hybrid-electric aircraft engine. at the next desk his colleagues were working on the hybrid engine itself, which had been designed to power an innovative unmanned aerial vehicle (uav) that was being developed by yet another step team. last summer's youthful researchers seemed to like step's throw-them-in-the-deep-end approach. nick tysver, a 10th grader from lithia springs high school who was on the autonomous boat / robotics vision team, told a visitor last summer: ""it was really interesting - on the first day the mentors were like, 'this is your project, get going.' that isn't at all like high school, where they inch you along - here they get you going in the right direction, and you know you're going to end up doing fine."" projects for the 2015 step session haven't been finalized. they will likely include both established and new research topics. both new students and some returning students will participate in this summer's program. ""gsgc is thrilled to be working with asdl to expand the highly effective program to multiple labs in aerospace engineering,"" said professor stephen ruffin, director of the gsgc. although summer 2015 applications have recently closed, interested parties can contact kelly griendling ( kelly.griendling@asdl.gatech.edu ) to inquire about applications for future semesters. during the 2014 session, most students participated on one of six teams: the hybrid electric team worked on an airborne hybrid-electric propulsion system designed by a georgia tech graduate student. the uav design team was tasked with designing an unmanned aircraft that would be powered by the hybrid electric engine. the asteroid capture team worked on a nasa plan to redirect an asteroid to a stable orbit around the moon, where astronauts can later visit it for research purposes. the quadrotor team was required to assemble and test several kits for quadrotors - small helicopters propelled by four propellers - and then design, build and test a custom quadrotor. the rotor / propeller testing team performed a series of wind-tunnel tests on various motor-propeller combinations, to gather data and make performance predictions that can be used to support vehicle design efforts. the autonomous boat team focused on developing software code for an autonomous boat design, as part of a naval engineering education center (neec) project.  research news georgia institute of technology 177 north avenue atlanta, georgia 30332-0181 usa media relations contact : john toon (404-894-6986) ( jtoon@gatech.edu ). writer : rick robinson

 researchers with georgia tech and emory university are field testing a new device that could help protect people who work outside from heat related injury. it's a skin patch you can wear while working that sends detailed information to a smartphone or other device about important health markers like skin hydration and body temperature. the device takes different measurements than health wearables on the market currently and will be paired with an artificial intelligence program to predict health hazards. the team is calling the device biopatch, and it's being put to the test with landscaping crews. researchers hope use of the device can guide better decisions about working in the heat. 
 the project involves collaboration between principal investigators vicki hertzberg from emory university, 
 w. hong yeo 
 from georgia tech, and li xiong from emory university. their expertise spans statistics, mechanical and biomedical engineering, and computer science, respectively. roxana chicas of the emory school of nursing and jeff sands of the emory school of medicine, along with members of the farmworker association of florida, are also part of the team. this video shows the device and data collection during a key component of testing during the summer.

rebuilding-after-natural-disaster.txt,"rebuilding after a natural disaster 
 georgia tech professors share their expertise on disaster recovery and smart infrastructure. 
 oct 27, 2022 
 - atlanta, ga 
 hurricane season may be coming to an end soon, but it's not without significant impact and devastation. two georgia tech experts offer their perspective on infrastructure and how to rebuild after severe weather events. 
 according to civil and environmental engineering professor  hermann fritz , ""there have been significant improvements in florida and gulf coast building codes over the past three decades. hurricane ian's impact was mostly storm surge and storm wave-driven, while the amount of wind damage was limited and highlights the success of advancing building codes since hurricane andrew."" 
 iris tien , associate professor in the school of civil and environmental engineering, points to hurricanes increasing in frequency and severity and says it's not enough to build based solely on what's happened in the past. ""we need to transform our thinking from reacting to events to becoming anticipatory and forward-looking. we don't want to build just to need to rebuild again when the next hurricane occurs. in creating resilient infrastructure, we need to anticipate what future events, loadings, shocks, and stressors our infrastructure is going to need to withstand, and build to those levels."" 
 fritz shares other experts' belief that storms are likely to become more frequent, and potentially larger, with higher wind speeds, storm surge, and other hazards. even in basins where storms have been rare, such as the arabian sea, there has been an increase in the frequency of storms, which may be linked to increasing sea surface temperature. 
 each city, state, and region has its own risk exposure, environmental conditions, and population characteristics. it is critical that builders, city planners, and infrastructure operators look to the future to anticipate what conditions are likely to look like and implement solutions that consider the range of possible storm impacts, as well as environment- and population-specific factors to create and tailor solutions for their specific community. 
 ""locations and types of infrastructure are both important to consider,"" tien said. ""we need to invest in infrastructure that is adaptive to varying levels of demands anticipated for these systems. we also need to invest in infrastructure where success is evaluated by community and population impacts. this will ensure infrastructure that is resilient, sustainable, and equitable in serving communities moving into the  future .""

 a new screening process could dramatically accelerate the identification of nanoparticles suitable for delivering therapeutic rna into living cells.

 oct 01, 2018 
 - atlanta, ga 
 a new screening process could dramatically accelerate the identification of nanoparticles suitable for delivering therapeutic rna into living cells. the technique would allow researchers to screen hundreds of nanoparticles at a time, identifying the organs in which they accumulate - and verifying that they can successfully deliver an rna cargo into living cells. 
 based on work known as ""dna barcoding,"" the technique inserts unique snippets of dna into as many as 150 different nanoparticles for simultaneous testing. the nanoparticles are then injected into animal models and allowed to travel to organs such as the liver, spleen or lungs. genetic sequencing techniques then identify which dna-labeled nanoparticles have reached specific organs. 
 in a paper published october 1 in the journal 
 proceedings of the national academy of sciences , a research team describes taking the process a step farther to verify that the nanoparticles have entered the cells of the specific organs. in addition to the dna barcode, the researchers inserted into each nanoparticle a snippet of mrna that is turned into a protein known as ""cre."" the cre protein generates a red glow, identifying cells that the nanoparticles have entered and successfully delivered the mrna drug, allowing the researchers to identify which nanoparticles can deliver rna drugs to the cells of the specific organs. 
 ""this technique, known as fast indication of nanoparticle discovery (find), will allow us to identify the right carrier far more quickly and less expensively than we have been able to do in the past,"" said 
 james e. dahlman , assistant professor in the 
 wallace h. coulter department of biomedical engineering at georgia tech and emory university . ""as a result, the odds that we will be able to find carriers for specific tissues should increase dramatically."" 
 the find technique would replace in vitro screening, which has limited success at identifying nanoparticle carriers for the genetic therapies. the research was supported by funding from the national institutes of health, and from the cystic fibrosis research foundation, the parkinson's disease foundation and the bayer hemophilia awards program. 
 therapies based on rna and dna could address a broad range of genetically based diseases, including atherosclerosis, where such therapies may be able to reverse the buildup of plaque in arteries. nanoparticles used to deliver rna and dna into cells are made from several ingredients whose levels can be varied, creating the potential for tens of thousands of different nanoparticles. finding the right combination of these ingredients to target specific cells has required extensive trial-and-error discovery processes that have limited the use of rna and dna therapies. 
 use of the dna barcoding process allows hundreds of possible nanoparticle combinations to be tested simultaneously in a single animal, but until now, researchers could only tell that the combination had reached specific organs. by examining which cells within the organs have the red glow, they can now verify that the nanoparticles carried the barcodes and delivered functional mrna drugs into the cells. 
 in the paper, the researchers report discovering two nanoparticles that efficiently delivered sirna, sgrna and mrna to endothelial cells in the spleen. the researchers believe their technique can deliver therapeutic rna and dna to a wide variety of endothelial cell types, and perhaps also to immune system and other cell types. 
 ""the field has been able to functionally deliver genetic drugs to the liver, and we are now trying to use our technology to deliver to different organs and cell types to enable therapies to treat all of the cell types that are in the liver,"" said cory sago, the paper's first author and a ph.d. candidate in dahlman's lab. ""now that we have a system that allows us to probe these questions at a very specific level of resolution, we now want to go after other cell types in a more efficient manner."" 
 dahlman expects to put the new technology to use quickly. 
 ""we hope to take projects that would ordinarily require years and complete several of them within the next 12 months,"" he said. ""find could be used to carry all sorts of nucleic acid drugs into cells. that could include small rnas, large rnas, small dnas and large dnas - many different types of genetic drugs that are now being developed in research labs."" 
 technical challenges ahead include demonstrating that identifying an affinity for mouse organs predicts which particles will work in the human body, and that the approach works for different classes of genetic therapies. 
 experimentally, dahlman's lab produces the nanoparticles at three formulation stations that require about 90 seconds to produce each of the 250 or so samples used. the resulting nanoparticles are then examined for proper size range - 40 to 80 nanometers in diameter - before being purified and sterilized for injection into the animals. 
 after three days, the researchers separate cells that are glowing red and sequence the dna snippets in them to identify which chemical compositions were most successful at entering cells of specific organs. the most promising chemical compositions are used to develop of a new batch of candidate nanoparticles for a new round of screening, which takes about a week to complete. 
 ""we want to evolve the best particles that we can,"" sago said. ""every single one of the components matters, and we work to get each component right for the cell type that we are interested in. there is a lot of optimization required.""

reflection-speakers-highlight-tech-community.txt,"reflection speakers highlight tech community 
 for the students selected as commencement reflection speakers, the task is one final challenge as well as a great honor. 
 catherine schlabach, zharia redhead, natalie huertas, and yasser el masri 
 may 03, 2023 
 commencement is one of the happiest days of the year for georgia tech graduates. for the four students selected as reflection speakers, it presents an opportunity to address their fellow graduates, professors, and loved ones. 
 at each of georgia tech's spring commencement ceremonies (master's, ph.d., and two bachelor's), a graduating student is given three minutes to deliver an inspiring message. the bachelor's speakers are catherine schlabach, an 
 aerospace engineering 
 major, and zharia redhead, a 
 business administration 
 major. the master's speaker is natalie huertas, who is earning a degree in 
 digital media . and the ph.d. speaker is yasser el masri in 
 architecture . 
 students must apply to become a reflection speaker. a panel of faculty, staff, and students selects a group of finalists who present a full version of their speech to the committee. the reflection speakers are required to work with tech's 
 communication center 
 in preparation for the ceremony. 
 catherine schlabach 
 the day before graduation, catherine schlabach is commissioning into the u.s. space force as an officer and will be an engineer. 
 ""i'll be at tech for another year to get my master's in aerospace engineering, and then i'm going to a space force base either in colorado or california,"" she said. ""i love tech and i love atlanta. i'm glad i get one more year here."" 
 for her reflection speech, schlabach was inspired by nick selby's ""we can do that"" speech given at georgia tech's new student convocation 10 years ago. 
 ""we say to ourselves, ‘we can do that,' but it brings added pressure sometimes,"" she said. ""as students we tend to compare ourselves and we don't give ourselves a lot of credit. so, i say give yourself a pat on the back. we did that. we're graduating. whether it took four, five, or six years to get here, we're doing it. we even made it through a pandemic. and we should recognize our achievements."" 
 about 30 family members, including her parents and twin sister, will join schlabach to celebrate her graduation. ""my sister, julia, was a big inspiration for my speech because she has been with me through all of my ups and downs at georgia tech. i couldn't have written it without her, and i wouldn't have the confidence to go and speak to the entire commencement ceremony without her."" 
 zharia redhead 
 zharia redhead is earning a business degree with a concentration in finance. she's also an aspiring physician and plans to apply to medical school and complete the md-mba dual degree program. she is interested obstetrics, gynecology, and other surgical related fields. after residency, she plans to open her own medical practice. 
 her reflection speech will highlight what it means for georgia tech students to ""get out"" and what it means to be a true yellow jacket. ""often times, people mistake tech students for brainiacs or nerds, and maybe we are a little nerdy, but we are in fact much more,"" she said. ""we are innovators, problem solvers, leaders, and competitors, but, most of all, we are fighters."" 
 a challenge redhead faced at the beginning of her georgia tech experience was finding a community on campus. ""although tech was diverse, i found myself as the only black woman in most of my finance classes. this presented an opportunity to make tech a more welcoming and inclusive community."" 
 she co-founded the black women support group with her sister, asha redhead, ie 2022, and other black women at tech. as president of the organization, she helped secure sponsorships, increase attendance, and provide a space for black women to excel socially, academically, and professionally. in its first year, the organization won the student government association's emerging excellence award. 
 joining redhead to celebrate commencement will be about 30 family members including her parents, siblings, grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins. 
 natalie huertas 
 public speaking does not come naturally for natalie huertas, but she likes a challenge. so, as a cancer survivor she took on another challenge and decided to apply to be the reflection speaker for the master's ceremony. 
 ""it was a challenge as well as an opportunity to prove i could do it,"" she said. ""presentations are not my comfort zone, but they have become less daunting because i've had to make so many presentations here at georgia tech. speaking in this format will be a good challenge, and i'm very excited about it."" 
 on may 5, huertas will celebrate the three-year anniversary of her cancer being in remission. she was diagnosed with acute promyelocytic leukemia in september 2019, and while in treatment, she wrote part of her graduate school application letter to keep her in good spirits and optimistic about her future. ""i am really blessed that i was able to get in and finish the program,"" she said. 
 her speech will center around the phrase ""purpose comes from perspective"" and she will reflect on her time at tech. 
 huertas is earning a degree in digital media because she wants to connect art, technology, and research. ""this is such a unique program in the sense that i can do all of those at the same time,"" she said. she plans to work in the area of business design, strategy, and customer experience. 
 yasser el masri 
 in the last four years, yasser el masri has earned three degrees from georgia tech: a master's in architecture, a master's in international affairs, and now a ph.d. in architecture. the impact on his life has been profound. 
 ""my time at georgia tech has really been so foundational to my entire career and education, i really felt like i wanted to tell the world about it in some way,"" he said. ""i can't tell you how much of an impact it had on me as a person, as an educator, as a researcher, and as a practitioner. i feel that taking the stage and sharing it with the world is important."" 
 the path is different for every ph.d. student, but el masri will talk about their shared experiences and georgia tech's philosophy of helping to solve tough challenges. 
 after graduating, he will head to the national renewable energy lab in golden, colorado, as a researcher. ""georgia tech prepared me very well for it,"" said el masri, who recently won one of three institute-wide awards given for graduate student instructor of the year. 
 he will celebrate commencement in person with his wife and georgia tech friends, and via zoom with his parents in lebanon. he plans to visit his family in lebanon before beginning his new position in colorado.

 when a lake malawi cichlid loses a tooth, a new one drops neatly into place as a replacement. why can't humans similarly regrow teeth lost to injury or disease? working with hundreds of these colorful fish, researchers are beginning to understanding how the animals maintain their hundreds of teeth throughout their adult lives. by studying how structures in embryonic fish differentiate into either teeth or taste buds, the researchers hope to one day be able to turn on the tooth regeneration mechanism in humans - which, like other mammals, get only two sets of teeth to last a lifetime. the work, which also involved a study of dental differentiation in mice, shows that the structures responsible for growing new teeth may remain active for longer than previously thought, suggesting that the process might be activated in human adults. the research was conducted by scientists from the georgia institute of technology in atlanta and king's college in london, and published october 19 in early edition of the journal 
 proceedings of the national academy of sciences . the research was supported by the national institute of dental and craniofacial research, part of the u.s. national institutes of health. ""we have uncovered developmental plasticity between teeth and taste buds, and we are trying to understand the pathways that mediate the fate of cells toward either dental or sensory development,"" said 
 todd streelman , a professor in the georgia tech 
 school of biology . ""the potential applications to humans makes this interesting to everybody who has dealt with dental issues at one time or another in their lives."" worldwide, approximately 30 percent of persons have lost all their teeth by the time they reach the age of 60. beyond the painful dental health issues, this can causes significant medical and nutritional problems that can shorten life. to understand more about the pathways that lead to the growth and development of teeth, streelman and first author ryan bloomquist - a dmd / phd student at georgia tech and georgia regents university - studied how teeth and taste buds grow from the same epithelial tissues in embryonic fish. unlike humans, fish have no tongues, so their taste buds are mixed in with their teeth, sometimes in adjacent rows. the lake malawi cichlids have adapted their teeth and taste buds to thrive in the unique conditions where they live. one species eats plankton and needs few teeth because it locates its food visually and swallows it whole. another species lives on algae which must be scraped or snipped from rocky lake formations, requiring both many more teeth and more taste buds to distinguish food. the researchers crossed the two closely-related species, and in the second generation of these hybrids, saw substantial variation in the numbers of teeth and taste buds. by studying the genetic differences in some 300 of these second-generation hybrids, they were able to tease out the genetic components of the variation. ""we were able to map the regions of the genome that control a positive correlation between the densities of each of these structures,"" streelman explained. ""and through a collaboration with colleagues at king's college in london, we were able to demonstrate that a few poorly studied genes were also involved in the development of teeth and taste buds in mice."" by bathing embryonic fish in chemicals that influence the developmental pathways involved in tooth and taste bud formation, the researchers then manipulated the development of the two structures. in one case, they boosted the growth of taste buds at the expense of teeth. these changes were initiated just five or six days after the fish eggs were fertilized, at a stage when the fish had eyes and a brain - but were still developing jaws. ""there appear to be developmental switches that will shift the fate of the common epithelial cells to either dental or sensory structures,"" streelman said. though they have very different purposes and final anatomy, teeth and taste buds originate in the same kind of epithelial tissue in the developing jaws of embryonic fish. these tiny buds differentiate later, forming teeth with hard enamel - or soft taste buds. ""it's not until later in the development of a tooth that it forms enamel and dentine,"" said streelman. ""at the earliest stages of development, these structures are really very similar."" the studies in fish and mice suggest the possibility that with the right signals, epithelial tissue in humans might also be able to regenerate new teeth. ""it was not previously thought that development would be so plastic for structures that are so different in adult fish,"" streelman said. ""ultimately, this suggests that the epithelium in a human's mouth might be more plastic than we had previously thought. the direction our research is taking, at least in terms of human health implications, is to figure out how to coax the epithelium to form one type of structure or the other."" but growing new teeth wouldn't be enough, streelman cautions. researchers would also need to understand how nerves and blood vessels grow into teeth to make them viable. ""the exciting aspect of this research for understanding human tooth development and regeneration is being able to identify genes and genetic pathways that naturally direct continuous tooth and taste bud development in fish, and study these in mammals,"" said professor paul sharpe, a co-author from king's college. ""the more we understand the basic biology of natural processes, the more we can utilize this for developing the next generation of clinical therapeutics: in this case how to generate biological replacement teeth."" as a next step, streelman and research technician teresa fowler are working to determine how far into adulthood the plasticity between teeth and taste buds extends, and what can trigger the change. in addition to those already mentioned, the research included nicholas parnell and kristine phillips from georgia tech, and tian yu from king's college. this research is supported by the national institute of dental and craniofacial research, part of the u.s. national institutes of health, under grants 2r01de019637 (to j.t.s.) and 5f30de023013 (to r.f.b.). any opinions or conclusions are those of the authors and may not necessarily represent the official views of the nih. citation : ryan f. bloomquist, et al., ""co-evolutionary patterning of teeth and taste buds,"" (proceedings of the national academy of sciences, 2015).  http: / / www.pnas.org / content / early / 2015 / 10 / 15 / 1514298112 research news georgia institute of technology 177 north avenue atlanta, georgia 30332-0181 usa media relations contact : john toon ( jtoon@gatech.edu ) (404-894-6986). writer : john toon

 endowment will use funds to enhance forest-related research 
 the institute of paper science and technology is now the renewable bioproducts institute. 
 jan 29, 2016 
 - atlanta, ga 
 the institute of paper chemistry foundation inc. and the georgia tech foundation inc. have announced a $1 million grant to establish the institute of paper chemistry legacy endowment fund. the fund is being established in recognition of the institute of paper chemistry's  (ipc) educational and leadership legacy and will be maintained as an endowment fund for support of georgia tech's renewable bioproducts institute (rbi). it will be directed to student and faculty initiatives and programs that enhance the mission of rbi as well as advance forest-related industries. this is not the first large gift from the institute of paper chemistry foundation (ipcf). in 2014, rbi received a $44 million grant, one of the single largest gifts in georgia tech's history. that endowment currently supports 43 paper science and engineering students who advance the research mission of rbi through their faculty-directed research. jim ferris, chair of the ipcf, stated that the ipc legacy endowment is targeted to place funding right at the interface of georgia tech and forest-related manufacturing sites. ""we want the funds generated by this grant to have the best chance of being of value to manufacturing sites,"" he said. ""the grant will support the development of new technology that will improve competitiveness of existing or future forest-based industries and will support the development of people at these manufacturing locations."" the establishment of this fund further affirms the institute's position as a leading driver of the future of the forest bioproducts industry and continues the commitment by the ipcf to strengthen rbi's hand in developing the next generation of engineers and leaders for the industry, according to rbi executive director norman marsolan. ""the ipc foundation has played a pivotal role not only in the success found on this campus, but that of all who came before us - more than 85 years of industry leadership and research support,"" he said. the primary purpose of the fund is to support faculty and students engaging with the forest-related industries through the rbi. the fund will be used to encourage interaction among industry, students and faculty through programs and events that offer value to forest-related company leadership. the fund will also promote programs that attract undergraduate and graduate students to forest-related industries. ""our members are our partners, providing financial support, but also insight as to what challenges and opportunities the industry is facing today and what the evolution of those will hold for tomorrow,"" marsolan said. ""we want to strengthen and maintain our existing rbi industry members, but also cultivate new partners, extending our outreach. the benefits extend beyond the companies' access and any financial contribution rbi receives. our students receive a tremendous benefit by gaining a unique foothold in the industry and forming a relationship with a company, which many times translates into career opportunities."" the ipc 
 was founded in 1929 in wisconsin to provide science, technology and education in support of the pulp and paper industry, a rapidly growing sector of the economy whose executives recognized the need for employees specifically trained in the scientific processes of papermaking. 
 in 1989, ipc, renamed the institute of paper science & technology, relocated to atlanta and merged with georgia tech in 2003.  the evolution continued in 2014 with an expanded scope of work and research, as well as designation as one of georgia tech's 11 interdisciplinary research institutes, the renewable bioproducts institute. for more information, visit www.rbi.gatech.edu.

 georgia tech's strategic plan for research will shape the future of innovation 
 aug 25, 2022 
 with the research landscape rapidly changing, georgia tech must respond to external forces to address local, national, and global challenges and produce novel ideas ​and actionable solutions.​ in alignment with the institute strategic plan, research next positions georgia tech to respond to future challenges with innovation, expertise, creativity, and a dedication to improving the human condition. 
 ""georgia tech envisions a future in which we continue to educate transformative researchers, strive for inclusive excellence and truth, and leverage our scale and resources to address the most urgent challenges of our time,"" said chaouki abdallah, executive vice president for research at georgia tech. ""our plan is people centered, value based, and data informed. like the institute's strategic plan, this belongs to all of us, and it will be up to us to make it a reality."" 
 to create the research strategy, georgia tech faculty, staff, and students assessed the current landscape for research-intensive universities. they identified the internal and external forces and factors that shape the research ecosystem. out of this came a 
 research landscape analysis . the phase ii work capitalized on the rich insights from the phase i to identify 16 goals and 50 objectives for georgia tech to work toward over the next decade. 
 now, seven initial projects have been identified to support the vision of the research next.  they are large-scale, campus-wide projects. four of the teams have assembled, and efforts are underway, including: 
 project management support: large-scale projects and scaling pi operations 
 this group develops project management recommendations that are proactively supporting researchers and thinking through the needs of both singular, large activities, as well as the demands for larger efforts distributed over a range of projects. 
 research faculty engagement & career development 
 this group takes a deeper look at georgia tech research faculty environment, including hiring, mentoring, career development, community and work environment, promotion, and compensation approaches. 
 all members of the research enterprise feel connected to and included in and able to contribute to the mission, conduct, and products of research 
 this group makes our community feel appreciated and empowered by creating an environment and culture in which all can grow, thrive, and add value. 
 strategic & operational expansion of historically black colleges and universities (hbcus) & minority serving institutions (msis) research partnerships 
 this group identifies and streamlines processes that enable collaborative research with msis; develops an ongoing process for identifying, networking, and finalizing potential research collaborations across georgia tech and msis; and establish / maintain a network of sources, sponsors, and new paradigms for funding long-term research partnerships. 
 three additional teams will be launched in fy23, including: 
 research prioritization & annual strategic analysis 
 this team will monitor progress and metrics across all research next initiatives, as well advise the research enterprise on large research initiatives and directions. 
 organizational structures & pathways of interdisciplinary research

research-partnership-expands-address-lymphatic-injury.txt,"research partnership expands to address lymphatic injury 
 researchers at georgia tech are working to understand the lymph system through a partnership with the global center for medical innovation (gcmi).

 years after cancer surgery, many patients' lymphatic systems start to fail. they can experience swelling and fluid retention, a condition known as lymphedema that has no cure. but researchers at the georgia institute of technology are working to understand the lymph system through a partnership with the 
 global center for medical innovation (gcmi). 
 ""we want to know: ‘why does the lymphatic system fail?'"" said 
 brandon dixon , a professor in the 
 school of mechanical engineering . ""what are some of the mechanisms that drive its failure? we want a basic understanding of the rules that govern lymphatic remodeling."" 
 to uncover this basic understanding, dixon and his fellow mechanical engineering investigators 
 alexander alexeev 
 and 
 zhanna nepiyushchikh 
 are studying the lymph system in sheep. sheep make ideal candidates as they have limbs that must transport fluid against gravity and these limbs have a consistent architecture of lymphatic vessels. previously, the researchers had worked with mice and rats, but there are inherent limitations to this. 
 ""gravity is a key component of lymphedema, especially in the lower legs or arms, places where the fluid has to travel a long distance against gravity,"" he said. ""you just can't recapitulate that in a mouse or a rat, so we wanted a large animal model of lymphatic failure."" 
 initially, the researchers partnered with the 
 university of georgia college of veterinary medicine 
 to study sheep. their results won a $3 million national institutes of health (nih) grant for the next four years to build a computational model and framework to understand lymphatic growth and adaptation after injury. 
 part of the grant was moving the research from athens to atlanta by partnering with gcmi. 
 ""the challenge of the large animal work is it's very expensive, and we could not have done this project without both nih support and in-kind contributions from gcmi which were made available through support from the office of the executive vice president for research,"" said dixon, who is also a researcher in the 
 petit institute for bioengineering and bioscience . ""gcmi has really created a unique environment that's allowed us to do this work here."" 
 studying the system 
 to conduct the research, the team surgically dissects a section of lymphatic vessel but leaves all the remaining vasculature intact to determine how the remaining lymphatic vessels compensate for this loss of lymphatic vessels over time. as a point of comparison the researchers use the other limb, which does not receive an injury to its lymphatics, as a control, and then employ 
 in vivo 
 near-infrared lymphatic imaging (indirect visual imaging that utilizes specialized tracers taken up by the lymphatic system) to determine how the vessels adapt over time. 
 from here, they develop computational models to understand how the structural changes in the lymphatic vessels alter their ability to pump fluid. although it's a biological system, the mechanics plays a very important role in the understanding of its function, according to alexeev. 
 ""in contrast to the circulatory system where we have a centralized pump, or the heart, that pumps the fluid and drives the flow, in lymphatics we have a distributed system of pumps that contract periodically, and there are also numerous elastic valves that open and close to create a unidirectional lymph flow,"" he said. 
 the modeling of a lymphatic system presents an extra challenge because the researchers need to consider how the fluid flow interacts with elastic valves and contracting vessel walls. yet an advantage of computational modeling is that it provides detailed insights into how the system should work and helps to rationalize the observations from the sheep studies. 
 ""the problem we are addressing is the gap in understanding what triggers lymphatics to fail and why one patient develops lymphedema while another does not,"" said nepiyushchikh. ""it is very exciting to work with a team where everybody brings a high level of expertise and experience towards understanding such a complex disease as lymphedema. it will be tremendous for the lymphedema field to be able to predict lymphatic failure and find the best preventative options, as well as narrow the treatment possibilities in already existing conditions.""

 a team of georgia institute of technology researchers will head to west antarctica next winter as part of an international collaboration to explore a melting glacier that could significantly affect global sea levels. the thwaites glacier drains the ice from an area roughly the size of florida, accounting for around 4 percent of current global sea-level rise - an amount that has doubled since the mid-1990s and looks to be accelerating. 
 the georgia tech team will send 
 icefin, its home-built autonomous vehicle , through a borehole near the grounding line of the glacier to explore underneath the ice. this will allow it to map, for the first time ever, how the geology beneath the surface and the interactions between the ice and ocean water are affecting how the glacier is changing. 
 the mission is part of a $25 million international research collaboration led by the national science foundation (nsf) and the united kingdom's natural environment research council (nerc). 
 this will be the fourth antarctic voyage for icefin, but the first to the remote glacier. in fact, only a few dozen people have ever stepped foot on thwaites. 
 ""thwaites glacier is one of the fastest changing regions in the antarctic,"" said britney schmidt, an assistant professor in the school of earth and atmospheric sciences who leads the icefin project. ""with individual research programs, we can only investigate small parts of the system at a time. so much of west antarctica may depend on the stability of thwaites -  it's a critical time to come together to explore the whole system to reveal whether it's reached a tipping point. we're thrilled to be a part of this incredible effort."" 
 the research program is called the international thwaites glacier collaboration (itgc). it includes   nine projects that will help scientists understand whether the glacier's collapse could begin in the next few decades or centuries. 
 icefin is one part of the melt project, which is overseen by keith nicholls of the british antarctic survey and new york university's david holland. investigators from penn state, university of california irvine and the university of kansas are also involved. 
 according to a joint press release from the nsf and nerc , melt ""will measure the melting at the ice-ocean interface of the glacier, to understand the processes involved and its potential for triggering increased sea-level rise."" 
 icefin will use sonar to map the ice and sea floor and explore how the two are interacting. its onboard cameras will also provide images of both areas. icefin's sensors will measure the temperature, depth and salinity of the water underneath the glacier to learn how and where the glacier is melting. 
 ""the grounding line of a glacier is the place where it goes from sliding along the continent to floating in the ocean. this is where the glacier can become unstable,"" said schmidt. ""melt water from upstream under the glacier escapes out into the ocean across the grounding line, and warm ocean water can melt it back from below. icefin was designed with this kind of a project in mind -measuring the properties of the ice, ocean and seafloor where other vehicles and instruments cannot reach to map these changes in the underbelly of the glacier."" 
 antarctica's glaciers contribute to sea-level rise when more ice is lost to the ocean than is replaced by snow. to fully understand the causes of changes in ice flow requires research on the ice itself, the nearby ocean and the antarctic climate in the region. in addition to icefin, the program will deploy the most up-to-date instruments and techniques available, from drills that can make access holes 1,500 meters into the ice with jets of hot water to autonomous submarines like the autobsub long range affectionately known around the world as boaty mcboatface. 
 the nearest permanently occupied research station to the thwaites glacier is more than 1,000 miles away. researchers on the ice will rely on aircraft support from american and british research stations. oceanographers and geophysicists will approach the glacier from the sea in icebreaker ships. in addition to the united states and united kingdom, the itgc collaboration includes researchers from south korea, germany, sweden, new zealand and finland. portions of this article were taken from the full nsf-nerc press release.

 a team of researchers from the georgia institute of technology has developed a way to use 3-d printers to create objects capable of expanding dramatically that could someday be used in applications ranging from space missions to biomedical devices. 
 the new objects use tensegrity, a structural system of floating rods in compression and cables in continuous tension. the researchers fabricated the struts from shape memory polymers that unfold when heated. 
 ""tensegrity structures are extremely lightweight while also being very strong,"" said glaucio paulino, a professor in georgia tech's school of civil and environmental engineering. ""that's the reason there's a heavy amount of interest right now in researching the use of tensegrity structures for outer space exploration. the goal is to find a way to deploy a large object that initially takes up little space."" 
 the research, which was reported june 14 in the journal  scientific reports , was sponsored by the national science foundation and the air force office of scientific research. 
 the researchers used 3-d printers to create the struts that make up one of the primary components of the tensegrity structure. to enable the struts to be temporarily folded flat, the researchers designed them to be hollow with a narrow opening that runs the length of the tube. each strut has an attachment point on each end to connect to a network of elastic cables, which are also made with 3-d printers. 
 once the struts were heated to 65 degrees celsius, the researchers could partially flatten and fold them into a shape resembling the letter w. the cooled structures then retain the temporary shape. 
 with all cables attached, the objects can be reheated to initiate the transformation into tensegrity structures. 
 ""we believe that you could build something like an antenna that initially is compressed and takes up little space, but once it's heated, say just from the heat of the sun, would fully expand,"" said jerry qi, a professor in the george w. woodruff school of mechanical engineering at georgia tech. 
 a key component of making 3-d printed objects that can transform into tensegrity structures was controlling the rate and sequence of expansion. the shape memory polymers enable the researchers to fine-tune how quickly each strut expands by adjusting at which temperature the expansion occurs. that enables structures to be designed with struts that expand sequentially. 
 ""for bigger and more complicated structures, if you don't control the sequence that these struts expand, it tangles and you have a mess,"" paulino said. ""by controlling the temperature at which each strut expands, we can have a phased deployment and avoid this entanglement."" 
 the term ""tensegrity"" comes from a combination of the words ""tensional integrity,"" and the concept has been used as the structural basis for several notable projects through the years, including a large pedestrian bridge in brisbane, australia, and stadium roofs such as the georgia dome stadium in atlanta and the olympic gymnastics arena in seoul, south korea. 
 the researchers envision that the new 3-d printed structures could be used for super light-weight structures needed for space exploration or even shape-change soft robots. 
 ""these active tensegrity objects are very elegant in design and open up a range of possibilities for deployable 3-d structures,"" paulino said.

 georgia tech researchers have engineered one of the world's first yeast cells able to harness energy from light, expanding our understanding of the evolution of this trait - and paving the way for advancements in biofuel production and cellular aging. 
 jan 12, 2024 
 you may be familiar with yeast as the organism content to turn carbs into products like bread and beer when left to ferment in the dark. in these cases, exposure to light can hinder or even spoil the process. 
 in a 
 new study 
 published in 
 current biology , researchers in georgia tech's 
 school of biological sciences 
 have engineered one of the world's first strains of yeast that may be happier with the lights on. 
 ""we were frankly shocked by how simple it was to turn the yeast into phototrophs (organisms that can harness and use energy from light),"" says 
 anthony burnetti , a research scientist working in associate professor 
 william ratcliff 's laboratory and corresponding author of the study. ""all we needed to do was move a single gene, and they grew 2% faster in the light than in the dark. without any fine-tuning or careful coaxing, it just worked."" 
 easily equipping the yeast with such an evolutionarily important trait could mean big things for our understanding of how this trait originated - and how it can be used to study things like biofuel production, evolution, and cellular aging. 
 looking for an energy boost 
 the research was inspired by the group's past work investigating the evolution of multicellular life. the group published their first report on their 
 multicellularity long-term evolution experiment 
 (multee) in 
 nature 
 last year, uncovering how their single-celled model organism, ""snowflake yeast,"" was able to evolve multicellularity over 3,000 generations. 
 throughout these evolution experiments, one major limitation for multicellular evolution appeared: energy. 
 ""oxygen has a hard time diffusing deep into tissues, and you get tissues without the ability to get energy as a result,"" says burnetti. ""i was looking for ways to get around this oxygen-based energy limitation."" 
 one way to give organisms an energy boost without using oxygen is through light. but the ability to turn light into usable energy can be complicated from an evolutionary standpoint. for example, the molecular machinery that allows plants to use light for energy involves a host of genes and proteins that are hard to synthesize and transfer to other organisms - both in the lab and naturally through evolution. 
 luckily, plants are not the only organisms that can convert light to energy. 
 keeping it simple 
 a simpler way for organisms to use light is with rhodopsins: proteins that can convert light into energy without additional cellular machinery. 
 ""rhodopsins are found all over the tree of life and apparently are acquired by organisms obtaining genes from each other over evolutionary time,"" says 
 autumn peterson , a biology ph.d. student working with ratcliff and lead author of the study. 
 this type of genetic exchange is called horizontal gene transfer and involves sharing genetic information between organisms that aren't closely related. horizontal gene transfer can cause seemingly big evolutionary jumps in a short time, like how bacteria are quickly able to develop resistance to certain antibiotics. this can happen with all kinds of genetic information and is particularly common with rhodopsin proteins. 
 ""in the process of figuring out a way to get rhodopsins into multi-celled yeast,"" explains burnetti, ""we found we could learn about horizontal transfer of rhodopsins that has occurred across evolution in the past by transferring it into regular, single-celled yeast where it has never been before."" 
 to see if they could outfit a single-celled organism with solar-powered rhodopsin, researchers added a rhodopsin gene synthesized from a parasitic fungus to common baker's yeast. this specific gene is coded for a form of rhodopsin that would be inserted into the cell's vacuole, a part of the cell that, like mitochondria, can turn chemical gradients made by proteins like rhodopsin into energy. 
 equipped with vacuolar rhodopsin, the yeast grew roughly 2% faster when lit - a huge benefit in terms of evolution. 
 ""here we have a single gene, and we're just yanking it across contexts into a lineage that's never been a phototroph before, and it just works,"" says burnetti. ""this says that it really is that easy for this kind of a system, at least sometimes, to do its job in a new organism."" 
 this simplicity provides key evolutionary insights and says a lot about ""the ease with which rhodopsins have been able to spread across so many lineages and why that may be so,"" explains peterson, who peterson 
 recently received 
 a howard hughes medical institute (hhmi) gilliam fellowship for her work. 
 carina baskett , grant writer for georgia tech's 
 center for microbial dynamics and infection , also worked on the study. 
 because vacuolar function may contribute to cellular aging, the group has also initiated collaborations to study how rhodopsins may be able to reduce aging effects in the yeast. other researchers are already starting to use similar new, solar-powered yeast to study advancing bioproduction, which could mark big improvements for things like synthesizing biofuels. 
 ratcliff and his group, however, are mostly keen to explore how this added benefit could impact the single-celled yeast's journey to a multicellular organism. 
 ""we have this beautiful model system of simple multicellularity,"" says burnetti, referring to the long-running 
 multicellularity long-term evolution experiment (multee) . ""we want to give it phototrophy and see how it changes its evolution.""

 sep 28, 2015 
 - atlanta, ga 
 researchers from the school of interactive computing and the institute for robotics and intelligent machines developed a new method that teaches computers to ""see"" and understand what humans do in a typical day. the technique gathered more than 40,000 pictures taken every 30 to 60 seconds, over a 6 month period, by a wearable camera and predicted with 83 percent accuracy what activity that person was doing. researchers taught the computer to categorize images across 19 activity classes. the test subject wearing the camera could review and annotate the photos at the end of each day (deleting any necessary for privacy) to ensure that they were correctly categorized. ""it was surprising how the method's ability to correctly classify images could be generalized to another person after just two more days of annotation,"" said steven hickson, a ph.d. candidate in computer science and a lead researcher on the project. ""this work is about developing a better way to understand people's activities, and build systems that can recognize people's activities at a finely-grained level of detail,"" said edison thomaz, co-author and graduate research assistant in the school of interactive computing. ""activity tracking devices like the fitbit can tell how many steps you take per day, but imagine being able to track all of your activities - not just physical activities like walking and running. this work is moving toward full activity intelligence. at a technical level, we are showing that it's becoming possible for computer vision techniques alone to be used for this."" the group believes they have gathered the largest annotated dataset of first-person images to demonstrate that deep-learning can understand human behavior and the habits of a specific person. student daniel casto, a ph.d. candidate in computer science and a lead researcher on the project, helped present the method earlier this month at ubicomp 2015 in osaka, japan. he says reaction from conference-goers was positive. ""people liked that we had a method that combines time and images,"" castro says. ""time (of activity) can be especially important for some activity classes. this system learned how relevant images were because of people's schedules. what does it think the image is showing? it sees both time and image probabilities and makes a better prediction."" the ability to literally see and recognize human activities has implications in a number of areas - from developing improved personal assistant applications like siri to helping researchers explain links between health and behavior, thomaz says. castro and hickson believe that someday within the next decade we will have ubiquitous devices that can improve our personal choices throughout the day. ""imagine if a device could learn what i would be doing next - ideally predict it - and recommend an alternative?"" castro says. ""once it builds your own schedule by knowing what you are doing, it might tell you there is a traffic delay and you should leave sooner or take a different route."" the research, ""predicting daily activities from egocentric images using deep learning,"" can be found at

researchers-discover-potential-drug-targets-early-onset-glaucoma.txt,"researchers discover potential drug targets for early onset glaucoma 
 scientists have for the first time identified molecules with the potential to block the accumulation of a toxic eye protein that can lead to early onset of glaucoma. 
 raquel lieberman, an associate professor in the school of chemistry and biochemistry at the georgia institute of technology in atlanta, whose lab led the research.

 using a novel high-throughput screening process, scientists have for the first time identified molecules with the potential to block the accumulation of a toxic eye protein that can lead to early onset of glaucoma. glaucoma is a group of diseases that can damage the eye's optic nerve and cause vision loss and blindness. elevated eye pressure is the main risk factor for optic nerve damage. 
 researchers have implicated a mutant form of a protein called myocilin as a possible root cause of this increased eye pressure. mutant myocilin is toxic to the cells in the part of the eye that regulates pressure. these genetically inherited mutants of myocilin clump together in the front of the eye, preventing fluid flow out of the eye, which then raises eye pressure. this cascade of events can lead to early onset-glaucoma, which affects several million people from childhood to age 35. 
 to find molecules that bind to mutant myocilin and block its aggregation, researchers designed a simple, high-throughput assay and then screened a library of compounds. they identified two molecules with potential for future drug development to treat early onset glaucoma. 
 ""these are really the first potential drug targets for glaucoma,"" said 
 raquel lieberma n, an associate professor in the school of chemistry and biochemistry at the georgia institute of technology in atlanta, whose lab led the research. 
 lieberman presented her findings on january 20 at the society for laboratory automation and screening conference in san diego, calif. the study was published on nov. 26, 2013, in the journal 
 acs chemical biology . the national institutes of health and the pew scholar in biomedical sciences program provided support for the research. the work was a collaboration involving georgia tech, emory university and the university of south florida. at the heart of the study was an assay that lieberman's lab created to take advantage of the fundamental principles of ligand binding. in their assay, mutant myocilin is mixed with a fluorescent compound that emits more light when the protein is unwound. when a molecule from the library screen binds to myocilin, the pair becomes highly stable - tightly wound - and the fluorescent light emitted decreases. by measuring fluorescence, researchers were able to identify molecules that bound tightly to mutant myocilin. the researchers then added these molecules to cultured human cells that were making the toxic aggregating myocilin. treating the cells with the newly identified molecules blocked the aggregation and caused the mutated version of myocilin to be released from the cells, reducing toxicity. ""we found two molecules from that initial screen that bound to our protein and also inhibited the aggregation,"" lieberman said. ""when we saw that these compounds inhibited aggregation then we knew we were onto something good because aggregation underlies the pathogenesis of this form of glaucoma."" in a separate study, lieberman's lab characterized the toxic myocilin aggregates. that study was published in december 2013 in the 
 journal of molecular biology . the study found that myocilin aggregates are similar to the protein deposits called amyloid, which are responsible for alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases. 
 ""in alzheimer's disease, the deposits are extracellular and kill neurons. in glaucoma the aggregates are not directly killing neurons in the retina to cause vision loss, but they are cytotoxic in the pressure-regulating region of the eye,"" lieberman said. ""it's parallel to all these other amyloids that are out there in neurodegenerative disease."" the researchers are now focusing on mapping the structure of myocilin to learn more about what myocilin does and why it is in the eye in the first place. 
 ""the underlying problem with myocilin is that for 14 years it has been studied and still nobody really knows what its biological role is inside the eye,"" lieberman said.

researchers-find-achieve-long-term-sustainability-urban-systems-must-tackle-social.txt,"researchers find that to achieve long-term sustainability, urban systems must tackle social justice and equity 
 inclusivity and understanding past policies and their effects on underserved and marginalized communities must be part of urban planning, design, and public policy efforts for cities.

 inclusivity and understanding past policies and their effects on underserved and marginalized communities must be part of urban planning, design, and public policy efforts for cities. 
 an international coalition of researchers - led by georgia tech - have determined that advancements and innovations in urban research and design must incorporate serious analysis and collaborations with scientists, public policy experts, local leaders, and citizens. to address environmental issues and infrastructure challenges cities face, the coalition identified three core focus areas with research priorities for long-term urban sustainability and viability. those focus areas should be components of any urban planning, design, and sustainability initiative. 
 the researchers found that the core focus areas included social justice and equity, circularity, and a concept called ""digital twins."" the team - which consists of 13 co-authors and scholars based in the u.s., asia, and europe - also provided guidance and future research directions for how to address these focus areas. they detailed their  findings  in the  journal of industrial ecology , published in january 2023. 
 ""climate change has certainly increased the amount and intensity of extreme weather events and because of that, it makes our decision making today critical to the manner in which our economy and our day to day lives can operate,"" said  joe f. bozeman iii , the lead author and an assistant professor in georgia tech's  school of civil and environmental engineering . he is also the director of tech's  social equity & environmental engineering lab  and has a courtesy appointment in the 
 school of public policy . ""our quality of life can be negatively affected if we don't make good decisions today."" 
 three core areas of focus to achieve urban sustainability 
 the researchers' first core focus area, justice and equity, addresses innovations and trends that disproportionately benefit middle and high-income communities. trends like iot, ""smart cities,"" and the urban ""green movement"" are part of a broader push by cities to become more sustainable and resilient. but communities of color and low-income neighborhoods - the same areas often home to environmental contaminations, infrastructure challenges, and other hazards - have often been overlooked. 
 the researchers' findings showed a consistent trend with marginalized communities across several countries, including canada, the netherlands, india, and south africa. they call for mandatory equity analyses which incorporate the experiences and perspectives of these marginalized communities, and, more importantly, ensure members of those communities are actively engaged in decision-making processes. 
 ""planning, professional, and community stakeholders,"" the researchers write in the paper, ""should recognize that working together gets cities closer to harmonizing the technological and social dimensions of sustainability."" 
 the second focus area, circularity, addresses resource consumption of staple commodities including food, water, and energy; the waste and emissions they generate; and the opportunities to increase conservation of those resources by boosting efficiencies. 
 ""what we mean by circularity is basic reuse, remanufacturing, and recycling efforts across the entire urban system - which not only includes cities and under resourced areas within those cities - but also rural communities that supply and take resources from those city hubs,"" bozeman said. the idea is aligned with the circular economy concept which addresses the need to move away from the resource-wasteful and unsustainable cycle of taking, making, and throwing away. 
 instead, the researchers argue, cities should look for ways to improve efficiency and maximize local resource use. that has potential benefits not only for urban areas, but rural communities, too. one example, bozeman said, is the lifecycle building center in atlanta. it takes old building supplies and sells them locally for reuse. 
 ""by doing that, they're at the beginning stages of creating an economic system, a regional engine where we share resources between cities and rural areas,"" he said. ""we can start creating an economic framework, not only where both sides can make money and get what they need, but something that can actually turn into a sustainable economic engine without having to rely on another state or another country's import or export economic pressures."" 
 to strengthen circularity and make it more robust, the researchers call for more expansive metrics beyond measuring recycling rates and zero waste efforts, to include other parts of the supply chain that may yield new ideas and solutions. 
 the third focus area, digital twins, addresses the development of automated technologies in smart buildings and infrastructure, such as traffic lights to respond to weather and other environmental factors. 
 ""let's say there's a heavy rain event and that the rainwater is being stored into retainment,"" said bozeman. ""an automated system can open another valve where we can store that water into a secondary support system, so there's less flooding, and that can happen automatically, if we utilize the concept of digital twins."" 
 creating a new urban planning model 
 the research came about as part of the mission of the  sustainable urban systems section  of the international society for industrial ecology, which aims to be a conduit for scientists, engineers, policymakers, and others who want to marry environmental concerns and economic activity. bozeman is a board member of the sustainable urban systems section. 
 ""in that role, part of we do is set a vision and foundation for how other researchers should operate within the city and urban system space,"" he said. 
 for urban sustainability, engineers and policy makers must come to the table and make collective decisions around social justice and equity, circularity, and the digital twins concepts. 
 ""i think we're at a really critical decision point when it comes to engineers and others being able to do work that is forward looking and human sensitive,"" said bozeman. ""good decision making involves addressing social justice and equity and understanding its root causes, which will enable cities to create solutions that integrate cultural dynamics.""

researchers-find-understanding-and-embracing-intercultural-tensions-and-differences.txt,"researchers find understanding and embracing intercultural tensions and differences in teams increases information elaboration and creativity 
 team members who embrace diversity while acknowledging differences are more successful at building teams who display collaboration and information elaboration. 
 feb 02, 2023 
 - atlanta, ga 
 ""teamwork makes the dream work."" it's a popular phrase used to describe the merits of working in teams to get things done. when applied successfully, creating and collaborating with coworkers can produce results that surpass a single individual's contribution. 
 in the past, teams were mostly homogeneous because this was the makeup of most organizations in the u.s. today, teams are more diverse, and organizations can reap the benefits that individuals with different ethnicities and cultures bring to the table. 
 but not all teams are more collaborative because of their multicultural makeup. in fact, these differences may produce tensions and an inability to see the other side, creating barriers that would otherwise enable teams to foster creativity and information elaboration - the process of verbally expressing and exchanging information and viewpoints, and elaborating on these ideas. on the other hand, if a team downplays these differences, it could stifle constructive dialogue and creativity. 
 how does a team of individuals from different backgrounds coalesce by using their differences to their advantage rather than allowing them to inhibit information elaboration and creativity? 
 that's the question two researchers, 
 christina shalley 
 and pier vittorio mannucci, asked in their paper "" embracing multicultural tensions: how team members' multicultural paradox mindsets foster team information elaboration and creativity ,"" published by 
 organizational behavior and human decision process, 
 november 2022. 
 the multicultural paradox mindset 
 according to shalley, sharon m. and matthew r. price chair, and professor of organizational behavior at the georgia tech scheller college of business, one or more team members need to have a multicultural paradox mindset (mpm) to steer the team to creative success. 
 the researchers define multicultural paradox mindset (mpm) as ""the degree to which one is accepting of and energized by intercultural tensions, both emphasizing cultural differences and finding common ground."" their analysis finds that team members who demonstrate a high mpm can positively accept and embrace these conflicting ideas to influence team behavior. 
 ""a diverse team has the potential to be better at information elaboration, and, thus, creativity, than a non-diverse team. however, this potential needs to be unlocked. the presence of a member with high mpm is one way to achieve this within multicultural teams,"" shalley explained. 
 these individuals, rather than ignoring differences, or as the researchers call it, taking ""the cultural-blind approach,"" embrace differences and encourage other team members to express themselves and their perspectives, bringing more value to the creative process. 
 testing their theory 
 to test their theory of the advantages of having an mpm, the researchers chose 217 participants and divided them into 63 diverse teams. shalley and mannucci divided the teams into ""clusters"" rather than geographical locations to ensure the teams met cultural diversity. for example, they placed a person from spain with a person from china rather than putting a person from spain and a person from france together. 
 they provided the teams with a scenario of an employee who was granted the ability to work from home to help an aging relative. this setup only became an issue when other employees wanted the same opportunity. 
 each team was tasked with coming up with creative solutions to send to hr based on the available information. 
 ""we found this task to be particularly well-suited for a study focusing on culturally diverse teams because of the deep cross-cultural differences in terms of views on work-life balance and remote work, how to care for family members, valuing the elderly, and overall hr policies and practices,"" shalley wrote. 
 the researchers accounted for several variables, including the way creativity is defined among individuals, gender diversity, and those who had lived abroad, which might have affected their experiences of and tolerance for different cultures. 
 in addition, the team accounted for team members who came from countries with a ""tight"" culture. these individuals tend to be warier of different values and perspectives and may not be as comfortable expressing creative ideas. this differed from a secondary group shalley and her colleague considered who came from a ""loose"" culture."" these individuals tend to assimilate more easily in a group, which may result in more team members possessing a multicultural paradox mindset. 
 as shalley put it, ""leaders should definitely keep in mind who has a mpm when assembling a multicultural team. without one (or more) members with a mpm, the risk of not unlocking the creative potential of the multicultural team is very high,"" shalley noted.

""with this project, we've been able to debunk that notion and demonstrate that we can find a balance between ease of use and child resistance through quality design work."" gtri has a history of helping companies evaluate and improve the design of consumer products and currently serves as the independent product testing organization for the u.s. arthritis foundation, the arthritis society of canada and arthritis australia. for this work, gtri recruits users to test a variety of consumer products - medicine bottles, beverage containers, office supplies, medical devices, vehicles and cell phones - in its accessibility evaluation facility.   if a product passes gtri's rigorous ease-of-use testing, the company that created the product can use the arthritis organization's logo in its advertisements and on its packaging. pfizer previously received the u.s. arthritis foundation's ease-of-use commendation for the easy-open cap used on its 120-count bottles of advil® tablets, caplets and gel caplets. pfizer began working with gtri in early 2011 to develop a container and closure system that was easy to open, child resistant and able to be manufactured on a high-speed production line. pfizer asked fain and his team to suggest design features and materials for the bottle and closure system that would make it easier to open than a typical child-resistant prescription bottle. ""we helped pfizer understand the consumer aspects of the medicine bottle and closure design and what would work and not work from the perspective of a user with arthritis,"" said fain. wearing arthritis simulation gloves designed by gtri researchers helped packaging engineers at pfizer understand how arthritis affects a person's ability to grasp, pinch, turn, lift and twist objects. the gloves reproduce the reduction in functional capacity experienced by persons with arthritis. when gtri researchers began proposing bottle and cap possibilities to the company, the cap's material and the shape of the bottle were important elements to consider, according to fain. the team suggested coating the cap with a rubber-like thermoplastic elastomer to increase the friction between the cap and hand holding it, and make it easier to grasp and rotate. they also recommended selecting a non-cylindrical container that would be easier to grasp. ""a bottle with flat sides is less likely to rotate in the user's hand when it's being grasped, so the user doesn't need to apply as much force to stabilize the bottle in the hand while turning the cap,"" explained fain. next, fain and his research team instrumented medicine bottles and caps with force sensors and measured the top-down and rotational forces that people with arthritis could comfortably apply. from this data, they determined the maximum allowable force that could be required to push down on the cap and the maximum allowable force that could be required to rotate and remove the cap. ""we collected this data because both of these actions - pushing down on and twisting the cap - play significant roles in how easy it is for someone with arthritis to be able to open a medicine bottle without experiencing significant pain,"" said fain. pfizer ultimately selected a square container and round thermoplastic elastomer cap that would meet the force constraints, but still be child resistant. and the data gtri researchers collected was used as evidence of compliance with the u.s. arthritis foundation requirements when pfizer applied for the ease-of-use commendation. ""this project demonstrates that georgia tech can work with industry, plug directly into a company's commercialization process and quickly provide the necessary data so that the company can launch a product on-time,"" added fain. research news georgia institute of technology 177 north avenue atlanta, georgia  30332-0181 media relations contacts : john toon (404-894-6986)( jtoon@gatech.edu ) or lance wallace (404-407-7280)( lance.wallace@gtri.gatech.edu ). writer : abby robinson

 with the design of ai systems that seek to enhance the abilities of older adults as they experience cognitive decline, a broad range of ethical issues arises. 
 next-generation smart assistants will likely be designed to anticipate a user's wants and needs, and even assist and mediate social interactions between users and their support networks. 
 jul 31, 2023 
 most people use voice assistant technologies like alexa or google assistant for list making and quick weather updates. but imagine if these technologies could do much more - summarize doctor's appointments, remind someone to take their medicines, manage their schedule (knowing which events take priority), and not only read a recipe but also create reminders to shop for ingredients - without the user having to prompt it. if a smart assistant could use artificial intelligence to take away some of the cognitive load for common tasks, it could help older adults preserve their independence and autonomy. 
 next-generation smart assistants aren't on the market yet, but the research necessary to create them is underway now. this includes efforts to develop smart assistants that are proactive -that is, the system could anticipate the user's wants and needs, and even assist and mediate social interactions between users and their support networks. but with the design of systems that seek to enhance the abilities of older adults as they experience cognitive decline, a broad range of ethical issues arises. 
 researchers from the nsf 
 ai institute for collaborative assistance and responsive interaction for networked groups (ai-caring) 
 saw a need to outline some of these issues up front, with the hope that designers will consider them when developing the next generation of smart assistants. the team's article, "" ethical issues in near-future socially supportive smart assistants for older adults ,"" was published in the journal 
 ieee transactions on technology and society . 
 ""we're trying to provide a landscape of the ethical issues designers need to take into account long before advanced smart assistant systems show up in a person's home,"" said 
 jason borenstein , professor of ethics and director of graduate research ethics programs in the 
 school of public policy 
 and the office of graduate and postdoctoral education at georgia tech. ""if designers don't think through these issues, then a family might set a relative up with a system, go home, and trust that their relative is safe and secure when they might not be."" 
 according to the ai-caring researchers, when a person relies on an ai system, that person becomes vulnerable to the system in unique ways. for people with age-related cognitive impairment who might use the technology for complicated forms of assistance, the stakes get even higher, with vulnerability increasing as their health declines. systems that fail to perform correctly could put an older adult's welfare at significant risk. 
 ""if a system makes a mistake when you've relied on it for something benign - like helping you choose the movie you're going to watch - that's not a big deal,"" said 
 alex john london , lead author of the paper and k&l gates professor of ethics and computational technologies at carnegie mellon university. ""but if you've relied on it to remind you to take your medicine, and it doesn't remind you or tells you to take the wrong medicine, that would be a big problem."" 
 according to the researchers, to develop a system that truly prioritizes the user's well-being, designers should consider issues such as trust, reliance, privacy, and a person's changing cognitive abilities. they should also make sure the system supports the user's goals rather than the goals of an outside party such as a family member, or even a company that might seek to market products to the user. 
 a system like this would require a nuanced and constantly evolving model of the user and their preferences, incorporating data from a variety of different sources. for a smart assistant to effectively do its job, it might need to share some of the main user's information with other entities, which can expose the user to risk. 
 for example, a user might want the physician's office to know that they would like a doctor's appointment. but depending on the person, they may not want that information shared with their children, or only with one child and not another. according to the researchers, designers should consider methods of sharing personal information that also uphold the user's ability to control it. 
 over trust and under trust of the system's abilities are also important issues to consider. over trust occurs when people project onto a technology abilities that it doesn't have, which could put them at risk when the system fails to deliver in a way they anticipated. under trust can be an issue as well, because if a system can help a person with an important task and the person chooses not to use the system, they also could be left without help. 
 ""the goal of our analysis is to point out challenges for creating truly assistive ai systems so that they can be incorporated into the design of ai from the beginning,"" london said. ""this can also help stakeholders create benchmarks for performance that reflect these ethical requirements rather than trying to address ethical issues after the system has already been designed, developed, and tested."" 
 according to borenstein, when smart assistants are created and introduced into homes, the primary user's well-being and goals should be the foremost concern. 
 ""designers are certainly well-intended, but all of us can benefit from the exchange of ideas across disciplines, and from talking with people with different perspectives on these kinds of technologies,"" borenstein said. ""this is just one piece of that puzzle that can hopefully inform the design process.""

 - atlanta, ga 
 thermally-based industrial chemical separation processes such as distillation now account for 10 to 15 percent of the world's annual energy use. slaking the global thirst for energy could therefore get a substantial boost from improved technologies for producing fuels, plastics, food and other products with reduced inputs of energy. in a comment article published april 26 in the journal 
 nature , two researchers from the georgia institute of technology suggest seven energy-intensive separation processes they believe should be the top targets for research into low-energy purification technologies. beyond cutting energy use, improved techniques for separating chemicals from mixtures would also reduce pollution, cut carbon dioxide emissions - and open up new ways to obtain critical resources the world needs. technologies applicable to those separation processes are at varying stages of development, the authors note. these alternative processes are now under-developed or expensive to scale up, and making them feasible for large-scale use could require a significant investment in research and development. ""we wanted to highlight how much of the world's energy is used for chemical separations and point to some areas where large advances could potentially be made by expanding research in these areas,"" said 
 david sholl , one of the article's authors, chair of georgia tech's 
 school of chemical & biomolecular engineering  and a georgia research alliance eminent scholar. ""these processes are largely invisible to most people, but there are large potential rewards - to both energy and the environment - for developing improved separation processes in these areas."" in the united states, substituting non-thermal approaches for purifying chemicals could reduce energy costs by $4 billion per year in the petroleum, chemical and paper manufacturing sectors alone. there's also a potential for reducing carbon dioxide emissions by 100 million tons per year. ""chemical separations account for about half of all u.s. industrial energy use,"" noted 
 ryan lively , an assistant professor in georgia tech's school of chemical & biomolecular engineering and the article's second author. ""developing alternatives that don't use heat could dramatically improve the efficiency of 80 percent of the separation processes that we now use."" dubbed the ""seven chemical separations to change the world,"" the list is not intended to be exhaustive, but includes: hydrocarbons from crude oil . hydrocarbons from crude oil are the main ingredients for making fuels, plastics and polymers - keys to the world's consumer economy. each day, the article notes, refineries around the world process around 90 million barrels of crude oil, mostly using atmospheric distillation processes that consume about 230 gigawatts of energy per year, the equivalent of the total 2014 energy consumption of the united kingdom. distillation involves heating the oil and then capturing different compounds as they evaporate at different boiling points. finding alternatives is difficult because oil is complex chemically and must be maintained at high temperatures to keep the thick crude flowing. uranium from sea water . nuclear power could provide additional electricity without boosting carbon emissions, but the world's uranium fuel reserves are limited. however, more than four billion tons of the element exist in ocean water. separating uranium from ocean water is complicated by the presence of metals such as vanadium and cobalt that are captured along with uranium in existing technologies. processes to obtain uranium from sea water have been demonstrated on small scales, but those would have to be scaled up before they can make a substantial contribution to the expansion of nuclear power. alkenes from alkanes . production of certain plastics requires alkenes - hydrocarbons such as ethane and propene, whose total annual production exceeds 200 million tons. the separation of ethene from ethane, for instance, typically requires high-pressure cryogenic distillation at low temperatures. hybrid separation techniques that use a combination of membranes and distillation could reduce energy use by a factor of two or three, but large volumes of membrane materials - up to one million square meters at a single chemical plant - could be required for scale-up. greenhouse gases from dilute emissions . emission of carbon dioxide and hydrocarbons such as methane contribute to global climate change. removing these compounds from dilute sources such as power plant emissions can be done using liquid amine materials, but removing the carbon dioxide from that material requires heat. less costly methods for removing carbon dioxide are needed. rare earth metals from ores . rare earth elements are used in magnets, catalysts and high-efficiency lighting. though these materials are not really rare, obtaining them is difficult because they exist in trace quantities that must be separated from ores using complex mechanical and chemical processes. benzene derivatives from each other . benzene and its derivatives are essential to production of many polymers, plastics, fibers, solvents and fuel additives. these molecules are now separated using distillation columns with combined annual energy usage of about 50 gigawatts. advances in membranes or sorbents could significantly reduce this energy investment. trace contaminants from water . desalination is already critical to meeting the need for fresh water in some parts of the world, but the process is both energy and capital intensive, regardless of whether membrane or distillation processes are used. development of membranes that are both more productive and resistant to fouling could drive down the costs. sholl and lively conclude the paper by suggesting four steps that could be taken by academic researchers and policymakers to help expand the use of non-thermal separation techniques: in research, consider realistic chemical mixtures and reflect real-world conditions,  evaluate the economics and sustainability of any separation technique,  consider the scale at which technology would have to be deployed for industry, and  further expose chemical engineers and chemists in training to separation techniques that do not require distillation. citation : david s. sholl and ryan p. lively, ""seven chemical separations to change the world,"" (nature, vol. 532, 2016).

researchers-map-rotating-spiral-waves-live-human-hearts.txt,"researchers map rotating spiral waves in live human hearts 
 researchers at georgia tech and clinicians at the emory university school of medicine are bringing a new understanding to these complicated conditions with the first high-resolution visualizations of stable spiral waves in human ventricles. 
 sep 07, 2022 
 - atlanta, ga 
 electrical signals tell the heart to contract, but when the signals form spiral waves, they can lead to dangerous cardiac events like tachycardia and fibrillation. researchers at the georgia institute of technology and clinicians at 
 emory university school of medicine 
 are bringing a new understanding to these complicated conditions with the first high-resolution visualizations of stable spiral waves in human ventricles. 
 ""clinicians have known for decades that spiral waves of electrical activity can occur in the heart, and researchers have done experiments in animal and human hearts before,"" said 
 school of physics 
 professor 
 flavio fenton . ""however, this is the first time the evolution of relatively stable spiral waves of voltage and calcium in the ventricles of human hearts have been mapped at very high spatial and temporal resolution."" 
 studying live hearts from heart transplant patients gives a rare window into the detailed behavior of the heart during conditions that are difficult to treat like fibrillation. as a result, doctors can gain a better understanding of how spiral waves begin and are sustained, which can lead to new therapies. 
 the present work has been part of a decade-long collaboration between the georgia tech school of physics and the emory school of medicine. the researchers published their latest findings, "" direct observation of a stable spiral wave reentry in ventricles of a whole human heart using optical mapping for voltage and calcium "" and "" spiral wave breakup: optical mapping in an explanted human heart shows the transition from ventricular tachycardia to ventricular fibrillation and self-termination ,"" in the journal 
 heart rhythm . 
 mapping the heart 
 to generate the conditions for spiral waves, the researchers applied timed electric shocks to the heart. then, to visualize and record the spiral waves, they injected florescent dyes for voltage and calcium into the blood substitute that keeps the heart alive. the changes in light intensity enable them to record signals across the heart tissue, a technique known as optical mapping. 
 ""in this way we can visualize simultaneously the calcium and electrical waves in the heart by measuring the changes in light intensity as direct changes in calcium and voltage in the cardiac cells,"" said 
 ilija uzelac , a physics research scientist at georgia tech. ""the amazing thing about this technique is that by using a high-resolution camera, we can obtain measurements of voltage and calcium at very high spatial and temporal resolutions that could not be possible even using thousands of recording electrodes around the heart."" 
 each heart has a slightly different condition leading to the need for a transplant, so the researchers can investigate the dynamics of spiral waves with different types and severities of disease. 
 collaborating with clinicians 
 fenton's group has been studying spiral waves in hearts for more than two decades. spiral waves are a good candidate for the physics field of nonlinear dynamics, where systems that appear to be unpredictable are not random but chaotic. methods can be developed to control and terminate spiral waves to stop fibrillation with little energy, as fenton's group 
 demonstrated theoretically 
 earlier this year. 
 previously, the group has worked with fish, reptiles, amphibians, and some mammalian hearts. however, thanks to the partnership with emory, they have been able to study 10 human hearts from transplant patients who have received a new heart in the past year. 
 ""we're very fortunate to have this strong collaboration between emory and georgia tech to perform these experiments,"" fenton said. ""there are very few physicians that, in addition to treating patients, want to partner with physicists to investigate arrhythmias."" 
 the research has also been eye-opening from a medical standpoint. 
 ""i had a simplistic view of ventricular fibrillation based on what i see in the clinic and what i have read, but actually looking at ventricular fibrillation directly through these experiments gives a different perspective of the complexity and of what's going on with their dynamics,"" said shahriar iravanian, an emory cardiologist in the group. 
 ""mapping electrical and chemical waves simultaneously in the isolated human heart offers a unique possibility to investigate mechanisms of sudden cardiac death at a new functional level and to associate the dynamic electrical changes characterizing malignant arrhythmias to the specific and individual pathology of patients,"" said dr. andré g. kléber, professor of pathology in the disease biophysics group at the a. paulson school of engineering and applied sciences, harvard university. 
 the researchers are continuing to study explanted hearts and hope to tailor the experiments not only for basic science but improving treatments. for example, most arrythmias are treated through ablation, by burning the substrate of faulty circuits, or electric shocks, and this research could make such treatments more targeted and even personalized.  such advances could have enormous implications for the future of the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias, a major cause of death in the u.s. 
 ""it is difficult to map ventricular fibrillation because of patient instability and complexity of signals,"" said neal bhatia, an assistant professor of medicine at emory and member of the collaboration. ""this research has potential significant clinical complications. by detailed mapping of spiral wave dynamics, we can better understand their evolution and ultimately identify if and how the heart can be treated with better catheter ablation strategies.""

 georgia tech-europe and mit researchers are using emerging technology to demonstrate a process that will enable more immersive and realistic virtual and augmented reality displays with the world's smallest and thinnest micro-leds.

 put on a virtual reality headset and, chances are, it will look like you are viewing the world through a screen door. current flat panel displays use pixels that are visible to the naked eye, along with small bits of unlit dark space between each pixel that can appear as a black, mesh-like grid. 
 now, researchers from the georgia institute of technology, in collaboration with researchers from the massachusetts institute of technology (mit), have developed a new process based on 2d materials to create led displays with smaller and thinner pixels. enabled by two-dimensional, materials-based layer transfer technology, the innovation promises a future of clearer and more realistic led displays. 
 the team published a paper in the journal 
 nature 
 in february titled, "" vertical full-colour micro-leds via 2d materials-based layer transfer ."" co-authors also include researchers from sejong university in korea, and from additional institutions in the u.s. and south korea. 
 georgia tech-europe professor abdallah ougazzaden and research scientist suresh sundaram (who both also hold appointments in georgia tech's 
 school of electrical and computer engineering ) collaborated with researchers from mit to turn the conventional led manufacturing process on its head - literally. instead of using prevailing processes based on laying red, green, and blue (rgb) leds side by side, which limits pixel density, the team vertically stacked freestanding, ultrathin rgb led membranes, achieving an array density of 5,100 pixels per inch - the smallest pixel size reported to date (4 microns) and the smallest-ever stack height - all while delivering a full commercial range of colors. this ultra-small vertical stack was achieved via the technology of van der waals epitaxy on 2d boron nitride developed at the georgia tech-europe lab and the technology of remote epitaxy on graphene developed at mit. 
 the study showed that the world's thinnest and smallest pixeled displays can be enabled by an active layer separation technology using 2d materials such as graphene and boron to enable high array density micro-leds resulting in full-color realization of micro-led displays. 
 one unique facet of the two-dimensional, material-based layer transfer (2dlt) technique is that it allows the reuse of epitaxial wafers. reusing this costly substrate could significantly lower the cost for manufacturing smaller, thinner, and more realistic displays. 
 ""we have now demonstrated that this advanced 2d, materials-based growth and transfer technology can surpass conventional growth and transfer technology in specific domains, such as in virtual and augmented reality displays,"" said ougazzaden, the lead researcher for the georgia tech team. 
 these advanced techniques were developed in metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (mocvd) reactors, the key tool for led production at the wafer scale. the 2dlt technique can be replicated on an industrial scale with high throughput yield. the technology has the potential to bring the field of virtual and augmented reality to the next level, enabling the next generation of immersive, realistic micro-led displays. 
 ""this emerging technology has a tremendous potential for flexible electronics and the heterogenous integration in opto-electronics, which we believe will develop new functionalities and attract industry to develop commercial products from smartphone screens to medical devices,"" ougazzaden said.

researchers-reveal-roadmap-ai-innovation-brain-and-language-learning.txt,"researchers reveal roadmap for ai innovation in brain and language learning 
 a new study co-led by anna (anya) ivanova highlights how human neuroscience is paving the way for ai innovation - and what ai can teach us about ourselves. 
 mar 19, 2024 
 one of the hallmarks of humanity is language, but now, powerful new artificial intelligence tools also compose poetry, write songs, and have extensive conversations with human users. tools like chatgpt and gemini are widely available at the tap of a button - but just how 
 smart 
 are these ais? 
 a new multidisciplinary research effort co-led by 
 anna (anya) ivanova , assistant professor in the 
 school of psychology 
 at georgia tech, alongside 
 kyle mahowald , an assistant professor in the department of linguistics at the university of texas at austin, is working to uncover just that. 
 their results could lead to innovative ais that are more similar to the human brain than ever before - and also help neuroscientists and psychologists who are unearthing the secrets of our own minds. 
 the study, 
 ""dissociating language and thought in large language models,"" 
 is published this week in the scientific journal 
 trends in cognitive sciences . the work is already making waves in the scientific community: an earlier 
 preprint 
 of the paper, released in january 2023, has already been cited more than 150 times by fellow researchers. 
 the 
 research team 
 has continued to refine the research for this final journal publication. 
 ""chatgpt became available while we were finalizing the preprint,"" ivanova explains. ""over the past year, we've had an opportunity to update our arguments in light of this newer generation of models, now including chatgpt."" 
 form versus function 
 the study focuses on large language models (llms), which include ais like chatgpt. llms are text prediction models, and create writing by predicting which word comes next in a sentence - just like how a cell phone or email service like gmail might suggest what next word you might want to write. however, while this type of language learning is extremely effective at creating coherent sentences, that doesn't necessarily signify intelligence. 
 ivanova's team argues that 
 formal competence 
 - creating a well-structured, grammatically correct sentence - should be differentiated from 
 functional competence 
 - answering the right question, communicating the correct information, or appropriately communicating. they also found that while llms trained on text prediction are often very good at formal skills, they still struggle with functional skills. 
 ""we humans have the 
 tendency to conflate language and thought,"" ivanova says. ""i think that's an important thing to keep in mind as we're trying to figure out what these models are capable of, because using that ability to be good at language, to be good at formal competence, leads many people to assume that ais are also good at thinking - even when that's not the case. 
 it's a heuristic that we developed when interacting with other humans over thousands of years of evolution, but now in some respects, that heuristic is broken,"" ivanova explains. 
 the distinction between formal and functional competence is also vital in rigorously testing an ai's capabilities, ivanova adds. evaluations often don't distinguish formal and functional competence, making it difficult to assess what factors are determining a model's success or failure. the need to develop distinct tests is one of the team's more widely accepted findings, and one that some researchers in the field have already begun to implement. 
 creating a modular system 
 while the human tendency to conflate functional and formal competence may have hindered understanding of llms in the past, our human brains could also be the key to unlocking more powerful ais. 
 leveraging the tools of cognitive neuroscience while a postdoctoral associate at 
 massachusetts institute of technology (mit) , ivanova and her team studied brain activity in neurotypical individuals via fmri, and used behavioral assessments of individuals with brain damage to test the causal role of brain regions in language and cognition - both conducting new research and drawing on previous studies. the team's results showed that human brains use different regions for functional and formal competence, further supporting this distinction in ais. 
 ""our research shows that in the brain, there is a language processing module and separate modules for reasoning,"" ivanova says. this modularity could also serve as a blueprint for how to develop future ais. 
 ""building on insights from human brains - where the language processing system is sharply distinct from the systems that support our ability to think - we argue that the language-thought distinction is conceptually important for thinking about, evaluating, and improving large language models, especially given recent efforts to imbue these models with human-like intelligence,"" says ivanova's former advisor and study co-author 
 evelina fedorenko , a professor of brain and cognitive sciences at mit and a member of the mcgovern institute for brain research. 
 developing ais in the pattern of the human brain could help create more powerful systems - while also helping them dovetail more naturally with human users. ""generally, differences in a mechanism's internal structure affect behavior,"" ivanova says. ""building a system that has a broad macroscopic organization similar to that of the human brain could help ensure that it might be more aligned with humans down the road."" 
 in the rapidly developing world of ai, these systems are ripe for experimentation. after the team's preprint was published, openai announced their intention to add plug-ins to their gpt models. 
 ""that plug-in system is actually very similar to what we suggest,"" ivanova adds. ""it takes a modularity approach where the language model can be an interface to another specialized module within a system."" 
 while the openai plug-in system will include features like booking flights and ordering food, rather than cognitively inspired features, it demonstrates that ""the approach has a lot of potential,"" ivanova says. 
 the future of ai - and what it can tell us about ourselves 
 while our own brains might be the key to unlocking better, more powerful ais, these ais might also help us better understand ourselves. 
 ""when researchers try to study the brain and cognition, it's often useful to have some smaller system where you can actually go in and poke around and see what's going on before you get to the immense complexity,"" ivanova explains. 
 however, since human language is unique, model or animal systems are more difficult to relate. that's where llms come in. 
 ""there are lots of surprising similarities between how one would approach the study of the brain and the study of an artificial neural network"" like a large language model, she adds. ""they are both information processing systems that have biological or artificial neurons to perform computations."" 
 in many ways, the human brain is still a black box, but 
 openly available ais offer a unique opportunity to see the synthetic system's inner workings and modify variables, and explore these corresponding systems like never before. 
 "" it's a really wonderful model that we have a lot of control over,"" ivanova says. "" n eural networks - they are amazing.""

 research team also includes

 researchers at the georgia institute of technology discovered a new way to improve human and robot safety in manufacturing scenarios by developing a method for robots to project their next action into the 3d world and onto any moving object. ""we can now use any item in our world as the ‘display screen' instead of a projection screen or monitor,"" says 
 heni ben amor , research scientist in georgia tech's school of interactive computing. ""the robot's intention is projected onto something in the 3d world, and its intended action continues to follow the object wherever that moves as long as necessary."" the discovery, born from two algorithms and a spare car door, is ideal for manufacturing scenarios in which both humans and robots assemble together. instead of controlling the robot with a tablet or from a distant computer monitor, the human worker can safely stand at the robot's side to inspect precision, quickly make adjustments to its work, or move out of the way as the robot and human take turns assembling an object. knowing exactly where and what task a robot will do next can help workers avoid injury. watch video demonstration ""the goal of this research was to get information out of the virtual space inside the computer and into the real physical space that we inhabit,"" ben amor adds. ""as a result of that, we can increase safety and lead to an intuitive interaction between humans and robots."" the discovery was developed over a four-month period by ben amor and 
 rasmus andersen , a visiting ph.d. student from aalborg university in denmark. the team realized that, by combining existing research available at georgia tech's institute for robotics & intelligent machines (irim) with new algorithms, plus personal experience with auto manufacturers, they could make ""intention projection"" possible. they first perfected algorithms that would allow a robot to detect and track 3d objects, beginning with previous research from georgia tech and aalborg university that was further developed. they next developed a second set of entirely new algorithms that can display information onto a 3d object in a geometrically correct way. tying these two pieces together allows a robot to perceive an object, then identify where on that object to project information and act, then continuously project that information as the object moves, rotates or adapts. andersen led the coding. irim has contributed previous research to bmw, daimler ag, and peugeot. the recent discovery was inspired by what ben amor had observed during earlier work with peugeot in paris and from andersen's previous work on interaction with mobile robots. the group next plans to formally publish their research.  about the georgia tech college of computing the georgia tech college of computing is a national leader in the creation of real-world computing breakthroughs that drive social and scientific progress. with its graduate program ranked 9th nationally by 
 u.s. news and world report , the college's unconventional approach to education is expanding the horizons of traditional computer science students through interdisciplinary collaboration and a focus on human-centered solutions. for more information about the georgia tech college of computing, its academic divisions and research centers, please visit http: / / www.cc.gatech.edu .

 drexel university and georgia institute of technology researchers have discovered how the rad52 protein is a crucial player in rna-dependent dna repair. the results of their study, published june 8 
 in the journal 
 molecular cell , uncover a surprising function of the homologous recombination protein rad52. they also may help to identify new therapeutic targets for cancer treatment. 
 radiation and chemotherapy can cause a dna double-strand break, one of the most harmful types of dna damage. the process of homologous recombination - which involves the exchange of genetic information between two dna molecules - plays an important role in dna repair, but certain gene mutations can destabilize a genome. for example, mutations in the tumor suppressor brca2, which is involved in dna repair by homologous recombination, can cause the deadliest form of breast and ovarian cancer. 
 alexander mazin, a professor at drexel university's college of medicine, and francesca storici, an associate professor at georgia tech's school of biological sciences, have dedicated their research to studying mechanisms and proteins that promote dna repair. 
 in 2014, storici and mazin made a major breakthrough when they discovered that rna can serve as a template for the repair of a dna double-strand break in budding yeast, and rad52, a member of the homologous recombination pathway, is an important player in that process. 
 ""we provided evidence that rna can be used as a donor template to repair dna and that the protein rad52 is involved in the process,"" said mazin. ""but we did not know exactly how the protein is involved."" 
 in their current study, the research team uncovered the unusual, important role of rad52: it promotes ""inverse strand exchange"" between double-stranded dna and rna, meaning that the protein has a novel ability to bring together homologous dna and rna molecules. in this rna-dna hybrid, rna can then be used as a template for accurate dna repair. 
 it appeared that this ability of rad52 is unique in eukaryotes, as otherwise similar proteins do not possess it. 
 ""strikingly, such inverse strand exchange activity of rad52 with rna does not require extensive processing of the broken dna ends, suggesting that rna-templated repair could be a relatively fast mechanism to seal breaks in dna,"" storici said. 
 as a next step, the researchers hope to explore the role of rad52 in human cells. 
 ""dna breaks play a role in many degenerative diseases of humans, including cancer,"" storici added. ""we need to understand how cells keep their genomes stable. these findings help bring us closer to a detailed understanding of the complex dna repair mechanisms."" 
 the research was supported by the national institutes of health, the national science foundation and the howard hughes medical institute. 
 these results offer a new perspective on the multifaceted relationship between rna, dna and genome stability. they also may help to identify new therapeutic targets for cancer treatment. it is known that active rad52 is required for proliferation of brca-deficient breast cancer cells. targeting this protein with small molecule inhibitors is a promising anticancer strategy.  however, the critical activity of rad52 required for cancer proliferation is currently unknown. 
 this new rad52 activity in dna repair, discovered by mazin, storici and their team, may represent this critical protein activity that can be targeted with inhibitors to develop more specific - and less toxic - anti-cancer drugs. understanding of the mechanisms of rna-directed dna repair may also lead to development of new rna-based mechanisms of genome engineering.

 researchers at georgia institute of technology are using machine learning to ultimately find ways to build more capable capacitors.

 capacitors, given their high energy output and recharging speed, could play a major role in powering the machines of the future, from electric cars to cell phones. 
 but the biggest hurdle for these energy storage devices is that they store much less energy than a battery of similar size. 
 researchers at georgia institute of technology are tackling that problem in a novel way, using machine learning to ultimately find ways to build more capable capacitors. 
 the method, which was described in february 18 in the journal npj computational materials and sponsored by the u.s. office of naval research, involves teaching a computer to analyze at an atomic level two materials that make up some capacitors: aluminum and polyethylene. 
 the researchers focused on finding a way to more quickly analyze the electronic structure of those materials, looking for features that could affect performance. 
 ""the electronics industry wants to know the electronic properties and structure of all of the materials they use to produce devices, including capacitors,"" said rampi ramprasad, a professor in the school of materials science and engineering. 
 take a material like polyethylene: it is a very good insulator with a large band gap-an energy range forbidden to electrical charge carriers. but if it has a defect, unwanted charge carriers are allowed into the band gap, reducing efficiency, he said. 
 ""in order to understand where the defects are and what role they play, we need to compute the entire atomic structure, something that so far has been extremely difficult,"" said ramprasad, who holds the michael e. tennenbaum family chair and is the georgia research alliance eminent scholar in energy sustainability. ""the current method of analyzing those materials using quantum mechanics is so slow that it limits how much analysis can be performed at any given time."" 
 ramprasad and his colleagues, who specialize in using machine learning to help develop new materials, used a sample of data created from a quantum mechanics analysis of aluminum and polyethylene as an input to teach a powerful computer how to simulate that analysis. 
 analyzing the electronic structure of a material with quantum mechanics involves solving the kohn-sham equation of density functional theory, which generates data on wave functions and energy levels. that data is then used to compute the total potential energy of the system and atomic forces. 
 using the new machine learning method produces similar results eight orders of magnitude faster than using the conventional technique based on quantum mechanics. 
 ""this unprecedented speedup in computational capability will allow us to design electronic materials that are superior to what is currently out there,"" ramprasad said. ""basically we can say, ‘here are defects with this material that will really diminish the efficiency of its electronic structure.' and once we can address such aspects efficiently, we can better design electronic devices."" 
 while the study focused on aluminum and polyethylene, machine learning could be used to analyze the electronic structure of a wide range materials. beyond analyzing electronic structure, other aspects of material structure now analyzed by quantum mechanics could also be hastened by the machine learning approach, ramprasad said. 
 ""in part we selected aluminum and polyethylene because they are components of a capacitor, but it also allowed us to demonstrate that you can use this method for vastly different materials, such as metals that are conductors and polymers that are insulators,"" ramprasad said. 
 the faster processing allowed by the machine learning method would also enable researchers to more quickly simulate how modifications to a material will impact its electronic structure, potentially revealing new ways to improve its efficiency.

 dr. michael filler, school of chemical and biomolecular engineering 
 1. what sparked your interest in engineering and what problems are you hoping to help solve as an engineer? 
 in school i've gravitated towards the math and sciences. in high school i ended up taking a lot of different science classes, and i was good at math so engineering seemed like a natural next step. i wasn't really sure what i wanted to do as a career, but i knew that i did well in math and science and that i wanted to solve problems. i think it was a pretty natural choice to go into engineering and i chose to go into chemical engineering not really having a good idea of what it was. i took some classes and thankfully ended up liking it, if possible i would like to solve problems within sustainability, alternative energy, or environmental remediation. 
 2. what research are you conducting at gt and what applications do you feel this research may have? 
 ""currently i am working with dr. michael filler and his lab. i am studying the effects of oxide coatings on plasmonic si nanowires in order to understand and engineer their optical properties. throughout the summer i've gotten to use different tools in the clean room and characterization facility to conduct the research. 
 the interactions between coatings and si nanowires are significant due to their use of silicon, which as a material is cheap, abundant, and ubiquitous. as a result, the variety of applications and devices grows immensely due to the accessibility of silicon. these interactions would have value in applications such as thermal transport and energy harvesting"" 
 3. what has been your favorite lab activity / tool training / etc. thus far and why? 
 i think my favorite lab activity / tool would probably be the ones used for visual characterization, specifically the scanning electron microscopy and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. while fabricating & processing the wires via atomic layer deposition tools and being in the clean room has been a really positive experience, i think seeing the results and characteristics of the structures is pretty interesting. i like seeing the outcomes and proof that something i helped make exists. 
 4. do you feel this reu experience has helped prepare you for working in a collaborative laboratory environment and furthered your education goals? 
 i feel like this reu experience definitely has. before this summer i didn't really have a strong understanding of how research was conducted in a collaborative environment nor the experience of working in a research group with other researchers. i think that this experience has definitely opened my mind to the possibility of grad school and pursuing a ph.d., as well as contributing to collaborative research back at my university. 
 5. what are your plans post-undergraduate? 
 this summer has opened my eyes to the possibility of career as a research scientist and i've received great advice from the graduate researchers about applying for, and attending graduate school but currently i'm split between pursuing this option and something in industry. i've had some research experience, but hopefully i'll get a chance to experience industry through an internship next summer and have a better idea of how i feel about each one. 
 6. what is your favorite thing about / impression of ga tech and atl? 
 i've really enjoyed getting to explore and visit different places in atlanta. this is my first time in the area, so it's been really fun getting to visit different parks and see different places. georgia tech's campus is amazing and atlanta is a beautiful city. everyone's been really welcoming and i've had a really good time so far!

reversible-saliva-allows-frogs-hang-next-meal.txt,"reversible saliva allows frogs to hang on to next meal 
 a frog's saliva changes three times in milliseconds as it snares food with its tongue.

 jan 31, 2017 
 - atlanta, ga 
 a frog uses its whip-like tongue to snag its prey faster than a human can blink, hitting it with a force five times greater than gravity. how does it hang onto its meal as the food rockets back into its mouth? 
 a new georgia institute of technology study says the tongue's stickiness is caused by a unique reversible saliva in combination with a super soft tongue. a frog's saliva is thick and sticky during prey capture, then turns thin and watery as prey is removed inside the mouth. the tongue, which was found to be as soft as brain tissue and 10 times softer than a human's tongue, stretches and stores energy much like a spring. this combination of spit and softness is so effective that it provides the tongue 50 times greater work of adhesion than synthetic polymer materials such as sticky-hand toys. 
 the georgia tech researchers filmed frogs eating crickets in super-slow motion to better understand the physics of the tongue. they also collected saliva samples and poked the tissue to measure softness. 
 "" the tongue acts like a bungee cord once it latches onto its prey ,"" said alexis noel, a georgia tech mechanical engineering ph.d. student who led the study. ""it deforms itself as it pulls back toward the mouth, continually storing the intense applied forces in its stretchy tissue and dissipating them in its internal damping."" 
 this tissue damping, noel said, is much like a car's shock absorbers. the tongue's softness also allows it to change shape during contact and immediately afterward while retracting. 
 the other vital component of the capturing process is the frog's versatile saliva. 
 ""there are actually three phases,"" noel said. ""when the tongue first hits the insect, the saliva is almost like water and fills all the bug's crevices. then, when the tongue snaps back, the saliva changes and becomes more viscous - thicker than honey, actually - gripping the insect for the ride back.  the saliva turns watery again when the insect is sheared off inside the mouth."" 
 unlike water and honey, frog saliva can change its viscosity with shear rate, much like paint. paint spreads easily when applied, but stays firmly on the wall once the brush is removed. 
 ""for frogs, saliva seeps easily when it hits the insect, then thickens up during retraction,"" she said. 
 this spit switch can't be seen in the 
 slow-mo videos . to identify the shear rate when viscosity drops, noel collected saliva from 18 frogs and placed samples in a rheometer, a highly sensitive device for measuring properties of fluids. 
 david hu, a professor in the george w. woodruff school of mechanical engineering, is noel's advisor who has also studied how 
 mosquitos fly in the rain , how dogs shake off water 
 and 
 why eyelashes need to be an ideal length . he says the frog study could help engineers design reversible adhesives at high speed. 
 ""most adhesives that have been created are stiff, especially tape,"" said hu, who is also a faculty member in the school of biological sciences. ""frog tongues can attach and reattach with soft, special properties that are extremely stickier than typical materials. perhaps this technology could be used for new band-aids. or it could be used to create new materials in soft manufacturing."" 
 the georgia tech team worked with mark mandica, the leading herpetologist at the 
 amphibian foundation 
 in atlanta. the foundation brings together top researchers in the field of amphibian biology, conservation, and applied science to address the causes of global amphibian declines. current research estimates that 38 percent of the world's amphibian populations are in decline or already extinct. 
 the study, "" frogs use a viscoelastic tongue and non-newtonian saliva to catch prey ,"" is published in the journal of the royal society interface.

 figuring out which combinations of materials will make the most effective polymers is a monumental and time-consuming task because the combinations are essentially endless. researchers at georgia tech have developed a groundbreaking machine learning model that could revolutionize how scientists and manufacturers virtually search the chemical space to identify and develop these all-important polymers. 
 jul 18, 2023 
 - atlanta, ga 
 polymers are well-known macromolecules in materials science and engineering communities, but most of us may not be aware of how often we're touching, using, and interfacing with these materials. polymers can be engineered to have desired properties such as flexibility, water resistance, or electrical conductivity. nonstick cookware and construction materials, for example, include the polymers polytetrafluoroethylene and polyvinyl chloride. 
 figuring out which combinations of materials will make the most effective polymers is a monumental and time-consuming task because the combinations are essentially endless. researchers at georgia tech have developed a groundbreaking machine learning model that could revolutionize how scientists and manufacturers virtually search the chemical space to identify and develop these all-important polymers. they published their findings recently in 
 ""polybert: a chemical language model to enable fully machine-driven ultrafast polymer informatics"" in 
 nature communications . 
 the work was conceived and guided by 
 rampi ramprasad 
 from the 
 georgia tech school of materials science and engineering. 
 the new tool called polybert was designed and implemented by chris kuenneth, formerly a postdoctoral fellow in the ramprasad group and current professor at the university of bayeruth in germany. it aims to overcome the challenges of searching the staggeringly large chemical space of polymers. trained on a massive dataset of 80 million polymer chemical structures, polybert has become an expert in understanding the language of polymers. 
 ""this is a novel application of language models within polymer informatics. while natural language models may be used to extract materials data from the literature, here, we aim such capabilities at understanding the complex grammar and syntax followed by atoms as they come together to make up polymers,"" said ramprasad, the michael e. tennenbaum family chair and georgia research alliance eminent scholar in energy sustainability. 
 currently investigators use a manual method called fingerprinting to understand the chemical structure of polymers, which are used to understand the relationships between the structure, properties, and performance of different polymers. polybert treats chemical structures and connectivity of atoms as a form of chemical language and uses state-of-the-art techniques inspired by natural language processing to extract the most meaningful information from chemical structures. the tool uses the powerful transformer architecture, used in natural language models, to capture the patterns and relationships and learn the grammar and syntax that occur at the atomic and higher levels in the polymer structure. 
 speed is one remarkable advantage of polybert. compared to traditional fingerprinting methods, polybert is over two orders of magnitude faster. this high-speed capability makes polybert an ideal tool for high-throughput polymer informatics pipelines, allowing for the rapid screening of massive polymer spaces at an unprecedented scale. 
 with advancements in graphics processing unit technology, the computation time for polybert fingerprints is expected to improve even further. 
 polybert's multitask deep neural networks enable it to simultaneously predict multiple properties of polymers, leveraging hidden correlations within the data. this approach outperforms single-task models, enhancing the accuracy of property predictions. property predictions for large datasets by polybert can offer valuable insights into the true limits of the polymer property space. researchers can establish standardized benchmarks, explore uncharted areas, and even facilitate the direct selection of polymers with specific properties. by analyzing the chemical relevance of polybert-generated fingerprints, scientists can unravel the functions and interactions of different structural components in polymers. this opens possibilities for designing polymers based on an even wider array of specific properties. 
 the dataset, comprising 100 million hypothetical polymers and their predictions for 29 properties, is now available for academic use. this vast collection presents researchers with ample opportunities to delve into the polymer universe, unlocking new discoveries, design rules, and practical applications. 
 ""our vision is to combine ultrafast fingerprinting and property prediction schemes such as polybert and polygnn with virtual polymer generation algorithms to perform searches of synthetically accessible chemical spaces for application-specific polymers at unprecedented scales,"" said ramprasad. 
 an alternate capability to perform ultrafast fingerprinting of polymers by treating polymer chemical structures as mathematical graphs was also recently published from the ramprasad group in the journal 
 chemistry of materials . this capability, called polygnn, was designed and implemented by georgia tech graduate student rishi gurnani.

 this robot is designed to lure in digital troublemakers who have set their sights on industrial facilities. honeybot will then trick the bad actors into giving up valuable information to cybersecurity professionals. 
 cybersecurity experts have a new tool in the fight against hackers - a decoy robot. researchers at georgia tech built the ""honeybot"" to lure hackers into thinking they had taken control of a robot, but instead the robot gathers valuable information about the bad actors, helping businesses better protect themselves from future attacks. 
 mar 29, 2018 
 - atlanta, ga 
 it's small enough to fit inside a shoebox, yet this robot on four wheels has a big mission: keeping factories and other large facilities safe from hackers. 
 meet the honeybot. 
 developed by a team of researchers at the georgia institute of technology, the diminutive device is designed to lure in digital troublemakers who have set their sights on industrial facilities. honeybot will then trick the bad actors into giving up valuable information to cybersecurity professionals. 
 the decoy robot arrives as more and more devices - never designed to operate on the internet - are coming online in homes and factories alike, opening up a new range of possibilities for hackers looking to wreak havoc in both the digital and physical world. 
 ""robots do more now than they ever have, and some companies are moving forward with, not just the assembly line robots, but free-standing robots that can actually drive around factory floors,"" said raheem beyah, the motorola foundation professor and interim steve w. chaddick school chair in georgia tech's school of electrical and computer engineering. ""in that type of setting, you can imagine how dangerous this could be if a hacker gains access to those machines. at a minimum, they could cause harm to whatever products are being produced. if it's a large enough robot, it could destroy parts or the assembly line. in a worst-case scenario, it could injure or cause death to the humans in the vicinity."" 
 internet security professionals long have employed decoy computer systems known as ""honeypots"" as a way to throw cyberattackers off the trail. the research team applied the same concept to the honeybot, which is partially funded with a grant from the national science foundation. once hackers gain access to the decoy, they leave behind valuable information that can help companies further secure their networks. 
 ""a lot of cyberattacks go unanswered or unpunished because there's this level of anonymity afforded to malicious actors on the internet, and it's hard for companies to say who is responsible,"" said celine irvene, a georgia tech graduate student who worked with beyah to devise the new robot. ""honeypots give security professionals the ability to study the attackers, determine what methods they are using, and figure out where they are or potentially even who they are."" 
 the gadget can be monitored and controlled through the internet. but unlike other remote-controlled robots, the honeybot's special ability is tricking its operators into thinking it is performing one task, when in reality it's doing something completely different. 
 ""the idea behind a honeypot is that you don't want the attackers to know they're in a honeypot,"" beyah said. ""if the attacker is smart and is looking out for the potential of a honeypot, maybe they'd look at different sensors on the robot, like an accelerometer or speedometer, to verify the robot is doing what it had been instructed. that's where we would be spoofing that information as well. the hacker would see from looking at the sensors that acceleration occurred from point a to point b."" 
 in a factory setting, such a honeybot robot could sit motionless in a corner, springing to life when a hacker gains access - a visual indicator that a malicious actor is targeting the facility. 
 rather than allowing the hacker to then run amok in the physical world, the robot could be designed to follow certain commands deemed harmless - such as meandering slowly about or picking up objects - but stopping short of actually doing anything dangerous. 
 so far, their technique seems to be working. 
 in experiments designed to test how convincing the false sensor data would be to individuals remotely controlling the device, volunteers in december 2017 used a virtual interface to control the robot and could not to see what was happening in real life. to entice the volunteers to break the rules, at specific spots within the maze, they encountered forbidden ""shortcuts"" that would allow them to finish the maze faster. 
 in the real maze back in the lab, no shortcut existed, and if the participants opted to go through it, the robot instead remained still. meanwhile, the volunteers - who have now unwittingly become hackers for the purposes of the experiment - were fed simulated sensor data indicating they passed through the shortcut and continued along. 
 ""we wanted to make sure they felt that this robot was doing this real thing,"" beyah said. 
 in surveys after the experiment, participants who actually controlled the device the whole time and those who were being fed simulated data about the fake shortcut both indicated that the data was believable at similar rates. 
 ""this is a good sign because it indicates that we're on the right track,"" irvene said.

 what do you give a robot when it takes its first steps like a human? its first pair of shoes. georgia institute of technology researchers have created what they say is the most efficient-walking humanoid ever created. while most machines these days are hunched at the waist and plod along on flat feet, 
 georgia tech's durus strolls like a person . its legs and chest are elongated and upright. it lands on the heel of its foot, rolls through the step and pushes off its toe. it's even outfitted with a pair of size-13 shoes as it walks under its own power on a treadmill in the team's 
 amber lab . ""our robot is able to take much longer, faster steps than its flat-footed counterparts because it's replicating human locomotion,"" said aaron ames, director of the georgia tech lab and a professor in the george w. woodruff school of mechanical engineering and school of electrical and computer engineering. ""multi-contact foot behavior also allows it to be more dynamic, pushing us closer to our goal of allowing the robot to walk outside in the real world."" as ames tells it, the traditional approach to creating a robotic walker is similar to an upside-down pendulum. researchers typically use comparatively simple algorithms to move the top of the machine forward while keeping its feet flat and grounded. as it shuffles along, the waist stays at a constant height, creating the distinctive hunched look. this not only prevents these robots from moving with the dynamic grace present in human walking, but also prevents them from efficiently propelling themselves forward. the georgia tech humanoid 
 walked with flat feet until about a week ago , although it was powered by fundamentally different algorithms than most robots. to demonstrate the power of those methods, ames and his team of student researchers built a pair of metal feet with arched soles. they applied their complex mathematical formulas, but watched durus misstep and fall for three days. the team continued to tweak the algorithms and, on the fourth day, the robot got it.  the machine walked dynamically on its new feet, displaying the heel-strike and toe push-off that is a key feature of human walking. the robot is further equipped with springs between its ankles and feet, similar to elastic tendons in people, allowing for a walking gait that stores mechanical energy from a heel strike to be later reclaimed as the foot lifts off the ground. this natural gait makes durus very efficient. robot locomotion efficiency is universally measured by a ""cost of transport,"" or the amount of power it uses divided by the machine's weight and walking speed. ames says the best humanoids are approximately 3.0. georgia tech's cost of transport is 1.4, all while being self-powered: it's not tethered by a power cord from an external source. this new level of efficiency is achieved in no small part through human-like foot behavior. durus had earned its new pair of shoes.  ""flat-footed robots demonstrated that walking was possible,"" said ames. ""but they're a starting point, like a propeller-powered airplane. it gets the job done, but it's not a jet engine. we want to build something better, something that can walk up and down stairs or run across a field."" he adds these advances have the potential to usher in the next generation of robotic assistive devices like prostheses and exoskeletons that can enable the mobility-impaired to walk with ease. the student team was led by graduate student jake reher. the shoes were created by another graduate student, eric ambrose. durus was designed in collaboration with the robotics division of sri international.  the project is supported by the

 last halloween, sonia chernova hardly left her doorstep in decatur, georgia, handing out candy to a constant stream of kids. 
 this year, she put an autonomous robot on the porch to do it for her. it gave out 1,000 pieces in three hours to hundreds of kids. 
 ""best halloween ever,"" said chernova, an assistant professor in the school of interactive computing. ""both kids and parents loved getting candy from a real robot, and many people stayed around to watch it work. now all of my neighbors want one for their house next year!"" 
 the credit for the event goes to chernova's research team, who got the idea after she mentioned that halloween is overwhelming at her house because of the crowds. the students went to work, training sawyer, 
 a collaborative machine built by rethink robotics , in less than an hour. they simply showed the robot the motions that were required. the robot did the rest of the work the rest of the night. 
 ""it was fun to watch the faces of the kids when they walked up to the house,"" chernova said. ""everyone wanted to know who was remotely controlling the robot, but everything was autonomous. it was a lot of fun!"" 
 the robot wore a hat, cape and mask. 
 what's next? 
 ""maybe we'll have sawyer carve a turkey on thanksgiving,"" chernova said. ""or hang ornaments during the holidays."" 
 chernova oversees georgia tech's 
 robot autonomy and interactive learning (rail) lab , 
 which works to make robots more accessible to people. andrew silva, jonathan balloch, david kent, siddhartha banerjee, angel daruna, asif rana and weiuy liu are the students who worked on the halloween project.

robotic-cleaning-technique-could-automate-neuroscience-research.txt,"robotic cleaning technique could automate neuroscience research

 for scientists listening in on the faint whispers of brain neurons, a first-ever robotic technique for cleaning the tiny devices that record the signals could facilitate a new level of automation in neuroscience research. that could accelerate the gathering of information used to map the functions of brain cells and ultimately provide a better understanding what's going on between our ears. 
 the technique would be used in a recording method known as patch-clamping, in which a tiny liquid-filled glass pipette is connected to individual neurons. since patch-clamping was invented three decades ago, the technique has required changing pipettes between recordings - a manual process that slows research. now, a robotic cleaning technique developed by researchers at the georgia institute of technology allows the pipettes to be reused for as many as 11 recordings - and potentially more - allowing the recording to be more automated. 
 ""this is a step toward revolutionizing the robotic techniques in neuroscience,"" said 
 craig forest , associate professor in georgia tech's 
 george w. woodruff school of mechanical engineering. 
 ""we want to be able to put samples into our machine and walk away while it records 50 or even 100 neurons. this could enable for neuroscience the kind of research automation we've seen in other fields such as molecular biology, dramatically expanding our ability to listen in on brain signals."" 
 supported by the national institutes of health and the allen institute for brain science, the research was reported october 11 in the journal 
 scientific reports . based on their cleaning technique and earlier innovations that automated the process of connecting the pipettes to cells, the georgia tech researchers have demonstrated what's believed to be the first robot to perform sequential patch-clamp recording in cell culture, brain slices, and in the living brain - without a human operator. 
 to share what it's doing, the patch-clamping robot - known as ""patcherbot"" - has its own twitter account to automatically report on every cell it records. ""this is the first social neuroscience robot,"" said forest. 
 patch-clamping is the gold standard for stimulating and recording signals from neurons and other cells. it involves touching a glass pipette with a tip just one micron in diameter to the cell membrane, creating a tight seal that provides a direct electrical connection to the insides of the cell. the work is extremely meticulous and time-consuming, though a recent robotic technology termed the autopatcher, also out of forest's lab, has automated parts of the process. 
 because cellular debris could prevent the tight connection to cells, researchers have had to replace the pipettes with new ones for each recording. but while conducting patch-clamping, graduate research assistant ilya kolb began to question the conventional wisdom that the pipettes could not be used more than once. he knew about detergents used to clean laboratory glassware, and set to work assessing whether or not these agents to be used in a robotic cleaning process. 
 ""if you could clean the pipette automatically after each recording, you could just tell the autopatcher to go back to cells again and again,"" forest explained. ""you wouldn't even have to be in the room anymore. you could set this up before you leave the lab for the day, and when you returned the next morning, you'd have recorded 50 or 100 cells."" 
 kolb tested eight cleaning solutions and found one - alconox - which successfully removed the debris. he reprogrammed the software operating the autopatcher to add cleaning and rinsing steps between each recording. the new robot dips the pipette into a detergent solution located in a well next to the sample, creates a flow of fluid into and back out of the pipette, then moves the pipette to a rinse in a separate well. the entire cleaning process takes about a minute, which is as fast or even faster than a trained human operator. 
 the researchers compared the quality of the recordings made by the cleaned pipettes to those made with new ones. 
 ""when we patch with a fresh pipette and when we patch with a pipette that has been used and cleaned 11 times, the results are basically indistinguishable,"" said kolb. ""we do see some degradation after 14 or more attempts, but we're hopeful that with improvements in the technique, we could reuse pipettes as many as 50 or 100 times."" 
 working with researchers at emory university, the technique was tested to determine whether any remaining detergent residue could affect living cells. results of the testing, supplemented with mass spectroscopy studies of the pipette fluid, found no adverse implications. 
 georgia tech has filed for patent protection on the new robotic technique, which allows technicians to simply choose the cells to be recorded using a microscope view - then let the machine work. the researchers hope the technique can be commercialized for use not only by the thousands of labs currently using patch-clamping, but also used to expand automated applications more broadly for pharmaceutical testing and other research. 
 ""if we can put this technology into a piece of equipment and have all the smarts provided by software, it could really democratize this area of research,"" said forest. ""that's where we're headed in building tools that will make new science possible.""

 a georgia tech student has surrounded himself with a team of dancing robots and an improvising, marimba-playing bot to collaborate on an original, miles davis-inspired composition. mason bretan, a ph.d. candidate in music technology, plays the drums, guitar and keyboard. a robot named shimon listens to the sounds, then generates music on a marimba using its computational knowledge of jazz theory and improvisation. at the same time, a trio of shimi robots autonomously generates dance choreographies based on a joint analysis of the music and a self-awareness of their physical constraints and abilities. the shimis also play their own complementing music, based on a combination of bretan's original compositions and improvisational algorithms. 
 the six-minute, high-energy funk piece 
 is called ""what you say"" and is based on davis' ""what i say."" it's the latest project from the lab of gil weinberg, bretan's advisor and director of georgia tech's center for music technology. bretan created the composition after listening to davis' 1971 live evil album. ""the brilliance of the musicians on that album is an inspiration to me and my own musical and instrumental aspirations,"" said bretan. ""they also set the standard for the level of musicianship that i hope machines will one day achieve. and through the power of artificial intelligence, signal processing and engineering, i firmly believe it is possible for machines to be artistic, creative and inspirational."" the project was created during a span of several months at georgia tech. the shimi robots analyze the music offline and generate a sequence of movements and musical phrases that can then be performed live. shimon, is given the chord progression prior to the performance, then figures out how to improvise with bretan. the student will spend the next few months fine-tuning the process to allow real-time analysis and composing.

 here's an open invitation to steal. it goes out to cancer fighters and tempts them with a 
 new program that predicts cancer drug effectiveness 
 via machine learning and raw genetic data. 
 the researchers who built the program at the georgia institute of technology would like cancer fighters to take it for free, or even just swipe parts of their programming code, so they've made it open source. they hope to attract a crowd of researchers who will also share their own cancer and computer expertise and data to improve upon the program and save more lives together. 
 the researchers' invitation to take their code is also a gauntlet. 
 they're challenging others to come beat them at their own game and help hone a formidable software tool for the greater good. not only the labor but also the fruits will remain openly accessible to benefit the treatment of patients as best possible. 
 ""we don't want to hold the code or data for ourselves or make profits with this,"" said john mcdonald, the 
 director of georgia tech's integrated cancer research center .  ""we want to keep this wide open so it will spread."" 
 the goods 
 researchers wanting to participate can 
 follow this link to a new study published on october 26, 2017, in the journal 
 plos one . there they will find links to download the software from github and to access the code. 
 they'll start out with a current program that has been about 85% accurate in assessing treatment effectiveness of nine drugs across the genetic data of 273 cancer patients. the study by mcdonald and collaborator fredrik vannberg details how and why. 
 ""nine drugs are in the published study, but we've actually run about 120 drugs through the program all total,"" said vannberg, an 
 assistant professor in georgia tech's school of biological sciences . 
 the program uses proven machine learning mechanisms and also normalizes data. the latter allows the machine learning to work with data from varying sources by making them compatible. 
 the bias 
 and the researchers have reduced human bias about which data are important for predicting outcomes. 
 ""it's much more effective to put in loads of raw data and let the algorithm sort it out,"" mcdonald said. ""it's looking for correlations, not causes, so it's not good to preselect data for what you suspect are most relevant."" 
 one big bias the researchers tossed out was a concentration only on gene expression data pertaining to the specific type of cancer they were aiming to treat. 
 ""it turns out that it's better to give the program data from a broad diversity of cancers, and that will actually later give a better prediction of drug effectiveness for a specific cancer like breast cancer,"" vannberg said. 
 ""on a molecular level, some breast cancers, for example, are going to be more similar to some ovarian cancers than to other breast cancers,"" mcdonald said. ""we just let the algorithm work with about everything we had, and we got high accuracy."" 
 the winners 
 the researchers also want the project to pool large amounts of anonymous patient treatment success and failure data, which will help the program optimize predictions for everyone's benefit. but that doesn't mean some companies can't benefit, too. 
 ""if a company comes along and makes profits while using the program to help patients, that's fine, and there's no obligation to give back to the project,"" said mcdonald, who is also a professor in georgia tech's 
 school of biological sciences . ""others may just take if they so please."" 
 but hopefully, most players will catch the spirit of kindness. 
 ""with our project, we're advertising that sharing should be what everybody does,"" vannberg said. ""this can be a win for everybody, but really it's a win for the cancer patients.""

 anyone who has a rear-view mirror that automatically dims blue in reaction to annoying high-beam headlights glaring from behind has seen an electrochromic film in action. 
 now, 
 chemists at the georgia institute of technology 
 have developed 
 a new method to more safely and, by extension, easily produce these shear films , which change their color with the help of a tiny electric current. this could make them available to many industries that have not been able to feasibly use them before. 
 in manufacturing, electrochromic films are often coated onto other materials, such as the surface of a mirror, as inks. they are usually based in solvents that are flammable and have toxic fumes, making them unsuitable for many work settings that rely on printing and spraying machinery to apply colors. 
 georgia tech researchers have developed electrochromic film inks that are water-based, making them safer for diffuse application in settings where the kinds of safety precautions and protective equipment that are standard in handling volatile organic chemicals would be impractical. 
 everyday environments 
 ""where people print is not always in chemically safe environments,"" said 
 john reynolds, 
 a professor in georgia tech's 
 schools of chemistry and biochemistry 
 and 
 material science and engineering . so reynolds and the study's first author brian schmatz, who came up with the water-based method, set out to make electrochromic film inks safer for everyday environments. 
 there were some hurdles to pulling it off. the finished product had to electrically operate comparable to films that are applied in an organic solvent, and also be water-resistant in spite of the water-based production. schmatz's method also needed to be logistically and financially realistic for producers to implement. 
 the researchers published details on their solution and how it has met the criteria 
 in the journal 
 acs central science 
 on august 16, 2017. 
 should the chemical process progress to production, the future may see more windows, prescription glasses, or even textiles 
 that switch between colors and shades of darkness with the click of a button 
 or with the help of a light-detecting switch. 
 that's how many self-dimming rear-view mirrors work: the high-beams of the motorist behind you hit a light sensor that applies a mild electric field to the mirror, and that activates the color-changing, or electrochromic, film, which switches to a darker tint. 
 electrochemical rainbow 
 the reynolds lab's electrochromic films are made with 
 conjugated polymers , colorful and electroactive organic molecules. they easily let go of a few of their more loosely attached electrons, and when they do, their colors shift. 
 if the colored films are on a clear surface, when the color vanishes, the surface becomes clear. the surface has to be conductive so that a small voltage (about 1 volt) can be applied to bump the electrons off the conjugated polymer or help them jump back on. 
 the tints don't have to be gray, blue, brown, or otherwise straight-laced. ""we can make any color,"" reynolds said. 
 ‘toxic,' ‘carcinogenic' 
 because of previous inks' organic solvents, applying electrochromic films in the past has come with significant safety requirements. their costs could become prohibitive if the job is big, say, if a company wanted to cover the windows of an office building with an electrochromic film. 
 ""most research labs use chlorobenzene as a solvent. it's pretty toxic. it's carcinogenic, slightly volatile as well,"" schmatz said. ""so, it's not something people want to work with at scale."" 
 also, people may simply find the smell of an organic chemical in their workplace unpleasant. examples of organic solvent smells most everyone has experienced are kerosene, gasoline, or rubbing alcohol. 
 organic then aqueous 
 water as a solvent is much safer, but it can present other challenges. conjugated polymers are produced in organic solvents and do not inherently dissolve in water. also, films printed from water-based inks might wash out in the rain or smudge in high humidity. 
 schmatz's invention combines the best of both worlds by using an organic solvent and an aqueous solvent in phases. 
 first, the conjugated polymer is produced in an organic solvent to assure quality material is made. that's also aligned with chemical industry practices. 
 ""chemical companies really do a lot of this kind of processing, and it's advantageous to keep this as it is, so the companies can keep doing what they're doing and add this product more easily,"" schmatz said. 
 but then schmatz alters the conjugated polymer - the ink's active ingredient, so to speak -- which is usually not water soluble, so that it will indeed dissolve in water. 
 ""we embed a chemical trigger within the polymer. it's activated through a high ph water wash, and that transforms the organic soluble polymer into a water soluble polyelectrolyte,"" he said. ""the reason we want to do all of this is so we can produce the polymer in an organic solvent, but then print the polymer from a water-based ink."" 
 ultraviolet cleaver 
 to make sure that the film doesn't smear or run after printing and that it functions well when it's completed, schmatz cleaves off that added chemical trigger from the conjugated polymer by shining ultraviolet light on the electrochromic film. 
 the water-soluble chemical chain then becomes a simple residue that can be wiped or rinsed off. what's left is a robust, pure conjugated polymer film, which can no longer dissolve in water or organic solvents. 
 reynolds envisions electrochromic films on various materials, including some other than glass or plastic. ""you could apply this to camouflage, for example, with the right textiles, and have a sensor connected to a battery, and have it switch the colors to match the changing lightness or darkness of a soldier's surroundings."" 
 aside from electrochromics, these conjugated polymers are also being explored for printed transistors, solar cells, chemical and bio-sensors, light emitting displays and bioelectronics. reynold's group has access to a number of delivery methods to test application of conjugated polymers. 
 ""georgia tech is a focused engineering university and has application capabilities you can find right here,"" reynolds said. ""the various methods of printing or spraying are here - airbrush, blade coater, ink jet. and if we don't have something, we can build it here.""

 - atlanta, ga 
 when tasked with redesigning a medical device, four biomedical engineering majors focused their attention on scalpels. specifically, the blade packaging for the tool. 
 their blade packaging was designed to protect health care workers from accidental injuries that can occur when handling exposed scalpel blades. 
 now their invention, 
 scal-pal , is one of six competing for georgia tech's 
 inventure prize , an annual innovation competition. the winner will be chosen march 14. 
 currently doctors and nurses must handle the blade with their fingers to remove it or attach a new one to the scalpel handle. the foil packaging around a fresh blade is opened like an adhesive bandage. one person opens the packaging, while a second person grabs the exposed blade with needle holders and inserts it into the scalpel handle. 
 ""it's easy for accidents to happen because the packaging forces the blade to be exposed,"" said alpharetta native bailey klee. ""i was job shadowing in an operating room and i saw a nurse take off the blade and cut herself. we found a way to prevent that from happening again."" 
 scal-pal 
 works much the same way as switching out razor blades. the blade is stored inside a single-use box made from pre-recycled polyethylene, akin to the plastic used in milk jugs. the scalpel handle is inserted into the box and the blade is attached. to remove the used blade, the scalpel is inserted back into the box and the blade is released from the handle and trapped inside. the entire box is then thrown away. 
 the team 3d printed the pink and black box in the 
 bme machine shop . 
 ""our design works because the blade is never exposed,"" said sydney platt, who is from lake jackson, texas. ""no one has to touch it directly."" 
 ""there is a market and a need for what we developed,"" added nicholas quan from richmond hill, ga. 
 hospitals spend more than $116 million a year on scalpel related injuries, reported rachel mann, a native of homer glen, ill. those same hospitals use more than 1 million scalpel blades a day. 
 ""we need to gain exposure with medical device manufacturers,"" mann said. ""we're hopeful the inventure prize will help make that happen.""

 georgia tech has received two department of defense (dod) 
 2022 multidisciplinary university research initiative (muri) awards 
 totaling almost $14 million. the highly competitive government program supports interdisciplinary teams of investigators developing innovative solutions in dod interest areas. this year, the dod awarded $195 million to 28 research teams across the country. 
 georgia tech's muris are both primarily within the 
 school of physics . first, 
 simon sponberg , a dunn family associate professor of physics and biological sciences, leads a team discovering how animals strategically use sensing and cognition to make decisions in complex environments. the project, 
 fast, lexicographic agile perception integrates decision and control in a spike-resolved, sensorimotor program (flap), 
 specifically addresses the  core dod topic area of understanding neural systems integration for competent autonomy in decision and control. 
 ""we have all these great, sophisticated algorithms for processing big data, but an animal doesn't have time to process a million samples of its environment and then figure out what's a predator,"" said sponberg. 
 studying moths for their agile, sophisticated flying and complex sensing abilities, the team will record electrical activity in the brain to determine how the moths make decisions and use natural language processing techniques to see how a moth derives meaning from sensory cues and movements. the goal is to develop an information processing framework that enables quick, flexible decision-making that could facilitate the next generation of autonomous bio-inspired systems and better integrate living systems with engineered technologies 
 the interdisciplinary nature of the team makes complex research possible. half the team is made of experimentalists: sponberg specializes in sensors connected to motor systems with precisely timed signals; jeff riffell, a professor at the university of washington, studies how the nervous system processes sensory signals to control behavior; and as a vision neuroscientist at florida international university, jamie theobald, determines how animals parse complex environments. the other half of the team will build the framework: duke professor vahid tarokh models complex datasets, georgia tech 
 school of mathematics 
 assistant professor 
 hannah choi 
 focuses on neural networks, and cornell professor silvia ferrari ties it all together as a control theorist embedding control in neural structures. 
 ""muris were originally training grants for the dod to develop the next generation of scientists who would make progress,"" said sponberg. ""this funding will allow us to have postdocs and graduate students across all six labs and disciplines working together tightly and creating a community."" 
 for the second muri, 
 programming multistable origami and kirigami structures via topological design, 
 georgia tech assistant professor 
 zeb rocklin 
 is part of a team exploring a new class of origami- and kirigami-inspired flexible, lightweight structures capable of transitioning between many stable shapes to perform different tasks or adapt to changing environmental conditions. these structures could be used in a range of applications, from multifunctional robots and collapsible antennae to rapidly assembled bridges and temporary structures, and force protection elements like origami-inspired bulletproof shields. 
 the team combines experts in mathematics, physics, material science, mechanics, robotics, numerical modeling, and computation, including harvard university professors katie betoldi, jennifer lewis, l. mahadevan, and robert wood, as well as university of pennsylvania associate professor eleni katifori 
 the researchers will develop mathematical models to characterize and design the complex mechanical behavior of multi-stable origami and kirigami structures; new scale-spanning manufacturing processes that efficiently integrate actuation and sensing; and experimental test beds to serve as a platform for evaluation and optimization of design concepts. 
 ""this project benefits from georgia tech's ability to develop tight, powerful connections between engineering advanced technologies and developing universal, mathematically rigorous physical theories,"" rocklin said. ""we'll be starting from concepts that anyone can get a sense of by looking at or feeling a piece of origami and using robotics and multifunctional 3d printing to create complex, flexible and robust dynamical structures that can do things nobody has ever seen before.""

school-public-policy-professor-talks-tiktok-ban.txt,"school of public policy professor talks tiktok ban 
 professor milton mueller is the co-author of a widely cited report on tiktok. 
 apr 23, 2024 
 newly passed legislation requiring the sale or ban of tiktok has more to do with political fears over u.s. competitiveness with china than with national security, according to a school of public policy cybersecurity policy and internet governance expert.. ""it amounts to a new 
 chinese exclusion act 
 for the 21st century,"" said professor milton mueller, director of the internet governance project in georgia tech's 
 school of public policy . the tiktok provision is part of foreign aid legislation signed by president joe biden on wednesday, a day after it easily cleared the u.s. senate following bipartisan approval in the house. it requires that tiktok's chinese owner, bytedance, sell the service or face a u.s. ban. advocates of such a ban say tiktok is a national security threat: a backdoor for the chinese government to sow disinformation and maliciously leverage the private data of u.s. users.  however, 
 mueller , whose research has been widely cited in the tiktok debate, has found no credible national security threat in tiktok - certainly nothing, he said, that isn't also an issue with any other social media service. ""there are foreign influence campaigns going on right now on facebook, x, and other platforms. there's nothing unique about tiktok in that regard,"" mueller said. and while critics would argue that chinese-owned tiktok is different than facebook or x - both largely american companies - mueller says that no matter who owns a social media platform, there's little national security value in the data of everyday americans who post dances, silly animal videos, or even political commentary. risk is inherent in any social media platform and focused on users closely connected to national security functions - risks the sale or closure of one social media platform won't solve, he said. mueller's analysis of tiktok and the arguments swirling around it are published in a march 2023 
 report . he said he doubts that a sale of tiktok is likely, at least in its current form. china's government has said it sees the artificial intelligence that powers tiktok's algorithm as chinese intellectual property that can't be transferred to the u.s. so, whatever might be sold would be, essentially, a different service. mueller echoed many legal experts who have argued that a ban would trigger an immediate court challenge on free speech grounds. however, if such legal challenges were to fail, it would be a blow to the free flow of ideas around the world, mueller argues. ""if the ban goes through and is upheld by the courts, this would be a disaster for the freedom of information and the ethos of the internet, that we can all be connected,"" mueller said.

 people with weakened immune systems are at constant risk of infection.  pseudomonas aeruginosa , a common environmental bacterium, can colonize different body parts, such as the lungs, leading to persistent, chronic infections that can last a lifetime - a common occurrence for people with cystic fibrosis. 
 but the bacteria can sometimes change their behavior and enter the bloodstream, causing chronic localized infections to become acute and potentially fatal. despite decades of studying the transition in lab environments, how and why the switch happens in humans has remained unknown.

 there's nothing like the first time. a first kiss. your first car. a baby's first steps. 
 laura cadonati's first chirp came on 
 september 14, 2015 . it lasted just a fraction of second, passing through earth 1.5 billion years after a violent collision of two massive black holes. the signal confirmed the existence of gravitational waves, ripples in space-time, which the world had been hoping to detect since albert einstein predicted them a century ago. 
 on august 17 of this year, cadonati and her ligo colleagues heard another chirp - much different from the original. this chirp didn't come and go in the blink of an eye. it stretched for 100 seconds. 
 ""groundbreaking,"" said cadonati, a professor in the 
 college of sciences . ""it's just as special as the first one, if not more."" 
 that's because the gravitational wave that produced this chirp arrived with something else, something that couldn't have been produced by colliding black holes. it arrived with light. 
 130-million-year-old clues 
 for the first time, scientists have detected a gravitational wave produced by the collision of two neutron stars. the wave was born 130 million years ago when the stars spun around each other, creating warps in space and time. when the stars crashed together, they produced a burst of electromagnetic radiation - gamma radiation, to be precise. 
 those gravitational waves and gamma rays raced through the cosmos at the speed of light, arriving at earth at 8:41 a.m. on august 17. 
 the waves were first detected by the laser interferometer gravitational-wave observatory (ligo) and italy's virgo observatory. nasa's orbiting fermi satellite saw the gamma ray flash two seconds later, and the european science agency also confirmed it. in the days and weeks afterward, other forms of electromagnetic radiation - including x-ray, ultraviolet, optical, infrared and radio waves - were detected by nearly 70 ground- and space-based observatories around the world. 
 the observations are allowing scientists to view a neutron star collision, and learn what happens next, for the first time. 
 ""the 2015 detection was about discovery. this time it's about understanding,"" said cadonati, who also serves as deputy spokesperson of the ligo scientific collaboration (lsc), an international team of more than 1,200 researchers. ""we're decoding the mysteries of the universe using our senses. we're listening to the information within gravitational waves and combining it with what we're seeing within electromagnetic radiation."" 
 a golden collision 
 neutron stars form when massive stars explode in supernovas and collapse upon themselves. the august 17 neutron stars were about 12 miles in diameter - about the size of atlanta - with an estimated mass within the range of 1.1 to 1.6 times that of our sun. neutron stars are so incredibly dense that a teaspoon of their material would weigh a billion tons. 
 the gravitational waves they produced are gone forever, arriving and leaving the ligo and virgo detectors in less than two minutes. but the fragments of the collision remain in view for electromagnetic researchers, who have pointed their telescopes and instruments at the faraway galaxy. 
 theorists have predicted that what follows the initial fireball is a ""kilonova"" - a phenomenon by which the material that is left over from the collision is blown out of the immediate region and far out into space and triggers a chain of nuclear reactions. the new light-based observations show that heavy elements, such as lead, gold and platinum, are created in these collisions and subsequently distributed throughout the universe. this solves a decades-long mystery of where about half of all elements heavier than iron are produced. 
 more findings are expected as scientists continue to monitor the smashup's remnants in the weeks and months to come. 
 ""this detection has genuinely opened the doors to a new way of doing astrophysics,"" said cadonati. ""i expect it will be remembered as one of the most studied astrophysical events in history."" 
 the tech contribution 
 cadonati announced the findings during a press conference on october 16 in washington, d.c., as part of a panel of ligo, virgo and electromagnetic researchers. she's one of 17 georgia tech faculty members, postdoctoral researchers and students within the lsc. each is also a member of the georgia tech 
 center for relativistic astrophysics 
 within the 
 school of physics . 
 ""to me, it's easily the most interesting physical discovery in recent times,"" said graduate student christopher evans. ""this not only gives us a chance to study neutron stars in a manner that we have never before, but also allows us to look at these exotic objects from multiple perspectives at once in order to form a more complete picture."" 
 evans created a visualization of the collision and the gravitational waves it produced. the animation was included in the worldwide announcement at the press club. 
 postdoctoral researcher karelle siellez joined the georgia tech ligo team in 2015. for this discovery, she collaborated with nasa's fermi satellite team as it searched the skies for gamma rays. she developed algorithms that helped ensure that no bursts, as faint as they might be, would be overlooked during the search for gravitational waves. siellez will now work on the development of new algorithms for the joint search of gravitational waves and faint gamma ray bursts when the ligo instruments come back online in 2018. 
 ""today we are in a river,"" she said. ""tomorrow we will swim in an ocean of data where neutron star mergers guide us to a better understanding of our universe, observing cataclysmic events we once could only dream of."" 
 another georgia tech postdoctoral researcher, james clark, was at a workshop in montana on august 17. he was leading a discussion on the possibilities and prospects for analysis of postmerger signals from binary neutron star mergers. as soon as he received news of the detection, he initiated analyses to probe the later, high-frequency stages of the merger using the techniques he spent years developing. 
 clark said the days after august 17 were the most exciting of his career. 
 ""i've dedicated so much of my career to the detection of neutron stars,"" said clark, who has been in ligo for 10 years. ""when i sit back and think about what was observed and the future potential for new science from this event, the hairs on my arms raise. i'm overwhelmed with a similar sense of excitement and wonder that i experience when motorcycling through the scottish mountains in my homeland. it has been amazing.""

 jan 11, 2020 
 - atlanta, ga 
 researchers have devised a straightforward technique for building a laboratory device known as an electroporator - which applies a jolt of electricity to temporarily open cell walls - from inexpensive components, including a piezoelectric crystal taken from a butane lighter. 
 plans for the device, known as the electropen, are being made available, along with the files necessary for creating a 3d-printed casing. 
 ""our goal with the electropen was to make it possible for high schools, budget-conscious laboratories, and even those working in remote locations without access to electricity to perform experiments or processes involving electroporation,"" said 
 m. saad bhamla , an assistant professor in georgia tech's 
 school of chemical and biomolecular engineering . ""this is another example of looking for ways to bypass economic limitations to advance scientific research by putting this capability into the hands of many more scientists and aspiring scientists."" 
 in a study reported january 10 in the journal 
 plos biology 
 and sponsored by the national science foundation and the national institutes of health, the researchers detail the method for constructing the electropen, which is capable of generating short bursts of more than 2,000 volts needed for a wide range of laboratory tasks. 
 one of the primary jobs of a cell membrane is to serve as a protective border, sheltering the inner workings of a living cell from the outside environment. 
 but all it takes is a brief jolt of electricity for that membrane to temporarily open and allow foreign molecules to flow in - a process called electroporation, which has been used for decades in molecular biology labs for tasks ranging from bacterial detection to genetic engineering. 
 despite how commonplace the practice has become, the high cost of electroporators and their reliance on a source of electricity have kept the technique mostly within the confines of academic or professional labs. bhamla and undergraduate student gaurav byagathvalli set out to change that, with help from collaborators soham sinha, yan zhang, assistant professor mark styczynski, and lambert high school teacher janet standeven. 
 ""once we decided to tackle this issue, we began to explore the inner workings of electroporators to understand why they are so bulky and expensive,"" said byagathvalli. ""since their conception in the early 1980s, electroporators have not had significant changes in design, sparking the question of whether we could achieve the same output at a fraction of the cost. when we identified a lighter that could produce these high voltages through piezoelectricity, we were excited to uncover new mysteries behind this common tool."" 
 in addition to the piezoelectric lighter crystal - which generates current when pressure is applied to it - the other parts in the device include copper-plated wire, heat-shrinking wire insulator, and aluminum tape. to hold it all together, the researchers designed a 3d-printed casing that also serves as its activator. with all the parts on hand, the device can be assembled in 15 minutes, the researchers reported. 
 while the electropen is not designed to replace a lab-grade electroporator, which costs thousands of dollars and is capable of processing a broad range of cell mixtures, the device is still highly capable of performing tasks when high volumes are not required. 
 the researchers tested several different lighter crystals to find ones that produced a consistent voltage using a spring-based mechanism. to understand more about how the lighters function, the team used a high-speed camera at 1,057 frames per second to view device mechanics in slow motion. 
 ""one of the fundamental reasons this device works is that the piezoelectric crystal produces a consistently high voltage, independent of the amount of force applied by the user,"" bhamla said. ""our experiments showed that the hammer in these lighters is able to achieve acceleration of 3,000 g's, which explains why it is capable of generating such a high burst of voltage."" 
 to test its capabilities, the researchers used the device on samples of e. coli to add a chemical that makes the bacterial cells fluorescent under special lights, illuminating the cell parts and making them easier to identify. similar techniques could be used in a lab or in remote field operations to detect the presence of bacteria or other cells. 
 the team also evaluated whether the device was easy to use, shipping the assembled electropens to students at other universities and high schools. 
 ""the research teams were able to successfully obtain the same fluorescence expression, which i think validates how easily these devices can be disseminated and adopted by students across the globe,"" bhamla said. 
 to that end, the researchers have made available the plans for how to build the device, along with digital files to be used by a 3d printer to fabricate the casing and actuator. next steps of the research include testing a broader range of lighters looking for consistent voltages across a wider range, with the goal of creating electropens of varying voltages. 
 this research was supported by the national science foundation (nsf) under grant no. 1817334, the mindlin foundation under grant no. mf19-1t1p03, and the national institutes of health (nih) under grant no. r01-eb022592. any opinions, findings, and conclusions or recommendations expressed in this material are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of the sponsoring organizations.

scientists-unearth-20-million-years-hot-spot-magmatism-under-cocos-plate.txt,"scientists unearth 20 million years of ‘hot spot' magmatism under cocos plate 
 a team of scientists led by georgia tech have observed past episodic intraplate magmatism and corroborated the existence of a partial melt channel at the base of the cocos plate. 
 jun 20, 2023 
 ten years ago, 
 samer naif 
 made an unexpected discovery in earth's mantle: a narrow pocket, proposed to be filled with magma, hidden some 60 kilometers beneath the seafloor of the cocos plate. 
 mantle melts are buoyant and typically float toward the surface - think underwater volcanoes that erupt to form strings of islands. but naif's imaging instead showed a clear slice of semi-molten rock: 
 low-degree partial melts , still sandwiched at the base of the plate some 37 miles beneath the ocean floor. 
 then, the observation 
 provided an explanation 
 for how tectonic plates can gradually slide, lubricated by partial melting. the study also ""raised several questions about 
 why 
 magma is stored in a thin channel - and where the magma originated from,"" says naif, an assistant professor in the 
 school of earth and atmospheric sciences 
 at 
 georgia institute of technology . 
 fellow researchers went on to share competing interpretations for the cause of the channel - including studies that argued against magma being needed to explain the observation. 
 so naif went straight to the source. 
 ""i basically went on a multiyear hunt, akin to a sherlock holmes detective story, looking for clues of mantle magmas that we first observed in the 
 2013 
 nature 
 study ,"" he says. ""this involved piecing together evidence from several independent sources, including geophysical, geochemical, and geological (direct seafloor sampling) data."" 
 now, the results of that search are detailed in a new

 ""episodic intraplate magmatism fed by a long-lived melt channel of distal plume origin"" , authored by naif and researchers from the u.s. geological survey at woods hole coastal and marine science center, northern arizona university, lamont-doherty earth observatory of columbia university, the department of geology and geophysics at woods hole oceanographic institution, and gns science of lower hutt, new zealand. 
 zeroing in 
 a relatively young oceanic plate - some 23 million years old - the cocos plate traces down the western coast of central america, veering west to the pacific plate, then north to meet the north american plate off the pacific coast of mexico. 
 sliding between these two plates caused the devastating 1985 mexico city earthquake and the 2017 chiapas earthquake, while similar subduction between the cocos and caribbean plates resulted in the 1992 nicaragua tsunami and earthquake, and the 2001 el salvador earthquakes. 
 scientists study the edges of these oceanic plates to understand the history and formation of volcanic chains - and to help researchers and agencies better prepare for future earthquakes and volcanic activity. 
 it's in this active area that naif and fellow researchers recently set out to document a series of magmatic intrusions just beneath the seafloor, in the same area that the team first detected the channel of magma back in 2013. 
 plumbing the depths 
 for the new study, the team combined geophysical, geochemical, and seafloor drilling results with seismic reflection data, a technique used to image layers of sediments and rocks below the surface. ""it helps us to see the geology where we cannot see it with our own eyes,"" naif explains. 
 first, the researchers observed an abundance of widespread intraplate magmatism. ""volcanism where it is not expected,"" naif says, ""basically away from plate boundaries: subduction zones and mid-ocean ridges."" 
 think hawaii, where ""a mantle plume of hot, rising material melts during its ascent, and then forms the hawaii volcanic chain in the middle of the pacific ocean,"" just as with the cocos plate, where the team imaged the volcanism fed by magma at the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary - the base of the sliding tectonic plates. 
 ""below it is the convecting mantle,"" naif adds. ""the tectonic plates are moving around on earth's surface because they are sliding on the asthenosphere below them."" 
 the researchers also found that this channel below the lithosphere is regionally extensive - over 100,000 square kilometers - and is a ""long-lived feature that originated from the galápagos plume,"" a mantle plume that formed the volcanic galápagos islands, supplying melt for a series of volcanic events across the past 20 million years, and persisting today. 
 importantly, the new study also suggests that these plume-fed melt channels may be widespread and long-lived sources for intraplate magmatism itself - as well as for 
 mantle metasomatism , which happens when earth's mantle reacts with fluids to form a suite of minerals from the original rocks. 
 connecting the (hot spot) dots 
 ""this confirms that magma was there in the past - and some of it leaked through the mantle and erupted near the seafloor,"" naif says, ""in the form of sill intrusions and seamounts: basically volcanoes located on the seafloor."" 
 the work also provides compelling supporting evidence that magma could still be stored in the channel. ""more surprising is that the erupted magma has a chemical fingerprint that links its source to the galápagos mantle plume."" 
 ""we learned that the magma channel has been around for at least 20 million years, and on occasion some of that magma leaks to the seafloor where it erupts volcanically,"" naif adds. 
 the team's identified source of the magma, the galápagos plume, ""is more than 1,000 kilometers away from where we detected this volcanism. it is not clear how magma can stay around in the mantle for such a long time, only to leak out episodically."" 
 plume hunters wanted 
 the evidence that the team compiled is ""really quite subtle and requires a detailed and careful study of a suite of seafloor observations to connect the dots,"" naif says. ""basically, the signs of such volcanism, while they are quite clear here, also require high resolution data and several different types of data to be able to detect such subtle seafloor features."" 
 so, ""if we can see such subtle clues of volcanism here,"" naif explains, ""it means a similar, careful analysis of high resolution data in other parts of the seafloor may lead to similar discoveries of volcanism elsewhere, caused by other mantle plumes."" 
 ""there are numerous mantle plumes dotted across the planet. there are also numerous seamounts - at least 100,000 of them! - covering the seafloor, and it is anyone's guess how many of them formed in the middle of the tectonic plates because of magma sourced from distant mantle plumes that leaked to the surface."" 
 naif looks forward to continuing that search, from seafloor to asthenosphere.

scurrying-roaches-help-researchers-steady-staggering-robots.txt,"scurrying roaches help researchers steady staggering robots 
 researchers have leveraged cockroaches' scurrying skills for a cleverly simple method to assess and improve locomotion in robots. 
 the robot used in this experiment was a minotaur brand machine with legs. georgia tech / neveln 
 aug 22, 2019 
 - atlanta, ga 
 ew, a cockroach! but it zips off before the swatter appears. now, researchers have leveraged the bug's superb scurrying skills to create a cleverly simple method to assess and improve locomotion in robots. 
 normally, tedious modeling of mechanics, electronics, and information science is required to understand how insects' or robots' moving parts coordinate smoothly to take them places. but  in a new study , biomechanics researchers at the georgia institute of technology boiled down the sprints of cockroaches to handy principles and equations they then used to make a test robot amble about better. 
 the method told the researchers about how each leg operates on its own, how they all come together as a whole, and the harmony or lack thereof in how they do it. despite bugs' and bots' utterly divergent motion dynamics, the new method worked for both and should work for other robots and animals, too. 
 the biological robot, the roach, was the far superior runner with neurological signals guiding six impeccably evolved legs. the mechanical robot, a consumer model, had four stubby legs and no nervous system but relied instead for locomotion control on coarse physical forces traveling through its chassis as crude signals to roughly coordinate its clunky gait. 
 ""the robot was much bulkier and could hardly sense its environment. the cockroach had many senses and can adapt better to rough terrain. bumps as high as its hips wouldn't slow it down at all,"" said  izaak neveln , the study's first author, who was a postdoctoral researcher in the  lab of simon sponberg at georgia tech during the study. 
 advanced simplicity 
 the method, or ""measure,"" as the study calls it, transcended these huge differences, which pervade animal-inspired robotics. 
 ""the measure is general (universal) in the sense that it can be used regardless of whether the signals are neural spiking patterns,  kinematics , voltages or forces and does not depend on the particular relationship between the signals,"" the study's authors wrote. 
 no matter how a bug or a bot functions, the measure's mathematical inputs and outputs are always in the same units. the measure will not always eliminate the need for modeling, but it stands to shorten and guide modeling and avert anguishing missteps. 
 the authors  published the study in the journal  nature communications  in august 2019. the research was funded by the national science foundation.  sponberg is an assistant professor  in georgia tech's school of physics and in the school of biological sciences. 
 centralization vs. decentralization 
 often a bot or an animal sends many walking signals through a central system to harmonize locomotion, but not all signals are centralized. even in humans, though locomotion strongly depends on signals from the central nervous system, some neural signals are confined to regions of the body; they are localized signals. 
 some insects appear to move with little centralization -- such as stick bugs, also known as walking sticks, whose legs prod about nearly independently. stick bugs are  wonky runners . 
 ""the idea has been that the stick bugs have the more localized control of motion, whereas a  cockroach goes very fast  and needs to maintain stability, and its motion control is probably more centralized, more clocklike,"" neveln said. 
 strong centralization of signals generally coordinates locomotion better. centralized signals could be code traveling through an elaborate robot's wiring, a cockroach's central neurons synching its legs, or the clunky robot's chassis tilting away from a leg thumping the ground thus putting weight onto an opposing leg. 
 roboticists need to see through the differences and figure out the interplay of a locomotor's local and central signals. 
 [ready for graduate school?  here's how to apply to georgia tech. ] 
 cool physics 
 the new ""measure"" does this by focusing on an overarching phenomenon in the walking legs, which  can be seen as pendula  moving back and forth. for great locomotion, they need to synch up in what is called phase-coupling oscillations. 
 a fun, easy experiment illustrates this physics principle. if a few, say six, metronomes - ticking rhythm pendula that piano teachers use -- are swinging out of sync, and you place them all on a platform that freely sways along with the metronomes' swings,  the swings will sync up in unison . 
 the  phases, or directions, of their oscillations  are coupling with each other by centralizing their composite mechanical impulses through the platform. this particular example of phase-coupling is mechanical, but it can also be computational or neurological -- like in the roach. 
 its legs would be analogous to the swinging metronomes, and central neuromuscular activity analogous to the free-swaying platform. in the roach, not all six legs swing in the same direction. 
 ""their synchronization is not uniform. three legs are synchronized in phase with each other -- the front and back legs of one side with the middle leg of the other side -- and those three are synchronized out of phase with the other three,"" neveln said. ""it's an alternating tripod gait. one tripod of three legs alternates with the other tripod of three legs."" 
 useless pogoing 
 and just like pendula, each leg's swings can be graphed as a wave. all the legs' waves can be averaged into an overall roach scurry wave and then developed into more useful math that relates centralization with decentralization and factors like  entropy  that can throw locomotion control off. 
 the resulting principles and math benefited the clunky robot, which has strong decentralized signals in its leg motors that react to leg contact with the ground, and centralized control weaker than that of the stick bug. the researchers graphed out the robot's movements, too, but they didn't result in the neatly synced group of waves that the cockroach had produced. 
 the researchers turned with the principles and math to the clunky robot, which initially was out of sorts -- bucking or hopping uselessly like a pogo stick. then the scientists strengthened centralized control by re-weighting its chassis to make it move more coherently. 
 ""the metronomes on the platform are mechanical coupling, and our robot coordinates control that way,"" neveln said. ""you can change the mechanical coupling of the robot by repositioning its weights. we were able to predict the changes this would make by using the measure we developed from the cockroach."" 
 cockroach surprises 
 the researchers also wired up specific roach muscles and neurons to observe their syncopations with the scurry waves. seventeen cockroaches took 2,982 strides to inform the principles and math, and the bugs also sprung surprises on the researchers. 
 one stuck out: the scientists had thought signaling centralized more when the roach sped up, but instead, both central and local signaling strengthened, perhaps doubling down on the message: run!

seafloor-space-new-bacterial-proteins-shine-light-climate-and-astrobiology.txt,"from seafloor to space: new bacterial proteins shine light on climate and astrobiology 
 georgia tech researchers have uncovered eco-friendly bacterial proteins that stabilize methane clathrates, offering a green solution to climate challenges and potential implications for astrobiology. 
 sep 26, 2023 
 gigatons of greenhouse gas are trapped under the seafloor, and that's a good thing. around the coasts of the continents, where slopes sink down into the sea, tiny cages of ice trap methane gas, preventing it from escaping and bubbling up into the atmosphere. 
 while rarely in the news, these ice cage formations, known as methane clathrates, have garnered attention because of their potential to affect climate change. during offshore drilling, methane ice can get stuck in pipes, causing them to freeze and burst. the 2010 deepwater horizon oil spill is thought to have been caused by a buildup of methane clathrates. 
 but until now, the biological process behind how methane gas remains stable under the sea has been almost completely unknown. in a breakthrough study, a cross-disciplinary team of georgia tech researchers discovered a previously unknown class of bacterial proteins that play a crucial role in the formation and stability of methane clathrates. 
 a team led by 
 jennifer glass , associate professor in the 
 school of earth and atmospheric sciences , and 
 raquel lieberman , professor and sepcic-pfeil chair in the 
 school of chemistry and biochemistry , showed that these novel bacterial proteins suppress the growth of methane clathrates as effectively as commercial chemicals currently used in drilling, but are non-toxic, eco-friendly, and scalable. their study, funded by nasa, informs the search for life in the solar system, and could also increase the safety of transporting natural gas. 
 the research, 
 published in the journal 
 pnas nexus , underscores the importance of fundamental science in studying earth's natural biological systems and highlights the benefits of collaboration across disciplines. 
 ""we wanted to understand how these formations were staying stable under the seafloor, and precisely what mechanisms were contributing to their stability,"" glass said. ""this is something no one has done before."" 
 sifting through sediment 
 the effort started with the team examining a sample of clay-like sediment that glass acquired from the seafloor off the coast of oregon. 
 glass hypothesized that the sediment would contain proteins that influence the growth of methane clathrate, and that those proteins would resemble well-known antifreeze proteins in fish, which help them survive in cold environments. 
 but to confirm her hypothesis, glass and her research team would first have to identify protein candidates out of millions of potential targets contained in the sediment. they would then need to make the proteins in the lab, though there was no understanding of how these proteins might behave. also, no one had worked with these proteins before. 
 glass approached lieberman, whose lab studies the structure of proteins. the first step was to use dna sequencing paired with bioinformatics to identify the genes of the proteins contained in the sediment. 
 dustin huard , a researcher in lieberman's lab and first author of the paper, then prepared candidate proteins that could potentially bind to the methane clathrates. huard used x-ray crystallography to determine the structure of the proteins. 
 creating seafloor conditions in the lab 
 huard passed off the protein candidates to 
 abigail johnson , a former ph.d. student in glass' lab and co-first author on the paper, who is now a postdoctoral researcher at the university of georgia. to test the proteins, johnson formed methane clathrates herself by recreating the high pressure and low temperature of the seafloor in the lab. johnson worked with 
 sheng dai , an associate professor in the 
 school of civil and environmental engineering , to build a unique pressure chamber from scratch. 
 johnson placed the proteins in the pressure vessel and adjusted the system to mimic the pressure and temperature conditions required for clathrate formation. by pressurizing the vessel with methane, johnson forced methane into the droplet, which caused a methane clathrate structure to form. 
 she then measured the amount of gas that was consumed by the clathrate - an indicator of how quickly and how much clathrate formed - and did so in the presence of the proteins versus no proteins. johnson found that with the clathrate-binding proteins, less gas was consumed, and the clathrates melted at higher temperatures. 
 once the team validated that the proteins affect the formation and stability of methane clathrates, they used huard's protein crystal structure to carry out molecular dynamics simulations with the help of 
 james (jc) gumbart , professor in the 
 school of physics . the simulations allowed the team to identify the specific site where the protein binds to the methane clathrate. 
 a surprisingly novel system 
 the study unveiled unexpected insights into the structure and function of the proteins. the researchers initially thought the part of the protein that was similar to fish antifreeze proteins would play a role in clathrate binding. surprisingly, that part of the protein did not play a role, and a wholly different mechanism directed the interactions. 
 they found that the proteins do not bind to ice, but rather interact with the clathrate structure itself, directing its growth. specifically, the part of the protein that had similar characteristics to antifreeze proteins was buried in the protein structure, and instead played a role in stabilizing the protein. 
 the researchers found that the proteins performed better at modifying methane clathrate than any of the antifreeze proteins that had been tested in the past. they also performed just as well as, if not better than, the toxic commercial clathrate inhibitors currently used in drilling that pose serious environmental threats. 
 preventing clathrate formation in natural gas pipelines is a billion-dollar industry. if these biodegradable proteins could be used to prevent disastrous natural gas leaks, it would greatly reduce the risk of environmental damage. 
 ""we were so lucky that this actually worked, because even though we chose these proteins based on their similarity to antifreeze proteins, they are completely different,"" johnson said. ""they have a similar function in nature, but do so through a completely different biological system, and i think that really excites people."" 
 methane clathrates likely exist throughout the solar system - on the subsurface of mars, for example, and on icy moons in the outer solar system, such as europa. the team's findings indicate that if microbes exist on other planetary bodies, they might produce similar biomolecules to retain liquid water in channels in the clathrate that could sustain life. 
 ""we're still learning so much about the basic systems on our planet,"" huard said. ""that's one of the great things about georgia tech - different communities can come together to do really cool, unexpected science. i never thought i would be working on an astrobiology project, but here we are, and we've been very successful.""

 georgia tech is looking for a new leader to champion arts and education. 
 oct 05, 2023 
 georgia tech is looking for a new leader to champion arts education and research. 
 provost steve mclaughlin has convened a search committee charged with selecting the inaugural assistant vice provost for the arts (avp-a). this new position will help advance tech's strategic goal of more deeply integrating the arts into education and research. 
 this position is open to current full-time tenure-track and nontenure- track faculty at georgia tech. leslie sharp, dean of libraries, will serve as chair of the search committee. 
 reporting to senior vice provost for education and learning laurence jacobs, the position will sit at the intersection of art and technology, offering students and faculty a new opportunity to innovate. 
 ""this new role is so exciting because it will help georgia tech develop new and reimagined curricular experiences that nurture different ways of thinking, understanding, and problem-solving,"" said jacobs. ""weaving arts and stem disciplines together creates a more comprehensive and interdisciplinary learning environment, which benefits our students and society as a whole."" 
 emphasizing the curricular components of the arts could ultimately create academic majors, minors, or certificates that would distinguish georgia tech students from competitive institutions, jacobs added. he also noted that students with such qualifications are well placed to make a sizable impact on the state's already exploding arts and production scene. 
 according to the georgia council for the arts, the creative industries generate a $62.5 billion economic impact in georgia. that includes 200,000 employees who earn a combined salary of $12.1 billion. georgia tech wants to position itself as an arts-in-technology trailblazer that could fuel an even more significant economic boon for the state. 
 among other responsibilities, the avp-a will: 
 liaise with college deans, school chairs, and leadership as well as faculty (e.g., tenure-track, lecturers, research and academic professionals, librarians, and archivists) to design and lead the implementation of innovative programs that develop and incorporate the arts. 
 contribute to the institute's arts@tech and arts square strategic planning initiative. 
 facilitate student engagement in arts-based curricular and cocurricular learning experiences, encouraging creative expression and critical thinking across disciplines. 
 collaborate with the associate vice president for arts, belonging, and community in the division of student engagement and well-being to ensure alignment between curricular and cocurricular efforts and to integrate performing, visual, and all other forms of art into learning, service, and scholarship. 
 candidates should log in to oneusg connect ( https: / / oneusgconnect.usg.edu ), click the recruiting self-service tile, click the apply for jobs tile, and search for job id 264210. candidates should submit a cv, cover letter, and list of three professional references by nov. 1.

search-goldilocks-black-holes.txt,"in search of the goldilocks of black holes 
 analysis of gravitational waves data by hundreds of scientists so far reveals no collisions from mid-sized black holes. 
 may 22, 2017 
 - atlanta 
 black holes can be divided into three classes according to mass. on the low end are those with masses 10 times that of the sun. examples are the two black holes whose merger generated the 
 first gravitational wave to be detected , by 
 the ligo scientific collaboration 
 (lsc), an international team including researchers in the school of physics' 
 center for relativistic astrophysics 
 (cra). ligo stands for laser interferometer gravitational-wave observatory, a facility based in the u.s. 
 on the high end are black holes that are a million times as massive as the sun. 
 evidence for them comes from nasa images . 
 for the goldilocks black holes, with masses in between, no hard proof exists to date. 
 indirect evidence 
 has been offered, but nothing unambiguous so far. a single detection can transform our understanding of the first stars in the universe. 
 as it happens, ligo has been designed to detect gravitational waves arising from collisions of midsize black holes. a 
 recent study 
 suggests that the goldilocks of black holes may be uncommon. analysis of ligo data collected from september 2015 through january 2016 found no evidence for midsize black holes. however, the work enables scientists to estimate more accurately than ever before the abundance of such black holes. 
 the paper reports a ""survey of the universe for midsize-black-hole collisions up to 5 billion light years ago,"" says 
 karan jani , a former georgia tech ph.d. physics student who participated in the study. that volume of space contains about 100 million galaxies the size of the milky way. nowhere in that space did the study find a collision of midsize black holes. 
 ""clearly they are much, much rarer than low-mass black holes, three collisions of which ligo has detected so far,"" jani says. nevertheless, should a gravitational wave from two goldilocks black holes colliding ever gets detected, jani adds, ""we have all the tools to dissect the signal."" 
 the study was undertaken by hundreds of scientists worldwide belonging to lsc and 
 the virgo collaboration , another international team observing gravitational waves from a facility in italy. georgia tech scientists worked on 
 the paper 
 in close collaboration with colleagues from the 
 albert einstein institute hannover , in germany; hillsdale college; kenyon college;  massachusetts institute of technology; pennsylvania state university; 
 radboud university , in the netherlands; 
 université paris diderot , in france; and the 
 university of birmingham , in england. 
 jani received a 
 ph.d. in spring 2017 . he worked with cra director 
 deirdre shoemaker , 
 lsc deputy spokesperson laura cadonati , and cra colleagues 
 juan calderon bustillo , 
 james clark , 
 claudia lazzaro , and 
 pablo laguna . all of them participated in the first detection of a gravitational wave, on sept. 14, 2015.

search-life-solar-system.txt,"the search for life in the solar system 
 scientists are getting ready to take giant leaps in their search for life in our solar system. 
 nasa's james green with college of sciences dean paul goldbart (febuary 20, 2017). 
 feb 22, 2017 
 - atlanta, ga 
 scientists are getting ready to take giant leaps in their search for life in our solar system, and georgia tech researchers are playing key roles in that momentous journey. 
 an important stop on that celestial express is jupiter's frigid moon europa. institute researchers contributed to a nasa-commissioned study that just proposed a way to land there and examine surface samples. it would mark the first such serious attempt to look for life in the solar system since the mars viking probes of the mid-1970s. 
 that's according to 
 james green , director of nasa's planetary sciences division. green wowed a standing-room-only crowd on monday with a guided tour of europa, mars, the dwarf planet and former asteroid ceres, and other celestial bodies that might contain the basic recipes for life. 
 ""we're finding new and exciting places where life might exist,"" green told the audience. ""searching for life is going to take all our efforts - from biology to chemistry to planetary science and everything in between. and i'm proud to say that georgia tech is doing fabulously in this area, and i hope it continues."" 
 that georgia tech-nasa connection has yielded findings like the much-heralded 
 2015 discovery of flowing water on mars . the most recent example, however, is the feb. 8 release of a 
 nasa-commissioned science definition team study  co-authored by 
 britney schmidt , a planetary scientist in the school of earth and atmospheric sciences. 
 schmidt, who spends time in antarctica studying how organisms survive in frozen or near-freezing worlds, is part of a team proposing a 2021 mission to europa. a lander would set down on the moon's icy crust and take samples from above and below the surface that might bear proof of current or past organic activity. 
 ""if you get past the surface, europa looks a lot like earth,"" schmidt said. ""it's water, it's interacting with rock, it has a lot of the same chemistry, a lot of the same temperatures. we're very biased because we stand on rocks, but if you go to the antarctic where we work, some things there would not be surprised or not be sad if they were living on europa."" 
 the study includes descriptions of the instrumentation that would be needed not only to find proof of life on europa, but also to determine whether the moon was ever habitable. 
 ""we should be examining places in the solar system that give us the best opportunity to understand what the limits of life really are,"" schmidt said. ""right now the only limits seem to be our own imagination."" 
 images and descriptions from green - all courtesy of the latest findings from deep-space probes, planetary rovers, and orbiting telescopes - fired the audience's imagination. green's solar system tour included the sulfuric acid rain and crushing atmospheric pressures of venus; a rover-lowering ""skycrane"" in the 
 mars 2020 
 mission, like the one used to put the curiosity rover on the planet; the soaring geysers on saturn's moon enceladus, which form ""a wall of water"" on the icy surface; and the vast methane oceans of another saturn moon, titan. ""if there's any type of life that's very different from our own,"" green said, ""it's got to be on titan.""  green's slide showed titan accompanied by a photo of 
 star trek's 
 mr. spock and the meme, ""it's life, jim, but not as we know it."" 
 nasa's latest data, extensively analyzed by government and academic researchers, is giving the agency some new paths to consider as it plots the next phase of unmanned missions to search for life. 
 ""in these last 10 years in particular, what we've decided to go after is really to follow the water,"" green said. ""the water in our solar system has to be an underlying basis for where we might go and look for life. if a body has water today or in its past, perhaps it had life in its past or maybe even today."" 
 another key ingredient in the recipe for life - energy - doesn't have to involve only proximity to the sun. it can be generated internally by a planet's core or, in the case of europa, externally by jupiter's tidal forces, which are constantly squeezing the moon. ""the surface may rise or fall by 30 meters,"" green said. ""that heat has got to go somewhere. it melted this ice and created and maintains what we believe is a global ocean."" 
 green said the search for life also includes exoplanets, planets that orbit suns in other solar systems outside of our own. much of the current information about exoplanets comes from the 
 kepler space telescope , launched in 2009. some of those exoplanets may be in habitable zones of distant solar systems. 
 but as nasa announced this week, the 
 spitzer space telescope  has revealed the existence of seven earth-size exoplanets orbiting a single star in the constellation andromeda, about 40 light years (235 trillion miles) from earth. 
 that finding was published today in the journal 
 nature . all seven exoplanets may have liquid water, and three may lie within their star's habitable zone. 
 planetary exploration and the search for life must involve an interdisciplinary scientific approach, college of sciences dean paul m. goldbart said. ""none of this could be done without the input of geochemists, geobiologists, and geophysicists; everyone working together, and everyone knowledgeable about what everyone is doing. it's this confluence of expertise that makes the whole thing fly."" 
 as for looking beyond the solar system, ""we're eager to invest in that space between astrophysics, planetary science, and the early-life research,"" goldbart said. ""one or two additional team members would cement the from-the-planets-to-the-cosmos community here at georgia tech.""

sei-launches-new-energy-policy-innovation-center.txt,"sei launches new energy policy innovation center 
 strategic energy institute to develop regional energy and policy center. 
 the new center will explore intersection of energy policy and technology innovation in the southeast. 
 oct 25, 2016 
 - atlanta, ga 
 georgia institute of technology today announced the creation of a new, major regional energy center. the center will operate out of georgia tech's strategic energy institute (sei) and provide an unbiased and interdisciplinary framework for informing energy policy and systems analysis for the southeast region. 
 while located at georgia tech, the center will tap into regional expertise within academia, think tanks, businesses, non-governmental organizations (ngo), and research facilities.  conferences, workshops and symposiums will also be held at the center, which will serve as a neutral facilitator of a range of interdisciplinary academic, business and nongovernmental stakeholders to discuss relevant, important energy issues. 
 ""our region depends on us to help address our unique energy challenges,"" said georgia tech president g. p. ""bud"" peterson.  ""i can think of no better way to explore solutions to these challenges than to bring together the best minds and resources in the region. we look forward to working with experts in regional utilities, academics, industry, national labs and the department of energy to deliver pragmatic solutions with maximum impact in the southeast."" 
 according to "" rising to the challenge"" , a report produced by the national research council, federally-funded research and development has not been connected to state and regional industrial development. bridging that gap can create the local talent and technology base needed to convert these u. s. investments into domestic companies, industries, and jobs. the report also documented that private businesses and local education institutions are among those organizations in the best positions to identify opportunities, gauge competitive strengths, and mobilize wide community support for regional cluster initiatives. 
 there is growing recognition that solutions to global energy challenges must be tackled at a regional level.  u.s. energy secretary ernest moniz spoke in support of just such an approach during a recent meeting hosted by the pew charitable trusts. ""different parts of the country have different resources, challenges, and capabilities, and having a component managed at the regional level, we think, can best address those,"" moniz said. 
 the southeast region has a diverse energy mix, with natural gas power generation growing at about double the national rate, is home to the only new nuclear plants in the country, and is a leader in deploying utility scale solar.  it is also a global leader in industrial big data, hosting the largest global concentration of corporate facilities that are aggregating, analyzing, and remotely controlling major energy infrastructure. 
 ""the center will focus around these distinctives and engage a variety of regional stakeholders, to produce rigorous, fact-based policy studies and analyses that will address southeastern perspectives on global, national and regional energy issues"", said sei executive director, tim lieuwen. 
 the goal is to broaden views and approaches for energy innovation, for example, by including policy, economic, even social considerations along with conventional technological factors. as such, this venture is the first known implementation of a regional partnership to focus on the interdependencies of energy policy and technology toward the pragmatic realization of clean, reliable, affordable energy solutions.

 researchers have developed a new technique for identifying promotional infections of websites operated by government and educational organizations.

 by detecting semantic inconsistencies in content, researchers have developed a new technique for identifying promotional infections of websites operated by government and educational organizations. such attacks use code embedded in highly-ranked sites to drive traffic to sketchy websites selling fake drugs, counterfeit handbags and plagiarized term papers - or installing drive-by malware. the new technique, known as semantic inconsistency search (seise), uses natural language processing to spot the differences between a compromised site's expected content and the malicious advertising and promotional code. using seise, the researchers found 11,000 infected sites among non-commercial top-level sponsored .edu, .gov and .mil domains worldwide, and are working to extend the method to other domains. the research was supported by the u.s. national science foundation and natural science foundation of china. it will be described in a presentation may 25, 2016 at the ieee symposium on security and privacy in san jose. seise was developed by researchers from the georgia institute of technology, indiana university and tsinghua university in china. ""the basic idea behind promotional infection is to attack websites that are highly-ranked and to leverage their importance to promote various things, most of them illegal,"" explained 
 raheem beyah , who is the motorola foundation professor in georgia tech's 
 school of electrical and computer engineering . ""the bad content is nested into the prominent site to leverage the traffic of that domain. that gives the attackers a doorway to whatever they are promoting."" essentially, said beyah, the attackers are stealing the site's good name, even if they don't install malware or otherwise inflict harm on web visitors. ""the attackers essentially become part of the prominent website's brand and share in the ranking they have,"" he added. ""it's like setting up operations inside a well-known coffee shop chain. the attacker leverages the brand by becoming co-located with it."" the promotional attacks can be difficult to detect, especially if they don't contain malicious computer code. but the semantic differences between the host site and the attacker's code can tip off the seise algorithm. once it has characterized the content expected on a website - educational information on an .edu page, for example - the pitches for gambling or inexpensive prescription drugs become obvious. ""if you are visiting the website for a prestigious university, you don't expect to see information promoting casino gambling,"" said beyah. ""if we expect one thing from the website and see something significantly different, there is a huge semantic gap that we can detect."" seise doesn't have to review an entire site to determine what should be there; it can sample the pages to learn context that makes attacker terms stand out. because their domain purposes are clear and well established, the researchers began with education and government websites. they now hope to extend the automated approach to commercial and other domains whose intended purposes may be less consistent. ""we are trying to figure out how to get the context right for these domains so we can help companies detect these infections,"" beyah said. ""there's no reason to believe that the commercial domains are any less attractive to attackers than the non-commercial ones."" beyah and georgia tech ph.d. student xiaojing liao began the work by using google searches to find sites with known ""bad words"" denoting illicit products. they then utilized natural language processing to find terms associated with these known bad words, which were then used to train the seise before it was sent out to analyze 100,000 domains for the presence of the illicit terms. the approach identified 11,000 infected sites with a false detection rate of just 1.5 percent and coverage of more than 90 percent. seise found promotional infections on the websites of top u.s. universities and government agencies, though the problem was truly worldwide, with three percent of .edu and .gov sites infected. of the infected websites noted, 15 percent were in china and six percent were in the united states. sites are infected using proven attack techniques such as sql injection, url redirection and phishing to compromise the credentials of users, beyah said. though central websites of the organizations may be secure, pages of individual users and units may be more vulnerable - and still provide the prestige of the overall domain. existing techniques for detecting promotional infections rely on examining redirects and following links, or observing how sites change over time. but those techniques aren't scalable and can't be automated in the same way as the new semantic gap approach, beyah said. the researchers want to share their technique with the larger security community, and are discussing how best to make the algorithm available. ""our study shows that by effective detection of infected sponsored top-level domains (stlds), the bar to promotion infections can be substantially raised,"" the authors wrote in their paper. about those 11,000 compromised webpages? the researchers are attempting to contact the operators of all 11,000 of them to share the bad news. ""we have spent a lot of time contacting those folks and letting them know what we have found,"" beyah said. ""we're still in the process of doing that because there are so many."" this work was supported by the national science foundation through grants cns-1223477, cns-1223495 and cns-1527141 and by the natural science foundation of china through grant 61472215. any opinions, findings, and conclusions or recommendations expressed in this material are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of the sponsors. research news georgia institute of technology 177 north avenue atlanta, georgia 30332-0181 usa media relations contact s: john toon ( jtoon@gatech.edu ) (404-894-6986) or ben brumfield ( ben.brumfield@comm.gatech.edu ) (404-385-1933). writer : john toon

 ""hairy"" nanoparticles made with light-sensitive materials that assemble themselves could one day become ""nano-carriers"" providing doctors a new way to simultaneously introduce both therapeutic drugs and cancer-fighting heat into tumors. that's one potential application for a new technology that combines water-repelling yet light-sensitive and water-absorbing materials into polymeric nano-reactors for creating photo-responsive gold nanoparticles. 
 light of specific wavelengths causes the nanoparticles to assemble and disassemble on demand, allowing the dynamic organization of the nanoparticles for smart in vitro drug release. by including chemotherapy molecules in the nanoparticle structures when they are assembled, the molecules could be drawn into tumors - and then released with the application of a light at a shorter wavelength that triggers disassembly through photo-cleavage. 
 in addition to such a dynamic self-assembly and disassembly, the encapsulation and release of chemotherapy molecules could also be achieved by reversible covalent bonding of anticancer drugs to the polymeric ""hairs"" situated on the surface of nanoparticles. and by absorbing the same light that triggers the drug release, the gold nanoparticles could also heat the cancer cells, providing a double punch. 
 in a broad range of other applications, the nanoparticle self-assembly process could also be triggered by environmental factors including temperature, ph or solvent polarity by rationally designing the polymeric hairs. in this study, gold nanoparticles were used, but the process could also make self-assembled nanoparticles from a variety of metals and metal oxides. by tailoring the surface of nanoparticles with water-absorbing polymers containing near-infrared responsive components, the drug release could be performed 
 in vivo . 
 the spherical gold nanoparticles can be replaced with more complex shaped nanomaterials - such as hollow nanoparticles, nanorods, or nanotubes - to render a better absorption of near-infrared light to penetrate biological tissues. no testing of these nanoparticles has been done so far in living cells or organisms. 
 the research was supported by the air force office of scientific research and the national science foundation, and was reported january 31 in the early edition of the journal 
 proceedings of the national academy of sciences . materials scientists from the georgia institute of technology and south china university of technology co-authored the paper. 
 ""we envision that these photo-responsive polymer-capped gold nanoparticles could one day serve as nano-carriers for drug delivery into the body using our robust and reversible process for assembly and disassembly,"" said 
 zhiqun lin , a professor in the georgia tech 
 school of materials science and engineering . ""used in cancer therapy, this process could increase the impact of a treatment by heating the cancer cells while introducing the drug compound into the tumor."" 
 under light, the assemblies of photo-sensitive nanoparticles separate over a period of hours at a rate that can be controlled by the intensity and wavelength of the light. ""because the disassembly can be turned on and off at will, we could provide a timed release of the drug by controlling the short-wavelength light exposure,"" lin added. 
 the hairy nanoparticles are fabricated around a tiny core of beta-cyclodextrin from which polymer chains of poly(acrylicacid)-block-poly(7-methylacryloyloxy-4-methylcoumarin) (paa-b-pmamc) are grown. that material attracts water-soluble metal precursors, which use the space within the polymer hairs as nano-reactors to form gold nanoparticles. 
 to these inner structures - which are hydrophilic paa polymers - the researchers add hairs made from the hydrophobic monomer mamc. these materials are sensitive to light, and cause the nanoparticles to self-assemble through a photo-dimerization process - crosslinking - when subjected to light at a wavelength of 365 nanometers. 
 the assembly process can be reliably reversed on demand using a shorter wavelength at 254 nanometers. 
 ""once the polymer chains from adjacent gold nanoparticles begin to photo-crosslink, they bring nanoparticles together via a self-assembly process to generate large assemblies of nanoparticles,"" said lin. ""this process is completely reversible and can be repeated in many cycles."" 
 the research team incorporated dye molecules into the self-assembled nanoparticles to simulate what might be done to incorporate and then release chemotherapy agents. a magnetic oxide material incorporated into the nanoparticles could allow the assemblies to be directed to a tumor site by an external magnet, and could also support diagnostic imaging. 
 beyond the activity of the drugs, the plasmonic effects of the gold nanoparticles could heat the nanoparticles when they are subjected to light, attacking the cancer cells through a second route. 
 in addition to the potential medical uses, the self-assembly technique could have applications in optics, optoelectronics, magnetic technologies, sensing materials and devices, catalysis and nanotechnology. the technique could also lead to new basic research in crystallization kinetics, using the self-assembly process to create ""artificial crystals"" held together by polymer chains. 
 lin's lab has worked on the amphiphilic star-shaped block polymers for several years, adding new features and exploring new capabilities for the nanoparticle systems. 
 ""our work provides a design strategy that allows the manipulation of both the outer block and the inner block of a star-shaped block co-polymer,"" he said. ""our fundamental contribution in this work is to judiciously prepare a star-shaped block co-polymer in which the inner block has the capability to coordinate with metal precursors while the outer block allows photo-responsive materials to interact, which in turn renders the crafting of photo-responsive gold nanoparticles for light-enabled reversible and reliable self-assembly."" 
 the research team included yihuang chen, associated with both georgia tech and the south china university of technology; zewei wang, yanjie he, young jun yoon, and jaehan jung, associated with georgia tech, and guangzhao zhang from south china university of technology.

 georgia tech campus services has announced a strategic move from contracted dining to a self-operated solution. 
 jan 12, 2021 
 - atlanta, ga 
 georgia tech campus services has announced a strategic move from contracted dining to a self-operated solution. the new dining operation, called tech dining, will begin july 1, 2021. the decision to move from outsourced dining to an in-house operation directly aligns with georgia tech's new strategic plan, prioritizing the student experience while striving for dining excellence. current dining operations will transition over the summer, with new meal plans and operational improvements in place at the beginning of the fall 2021 semester. the new tech dining operation plans to focus on enhanced residential and retail dining offerings, relying on student feedback to continually improve the program. 
 this strategic decision allows georgia tech to refocus its priorities and further define its vision for on-campus dining where our dining environments offer cuisine, atmosphere and service that enhances and supports our commitment to student engagement and well-being. to align the program with campus stakeholder demand, students, faculty, and staff are being asked to participate in a  short survey  that will be used to plan the future of tech dining and name many of its new dining locations. please take ten minutes to complete  this survey  before sunday, jan. 24. 
 over the next year, tech dining will prioritize healthier foods, more diversified offerings, sustainability initiatives, and high-quality ingredients to increase campus satisfaction and meal plan demand. beginning in fall 2021, meal plans will move to all-you-care-to-eat in all three traditional dining halls, including west village, while avoiding a price increase for the first time in decades. dining will also look to partner with local restaurants to bring popular cuisines to the heart of the georgia tech campus. 
 current dining employees will have an opportunity to continue working at georgia tech, and additional information will be available soon. more information about tech dining and its proposed improvements will be communicated over the coming months. for immediate questions, please contact  ryan.greene@gatech.edu .

semiconductor-company-falcomm-raises-4m-seed-funding-advance-ultra-efficient-power.txt,"semiconductor company falcomm raises $4m in seed funding to advance ultra-efficient power amplifiers, hires industry leaders 
 seed round includes four investor partners 
 edgar garay is ceo and founder of falcomm. 
 nov 29, 2023 
 squadra ventures 
 led the round with participation from cambium capital, draper cygnus, and the georgia tech foundation. 
 falcomm is built on breakthroughs made over six years in the lab of founder and ceo edgar garay to revolutionize the power amplifier, a semiconductor found in devices from satellites to iot to cellphones, that conditions and blasts the 1s and 0s from software through an antenna. falcomm's dual-drive pa combines ultra-efficient performance with an architecture that lends itself to production at scale. 
 ""power amplifiers are the workhorse of the modern electronic era, but improvement to this technology hasn't kept pace with the rise of the innovation economy,"" said garay, who holds a doctorate in electrical engineering from georgia tech's 
 school of electrical and computer engineering , where he conducted the research that led to the formation of his startup. 
 ""falcomm's ultra-efficient, silicon-proven technology will bring advances in power and efficiency to the semiconductor industry that help communications manufacturers to realize massive efficiency gains, while lowering costs. with urgent challenges in the environment and supply chain, we can't wait another 90 years for change."" 
 with simultaneous transmission at each terminal of a transistor, the dual-drive pa delivers performance that is 1.8 times more efficient at 2 times higher power, with half of the silicon area requirements of traditional power amplifiers. for manufacturers, these gains will reduce thermal management and energy costs, while easing overall system requirements. 
 a patented architectural design allows the product to be manufactured in high volume by semiconductor foundries in the united states. with fabless technology, the company is poised to grow a network of industry partners that catalyzes expansion in the $23 billion power amplifier market. 
 born in venezuela, garay developed a passion for using science and engineering to solve problems while repairing machinery on a farm in his hometown. while pursuing doctoral studies at georgia tech, he recognized the opportunity to bring innovation to the power amplifier, which had not changed in decades despite the rapid advance of technology and its critical role in devices. 
 garay's research resulted in multiple patents, spurring him to spin out the technology and create falcomm through assistance from georgia tech resources, including  venturelab   and  create-x . falcomm is the first company to receive investment from the georgia tech foundation. 
 ""georgia tech is proud to support our academic innovators to help them ensure their inventions have real-world impact,"" said raghupathy sivakumar, georgia tech's vice president of commercialization and chief commercialization officer. ""the office of commercialization is rapidly expanding our programs and initiatives to build out the largest and most robust entrepreneurial ecosystem at any public university. i am happy to say that falcomm is the recipient of the first equity investment out of our new research impact fund targeted specifically at 
 spinouts based on georgia tech  intellectual property."" 
 the falcomm team was recently bolstered by the addition of pioneering industry leaders who have demonstrated a track record of innovation in telecommunications, wireless, and semiconductors: 
 thomas cameron, ph.d., chief strategy officer,   is a 35-year veteran of technology research and development in the wireless industry. during a 12-year stint at analog devices, cameron served as chief technology officer of the communications business unit and was a leading evangelist for the adoption of 5g connectivity. he held leadership and engineering roles in the rf industry at bell northern research, nortel, sirenza microdevices, and wj communications. cameron has seven patents in wireless technology and has authored numerous papers and technical articles. 
 ned cahoon, director of foundry and customer relationships,   brings more than 20 years of rf business development experience across the mobile and wireless infrastructure industries. he helped to stand up ibm's $1 billion rf business before joining globalfoundries in 2016, where he served as a fellow in the office of the chief technology officer. a senior design and go-to-market leader, cahoon brings experience building networks across foundries, academia, and technology companies. 
 for falcomm, the funding follows quickly on the heels of the company's selection to the techcrunch startup battlefield 200 in 2023. the company is a graduate of the  berkeley skydeck accelerator   and the  evonexus incubator . 
 bringing innovation to the tiny power amplifier can have a massive impact on some of the nation's most pressing challenges. the energy efficiency gains resulting from an increase in power output come at a time of growing urgency around climate change. the ability to manufacture domestically comes at a time when nearshoring is a priority to address cost and supply chain challenges underscored by the global semiconductor shortage and resulting chips act. 
 ""edgar and his team are just as inspiring as they are hard-working. they have shown that it's possible to assemble the talent and operations to innovate on a foundational technology that hasn't seen meaningful advances in decades anywhere in the country,"" said guy filippelli, squadra ventures' managing partner. ""by boosting efficiency and manufacturing domestically in the critical semiconductor industry, falcomm's innovations will bolster american competitiveness."" 
 the funding will be used to accelerate go-to-market activities with satellite companies and wireless infrastructure manufacturers, advance the company's patented technology, and expand the team. falcomm is actively hiring for roles in operations, engineering, and design.  view job openings .

 at least half of veterans with spinal cord injuries will develop sores on their skin from the unrelieved pressure of sitting for long periods of time in a wheelchair. it's a constant worry, because these skin ulcers can greatly limit patients' mobility. 
 ""pressure injuries directly impact the veteran's quality of life, because the medical provider will order the veteran to bed rest for weeks and potentially months,"" said kim house, a physician and medical director of the spinal cord injury clinic at the atlanta veterans administration healthcare system. ""at every clinic visit, i provide education for pressure injury prevention."" 
 house could one day have a new tool to offer her patients, thanks to researchers in the georgia tech college of engineering, and wheelchair-bound veterans are just the beginning. 
 materials engineers are developing new fabric sensors and a customized wheelchair system that assesses and automatically eases pressure at contact points to prevent injuries from developing in the first place. 
 ""we have three key issues happening: first, continuous pressure. second, moisture, because when you're sitting in the same spot, you tend to sweat and generate moisture. and third is shear. when you try to move somebody, the skin shears. that perfect combination is what causes pressure injuries,"" said 
 sundaresan jayaraman , professor in the

 mar 06, 2018 
 - atlanta, ga 
 as a competitive archer kolby hanley knows the challenges associated with the sport. as an engineer he knows how to solve them. 
 hanley, a materials and science engineering major, invented a new aiming device for competitive archery. the lightweight scope with integrated light, called starlight, is the latest product developed by his company, 
 ultraview . 
 the device is also among the six finalists for the 2018 
 inventure prize , georgia tech's annual invention competition. the winner will be selected march 14. 
 hanley transferred to tech in 2017 from the university of vermont. the 20-year-old has been involved with archery for 11 years and competing for the past seven. he's a four-time national champion and at one time was the top-ranked archer under 21 in the united states. 
 ""as a shooter there are other problems i'd like to solve within the sport,"" said hanley, who is from cambridge, vt. ""it's exciting that people are responding to it."" 
 he said starlight fixes several deficiencies. while current scopes are bulky, his design is made from fiber composite material which provides a smaller and lighter design. 
 lots of archers shoot in the woods where it's dark or at least heavily shaded. they would need to attach a light to scopes and the wires could obstruct views. but starlight's sight doesn't have any obstructions in the aiming window. it also has an integrated ultra violet led to illuminate a florescent dot on the glass magnifying lens. 
 hanley is accepting pre-orders for the product and expects to deliver them this summer.

 the severe storms research center is helping improve the ability to forecast tornados and other severe storms.

 for john trostel, madeline frank, jessica losego, and tom perry, a day without clouds isn't necessarily an ideal day. 
 the four researchers are part of the 
 georgia tech research institute's 
 (gtri) 
 severe storms research center 
 (ssrc), and for them, a day without clouds is a day without new information on how deadly tornadoes and severe thunderstorms develop and move across the peach state. 
 tornadoes in the southeast united states can differ dramatically from those popularized by storm chasers in the midwest. in the southeast, severe tornadoes may not stay on the ground for long, often dropping out of clouds and disappearing with only a relatively short, but deadly and destructive ground track. they also often occur at night, may be wrapped in rain, and embedded in larger squall line structures. 
 these characteristics mean that tornadoes in the southeast can be difficult to forecast using conventional weather radar, especially for storms near the edges of a radar's coverage area. but the measurement of lightning can be done more easily and can be useful because an increase in lightning activity can indicate an intensifying storm that could spawn a tornado. so to supplement existing national weather service warning technologies, the ssrc has been focusing on measuring lightning in north georgia, in collaboration with the local national weather service office in peachtree city. 
 ""when lightning occurs in the clouds or from the clouds to the ground, it produces bursts of radio-frequency energy,"" explained trostel, the center's director. ""our sensors pick up those bursts of energy and by looking at the times when each sensor receives the signal, we can calculate a 3-d path to the source. that allows us to map the lightning in near real-time."" 
 to capture the lightning data, the ssrc has built the north georgia lightning mapping array, a network of 12 sensors located around the metropolitan atlanta area, extending as far south as newnan and mcdonough, and as far north as acworth and duluth. the array feeds into a monitoring system that consolidates and transmits the information to the short-term prediction research and transition center (sport) and ultimately to the national weather service office in peachtree city. 
 ""we want to know which storms are active enough to produce lightning because that gives us information about the dynamics of what's going on inside the clouds,"" trostel said. ""total lightning, which includes both cloud-to-cloud and cloud-to-ground activity, often jumps before severe weather begins, so this can provide a more advanced warning. by collecting information from our array, we expect to be able to determine which storms are likely to become severe."" 
 each lightning measurement sensor, based on a design developed by engineers at the new mexico institute of mining and technology, includes an antenna, a small linux computer, two 12-volt batteries, and a transmitter - all in a weather-proof box. the earliest systems relied on power and network connections from the organizations hosting the sensors, but ssrc personnel have now converted most of the sensors to use solar power and wireless transmitters that can operate independently of a host building. 
 the gtri team builds and maintains the equipment, relying on assistance from other entities such as emory university, the georgia department of natural resources and local public safety organizations to provide locations. 
 ""it's a really big scientific collaboration and research partnership,"" said perry, who is a gtri electrical engineer at the ssrc. 
 the 12 locations transmit data every minute to provide real-time forecasting information and also store more detailed information useful to the researchers. the real-time data goes first to gtri, then to huntsville, alabama, where it is processed and sent to dallas, texas, for inclusion in data feeds that can be used by national weather service forecasters. the data is also posted in real time at the website ( nglma.gtri.gatech.edu ). 
 ""if a storm is developing, forecasters might not see the next radar image for as much as six minutes, so the more frequent updates we provide can help forecasters issue an earlier warning,"" said frank, who is a gtri research meteorologist. 
 a tornado can form and drop from the clouds within the time required for a single sweep of weather radar, noted losego, who is also a gtri research meteorologist. the north georgia lightning mapping array can help forecasters focus attention on which storms should be watched more closely. 
 ""we don't issue forecasts, but the information from the array can help forecasters determine which storms to watch based on their lightning activity,"" losego explained. ""forecasters may not know exactly which storm may produce a tornado, so having lightning data can help inform their decision-making."" 
 beyond lightning, the center is also studying infrasonics, very low frequency sound waves produced by severe storms. the signals, which are below the range of human hearing, can travel long distances and may one day provide an additional source of early warning data. 
 the ssrc was created after a tornado touched down in gainesville, georgia, march 20, 1998. the early morning storm killed 12 people in georgia and caused extensive damage. the storm dropped out of the clouds quickly, preventing forecasters from issuing a timely warning. 
 the ssrc launch was supported by the state of georgia, georgia emergency management agency (gema) and the federal emergency management agency (fema). 
 in addition to its interest in severe weather, the ssrc also supports other weather-related projects at gtri. it has supplied meteorological forecasting to a military program focused on air-dropping supplies, and to designers of inflatable antenna dishes where information about atmospheric pressure is critical. 
 ""we have been able to see how wind events, temperature drops, and rain rates affect the antennas,"" explained frank. ""for the designers, we are assessing the correlation between weather conditions and performance."" 
 and the center is part of gtri's outreach to k-12 schools. researchers produce weather programs for schools and use high school students in their field work. high schools were also involved in an earlier project to build ""electric field mills"" to detect changes in electromagnetic energy caused by charged clouds and lightning. 
 ""high schools students are quite capable and showed us they were able to build complex instruments that really worked,"" said trostel. ""our k-12 outreach helps get students excited about science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. we think that will pay off in the long term.""

sga-it-board-creates-student-focused-solutions.txt,"sga it board creates student-focused solutions 
 members of the student government association's it board help students improve their digital experience and receive on-the-job training to jump-start their careers. 
 tyler katchen, the outgoing sga joint vice president of it, works on his laptop on tech green. 
 apr 19, 2024 
 in a competitive industry like information technology (it), real-world experience can make all the difference as students prepare for jobs after commencement. 
 the student government association's it board 
 allows students to enhance their skills while creating solutions that benefit the georgia tech community. 
 made up of software engineers, product managers, and ui (user interface) designers, the board assists campus partners with constructing and maintaining the institute's technology infrastructure. projects overseen by the board, including student-focused sites such as 
 course critique , are run through the institute's aws and plesk platforms, mirroring industry trends. 
 ""the it board creates helpful products for students, but it also helps our members by giving them the tools to work within this professional setting. with so many companies using cloud-based systems, our students are getting hands-on experience with these tools, so they already have that on their resumé and are set up to find jobs when they leave georgia tech,"" said tyler katchen, the outgoing sga joint vice president of it (jvpit). 
 the board is responsible for tweaking existing sites, but its members are always seeking innovative ways to improve the student experience. the board is close to completing an app that enhances the career fair queueing process by allowing students to secure their place in line to speak with major industry players. by simplifying this process, the board hopes that attendees can spend less time waiting and more time speaking with prospective employers. 
 much of the it board's work is done behind the scenes, but katchen and his team aren't in search of the spotlight. 
 ""when people see an app we develop, they may not realize how much work goes into it, but we feel the impact in other ways. the projects that are well received by students are ones where they maybe don't recognize the product; they just see themselves using it,"" he said. for him, the reward is ""seeing it all come together. a lot of it is just taking pride in your work."" 
 since the formulation of the jvpit role - serving both undergraduate and graduate sga - in 2020, the board has continued to expand membership and take on larger tasks, including rebuilding the course critique site, which originated in 1976 as a tool to help students plan their schedules. looking ahead, katchen identified improvements to security measures in github, as well as streamlining surveying efforts for student organizations, as some of the board's top priorities. 
 the third-year computer science student recently handed over a 28-page transition document to his successor, outlining the status of current projects and day-to-day responsibilities. while he enjoyed his time at the helm, katchen is ready to return to the keyboard. 
 ""i'm a computer science nerd through and through,"" he said. ""so, i'm ready to put my head down and code.""

sga-leaders-see-opportunity-georgia-tech-reaches-inflection-point.txt,"sga leaders see opportunity as georgia tech reaches ‘inflection point' 
 the new leaders of the undergraduate student government association begin their terms at a critical moment in georgia tech's history and want to bring students to the table. 
 georgia tech undergraduate student government association vp harrison baro and president aanjan sikal. submitted photo.& 
 sep 28, 2023 
 with enrollment numbers reaching record highs and campus infrastructure changing rapidly, the new leaders of the undergraduate student government association (sga) see an opportunity to amplify the voice of their fellow students entering the institute's next generation. 
 president aanjan sikal and executive vice president harrison baro take their respective offices at an ""inflection point"" in georgia tech's history as transformative projects are completed and a growing student body creates the need for additional resources. 
 ""it truly does feel like there is something brewing,"" sikal said. ""especially with 
 scheller tower and the george tower coming up in tech square , with art square and science square now as well; it definitely feels like we are preparing ourselves, and with this enrollment growth we want to make access expandable to everyone."" 
 sikal, a fourth-year industrial engineering student, previously served as the vice president of academic affairs under rohan sohani, who he credits with igniting conversations with tech leadership regarding the stress that growth has placed on campus services such as housing, dining, registration, and infrastructure. deciding to run for president, sikal aimed to keep that conversation going and secure students' place at the table as critical decisions are made. 
 ""we want to make sure that for every decision that georgia tech makes, there are students on those decision boards and committees who are making those decisions along with the administration. we want student involvement in every level of georgia tech,"" he said. 
 sikal also notes that while some solutions take time to come to fruition, finding and executing short-term solutions will be a key part of their administration. both sikal and baro see sga as an organization that exists to embody the opinion of the collective student body, and baro emphasized the importance of creating an open forum for students to participate in an ongoing dialogue where ideas can be shared with sga leaders. 
 ""at the end of the day, this is an institution, and our goal as student government is always looking at how we can improve the student experience on campus and not only help everyone be a successful student, but also a successful member of the community. we want to make sure they understand that georgia tech is not just a place to get a degree, it's a place to call home, and it's a place that you should feel safe, welcome, and accepted,"" baro, a third-year environmental engineering student, said. 
 sga plays a vital role in the support of student organizations on campus , and continuing that support became a pillar of sikal and baro's platform. 
 ""whether it's funding organizations that can share pieces of their personality with other students or funding an organization to go and compete and represent georgia tech, i just want people to leave georgia tech having this love for their alma mater, and i think student government fits perfectly into that puzzle,"" sikal said. 
 the pair praised institute leadership for their willingness to engage with sga and value students' voice. to ensure the strong relationship continues, they have prioritized setting up meetings with faculty members and administrators early in their tenure to continue building bridges. 
 when he arrived on campus, baro was intrigued by the inner workings of a college campus. his various roles within sga have given him new insight into the ""city within a city"" that is georgia tech. 
 ""we get to see the student side as students ourselves and talking to our fellow classmates about things that we would like to see happen. from the administrative side, we get a more nuanced approach to the complexities of each situation and understand that cost-benefit analysis from both sides,"" he said. 
 the newly renovated john lewis student center was the vision of past sga leaders, and to sikal and baro, the space represents the impact that their administration will have during this period in tech's history. 
 ""we're a moment in time, but what we do now can be carried from year to year and should be carried on because, if you move on and forget about what happened the year before, everything that we work toward and advocate for is lost,"" sikal said. ""the continuation of ideas is extremely important to make georgia tech what it is."" 
 sikal and baro continue to gather feedback from the campus community, and while there are challenges that come with the position, they feel a renewed excitement on campus that has them eager to see what the future holds.

shape-shifting-robot-built-smarticles-shows-new-locomotion-strategy.txt,"shape-shifting robot built from ""smarticles"" shows new locomotion strategy 
 researchers have built a robot entirely from smaller robots known as ""smarticles.""

 sep 18, 2019 
 - atlanta, ga 
 building conventional robots typically requires carefully combining components like motors, batteries, actuators, body segments, legs and wheels. now, researchers have taken a new approach, building a robot entirely from smaller robots known as ""smarticles"" to unlock the principles of a potentially new locomotion technique. 
 the 3d-printed smarticles - short for smart active particles - can do just one thing: flap their two arms. but when five of these smarticles are confined in a circle, they begin to nudge one another, forming a robophysical system known as a ""supersmarticle"" that can move by itself. adding a light or sound sensor allows the supersmarticle to move in response to the stimulus - and even be controlled well enough to navigate a maze. 
 though rudimentary now, the notion of making robots from smaller robots - and taking advantage of the group capabilities that arise by combining individuals - could provide mechanically based control over very small robots. ultimately, the emergent behavior of the group could provide a new locomotion and control approach for small robots that could potentially change shapes. 
 ""these are very rudimentary robots whose behavior is dominated by mechanics and the laws of physics,"" said 
 dan goldman , a dunn family professor in the 
 school of physics 
 at the georgia institute of technology. ""we are not looking to put sophisticated control, sensing, and computation on them all. as robots become smaller and smaller, we'll have to use mechanics and physics principles to control them because they won't have the level of computation and sensing we would need for conventional control."" 
 the research, which was supported by the army research office and the national science foundation, was reported september 18 in the journal 
 science robotics . researchers from northwestern university also contributed to the project. 
 the foundation for the research came from an unlikely source: a study of construction staples. by pouring these heavy-duty staples into a container with removable sides, former ph.d. student nick gravish - now a faculty member at the university of california san diego - created structures that would stand by themselves after the container's walls were removed. 
 shaking the staple towers eventually caused them to collapse, but the observations led to a realization that simple entangling of mechanical objects could create structures with capabilities well beyond those of the individual components. 
 ""a robot made of other rudimentary robots became the vision,"" goldman said. ""you could imagine making a robot in which you would tweak its geometric parameters a bit and what emerges is qualitatively new behaviors."" 
 to explore the concept, graduate research assistant will savoie used a 3d printer to create battery-powered smarticles, which have motors, simple sensors, and limited computing power. the devices can change their location only when they interact with other devices while enclosed by a ring. 
 ""even though no individual robot could move on its own, the cloud composed of multiple robots could move as it pushed itself apart and shrink as it pulled itself together,"" goldman explained. ""if you put a ring around the cloud of little robots, they start kicking each other around, and the larger ring - what we call a supersmarticle - moves around randomly."" 
 the researchers noticed that if one small robot stopped moving, perhaps because its battery died, the group of smarticles would begin moving in the direction of that stalled robot. graduate student ross warkentin learned he could control the movement by adding photo sensors to the robots that halt the arm flapping when a strong beam of light hits one of them. 
 ""if you angle the flashlight just right, you can highlight the robot you want to be inactive, and that causes the ring to lurch toward or away from it, even though no robots are programmed to move toward the light,"" goldman said. ""that allowed steering of the ensemble in a very rudimentary, stochastic way."" 
 school of physics professor kurt wiesenfeld and graduate student zack jackson modeled the movement of the these smarticles and supersmarticles to understand how the nudges and mass of the ring affected overall movement. researchers from northwestern university studied how the interactions between the smarticles provided directional control. 
 ""for many robots, we have electrical current move motors that generate forces on parts that collectively move a robot reliably,"" said 
 todd murphey , a professor of mechanical engineering who worked with northwestern graduate students thomas berrueta and ana pervan. ""we learned that although individual smarticles interact with each other through a chaos of wiggling impacts that are each unpredictable, the whole robot composed of those smarticles moves predictably and in a way that we can exploit in software."" 
 in future work, goldman envisions more complex interactions that utilize the simple sensing and movement capabilities of the smarticles. ""people have been interested in making a certain kind of swarm robots that are composed of other robots,"" he said. ""these structures could be reconfigured on demand to meet specific needs by tweaking their geometry."" 
 the project is of interest to the u.s. army because it could lead to new robotic systems capable of changing their shapes, modalities and functions, said sam stanton. he is program manager of complex dynamics and systems at the army research office, an element of u.s. army combat capabilities development command's army research laboratory. 
 ""future army unmanned systems and networks of systems are imagined to be capable of transforming their shape, modality, and function. for example, a robotic swarm may someday be capable of moving to a river and then autonomously forming a structure to span the gap,"" stanton said. ""dan goldman's research is identifying physical principles that may prove essential for engineering emergent behavior in future robot collectives as well as new understanding of fundamental tradeoffs in system performance, responsiveness, uncertainty, resiliency, and adaptivity."" 
 in addition to those already mentioned, the research also included georgia tech graduate student shengkai li.

 jasmine hornbeck overcame some big challenges to finish her georgia tech degree. now she's back to earn a master's in mechanical engineering. 
 jasmine and her late father. 
 nov 04, 2021 
 - atlanta, ga 
 when jasmine hornbeck and her mother, junko, hit the road from jacksonville, florida, one evening during her senior year of high school, to tour the georgia tech campus, she didn't think about where they would stay that night. 
 ""we got [to campus] around 1 a.m. and i was like, ‘mom, did you not get a hotel?'"" remembered hornbeck. ""she pulled into the coca-cola building parking lot, and i realized that she had pillows and blankets back there and i was like, ‘wow, so this is what we're doing.'"" 
 the two created a makeshift bed in the back of the family suv and settled in for the night. 
 ""my back hurt the next morning, but i didn't care about sleeping in the car at all,"" said hornbeck. she didn't mind because, that morning, she was getting the opportunity to visit her dream school. 
 she wanted to pursue a college career at georgia tech in mechanical engineering and had already been accepted after applying during the early decision phase, but out-of-state tuition would place a heavy financial burden on her family back in florida. so, hornbeck and her mom agreed that they would go to visit the campus and see if tech was the place for her. neither had ever been to atlanta. 
 ""we weren't the type of family that traveled very often,"" she said. ""the longest road trip we'd ever been on was like two hours."" 
 after multiple hours on i-75 and an impromptu car campout, she finally got her first glimpse of campus. while on the tour, hornbeck and her mom shared a moment. 
 ""we looked at each other, and we just kind of knew. my mom simply stated, ‘this is where you belong,"" recalled hornbeck. 
 returning to jacksonville after the tour, hornbeck and her parents came up with a plan for her to attend georgia tech. she enrolled and completed the fall semester then spent the holidays at home. but when she returned to tech in january she received some difficult news. 
 ""my dad was diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer during my senior year of high school,"" said hornbeck. ""i couldn't comprehend the gravity of what was going on, so when i left home, it didn't register that this decision would impact the rest of my life, having such limited moments with him and still choosing my studies."" 
 at the start of spring classes, junko sent a text to hornbeck about her father's worsening condition. 
 ""when she told me to come home, i was so selfishly caught up in how it would affect my studies that i almost didn't,"" hornbeck remembered. but, she booked a ride on a megabus and made it home to see her father hours before he passed away. within 24 hours, hornbeck was on another bus back to georgia tech. 
 ""i don't think i felt the full effect of grief for six, seven, eight months,"" she said. ""i was in a bubble of disbelief."" 
 during that spring semester, hornbeck, a first-generation college student, worried about her future. her father was the main source of income for the family. so, she now faced the reality that she may not have been able to stay at tech. 
 ""i couldn't wrap my head around that. i worked so hard to get here, and, suddenly, it seemed as if my circumstance was going to prevent me from reaching my dreams,"" recalled hornbeck. 
 picking up multiple jobs on and off campus, she was unwilling to give up. she went to financial aid every day for two weeks after her father's death, seeking possible solutions. meanwhile, she kept her father's passing mostly to herself, electing not to tell professors, and leaning only on a handful of friends. she felt alienated from the rest of the georgia tech community. she waited until may for the financial aid packages to be released, continuing to work and attend classes without knowing her future at georgia tech. 
 ""everything was out of my hands,"" said hornbeck. ""that was a concept i struggled to grasp. i'd like to think that i can solve any problem, but, for once, i had no idea how to help myself."" 
 at the end of the semester, help arrived. hornbeck had earned enough scholarships to remain at tech. she'll never know, for sure, why she was awarded the aid but credits her perseverance. 
 after a tumultuous first year, hornbeck continued her collegial path in the wake of her father's death, but toward the end of her undergraduate studies found a sector of campus that could identify with her journey. 
 ""i didn't realize that other people [at georgia tech] were struggling with similar situations, until i found out about grief counseling my senior year,"" she said. ""that was so helpful. these people actually understand how the gravity of such a loss can affect your life, implicitly, for years to come. i found comfort in that community."" 
 this past summer, hornbeck completed her degree in mechanical engineering and is now pursuing a master's degree at georgia tech. 
 for a long time, she felt as if talking about grief was taboo, but she now feels sharing her story has been cathartic. 
 ""telling this heals me in a way. i feel like i've come to terms with all of this,"" she said. ""in his last months, my dad would always tell me that he knew he made the right decision in letting me come here and that he was proud of me. i hold on to that dearly. there is no right way or timeline in which i was supposed to process this, which i didn't understand at the time. with or without what was going on in my personal life, i was at georgia tech because i loved engineering. once i realized that, i had my fire back.""

 a simple, low-cost ventilator based on the resuscitation bags carried in ambulances - and widely available in hospitals - has been designed by an international team of university researchers. the device, which is powered by a 12-volt motor, could help meet peak medical demands in the industrialized world and serve resource-constrained countries that don't have supplies of conventional ventilators. 
 ""the high transmission rate and debilitating respiratory consequences of covid-19 are creating an unmet demand for ventilators worldwide. it is heartwarming to see u.s. manufacturers open-source some of their fda-approved designs to stimulate production."" said 
 susan margulies , chair of the 
 wallace h. coulter department of biomedical engineering at georgia tech and emory university , an expert in ventilator-associated lung injuries. ""our strategy to rapidly expand the supply of ventilators focuses on a simple, low-cost design based on common resuscitation bags carried by ambulances."" 
 the device, which can serve two patients simultaneously, can be produced from inexpensive metal stock and plastic gearing. power comes from standard wall adapters or 12-volt vehicle batteries. the research team is working with the 
 emory university office of technology transfer 
 to move the design into manufacturing. 
 ""we are adapting the bag-valve-mask (bvm) resuscitators that are already in place, designed to be manually squeezed for reviving a patient,"" said 
 shannon yee , an associate professor in 
 georgia tech's george w. woodruff school of mechanical engineering . ""we are providing the mechanical assist that allows the bags to be squeezed continuously for days rather than for short periods of time. we are using infrastructure already in place."" 
 the device was designed at cranfield university in the united kingdom and built and tested at georgia tech in collaboration with emory university. at cranfield, 
 professor leon williams , head of the 
 centre for competitive creative design , specializes in rapid prototyping, and has been iterating the designs with researchers in atlanta. 
 ""we have paid special attention to the requirements of medical specialists to ensure that the system is fit for the purpose,"" said williams. ""for example, we have ensured that the operator of the system is able to manually adjust the tidal volume - the volume of air delivered to the lungs with each breath - to safeguard the patient."" 
 yee said the device is intended to meet the critical needs created by the covid-19 pandemic. 
 ""what's unique about our design is that we have two bvm's per ventilator, which allows two people to breathe with each device that is built,"" yee said. ""our goal was to provide the bare essentials for a ventilator to help with patients who have covid-19 or acute respiratory distress syndrome."" 
 though each emergency ventilator can serve two patients simultaneously, their air flow is separate to avoid cross-contamination. flow volumes can be controlled independently to meet the needs of each patient. 
 in addition to yee and williams, kyle azevedo, a research engineer with the 
 georgia tech research institute (gtri) , has been supporting quality control and test procedures for the device, collaborating with gtri researchers jonathan holmes and wiley holcombe. a small batch of the devices has already been assembled for bench testing and shared with georgia hospitals for evaluation. 
 ""we believe these devices can be mass manufactured in quantities that make a tangible impact on ventilator shortages nationally or worldwide,"" azevedo said. ""leveraging the bvm resuscitators reduces the need for complex electronics, and most of the parts can be cut from flat stock or 3d printed. actuation is via a simple dc motor and regulator, which are widely available."" 
 gtri has experience with bringing concepts to reality, and is advising on manufacturing scale-up for the devices. ""it's very important to pay attention to design for mass manufacture,"" he said. 
 the automated bvm ventilation system has been designed for use in emergency situations where all other ventilators are occupied, or in resource-restricted areas where traditional ventilators are simply not available. the systems are intended to be used on a temporary basis until a conventional ventilator becomes available. 
 the system is designed to be inexpensive to produce. ""the bvm system is purposely designed to be modular and reconfigurable,"" williams said. ""if we need to make further improvements to the system over time, this is possible."" 
 because it is intended for global production and use, the bvm ventilator design emphasized using as few parts as possible, yee said. the ventilator can supply oxygen from a hospital's built-in supply system, or from a portable oxygen generator. the device must be used in conjunction with a pulse oximeter or other device that reliably provides a real-time reading of patient oxygen levels. 
 ""we designed the ventilator to be simple to make, cut from sheets of steel,"" yee explained. ""kits can be assembled and packaged flat for shipping, then reassembled where needed. the manufacturing requires skills that are readily available, and hand tools could even be used."" 
 with just a few weeks until the demand for medical support from ventilators is expected to peak in some hard-hit communities, the researchers understand the race against time to get their engineering drawings out to manufacturers. ""we really need to get this out to people,"" yee said. ""time is of the essence.""

 a simple solution-based processing technique could help reduce the cost of polymer solar cells.

 a simple solution-based electrical doping technique could help reduce the cost of polymer solar cells and organic electronic devices, potentially expanding the applications for these technologies. by enabling production of efficient single-layer solar cells, the new process could help move organic photovoltaics into a new generation of wearable devices and enable small-scale distributed power generation. 
 developed by researchers at the georgia institute of technology and colleagues from three other institutions, the technique provides a new way of inducing p-type electrical doping in organic semiconductor films. the process involves briefly immersing the films in a solution at room temperature, and would replace a more complex technique that requires vacuum processing. 
 ""our hope is that this will be a game-changer for organic photovoltaics by further simplifying the process for fabricating polymer-based solar cells,"" said 
 bernard kippelen , director of georgia tech's 
 center for organic photonics and electronics 
 and a professor in the 
 school of electrical and computer engineering . ""we believe this technique is likely to impact many other device platforms in areas such as organic printed electronics, sensors, photodetectors and light-emitting diodes."" 
 sponsored by the office of naval research, the work was reported december 5 in the journal 
 nature materials . the research also involved scientists from the university of california at santa barbara, kyushu university in japan, and the eindhoven university of technology in the netherlands. 
 the technique consists of immersing thin films of organic semiconductors and their blends in polyoxometalate (pma and pta) solutions in nitromethane for a brief time - on the order of minutes. the diffusion of the dopant molecules into the films during immersion leads to efficient p-type electrical doping over a limited depth of 10 to 20 nanometers from the surface of the film. the p-doped regions show increased electrical conductivity and high work function, reduced solubility in the processing solvent, and improved photo-oxidation stability in air. 
 this new method provides a simpler alternative to air-sensitive molybdenum oxide layers used in the most efficient polymer solar cells that are generally processed using expensive vacuum equipment. when applied to polymer solar cells, the new doping method provided efficient hole collection. for the first time, single-layer polymer solar cells were demonstrated by combining this new method with spontaneous vertical phase separation of amine-containing polymers that leads to efficient electron collection at the opposing electrode. the geometry of these new devices is unique as the functions of hole and electron collection are built into the light-absorbing active layer, resulting in the simplest single-layer geometry with few interfaces. 
 ""the realization of single-layer photovoltaics with our approach enables both electrodes in the device to be made out of low-cost conductive materials,"" said canek fuentes-hernandez, a senior research scientist in kippelen's research group. ""this offers a dramatic simplification of a device geometry, and it improves the photo-oxidation stability of the donor polymer. although lifetime and cost analysis studies are needed to assess the full impact of these innovations, they are certainly very exciting developments on the road to transform organic photovoltaics into a commercial technology."" 
 by simplifying the production of organic solar cells, the new processing technique could allow fabrication of solar cells in areas of africa and latin america that lack capital-intensive manufacturing capabilities, said felipe larrain, a ph.d. student in kippelen's lab. 
 ""our goal is to further simplify the fabrication of organic solar cells to the point at which every material required to fabricate them may be included in a single kit that is offered to the public,"" larrain said. ""the solar cell product may be different if you are able to provide people with a solution that would allow them to make their own solar cells. it could one day enable people to power themselves and be independent of the grid."" 
 organic solar cells have been studied in many academic and industrial laboratories for several decades, and have experienced a continuous and steady improvement in their power conversion efficiency with laboratory values reaching 13 percent - compared to around 20 percent for commercial silicon-based cells. though polymer-based cells are currently less efficient, they require less energy to produce than silicon cells and can be more easily recycled at the end of their lifetime. 
 ""being able to process solar cells entirely at room temperature using this simple solution-based technique could pave the way for a scalable and vacuum-free method of device fabrication, while significantly reducing the time and cost associated with it,"" said vladimir kolesov, a ph.d. researcher and the paper's lead author. 
 beyond solar cells, the doping technique could be more broadly used in other areas of organic electronics, noted ph.d. researcher wen-fang chou. ""with its simplicity, this is truly a promising technology offering adjustable conductivity of semiconductors that could be applied to various organic electronics, and could have huge impact on the industry for mass production."" 
 also at georgia tech, the research involved professors samuel graham and seth marder, both from the center for organic photonics and electronics. beyond georgia tech, the project also involved naoya aizawa from kyushu university; ming wang, guillermo bazan and thuc-quyen nguyen from the university of california santa barbara, and alberto perrotta from eindhoven university of technology,

 [note to researchers: mrna-protein level disparities found in metastatic ovarian cancer in more than 60% of measurements across 4,436 genes; evidence of micro rna regulation] 
 headlines, of late, have touted the successes of targeted gene-based cancer therapies, such as immunotherapies, but, unfortunately, also  their failures . 
 broad inadequacies in a widespread biological concept that affects cancer research could be significantly deflecting the aim of such targeted drugs,  according to a new study . a team exploring genetic mechanisms in cancer at the georgia institute of technology has found evidence that a prevailing concept about how cells produce protein molecules, particularly when applied to cancer, could be erroneous as much as two-thirds of the time. 
 prior studies by other researchers have also critiqued this concept about the pathway leading from genetic code to proteins, but this new study,  led by cancer researcher john mcdonald , has employed rare analytical technology to explore it in unparalleled detail. the study also turned up novel evidence for regulating mechanisms that could account for the prevailing concept's apparent shortcomings. 
 rna concept incomplete 
 the concept stems from common knowledge about the assembly line inside cells that produces protein molecules. it starts with code in dna, which is transcribed to messenger rna, then translated into protein molecules, the cell's building blocks. 
 that model seems to have left the impression that cellular protein production works analogously to an old-style factory production line: that the amount of a messenger rna encoded by dna on the front end translates directly into the amount of a corresponding protein produced on the back end. that idea is at the core of how gene-based cancer drug developers choose their targets. 
 to put that assumed congruence between rna production and protein production to the test, the researchers examined -- in ovarian cancer cells donated by a patient -- 4,436 genes, their subsequently transcribed messenger rna, and the resulting proteins. the assumption, that proverbial factory orders passed down the dna-rna line determine in a straightforward manner the amount of a protein being produced, proved incorrect 62 percent of the time. 
 rna skews drug cues 
 ""the messenger rna-protein connection is important because proteins are usually the targets of  gene-based cancer therapies ,"" mcdonald said. ""and drug developers typically measure messenger rna levels thinking they will tell them what the protein levels are."" but the significant variations in ratios of messenger rna to protein that the researchers found make the common method of targeting proteins via rna seem much less than optimal. 
 mcdonald,  mengnan zhang  and ronghu wu published their results  on august 15, 2017 in the journal  scientific reports . the work was funded by the ovarian cancer institute, the deborah nash endowment, atlanta's northside hospital and the national science foundation. the spectrophotometric technology needed to closely identify a high number of proteins is not widespread and is quite costly but is  available in wu's lab at georgia tech . 
 whereas many studies look at normal tissue versus cancerous tissue, this new study focused on cancer progression, or  metastasis, which is what usually makes cancer deadly . the researchers looked at primary tumor tissue and also metastatic tissue. 
 hiding drug targets 
 ""the idea that any change in rna level in cancerous development flows all the way up to the protein level could be leading to drug targeting errors,"" said  mcdonald, who heads georgia tech's integrated cancer research center . drug developers often look for oddly high messenger rna levels in a cancer then go after what they believe must be the resulting oddly high levels of a corresponding protein. 
 taking messenger rna as a protein level indicator could actually work some of the time. in the mcdonald team's latest experiment, in 38 percent of the cases, the rise of rna levels in cancerous cells did indeed reflect a comparable rise of protein levels. but in the rest of cases, they did not. 
 ""so, there are going to be many instances where if you're predicting what to give therapeutically to a patient based on rna, your prescription could easily be incorrect,"" mcdonald said. ""drug developers could be aiming at targets that aren't there and also not shooting for targets that are there."" 
 rna muted or magnified 
 the analogy of a factory producing building materials can help illustrate what goes wrong in a cancerous cell, and also help describe the study's new insights into protein production. to complete the metaphor: the materials produced are used in the construction of the factory's own building, that is, the cell's own structures. 
 in cancer cells, a mutation makes protein production go awry usually not by deforming proteins but by overproducing them. ""a lot of mutations in cancer are mutations in production levels. the proteins are being overexpressed,"" said mcdonald, who is also a  professor in georgia tech's school of biological sciences . 
 a bad factory order can lead to the production of too much of a good material and then force it into the structures of the cell, distorting it. the question is: where in the production line do bad factory orders appear? 
 according to the new study, the answer is less straightforward than previously thought. 
 micro rna managing 
 the orders don't all appear on the front end of the assembly line with dna over-transcribing messenger rna. additionally, some mutations that do over-transcribe messenger rna on the front end are tamped down or canceled by regulating mechanisms further down the line, and may never end up boosting protein levels on the back end. 
 regulating mechanisms also appear to be making other messenger rna, transcribed in normal amounts, unexpectedly crank out inordinate levels of proteins. 
 at the heart of those regulating systems, another rna called micro rna may be micromanaging how much, or little, of a protein is actually produced in the end. 
 ""we have evidence that micro rnas may be responsible for the non-correlation between the proteins and the rna, and that's completely novel,"" mcdonald said. ""it's an emerging area of research."" 
 micro rna, or  mirna , is an extremely short strand of rna. 
 no one at fault 
 mcdonald would like to see tissues from more cancer patients undergo similar testing. ""right now, with just one patient, the data is limited, but i also really think it shows that the phenomenon is real,"" mcdonald said. 
 ""many past studies have looked at one particular protein and a particular gene, or a particular handful. we looked at more than 4,000,"" mcdonald said. ""what that brings up is that the phenomenon is probably not isolated but instead genome-wide."" 
 the study's authors would also like to see currently less accessible, advanced protein detecting technology become more widely available to biomolecular researchers, especially in the field of cancer drug development. ""targeted gene therapy is a good idea, but you need the full knowledge of whether it's affecting the protein level,"" mcdonald said. 
 he pointed out that no one is at fault for the possible incompleteness of commonly held concepts about protein production. 
 as science progresses, it naturally illuminates new details, and formerly useful ideas need updating. with the existence of new technologies, it may be time to flesh out this particular concept for the sake of cancer research progress.

slothbot-takes-leisurely-approach-environmental-monitoring.txt,"slothbot takes a leisurely approach to environmental monitoring 
 slow and energy-efficient slothbot will handle environmental monitoring and other tasks.

 - atlanta, ga 
 for environmental monitoring, precision agriculture, infrastructure maintenance and certain security applications, slow and energy efficient can be better than fast and always needing a recharge. that's where ""slothbot"" comes in. 
 powered by a pair of photovoltaic panels and designed to linger in the forest canopy continuously for months, slothbot moves only when it must to measure environmental changes - such as weather and chemical factors in the environment - that can be observed only with a long-term presence. the proof-of-concept hyper-efficient robot, described may 21 at the international conference on robotics and automation (icra) in montreal, may soon be hanging out among treetop cables in the atlanta botanical garden. 
 ""in robotics, it seems we are always pushing for faster, more agile and more extreme robots,"" said 
 magnus egerstedt , the steve w. chaddick school chair of the school of electrical and computer engineering at the georgia institute of technology and principal investigator for slothbot. ""but there are many applications where there is no need to be fast. you just have to be out there persistently over long periods of time, observing what's going on."" 
 based on what egerstedt called the ""theory of slowness,"" graduate research assistant gennaro notomista designed slothbot together with his colleague, yousef emam, using 3d-printed parts for the gearing and wire-switching mechanisms needed to crawl through a network of wires in the trees. the greatest challenge for a wire-crawling robot is switching from one cable to another without falling, notomista said. 
 ""the challenge is smoothly holding onto one wire while grabbing another,"" he said. ""it's a tricky maneuver and you have to do it right to provide a fail-safe transition. making sure the switches work well over long periods of time is really the biggest challenge."" 
 mechanically, slothbot consists of two bodies connected by an actuated hinge. each body houses a driving motor connected to a rim on which a tire is mounted. the use of wheels for locomotion is simple, energy efficient and safer than other types of wire-based locomotion, the researchers say. 
 slothbot has so far operated in a network of cables on the georgia tech campus. next, a new 3d-printed shell - that makes the robot look more like a sloth - will protect the motors, gears, actuators, cameras, computer and other components from the rain and wind. that will set the stage for longer-term studies in the tree canopy at the atlanta botanical garden, where egerstedt hopes visitors will see a slothbot monitoring conditions as early as this fall. 
 the name slothbot is not a coincidence. real-life sloths are small mammals that live in jungle canopies of south and central america. making their living by eating tree leaves, the animals can survive on the daily caloric equivalent of a small potato. with their slow metabolism, sloths rest as much 22 hours a day and seldom descend from the trees where they can spend their entire lives. 
 ""the life of a sloth is pretty slow-moving and there's not a lot of excitement on a day-to-day level,"" said jonathan pauli, an associate professor in the department of forest & wildlife ecology at the university of wisconsin-madison, who has consulted with the georgia tech team on the project. ""the nice thing about a very slow life history is that you don't really need a lot of energy input. you can have a long duration and persistence in a limited area with very little energy inputs over a long period of time."" 
 that's exactly what the researchers expect from slothbot, whose development has been funded by the u.s. office of naval research. 
 ""there is a lot we don't know about what actually happens under dense tree-covered areas,"" egerstedt said. ""most of the time slothbot will be just hanging out there, and every now and then it will move into a sunny spot to recharge the battery."" 
 the researchers also hope to test slothbot in a cacao plantation in costa rica that is already home to real sloths. ""the cables used to move cacao have become a sloth superhighway because the animals find them useful to move around,"" egerstedt said. ""if all goes well, we will deploy slothbots along the cables to monitor the sloths."" 
 egerstedt is known for algorithms that drive swarms of small wheeled or flying robots. but during a visit to costa rica, he became interested in sloths and began developing what he calls ""a theory of slowness"" together with professor ron arkin in georgia tech's school of interactive computing. the theory leverages the benefits of energy efficiency. 
 ""if you are doing things like environmental monitoring, you want to be out in the forest for months,"" egerstedt said. ""that changes the way you think about control systems at a high level."" 
 flying robots are already used for environmental monitoring, but their high energy needs mean they cannot linger for long. wheeled robots can get by with less energy, but they can get stuck in mud or be hampered by tree roots, and cannot get a big picture view from the ground. 
 ""the thing that costs energy more than anything else is movement,"" egerstedt said. ""moving is much more expensive than sensing or thinking. for environmental robots, you should only move when you absolutely have to. we had to think about what that would be like."" 
 for pauli, who studies a variety of wildlife, working with egerstedt to help slothbot come to life has been gratifying. 
 ""it is great to see a robot inspired by the biology of sloths,"" he said. ""it has been fun to share how sloths and other organisms that live in these ecosystems for long periods of time live their lives. it will be interesting to see robots mirroring what we see in natural ecological communities.""

 georgia tech and partner organizations improving the lives of children 
 sep 11, 2015 
 - atlanta, ga 
 georgia tech scientists and engineers, in collaboration with emory university, children's healthcare of atlanta, and marcus autism center, are tackling one of the biggest challenges in pediatric medicine - the lack of medical devices and technologies designed specifically for children. 
 many medical devices used on children were designed for adults. and because the market for children's medical devices is small, many companies shy away from building medical technologies for children. georgia tech is helping to fill that gap in the market. from an app that allows parents to send pictures of their child's potential ear infection to a doctor, to surgical tools tailored to a child's physiology, the institute is leading the push toward improving and saving children's lives through technology. read more about the ""small wonders"" evolving in georgia tech labs in this article from

 capillary action inside glass tubes coated with a hydrogel behaves in unexpected ways. 
 close-up image shows water from a droplet moving into a narrow glass tube that has been coated on the inside with a hydrogel material. (credit: john toon, georgia tech) 
 jul 27, 2015 
 - atlanta, ga 
 coating the inside of glass microtubes with a polymer hydrogel material dramatically alters the way capillary forces draw water into the tiny structures, researchers have found. the discovery could provide a new way to control microfluidic systems, including popular lab-on-a-chip devices. capillary action draws water and other liquids into confined spaces such as tubes, straws, wicks and paper towels, and the flow rate can be predicted using a simple hydrodynamic analysis. but a chance observation by researchers at the georgia institute of technology will cause a recalculation of those predictions for conditions in which hydrogel films line the tubes carrying water-based liquids. ""rather than moving according to conventional expectations, water-based liquids slip to a new location in the tube, get stuck, then slip again - and the process repeats over and over again,"" explained 
 andrei fedorov , a professor in the 
 george w. woodruff school of mechanical engineering 
 at georgia tech. ""instead of filling the tube with a rate of liquid penetration that slows with time, the water propagates at a nearly constant speed into the hydrogel-coated capillary. this was very different from what we had expected."" the findings resulted from research sponsored by the air force office of scientific research (afosr) through the bionic center at georgia tech, and were reported earlier this month in the journal 
 soft matter . when the opening of a thin glass tube is exposed to a droplet of water, the liquid begins to flow into the tube, pulled by a combination of surface tension in the liquid and adhesion between the liquid and the walls of the tube. leading the way is a meniscus, a curved surface of the water at the leading edge of the water column. an ordinary borosilicate glass tube fills by capillary action at a gradually decreasing rate with the speed of meniscus propagation slowing as a square root of time. but when the inside of a tube is coated with a very thin layer of poly(n-isopropylacrylamide), a so-called ""smart"" polymer (pnipam), everything changes. water entering a tube coated on the inside with a dry hydrogel film must first wet the film and allow it to swell before it can proceed farther into the tube. the wetting and swelling take place not continuously, but with discrete steps in which the water meniscus first sticks and its motion remains arrested while the polymer layer locally deforms. the meniscus then rapidly slides for a short distance before the process repeats. this ""stick-slip"" process forces the water to move into the tube in a step-by-step motion. the flow rate measured by the researchers in the coated tube is three orders of magnitude less than the flow rate in an uncoated tube. a linear equation describes the time dependence of the filling process instead of a classical quadratic equation which describes filling of an uncoated tube. ""instead of filling the capillary in a hundredth of a second, it might take tens of seconds to fill the same capillary,"" said fedorov. ""though there is some swelling of the hydrogel upon contact with water, the change in the tube diameter is negligible due to the small thickness of the hydrogel layer. this is why we were so surprised when we first observed such a dramatic slow-down of the filing process in our experiments."" the researchers - who included graduate students james silva, drew loney and ren geryak and senior research engineer peter kottke - tried the experiment again using glycerol, a liquid that is not absorbed by the hydrogel. with glycerol, the capillary action proceeded through the hydrogel-coated microtube as with an uncoated tube in agreement with conventional theory. after using high-resolution optical visualization to study the meniscus propagation while the polymer swelled, the researchers realized they could put this previously-unknown behavior to good use. water absorption by the hydrogels occurs only when the materials remain below a specific transition temperature. when heated above that temperature, the materials no longer absorb water, eliminating the ""stick-slip"" phenomenon in the microtubes and allowing them to behave like ordinary tubes. this ability to turn the stick-slip behavior on and off with temperature could provide a new way to control the flow of water-based liquid in microfluidic devices, including labs-on-a-chip. the transition temperature can be controlled by varying the chemical composition of the hydrogel. ""by locally heating or cooling the polymer inside a microfluidic chamber, you can either speed up the filling process or slow it down,"" fedorov said. ""the time it takes for the liquid to travel the same distance can be varied up to three orders of magnitude. that would allow precise control of fluid flow on demand using external stimuli to change polymer film behavior."" the heating or cooling could be done locally with lasers, tiny heaters, or thermoelectric devices placed at specific locations in the microfluidic devices. that could allow precise timing of reactions in microfluidic devices by controlling the rate of reactant delivery and product removal, or allow a sequence of fast and slow reactions to occur. another important application could be controlled drug release in which the desired rate of molecule delivery could be dynamically tuned over time to achieve the optimal therapeutic outcome. in future work, fedorov and his team hope to learn more about the physics of the hydrogel-modified capillaries and study capillary flow using partially-transparent microtubes. they also want to explore other ""smart"" polymers which change the flow rate in response to different stimuli, including the changing ph of the liquid, exposure to electromagnetic radiation, or the induction of mechanical stress - all of which can change the properties of a particular hydrogel designed to be responsive to those triggers. ""these experimental and theoretical results provide a new conceptual framework for liquid motion confined by soft, dynamically evolving polymer interfaces in which the system creates an energy barrier to further motion through elasto-capillary deformation, and then lowers the barrier through diffusive softening,"" the paper's authors wrote. ""this insight has implications for optimal design of microfluidic and lab-on-a-chip devices based on stimuli-responsive smart polymers."" in addition to those already mentioned, the research team included professor vladimir tsukruk from the georgia tech school of materials science and engineering and rajesh naik, biotechnology lead and tech advisor of the nanostructured and biological materials branch of the air force research laboratory (afrl). this research was supported by the air force office of scientific research bionic center through awards fa9550-09-1-0162 and fa9550-14-1-0269, afosr award fa-9550-14-1-0015, and by georgia tech's renewable bioproducts institute fellowship. the content is solely the responsibility of the authors and does not necessarily represent the official views of the sponsors. citation : j.e. silva, et al., ""stick-slip water penetration into capillaries coated with swelling hydrogel,"" (soft matter, 11, pp. 5933-5939, 2015). research news georgia institute of technology 177 north avenue atlanta, georgia 30332-0181 media relations contact : john toon ( jtoon@gatech.edu ) or (404-894-6986) writer : john toon

smart-sea-sensors-expo-highlights-accomplishments-and-shares-future-plans.txt,"smart sea sensors expo highlights accomplishments and shares future plans 
 smart sea level sensors project marks first year successes. 
 students from jenkins high school in savannah are working with georgia tech researchers on the sea sensor project. 
 may 16, 2019 
 - atlanta, ga 
 the smart sea level sensors project marked its first year of successes. the project team, community collaborators, and local residents convened for an expo highlighting the programs accomplishments with presentations and hands-on demonstrations. they also gathered input to guide planning for the second year of the project. 
 ""the is the first project of its kind in the region, and we are excited about how far it's come and the genuine interest and input from the local community,"" said kim cobb, director of global change program and professor in the school of earth and atmospheric sciences. 
 the smart sea level sensors project is a collaboration between chatham emergency management officials, city of savannah officials and georgia tech scientists and engineers who are working together to install a dense network of internet-enabled sea level sensors across chatham county. 
 ""the publicly available data gathered from these sensors will inform our long-term resilience and 
 infrastructure planning,"" said the city of savannah's sustainability director, nick deffley. ""it provides a great opportunity to really engage with some of our most vulnerable neighborhoods, working collaboratively with them to improve their ability to respond, absorb and bounce back from extreme storm and flood events."" 
 at this time, the project team has installed 30 sensors, with hopes to install additional detectors across the coastal georgia region in the near future. the real-time coastal flooding data will help guide emergency planning and response efforts. 
 ""chatham county has an intricate network of waterways which greatly affects the timing and impact of flood conditions,"" said randall mathews, cema senior emergency management coordinator. ""this project affords decision makers the opportunity to monitor the movement of water throughout our community in real-time, as well as provide a greater understanding of flooding impact.  tools created by this project can be used to guide emergency response efforts during a severe weather emergency such as a hurricane."" 
 the project has been a group effort since it began last summer. from engaging h.v. jenkins school of engineering students on the assembly work involved with the smart sea level sensors to partnering with oglethorpe charter middle school for pilot testing of a 6th grade earth science curriculum, the project team has fostered substantial community involvement. 
 ""georgia tech has played a lead role in developing the technology for the project, which has been really exciting,"" said georgia tech senior research scientist, dr. russ clark. ""it's truly been great to work on a project that has such obvious, immediate value to our community and the place we call home."" 
 the smart sea level sensors project is one of four projects under the georgia smart communities challenge. the strategies developed by the selected communities are meant to serve as models that could be implemented elsewhere to advance smart technology and improve community well-being across georgia.

 growing up in plano, texas, watching star wars, battlestar galactica, and star trek with his parents, jason smith developed an early interest in all things aerospace. 
 jason smith - fall 2022 graduate 
 dec 14, 2022 
 - atlanta, ga 
 growing up in plano, texas, watching 
 star wars , 
 battlestar galactica , and 
 star trek 
 with his parents, jason smith developed an early interest in all things aerospace. when the time came to apply for college, he knew he wanted to study 
 aerospace engineering , and he knew he wanted to go to georgia tech - where his uncle, robert glenn, graduated with a degree in chemical engineering in 1994. 
 now, smith is preparing to wrap up one chapter of his life at this weekend's commencement ceremony, and begin a new one in seattle, washington, at spacex as an ion propulsion test engineer. 
 as he looks forward to ""celebrating everything that my friends and i have been through and achieved,"" he takes a moment to reflect on how far he's come. ""georgia tech was everything i expected and more,"" he said. ""it was just as difficult as i anticipated, but people were so incredibly supportive and collaborative that i never felt like i was alone on this journey."" 
 along the way, smith seized opportunities outside of the classroom and the lab, from being a member of the men's rowing team to promoting lgbtq representation in the engineering sector. ""i try to make any team i'm on a safe space for all identities, realizing that a strong team is a diverse team,"" he said. one opportunity that eluded smith as an undergraduate was study abroad. he'd signed up for the aerospace india program for summer 2020, but covid-19 made it impossible. 
 still, he credits tech with ""pushing me to my academic limits and making me extremely resilient."" just as importantly, he said, ""i feel like i have the context i need about every corner of the aerospace industry to know exactly what i want to pursue and how to do it successfully."" 
 and, as many graduating seniors do, smith has advice for students just beginning their own georgia tech journeys. ""have fun. tech is tough, but going through it alone is tougher,"" he said. ""our time at the institute really isn't that long, so i urge you to enjoy it and make as many friends as you can here. the students at tech are some of the brightest people i've met in my life, and i've only been enriched by spending time with them and learning as much as i can from them.""

social-media-driving-force-behind-increased-visits-national-parks.txt,"social media driving force behind increased visits to national parks 
 a new study from georgia tech's school of economics is the first to tie high levels of social media exposure to increased visitors to the u.s. national parks - and the increased crowding and ecological damage they bring with them. 
 apr 01, 2024 
 social media is a powerful influence on our lives and our culture, driving decisions from what we eat for lunch to where we go on vacation. now, a new study from 
 georgia tech's school of economics 
 is the first to tie high levels of social media exposure to increased visitors to the u.s. national parks - and the increased crowding and ecological damage they bring with them. 
 ""there's been a general idea that social media exposure matters for visitation, but this research shows that it matters to a very strong degree,"" said 
 casey wichman, 
 an associate professor of economics and the author of 
 the study, 
 published in april in the 
 proceedings of the national academy of sciences. 
 ""it's one of the main drivers of the huge increase in visitation to national parks."" 
 however, he says, the overall picture is much more nuanced than it's often portrayed in media accounts. 
 wichman found that parks with high social media exposure saw a 16 to 22% increase in visitors compared to locations that received less attention on social media. the growth began in 2013 when instagram and twitter started to gain popularity. 
 while well-known parks such as yosemite, grand canyon, and yellowstone saw big jumps tied to social media exposure, smaller, less well-known properties also saw significant jumps. for example, the number of travelers to lake clark national park and preserve in alaska increased by more than 180%. 
 parks in the southeast saw little change on average because a decrease at parks in florida and the carolinas offset an increase at great smoky mountains national park, the nation's most visited national park. the biggest increases on a percentage basis occurred in the western u.s., particularly in alaska, the rocky mountain region, and utah. 
 ""it seems like there may be some reshuffling of where people go because there are a lot of parks that don't see increases in visitation despite being pretty cool, interesting parks in similar areas,"" wichman said. ""but people end up seeing the parks with higher exposure online and are more likely to get pushed into visiting them."" 
 wichman used five measurements to create an index of social media exposure: instagram followers, instagram mentions, twitter followers, twitter mentions, and the total number of likes and retweets on twitter. then, he ranked the parks based on the average of these five metrics, with a lower rank indicating greater social media exposure. 
 ""social media serves as advertising for parks in a way that's targeted to an individual's network,"" wichman said. ""however, not all exposure increases visits - it has to be good exposure."" 
 wichman also looked at the type of posts and their effects, finding that tweets with photos or videos drove increased visits in the year after they were posted, while tweets with negative sentiment decreased visits over the following year. 
 the increase in visitation due to social media is a double-edged sword, wichman says. more visitors can result in overcrowding, frustrating traffic jams, and difficulty accessing campsites or other amenities. more traffic also means more pollution. but tourists also pay entrance fees and buy things at gift shops, restaurants and other concessions - revenue that can help support park operations, wildlife conservation efforts, and local economies. and, those pretty pictures of nature can also get people excited about going outside, which has its own benefits for travelers, wichman said. 
 ""if you look at news articles, social media is largely pitched as driving overcrowding and being a negative thing. but it's not clear to me that that's the case,"" he said. ""yes, we spend a lot of time on our phones, especially younger demographics, but this also suggests that social media can actually get us outside more. i don't know if it's good or bad, but it's much more nuanced than many sensationalist stories have made it out to be."" 
 wichman's paper, ""social media influences national parks visitation,"" was published in april 2024 in the 
 proceedings of the national academy of sciences.

social-media-profile-black-lives-matter-movement.txt,"the social media profile of the black lives matter movement 
 study examines 29 million tweets surrounding four recent black lives matter events. 
 jun 07, 2016 
 - atlanta, ga 
 researchers at the georgia institute of technology looked at nearly 29 million tweets surrounding four recent black lives matter (blm) events to identify the social media patterns of its activists. they found that the community is unlike many other social movements because of its ability to bond over the course of many months. more than a third of those who participated via social media for the first time continued their participation during the next blm event. the study also found being from a state with historically high rates of black victimization due to police violence, especially in the south and midwest, was linked to peoples' response on social media even if the state wasn't the scene of the current blm event. the researchers also found a change in tone on twitter the day before protests sprung up around the nation. the georgia tech study is among the first to examine the online language of the blm movement. it collected tweets surrounding four major events: the shooting of michael brown in ferguson, missouri (august 2014); the decision not to indict ferguson police officer darren wilson (november 2014); protests and the shooting deaths of two new york city police officers (december 2014); and the death of freddie gray while in custody of baltimore police officers (april 2015). the team also plugged in data of more than 10,000 deaths due to police shootings since 2000. from that, it outlined which states, based on their african-american population, had the highest rates of deaths. missouri, kansas, oklahoma and new mexico were among the highest in the mainland united states. ""these were the same states where we found very negative language on twitter during black lives matter events,"" said munmun de choudhury, the georgia tech assistant professor who led the study. ""other areas, especially in the south and midwest, used words about death to express their feelings. potentially, twitter users in states with historically higher rates of fatal police shootings of blacks tend to interact with others to seek and provide psychosocial support around issues of racial inequality."" however, much of that negativity disappeared on the immediate eve of protests. language changed. the researchers noticed that tweets about death, anger and first person singular nouns transformed into more posts about family, friends and first person plural pronouns. ""we saw more sadness but lower anger and anxiety the day before protests,"" said benjamin sugar, a georgia tech master's student who co-authored the study. ""it doesn't mean they weren't angry or anxious. but in 140 characters, people showed thoughts of moving forward and making a difference."" blm was born on facebook in 2013 following the acquittal of george zimmerman in the shooting death of florida's trayvon martin. during each subsequent event, the movement has contradicted typical twitter stereotypes. the study found that on average 36 percent of first-time blm users participated again. ""other hashtag movements have helped spread awareness about important issues, but many of them quickly lose their momentum,"" said shagun jhaver, a georgia tech ph.d. student and co-author. ""the black lives matter movement realizes it's part of a long-term social transformation and shows continual engagement. and it continues despite having no formal hierarchal structure.""   the research, "" social media participation in an activist movement for racial equality ,""  won best paper when it was presented last month at the international aaai conference on web and social media in germany. it was funded, in part, by the national institutes of health ( # 1r01gm11269701). any opinions, findings, and conclusions or recommendations expressed in this material are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of the national institutes of health.

 - atlanta, ga 
 from electric cars that travel hundreds of miles on a single charge to chainsaws as mighty as gas-powered versions, new products hit the market each year that take advantage of recent advances in battery technology. 
 but that growth has led to concerns that the world's supply of lithium, the metal at the heart of many of the new rechargeable batteries, may eventually be depleted. 
 now researchers at the georgia institute of technology have found new evidence suggesting that batteries based on sodium and potassium hold promise as a potential alternative to lithium-based batteries. 
 ""one of the biggest obstacles for sodium- and potassium-ion batteries has been that they tend to decay and degrade faster and hold less energy than alternatives,"" said matthew mcdowell, an assistant professor in the george w. woodruff school of mechanical engineering and the school of materials science and engineering. 
 ""but we've found that's not always the case,"" he added. 
 for the study, which was published june 19 in the journal 
 joule 
 and was sponsored by the national science foundation and the u.s. department of energy, the research team looked at how three different ions - lithium, sodium, and potassium - reacted with particles of iron sulfide, also called pyrite and fool's gold. 
 as batteries charge and discharge, ions are constantly reacting with and penetrating the particles that make up the battery electrode. this reaction process causes large volume changes in the electrode's particles, often breaking them up into small pieces. because sodium and potassium ions are larger than lithium, it's traditionally been thought that they cause more significant degradation when reacting with particles. 
 in their experiments, the reactions that occur inside a battery were directly observed inside an electron microscope, with the iron sulfide particles playing the role of a battery electrode. the researchers found that iron sulfide was more stable during reaction with sodium and potassium than with lithium, indicating that such a battery based on sodium or potassium could have a much longer life than expected. 
 the difference between how the different ions reacted was stark visually. when exposed to lithium, iron sulfide particles appeared to almost explode under the electron microscope. on the contrary, the iron sulfide expanded like a balloon when exposed to the sodium and potassium. 
 ""we saw a very robust reaction with no fracture - something that suggests that this material and other materials like it could be used in these novel batteries with greater stability over time,"" said matthew boebinger, a graduate student at georgia tech. 
 the study also casts doubt on the notion that large volume changes that occur during the electrochemical reaction are always a precursor to particle fracture, which causes electrode failure leading to battery degradation. 
 the researchers suggested that one possible reason for the difference in how the different ions reacted with the iron sulfide is that the lithium was more likely to concentrate its reaction along the particle's sharp cube-like edges, whereas the reaction with sodium and potassium was more diffuse along all of the surface of the iron sulfide particle. as a result, the iron sulfide particle when reacting with sodium and potassium developed a more oval shape with rounded edges. 
 while there's still more work to be done, the new research findings could help scientists design battery systems that use these types of novel materials. 
 ""lithium batteries are still the most attractive right now because they have the most energy density - you can pack a lot of energy in that space,"" mcdowell said. ""sodium and potassium batteries at this point don't have more density, but they are based on elements a thousand times more abundant in the earth's crust than lithium. so they could be much cheaper in the future, which is important for large scale energy storage - backup power for homes or the energy grid of the future.""

 georgia tech researchers have created a semiconductor material that acts like a second skin layer and is up to 200% more stretchable than its original dimension without significantly losing its electric current. 
 three engineering labs at georgia tech collaborated to demonstrate a new level of stretchability of a photodetector. pictured above is first author youngrak park (right) with the lab leads (l to r) bernard kippelen,  samuel graham, and olivier pierron. (photo credit: ben wright, georgia tech)

 semiconductors are moving away from rigid substrates, which are cut or formed into thin discs or wafers, to more flexible plastic material and even paper thanks to new material and fabrication discoveries. the trend toward more flexible substrates has led to fabrication of numerous devices, from light-emitting diodes to solar cells and transistors. 
 georgia tech researchers have created a material that acts like a second skin layer and is up to 200% more stretchable than its original dimension without significantly losing its electric current. the researchers say the soft flexible photodetectors could enhance the utility of medical wearable sensors and implantable devices, among other applications. the research will be published on dec. 15 in the journal 
 science advances . 
 georgia tech researchers from both mechanical and computing engineering labs collaborated over three years to demonstrate a new level of stretchability for a photodetector, a device made from a synthetic polymer and an elastomer that absorbs light to produce an electrical current. 
 photodetectors today are used as wearables for health monitoring, such as rigid fingertip pulse oximeter reading devices. they convert light signals into electrical ones and are commonly used on wearable electronics. 
 stretchable like a rubber band 
 given that conventional flexible semiconductors break under a few percentages of strain, the georgia tech findings are ""an order-of-magnitude improvement,"" said olivier pierron, professor in the 
 george w. woodruff school of mechanical engineering , whose lab measures the mechanical properties and reliability of flexible electronics under extreme conditions. 
 ""think of a rubber band or something that's soft and stretchable like human skin yet has similar electrical semiconducting properties of solid or rigid semiconductors,"" said canek fuentes-hernandez, a co-pi formerly in the 
 school of electrical and computer engineering (ece) 
 and now an associate professor in electrical and computer engineering at northeastern university in boston. ""we've shown that you can build stretchability into semiconductors that retains the electrical performance needed to detect light levels that are around hundred million times fainter than produced by a light bulb used for indoor illumination,"" he said. 
 extraordinary tenacity and teamwork 
 bernard kippelen, vice provost for international initiatives and an ece professor, oversaw the work of youngrak park, the study's first author and a ph.d. candidate in ece.  following two-and-a-half years of research, park uncovered the right combination of chemical compounds that produced a super-soft material with the ability to generate and conduct electricity when exposed to light. 
 park found the perfect ratio for all parts of the semiconductor layer to maintain high performance in the photodetector. but it was painstaking work to prove the materials' stretchability, especially given that a single layer was 1,000 times thinner than a human hair. 
 park relied on kyungjin kim, then a georgia tech ph.d. mechanical engineering student, to test the material's reliability. he continued to provide kim with larger, thicker samples until one with a thickness of 500 nanometers worked. 
 ""it was still super thin. under dry conditions, it would just crumble. we had to use a water reservoir to keep its shape,"" recalled kim, now an assistant professor in the university of connecticut's department of mechanical engineering. 
 elaborating on how difficult it was to measure pure mechanical properties of a photoactive layer, pierron noted, ""electronic devices are very brittle typically, which is okay with conventional devices fabricated on rigid substrates. but as soon as you use soft substrates that becomes an issue."" 
 the water acted like plastic wrap keeping the thin films in place without crumbling or losing shape, enabling the researchers to stretch the material and measure its mechanical properties. 
 to test for electrical signals coming out of the device under illumination, electronic terminals had to be embedded on it. yet, those terminals had to be deformable, too, or the entire device would become rigid. 
 ""fabricating stretchable electronic terminals was a major challenge in and of itself,"" said ece phd graduate felipe andres larrain, who worked closely with park and focused on the embedded components.  he is now an assistant professor at adolfo ibáñez university in chile. 
 while this breakthrough material has been initially integrated into a photodetector and tested for electrical functionality, more testing and optimization is needed to show the materials' stretchability  under multimodal loads and its shelf stability. 
 ""what's exciting is what these materials and the devices will enable us to develop―namely, the concept of intelligence systems. you have functional surfaces that combine sensors that monitor all kinds of physical properties,"" said graham, former chair of the woodruff school of mechanical engineering and now dean of engineering at the university of maryland. 
 ""this is a very good example of interdisciplinary research - none of this work would have been possible without the collaboration between electrical and mechanical engineers,"" kippelen said. ""in the lab we didn't have any prior experience with stretchable materials. figuring out how to measure this took a lot of perseverance, creativity and hard work."" 
 new smart applications possible 
 the researchers are most excited about the potential of the material to enhance medical wearables. typically, wristwatches that use rigid biosensors have limitations since flexing the wrist can completely change the sensor's measurements. they are subject to ""motion artifact,"" or degraded image quality, caused when a person moves. 
 ""moving around can drastically affect the usability of collected data but being able to reposition devices on the body to minimize or eliminate motion artifact is a big deal,"" noted gabriel cahn, a project manager for huxley medical, a biosensor startup in atlanta, who recently graduated from georgia tech with a doctorate in flexible electronics.  ""having electronics that can flex, twist, bend and conform to non-flat surfaces and move with your body will allow you to place these sensors in more advantageous places to collect biometric data. it will be infinitely more useful in helping diagnose or monitor existing medical illnesses."" 
 the research team foresees rich applications for the soft and stretchable polymer blend beyond wearables for health monitoring. ""the soft device also could be attractive for implantable electronics for bio-electronic applications since the interfaces comply with the dynamic motion of the soft biological tissues, reducing the foreign body reaction,"" said kim. 
 ""the potential is fantastic,"" added larrain. ""in the long-term, you could develop sensors that could enhance or even replace the human eye or be applied to robotic eyes."" 
 fuentes sees the material working in smart agriculture applications, where farmers could attach light sensors into fruits or other produce to monitor growth, disease and to better time harvesting. 
 kippelen believes the rubber-like photodiodes that detect ultralow light levels could find applications in detecting, identifying, and characterizing ionizing radiation for nuclear fuel cycle monitoring.

 a wireless, wearable monitor built with stretchable electronics could allow comfortable, long-term health monitoring of adults, babies and small children without concern for skin injury or allergic reactions caused by conventional adhesive sensors with conductive gels. 
 the soft and conformable monitor can broadcast electrocardiogram (ecg), heart rate, respiratory rate and motion activity data as much as 15 meters to a portable recording device such as a smartphone or tablet computer. the electronics are mounted on a stretchable substrate and connected to gold, skin-like electrodes through printed connectors that can stretch with the medical film in which they are embedded. 
 ""this health monitor has a key advantage for young children who are always moving, since the soft conformal device can accommodate that activity with a gentle integration onto the skin,"" said 
 woon-hong yeo , an assistant professor in the 
 george w. woodruff school of mechanical engineering 
 and 
 wallace h. coulter department of biomedical engineering at the georgia institute of technology . ""this is designed to meet the electronic health monitoring needs of people whose sensitive skin may be harmed by conventional monitors."" 
 details of the monitor were reported july 24 in the journal 
 advanced science . the research was supported by the imlay innovation fund at children's healthcare of atlanta, nextflex (flexible hybrid electronics manufacturing institute), and by a seed grant from the institute for electronics and nanotechnology at georgia tech. the monitor has been studied on both animal models and humans. 
 because the device conforms to the skin, it avoids signal issues that can be created by the motion of the typical metal-gel electrodes across the skin. the device can even obtain accurate signals from a person who is walking, running or climbing stairs. 
 ""when you put a conventional electrode on the chest, movement from sitting up or walking creates motion artifacts that are challenging to separate from the signals you want to measure,"" he said. ""because our device is soft and conformal, it moves with the skin and provides information that cannot be seen with the motion artifacts of conventional sensors."" 
 continuous evaluation with a wireless health monitor could improve the assessment of children and help clinicians identify trends earlier, potentially facilitating intervention before a condition progresses, said dr. kevin maher, a pediatric cardiologist at 
 children's healthcare of atlanta . 
 ""the generation of continuous data from the respiratory and cardiovascular systems could allow for the application of advanced diagnostics to detect changes in clinical status, response to therapies and implementation of early intervention,"" maher said. ""a device to literally follow every breath a child takes could allow for early recognition and intervention prior to a more severe presentation of a disease."" 
 used in the home, a wearable monitor might detect changes that might not otherwise be apparent, he said. in clinical settings, the wireless device could allow children to feel less ""tethered"" to equipment. ""i see this device as a significant change in pediatric health care and am excited to partner with georgia tech on the project,"" maher added. 
 the monitor uses three gold electrodes embedded in the film that also contains the electronic processing equipment. the entire health monitor is just three inches in diameter, and a more advanced version under development will be half that size. the wireless monitor is now powered by a small rechargeable battery, but future versions may replace the battery with an external radio-frequency charging system. 
 yeo and his collaborators, including first author and postdoctoral fellow yun-soung kim, are focusing on pediatric applications because of the need for ambulatory monitoring in children. however, they envision that the health monitor could also be used for other patient groups, including older adults who may also have sensitive skin. for adults, there would be additional advantages. 
 ""the monitor could be worn for multiple days, perhaps for as long as two weeks,"" yeo said. ""the membrane is waterproof, so an adult could take a shower while wearing it. after use, the electronic components can be recycled."" 
 two versions of the monitor have been developed. one is based on medical tape and designed for short-term use in a hospital or other care facility, while the other uses a soft elastomer medical film approved for use in wound care. the latter can remain on the skin longer. 
 ""the devices are completely dry and do not require a gel to pick up signals from the skin,"" yeo explained. ""there is nothing between the skin and the ultrathin sensor, so it is comfortable to wear."" 
 because the monitor can be worn for long periods of time, it can provide a long-term record of ecg data helpful to understanding potential heart problems. ""we use deep learning to monitor the signals while comparing them to data from a larger group of patients,"" yeo said. ""if an abnormality is detected, it can be reported wirelessly through a smartphone or other connected device."" 
 fabrication of the monitor's circuitry uses thin-film, mesh-like patterns of copper that can flex with the soft substrate. the chips are the only part not flexible, but they are mounted on the strain-isolated soft substrate instead of a traditional plastic circuit board. 
 as next steps, yeo plans to reduce the size of the device and add features to measure other health-related parameters such as temperature, blood oxygen and blood pressure. a major milestone would be a clinical trial to evaluate performance against conventional health monitors. 
 for yeo, who specializes in nano- and micro-engineering, the prospect of seeing the device in clinical trials - and ultimately used in children's hospitals - is a powerful incentive. 
 ""it will be a dream come true for me to see something we have developed be helpful to someone who is suffering,"" he said. ""we all want to see developments in science and engineering translated into improved patient care."" 
 in addition to those already mentioned, paper coauthors included robert herbert, shinjae kwon, and musa mahmood from georgia tech; yongkuk lee from wichita state university; nam kyun kim and hee cheol cho from emory university; and donghyun kim from yonsei university wonju college of medicine in south korea.

 researchers have developed a new type of low-temperature fuel cell that directly converts biomass to electricity with assistance from a catalyst activated by solar or thermal energy. 
 a new solar-induced direct biomass-to-electricity hybrid fuel cell can operate on fuels as varied as powdered wood. the fuel cell, shown on the right, relies on a polyoxometalate (pom) catalyst (shown in the vials) which changes color as it reacts with light. (georgia tech photo: john toon)

 although low temperature fuel cells powered by methanol or hydrogen have been well studied, existing low temperature fuel cell technologies cannot directly use biomass as a fuel because of the lack of an effective catalyst system for polymeric materials. now, researchers at the georgia institute of technology have developed a new type of low-temperature fuel cell that directly converts biomass to electricity with assistance from a catalyst activated by solar or thermal energy. the hybrid fuel cell can use a wide variety of biomass sources, including starch, cellulose, lignin - and even switchgrass, powdered wood, algae and waste from poultry processing. the device could be used in small-scale units to provide electricity for developing nations, as well as for larger facilities to provide power where significant quantities of biomass are available. ""we have developed a new method that can handle the biomass at room temperature, and the type of biomass that can be used is not restricted - the process can handle nearly any type of biomass,"" said 
 yulin deng , a professor in georgia tech's 
 school of chemical and biomolecular engineering 
 and the 
 institute of paper science and technology 
 (ipst). ""this is a very generic approach to utilizing many kinds of biomass and organic waste to produce electrical power without the need for purification of the starting materials."" the new solar-induced direct biomass-to-electricity hybrid fuel cell was described february 7, 2014, in the journal 
 nature communications . the challenge for biomass fuel cells is that the carbon-carbon bonds of the biomass - a natural polymer - cannot be easily broken down by conventional catalysts, including expensive precious metals, deng noted. to overcome that challenge, scientists have developed microbial fuel cells in which microbes or enzymes break down the biomass. but that process has many drawbacks: power output from such cells is limited, microbes or enzymes can only selectively break down certain types of biomass, and the microbial system can be deactivated by many factors. deng and his research team got around those challenges by altering the chemistry to allow an outside energy source to activate the fuel cell's oxidation-reduction reaction. in the new system, the biomass is ground up and mixed with a polyoxometalate (pom) catalyst in solution and then exposed to light from the sun - or heat. a photochemical and thermochemical catalyst, pom functions as both an oxidation agent and a charge carrier. pom oxidizes the biomass under photo or thermal irradiation, and delivers the charges from the biomass to the fuel cell's anode. the electrons are then transported to the cathode, where they are finally oxidized by oxygen through an external circuit to produce electricity. ""if you mix the biomass and catalyst at room temperature, they will not react,"" said deng. ""but when you expose them to light or heat, the reaction begins. the pom introduces an intermediate step because biomass cannot be directly accessed by oxygen."" the system provides major advantages, including combining the photochemical and solar-thermal biomass degradation in a single chemical process, leading to high solar conversion and effective biomass degradation. it also does not use expensive noble metals as anode catalysts because the fuel oxidation reactions are catalyzed by the pom in solution. finally, because the pom is chemically stable, the hybrid fuel cell can use unpurified polymeric biomass without concern for poisoning noble metal anodes. the system can use soluble biomass, or organic materials suspended in a liquid. in experiments, the fuel cell operated for as long as 20 hours, indicating that the pom catalyst can be re-used without further treatment. in their paper, the researchers reported a maximum power density of 0.72 milliwatts per square centimeter, which is nearly 100 times higher than cellulose-based microbial fuel cells, and near that of the best microbial fuel cells. deng believes the output can be increased five to ten times when the process is optimized. ""i believe this type of fuel cell could have an energy output similar to that of methanol fuel cells in the future,"" he said. ""to optimize the system, we need to have a better understanding of the chemical processes involved and how to improve them."" the researchers also need to compare operation of the system with solar energy and other forms of input energy, such as waste heat from other processes. beyond the ability to directly use biomass as a fuel, the new cell also offers advantages in sustainability - and potentially lower cost compared to other fuel cell types. ""we can use sustainable materials without any chemical pollution,"" deng said. ""solar energy and biomass are two important sustainable energy sources available to the world today. our system would use them together to produce electricity while reducing dependence on fossil fuels."" in addition to deng, the research team included wei liu, wei mu, mengjie liu, xiaodan zhang and hongli cai, all from the school of chemical and biomolecular engineering or the institute of paper science and technology at georgia tech. citation : wei liu, et al., ""solar-induced direct biomass-to-electricity hybrid fuel cell using polyoxometalates as photocatalyst and charge carrier,"" (nature communications, 2014).

 solving a 75-year-old mystery could provide a new way to produce farm fertilizer. 
 titanium dioxide, also known as titania, has photocatalytic properties that allow it to react with nitrogen. (credit: rob felt, georgia tech) 
 nov 27, 2018 
 - atlanta, ga 
 the solution to a 75-year-old materials mystery might one day allow farmers in developing nations to produce their own fertilizer on demand, using sunlight and nitrogen from the air. 
 thanks to a specialized x-ray source at 
 lawrence berkeley national laboratory , researchers at the georgia institute of technology have confirmed the existence of a long-hypothesized interaction between nitrogen and titanium dioxide (tio 2 ) - a common photoactive material also known as titania - in the presence of light. the catalytic reaction is believed to use carbon atoms found as contaminants on the titania. 
 if the nitrogen-fixing reaction can be scaled up, it might one day help power clean farm-scale fertilizer production that could reduce dependence on capital-intensive centralized production facilities and costly distribution systems that drive up costs for farmers in isolated areas of the world. most of the world's fertilizer is now made using ammonia produced by the haber-bosch process, which requires large amounts of natural gas. 
 ""in the united states, we have an excellent production and distribution system for fertilizer. however, many countries are not able to afford to build haber-bosch plants, and may not even have adequate transportation infrastructure to import fertilizers. for these regions, photocatalytic nitrogen fixation might be useful for on-demand fertilizer production,"" said 
 marta hatzell , an assistant professor in georgia tech's 
 woodruff school of mechanical engineering . ""ultimately, this might be a low-cost process that could make fertilizer-based nutrients available to a broader array of farmers."" 
 hatzell and collaborator 
 andrew medford , an assistant professor in georgia tech's 
 school of chemical and biomolecular engineering , are working with scientists at the international fertilizer development center (ifdc) to study the potential impacts of the reaction process. the research was reported october 29 in the 
 journal of the american chemical society . 
 the research began more than two years ago when hatzell and medford began collaborating on a materials mystery that originated with a 1941 paper published by seshacharyulu dhar, an indian soil scientist who reported observing an increase in ammonia emitted from compost subjected to light. dhar suggested that a photocatalytic reaction with minerals in the compost could be responsible for the ammonia. 
 since that paper, other researchers have reported nitrogen fixation on titania and ammonia production, but the results have not been consistently confirmed experimentally. 
 medford, a theoretician, worked with graduate research assistant benjamin comer to model the chemical pathways that would be needed to fix nitrogen on titania to potentially create ammonia using additional reactions. the calculations suggested the proposed process was highly unlikely on pure titania, and the researchers failed to win a grant they had proposed to use to study the mysterious process. however, they were awarded experimental time on the 
 advanced light source 
 at the u.s. department of energy's lawrence berkeley national laboratory, which allowed them to finally test a key component of the hypothesis. 
 specialized equipment at the lab allowed hatzell and graduate student yu-hsuan liu to use x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (xps) to examine the surface of titania as nitrogen, water and oxygen interacted with the surfaces under near-ambient pressure in the dark and in the light. at first, the researchers saw no photochemical nitrogen fixation, but as the experiments continued, they observed a unique interaction between nitrogen and titania when light was directed at the minerals surface. 
 what accounted for the initial lack of results? hatzell and medford believe that surface contamination with carbon - likely from a hydrocarbon - is a necessary part of the catalytic process for nitrogen reduction on the titania. ""prior to testing, the samples are cleaned to remove nearly all the trace carbon from the surface, however during experiments carbon from various sources (gases and the vacuum chamber) can introduce trace amount of carbon back onto the sample,"" hatzell explained. ""what we observed was that reduced nitrogen species only were detected if there was a degree of carbon on the sample."" 
 the hydrocarbon contamination hypothesis would explain why earlier research had provided inconsistent results. carbon is always present at trace levels on titania, but getting the right amount and type may be key to making the hypothesized reaction work. 
 ""we think this explains the puzzling results that had been reported in the literature, and we hope it gives insights into how to engineer new catalysts using this 75-year-old mystery,"" medford said. ""often the best catalysts are materials that are very pristine and made in a clean room. here you have just the opposite - this reaction actually needs the impurities, which could be beneficial for sustainable applications in farming."" 
 the researchers hope to experimentally confirm the role of carbon with upcoming tests at pacific northwest national laboratory (pnnl), which will allow them to directly probe the carbon during the photocatalytic nitrogen fixation process. they also hope to learn more about the catalytic mechanism so that they can better control the reaction to improve efficiency, which is currently less than one percent. 
 the research reported in the journal did not measure ammonia, but hatzell and her students have since detected it in lab scale tests. because the ammonia is currently produced at such low levels, the researchers had to take precautions to avoid ammonia-based contamination. ""even tape used on equipment can create small quantities of ammonia that can affect the measurements,"" medford added. 
 though the amounts of ammonia produced by the reaction are currently low, hatzell and medford believe that with process improvements, the advantages of on-site fertilizer production under benign conditions could overcome that limitation. 
 ""while this may sound ridiculous from a practical perspective at first, if you actually look at the needs of the problem and the fact that sunlight and nitrogen from the air are free, on a cost basis it starts to look more interesting,"" medford said. ""if you could operate a small-scale ammonia production facility with enough capacity for one farm, you have immediately made a difference."" 
 hatzell credits cutting-edge surface science with finally providing an explanation to the mystery. 
 ""since earlier investigators looked at this, there have been significant advances made in the area of measurement and surface science,"" she said. ""most surface science measurements require the use of ultra-high vacuum conditions which do not mimic the catalytic environment you aim to investigate. the near ambient pressure xps at lawrence berkeley national lab, allowed us to take a step closer to observing this reaction in its native environment."" 
 the research was supported by startup funds from georgia tech to hatzell and medford, and by georgia tech's serve-learn-sustain initiative. the effort also received a boost from georgia tech's technological innovation: generating economic results (ti:ger®) program, which supported research into potential stakeholders for scale-up of the process. 
 in addition to those already mentioned, the research included marm b. dixit and kelsey b. hatzell from vanderbilt university and yifan ye and ethan j. crumlin from lawrence berkeley laboratory. 
 this research used resources of the advanced light source, which is a doe office of science user facility under contract number de-ac02-05ch11231.

spiral-wave-teleportation-theory-offers-new-path-defibrillate-hearts-terminate.txt,"spiral wave teleportation theory offers new path to defibrillate hearts, terminate arrhythmias 
 researchers from the georgia institute of technology offer a new method to disrupt spiral waves that uses less energy and that may be less painful than traditional defibrillation. 
 jun 23, 2022 
 - atlanta, ga 
 a spiral wave of electrical activity in the heart can cause catastrophic consequences. one spiral wave creates tachycardia - a heart rate that's too fast - and multiple spirals cause a state of disorganized contraction known as fibrillation. researchers from the georgia institute of technology offer a new method to disrupt spiral waves that uses less energy and that may be less painful than traditional defibrillation. 
 this research has been ongoing in 
 school of physics 
 professor 
 flavio fenton's 
 lab with his student noah detal and research scientist abouzar kaboudian. their latest findings are published in the paper, "" terminating spiral waves with a single designed stimulus: teleportation as the mechanism for defibrillation,"" 
 in the journal 
 proceedings of the national academy of science . 
 the problem with spiral waves 
 electrical waves enable the heart to contract and send blood throughout the body. when a wave becomes a spiral, its rotation is faster than the heart's natural pacemaker and suppresses normal cardiac function. instead, one spiral wave can spawn more spirals until the heart is overtaken by multiple spiral waves, leading to disorganized contraction, and preventing the heart from supplying the body with blood. 
 for years, scientists and doctors have worked to find the best way to stop spiral waves before they get out of control. yet for over half a century the best method has been a single strong electric shock. the 300 joules of energy required for defibrillation excites not just the heart cells, but the entire body, making it very painful for the patient. 
 over the years researchers have experimented with using weaker shocks to reorganize arrythmias. 
 ""we still did not have a clear understanding of how defibrillation worked,"" said fenton. ""this research explains the minimum energy required to actually terminate an arrhythmia and i believe it clarifies the mechanism for defibrillation."" 
 the symmetrical solution 
 the researchers determined that because spiral waves develop in pairs, they must also be terminated in pairs. every spiral wave is connected to another spiral going in the opposite direction. bringing the spiral waves together through an electric shock instantly eliminates both waves. 
 the researchers used a mathematical method to identify the key regions for electrical shock stimulation to target spiral waves. they determined that a stimulus delivered to the tissue areas a spiral wave just left and were able sustain a new wave could defibrillate the heart. 
 in the process of terminating the spiral waves, the researchers were actually moving them, as well, through a concept they named ""teleportation."" 
 ""we call it teleportation because it's very similar to what you see in science fiction where something is moved instantaneously from one place to another,"" fenton said. 
 spiral waves can be teleported anywhere in the heart using this approach. in particular, spiral waves can be moved so that they collide with their partners, which extinguishes them. fenton explained that for successful defibrillation to occur, all pairs of spiral waves must be eliminated in this manner. 
 the researchers plan to further test this concept using two-dimensional cultures of heart cells. 
 ""the next step is to is to prove experimentally that what we did numerically is possible,"" fenton said. 
 eventually, fenton added, they want to develop methods that could be used clinically, and are partnering with cardiologists at emory university on this work.

 strong experimental indications of a rare quantum phenomenon could open doors into understanding the mystery of matter.

 - atlanta, ga 
 inside a new exotic crystal, physicist martin mourigal has observed strong indications of ""spooky"" action, and lots of it. 
 the results of his experiments , if corroborated over time, would mean that the type of crystal is a rare new material that can produce a quantum spin liquid. 
 currently, only a small handful of materials are believed to possibly have these properties. this new crystal was synthesized for the first time only a year ago. corroboration by other physicists of mourigal's newly produced experimental data could take a decade or more. 
 confused? meet quantum physics 
 a ""liquid"" found inside a solid object may sound confusing to many people. 
 welcome to quantum materials, part of the twilight zone called quantum physics, which scientists have been struggling for a century to grasp a nanometer at a time, and where they use terms like ""liquid"" and ""solid"" to mean things other than water and rocks. though much about it is yet undiscovered, quantum physics describes the underlying reality of matter. 
 computers, smart phones, superconductors and mri machines are engineered from it. but its laws about the atomic realm defy human perception of what is real, and some sound so preposterous that they have become popular science brain teasers. 
 ‘spooky' entanglement bonanza 
 take quantum entanglement, the core of mourigal's research on the apparent spin liquid in the crystal: if two particles, electrons, for example, become entangled, they can be physically separated by many miles, and still be intimately linked to one another. actions applied to one particle then instantaneously effect the other. 
 at first, this theory was too odd even for the father of relativity, albert einstein, 
 who lampooned it 
 as ""spooky action at a distance."" 
 entanglement has since been proven in experiments, but now scientists like 
 mourigal, an experimental physicist at the georgia institute of technology , and his team, have taken it much farther. the synthetic crystal he has examined, an ytterbium compound with the formula ybmggao 4 , is likely brimming with observable ‘spooky' connections. 
 ""imagine a state of matter where this entanglement doesn't involve two electrons but involves, three, five, 10 or 10 billion particles all in the same system,"" mourigal said. ""you can create a very, very exotic state of matter based on the fact that all these particles are entangled with each other. there are no individual particles anymore, but one huge electron ensemble acting collectively."" 
 mourigal, 
 former postdoctoral fellow joseph paddison 
 and graduate student 
 marcus daum 
 published their observations 
 in the journal 
 nature physics 
 on monday, december 5, 2016. they collaborated with colleagues at the university of tennessee and oak ridge national laboratory. work was funded by the national science foundation and the u.s. department of energy. 
 quantum computing dreams 
 this massive ""spooky"" entanglement makes a system of electrons a quantum spin ""liquid."" the term is not meant in the everyday sense, as in water. here, it describes the collective nature of electrons' spins in the crystal. 
 ""in a spin ‘liquid,' the directions of the spins are not tidily aligned, but frenzied, although the spins are interconnected, whereas in a spin ‘solid' the spin directions have a neat organization,"" mourigal said. 
 if the discovery stands, it could open a door to hundreds of yet unknown quantum spin liquid materials that physicists say must exist according to theory and mathematical equations. in the distant future, new quantum materials could become, by today's standards, veritable sorcerer's stones in quantum computing engineers' hands. 
 beijing's ytterbium crystal success? 
 the ytterbium crystal was first synthesized a year ago 
 by scientists in china , where the government in beijing has invested heavily in hopes of creating synthetic quantum materials with novel properties. it appears they may have now succeeded, said mourigal, an assistant professor at 
 georgia tech's school of physics . 
 one of the only previously observed apparent quantum spin liquids occurs in a natural crystal called 
 herbertsmithite, an emerald green stone found in 1972 
 in a mine in chile. it was named after mineralogist herbert smith, who died nearly 20 years prior to the discovery. 
 researchers 
 observed its apparent spin liquid nature in 2012 
 after massachusetts institute of technology scientists succeeded at reproducing a purified piece of the crystal in their lab. 
 encyclopedia of spin liquids 
 that initial discovery was just the beginning of an odyssey. because of its chemical makeup, herbertsmithite produces just one single entanglement scheme. physics math says there must be myriads more. 
 ""finding herbertsmithite was like saying, ‘animals exist.' but there are so many different species of animals, or mammals, or fish, reptiles and birds,"" mourigal said. ""now that we have found one, we are looking for different kinds of spin liquids."" 
 the more spin liquids experimental physicists confirm, the more theoretical physicists will be able to use them to bend their minds around quantum physics. ""it's important to create the encyclopedia of them,"" mourigal said. ""this new crystal may be only our second or third entry."" 
 what neutron scattering revealed 
 physicists from the university of tennessee 
 succeeded in replicating the original ytterbium crystal, and mourigal examined it at 
 oak ridge national laboratory (ornl), 
 where it was cooled down to a temperature of -273.09 degrees celsius (0.06 degrees kelvin). 
 the cooling slowed the natural motion of the atoms to a near stop, which allowed the researchers to observe the electron spins' dance around the ytterbium (yb) atoms in the ybmggao 4 
 crystal. they used a powerful superconducting magnet to line the spins up in an orderly fashion to create a starting point for their observations. 
 ""then we removed the magnetic field, and let them go back to their special kind of wiggling,"" mourigal said. his team carried out the observations at the 
 ornl spallation neutron source , a department of energy office of science user facility. the sns has about the power and size of a particle supercollider, and allowed the scientists to watch the concert of electrons' spins by bombarding them with neutrons. 
 normally, when one electron flips its spin, researchers would expect it to create a neat chain reaction, resulting in a wave going through the crystal. the wave of electron spins flipping in sequence might look something like fans at a football game standing and sitting back down to make a wave go around the stadium. 
 but something odd happened. ""this jumbly kind of spin wave broke down into many other waves, because everything is collective, everything is entangled,"" mourigal said. ""it was a continuum of excitations, but breaking down across many electrons at once."" 
 it was qualitatively similar to what was observed using the same technique on herbertsmithite. 
 nobel prize topology donut 
 to authenticate the observations made by mourigal's team, theoretical physicists will have to crunch the data with methods that, in part, rely on topology,  a focus of the 2016 nobel prize in physics . mourigal thinks chances are they will pass muster. ""at first glance, this material is screaming, ‘i'm a quantum spin liquid,'"" he said. 
 but it must undergo a years-long battery of stringent mathematical tests. the theoretical physicists will wrap the data around a mathematical ""donut"" to confirm whether or not it is a quantum spin liquid. 
 ""that's meant seriously,"" mourigal said. ""as a mathematical mental exercise, they virtually spread the spin liquid around a donut shape, and the way it responds to being on a donut tells you something about the nature of that spin liquid."" 
 though entangled particles appear to defy space and time, the shape of space they occupy affects the nature of the entanglement pattern. 
 the possibility of a quantum spin liquid was first demonstrated in the 1930s, but only using atoms placed in a straight line. physicists have been searching in the decades since for materials containing them. 
 zhiling dun and haidong zhou from the university of tennessee, and georg ehlers, yaohua liu and matthew stone from oak ridge national laboratory coauthored the paper ( 10.1038 / nphys3971) . reproduction of the ytterbium crystal at ut was funded by a national science foundation grant (dmr-1350002). ornl, which provided the neutron scattering is part of the u.s. department of energy.

 adapted from 
 georgia tech research horizons . 
 medical devices often require sophisticated biointerfaces for biocompatibility and biofunctions 
 in situ 
 and 
 in vivo . polymer brushes are a class of biomaterials that have been used in a range of applications such as sensors, drug delivery, and implants. in these applications and many others, such polymers are usually desired in high density at the interface, which typically requires synthesizing and growing the biopolymers from the surface. unfortunately, few methodologies exist for the synthetic catalysis of 
 natural 
 biopolymers from surfaces, and natural biopolymers are often desirable for biomaterials applications to improve biocompatibility and provide natural functions. overcoming these barriers is part of new work reported from the labs of smi professor jennifer curtis (school of physics), which introduces a versatile platform to grow ultra-thick (100 times the usual length), dense hyaluronan (ha) polymer brushes from surfaces. this new method for growing ha brushes provides a path to improved biocompatibility and dynamic control of biointerfaces that potentially can be grown 
 in vivo 
 or regenerated after wear. 
 in professor curtis's group, a lab goof with an enzyme taken from bacteria led to the creation of the leviathan polymer brushes. ""we were putting the enzyme onto a surface to observe it for a totally different experiment, but we put too much on the surface too densely, and - boom - we ended up with the thickest, longest polymer brush we'd ever seen or heard of,"" said jennifer curtis, who led the study and is  an associate professor in georgia tech's school of physics . ""they were so big you could actually see them under an optical microscope instead of having to feel them with an  atomic force microscope  or use other methods needed for more customary polymer brushes."" 
 the researchers diverted attention from the original study to pursue the freakishly large new brush. 
 to bacteria encroaching on them, the brush's bristles are a virtually impenetrable, squishy thicket that keeps microbes out in lab observations. it hinders the spread of biofilms, bacterial colonies that join together to form a tough material that makes killing the bacteria difficult. 
 biofilm bulwark 
 ""the human immune system has a hard time with biofilms. antibiotics don't work very well on them either. in water filtration, biofilms can stick tenaciously, too. if you have a hyaluronan brush on a surface, a biofilm can't stick to it,"" curtis said. 
 hyaluronan, the compound in the bristles, is a polysaccharide, a chain of sugar molecules, and is naturally widespread in and around our cells. it is also known to many from its use in cosmetic moisturizers. 
 the enzyme that makes the hyaluronan bristles on the brush is  hyaluronan synthase , and it circumvents more tedious chemical synthesis by effortlessly extruding extremely long bristles. the enzymes also can replace bristles when they break off, something chemically synthesized brushes cannot do, which limits those brushes' durability. still, use of the synthase is unorthodox. 
 ""brush people say, ‘what are these enzymes doing here?' because they're looking for chemistry, and biologists wonder what the brush has to do with biology,"" curtis said. 
 the team published  the new study,  self-regenerating giant hyaluronan polymer  brushes,  in the journal  nature communications  in december 2019 . the research was funded by the national science foundation. 
 engineered  e. coli 
 the researchers engineered bacteria to overabundantly produce the enzyme by inserting hyaluronan synthase genes from the bacteria  streptococcus equisimilis  into  e. coli  then they harvested the enzyme. 
 ""we shattered the bacteria into a bunch of non-living gooey fragments then adhered their membrane to surfaces, and the synthase extruded the brushes,"" curtis said. 
 the enzymes can be switched on and off, and adjusting salt concentration or ph in the solution around the brushes makes the bristles extend to a straight form or curl up into a retracted form. functional additives like antibacterials could be embedded in brushes. 
 something like a catheter could conceivably one day be coated with brushes to remain bacteria-free, and the thickness of the wiggly brushes would also act as a lubricant by preventing frictive contact with the surface beneath them. some human cells key to the healing process are actually able to sink through the bristles, which could have potential for medicine. 
 ""for a chronic wound that won't heal, you may be able to design a bandage that encourages new cell growth but keeps bacteria out,"" curtis said. 
 biophysics research 
 the researchers' fortuitous detour into the giant brush has expanded possibilities for their original intent of studying enzymatic hyaluronan in isolation. 
 ""we constantly deal with the coupling of biochemistry, chemical signaling, and mechanics, so having something that isolates the mechanics from the signaling so we can focus on just the mechanics is really useful,"" curtis said. 
 wenbin wei and jessica faubel of georgia tech were the study's first authors. these researchers co-authored the study: hemaa selvakumar, daniel t. kovari, joanna tsao, amar t. mohabir, michelle krecker, and michael a. filler from georgia tech; felipe rivas, elaheh rahbar, and adam hall from the virginia tech-wake forest university school of biomedical engineering and sciences; and jennifer washburn and paul weigel from the university of oklahoma. the research was funded by the national science foundation (grants # 0955811, 1709897 and 1205878). any findings, conclusions, and recommendations are those of the authors and not necessarily of the national science foundation.

 this weekend, emily rowe will graduate alongside her fiancé, who she met on the day of the 2017 solar eclipse - which also happened to be the first day of their first year at tech. 
 rowe is a business administration major concentrating in supply chain management. the tech white and gold colors have long been beloved by her family. both her father and older brother  graduated from georgia tech, and her twin brother will follow in their footsteps in december. 
 during her time here, rowe loved sports, the yellow jacket marching band, and cherished tech traditions. growing up, she'd go to football games and cheer with her family but as a student she stood side by side with the marching band. the tight-knit community provided some of her favorite memories of her college experience. 
 once elected as the rat dad of the band, a marching band tradition where the elected members provide assistance to first-years in acclimating to tech and the band, rowe was in charge of new students and helped pass on her knowledge. after running for it every year since her first year, she was finally elected last may. 
 ""knowing that the band trusted me to take on such an important position has been really nice and it's been a great time to get to know all of the new members."" 
 apart from her extracurricular activities and classes, emily began dating matthew leonard, who is also part of the marching band. she likes to say, ""the stars crossed the day that we met,"" because of the eclipse. their paths didn't cross during marching band camp, but after meeting that day, their paths aligned. they will be getting married in july. 
 with a job lined up after graduation and a new chapter waiting, emily's piece of advice for current students is to seek out internships and co-ops. ""these longer times with a company are valuable,"" she said. i ended up spending the pandemic tracking toilet paper production for georgia-pacific, something i definitely hadn't anticipated when i started my internship in january.""

 startup summer 
 program in 2014, sponsored a capstone team to work on a keyless entry to vending machines. it is designed to retrofit existing vending machines and replace the existing mechanical cylinder lock, said cory hewett, the company's ceo. the company introduced hardware and an app to make vending machine operations more efficient for owners. gimme vending won this year's annual tag business launch competition, which is sponsored in part by the technology association of georgia. hewett studied electrical engineering at tech and attended class with some members of the capstone team. he was already familiar with their strong work ethic and problem-solving skills ""it's been great working with them, not just for me, but for our whole team,"" hewett said. ""because of our size, it is very important that our core team focuses singularly on our current product offering. the capstone team is a huge help because they can work independently to help gimme build brand new technology without any split on our focus.""

 georgia's film industry has experienced exponential growth for more than 10 years, making the state one of the top filming locations in the industry. in fiscal year 2021, georgia hosted 366 film productions including 21 feature films, 45 independent films, 222 television series, 57 commercials, and 21 music videos, resulting in a record $4 billion invested in the state by the film industry. 
 savannah has captured a significant amount of production-related activity in georgia. however, a shortage of purpose-built, scalable soundstages and production facilities has hindered the region's ability to support this economic growth. subject to approval from the university system of georgia (usg) board of regents, the redevelopment of the current 52-acre georgia tech-savannah campus and adjacent property owned by the savannah economic development authority (seda) will provide much needed high-tech facilities to further attract industry and support local workforce development. furthermore, the project aims to identify programs and initiatives to facilitate diversity, equity, and inclusion in both procurement and staffing - in addition to demonstrating sustainability in design and construction. 
 this project is a collaborative effort between the usg board of regents, georgia film academy, seda, and gatv. currently, georgia tech's savannah campus occupies a portion of the land and anticipates relocating its programs to the downtown savannah area as the project moves forward. 
 ""the georgia film academy is delighted to be a part of this project, which will advance film and television production in the savannah region and provide good long-term jobs for the georgians we are committed to serving,"" said jeffrey stepakoff, executive director of the georgia film academy. ""students we will train from the state's universities and technical colleges in the region will be ready to provide the sustainable workforce that this new world-class production hub will need."" 
 it is anticipated that redevelopment of the land to create this production hub will begin in 2022. plans are to build out several soundstages, multiple production and workforce training facilities, as well as industry and vendor accommodations.

states-can-lower-electric-bills-clean-power-plan.txt,"states can lower electric bills with clean power plan 
 georgia tech identified least-cost clean power pathways that would lower household electricity bills and reduce carbon pollution. 
 jul 27, 2015 
 - atlanta, ga 
 the u.s. electric system faces an array of challenges. sluggish demand growth and the rise of solar power challenge the ability of utilities to recover their costs. the digital economy requires reliable power quality, and growing cyber threats call for increased investments in grid security. on top of these issues, global climate disruption suggests that energy systems need to be transformed. as a result, most forecasts predict that electricity bills will rise significantly over the next several decades. in response to these issues, researchers from the georgia institute of technology examined options for the power industry's future. the report released monday will ""help states define their preferred approach for complying with proposed carbon pollution regulations,"" said marilyn brown, the project's lead investigator and the brook byers professor of sustainable systems in the school of public policy. the report, "" low-carbon electricity pathways for the u.s. and the south ,"" examines two key issues: how states can reduce carbon pollution in the most cost-effective way and how different options impact household electricity bills. ""to minimize costs, the south needs to reduce its coal consumption more rapidly, continue to expand its gas-fired power plants, but temper this growth with aggressive policies to increase energy efficiency and renewable energy,"" brown said. the project took a turn when last year, the u.s. environmental protection agency proposed the first ever carbon pollution standards for existing power plants (known as the clean power plan). since states have considerable latitude to define their preferred response, they are vigorously debating the pros and cons of different options. using state-of-the-art modeling, georgia tech identified least-cost clean power pathways that would lower household electricity bills and reduce carbon pollution. this combination may not seem intuitive to some, but it is good news for states across the south and the nation. ""this work provides the type of analytic basis that is needed to inform policymaking and will guide the future of the power industry for decades,"" said tim lieuwen, director of the strategic energy institute at georgia tech. ""georgia tech plays an important role as honest broker in national policy discussions, and we will continue to support decision makers through these types of analyses.""

stem-cell-treatment-may-restore-vision-patients-damaged-corneas.txt,"stem cell treatment may restore vision to patients with damaged corneas 
 a new cell sorting technique may help restore vision for persons with damaged corneas.

 - atlanta, ga 
 researchers working as part of the university of georgia's regenerative bioscience center have developed a new way to identify and sort stem cells that may one day allow clinicians to restore vision to people with damaged corneas using the patient's own eye tissue. they published their findings in 
 biophysical journal . 
 the cornea is a transparent layer of tissue covering the front of the eye, and its health is maintained by a group of cells called limbal stem cells. but when these cells are damaged by trauma or disease, the cornea loses its ability to self-repair. 
 ""damage to the limbus, which is where the clear part of the eye meets the white part of the eye, can cause the cornea to break down very rapidly,"" said james lauderdale, an associate professor of cellular biology in uga's franklin college of arts and sciences and paper co-author. ""the only way to repair the cornea right now is do a limbal cell transplant from donated tissue."" 
 in their study, researchers used a new type of highly sensitive atomic force microscopy, or afm, to analyze eye cell cultures. created by 
 todd sulchek , an associate professor in the 
 george w. woodruff school of mechanical engineering 
 at georgia tech, the technique allowed researchers to probe and exert force on individual cells to learn more about the cell's overall health and its ability to turn into different types of mature cells. 
 they found that limbal stem cells were softer and more pliable than other cells, meaning they could use this simple measure as a rapid and cost-effective way to identify cells from a patient's own tissue that are suitable for transplantation. 
 ""todd's technology is unique in the tiniest and most sensitive detection to change,"" said lauderdale. ""just think about trying to gently dimple or prod the top of an individual cell without killing it; with conventional afm it's close to impossible."" 
 building on their findings related to cell softness, the research team also developed a microfluidic cell sorting device capable of filtering out specific cells from a tissue sample. 
 with this device, the team can collect the patient's own tissue, sort and culture the cells and then place them back into the patient all in one day, said lauderdale. it can take weeks to perform this task using conventional methods. 
 the researchers are quick to caution that more tests must be done before this technique is used in human patients, but it may one day serve as a viable treatment for the more than 1 million americans that lose their vision to damaged corneas every year. 
 the group first started this research with the hope of helping children with aniridia, an inherited malformation of the eye that leads to breakdown of the cornea at an early age. 
 because aniridia affects only one in 60,000 children, few organizations are willing to commit the resources necessary to combat the disease, lauderdale said. 
 ""our first goal in working with such a rare disease was to help this small population of children, because we feel a close connection to all of them,"" said lauderdale, who has worked with aniridia patients for many years. ""however, at the end of the day this technology could help hundreds of thousands of people, like the military who are also interested in corneal damage, common in desert conditions."" 
 steven stice, a georgia research alliance eminent scholar who plays an important role in fostering cross-interdisciplinary collaboration as director of the rbc, initially brought the researchers together and encouraged a seed grant application through the center for regenerative engineering and medicine, or rem, a joint collaboration between emory university, georgia tech and uga. 
 ""a culture is developing around seed funding that is all about interdisciplinary collaboration, sharing of resources, and coming together to make things happen,"" said stice. ""government funding agencies place a high premium on combining skills and disciplines. we can no longer afford to work in an isolated laboratory using a singular approach."" 
 the rem seed funding program is intended to stimulate new, unconventional collaborative research and requires equal partnership of faculty from two of the participating institutions. 
 ""we tend to get siloed experimentally,"" said lauderdale. ""to a biologist like me, all cells are very different and all atomic force microscopes are the same. to an engineer like todd it's just the opposite."" 
 the study, ""cellular stiffness as a novel stemness marker in the corneal limbus,"" is available at http: / / www.cell.com / biophysj / fulltext / s0006-3495(16)30771-8. 
 funding was provided by an nih nigms biotechnology training grant on cell and tissue engineering, the knights templar eye foundation, the center for regenerative engineering and medicine, the sharon stewart aniridia research trust and the nsf cmmi division.

 researchers at the georgia institute of technology have developed a promising new cathode and electrolyte system that replaces expensive metals and traditional liquid electrolyte with lower cost transition metal fluorides and a solid polymer electrolyte.

 sep 09, 2019 
 - atlanta, ga 
 the growing popularity of lithium-ion batteries in recent years has put a strain on the world's supply of cobalt and nickel - two metals integral to current battery designs - and sent prices surging. 
 in a bid to develop alternative designs for lithium-based batteries with less reliance on those scarce metals, researchers at the georgia institute of technology have developed a promising new cathode and electrolyte system that replaces expensive metals and traditional liquid electrolyte with lower cost transition metal fluorides and a solid polymer electrolyte. 
 ""electrodes made from transition metal fluorides have long shown stability problems and rapid failure, leading to significant skepticism about their ability to be used in next generation batteries,"" said gleb yushin, a professor in georgia tech's school of materials science and engineering. ""but we've shown that when used with a solid polymer electrolyte, the metal fluorides show remarkable stability - even at higher temperatures - which could eventually lead to safer, lighter and cheaper lithium-ion batteries."" 
 in a typical lithium-ion battery, energy is released during the transfer of lithium ions between two electrodes - an anode and a cathode, with a cathode typically comprising lithium and transition metals such as cobalt, nickel and manganese. the ions flow between the electrodes through a liquid electrolyte. 
 for the study, which was published sept. 9 in the journal  nature materials  and sponsored by the army research office, the research team fabricated a new type of cathode from iron fluoride active material and a solid polymer electrolyte nanocomposite. iron fluorides have more than double the lithium capacity of traditional cobalt- or nickel-based cathodes. in addition, iron is 300 times cheaper than cobalt and 150 times cheaper than nickel. 
 to produce such a cathode, the researchers developed a process to infiltrate a solid polymer electrolyte into the prefabricated iron fluoride electrode. they then hot pressed the entire structure to increase density and reduce any voids. 
 two central features of the polymer-based electrolyte are its ability to flex and accommodate the swelling of the iron fluoride while cycling and its ability to form a very stable and flexible interphase with iron fluoride. traditionally, that swelling and massive side reactions have been key problems with using iron fluoride in previous battery designs. 
 ""cathodes made from iron fluoride have enormous potential because of their high capacity, low material costs and very broad availability of iron,"" yushin said. ""but the volume changes during cycling as well as parasitic side reactions with liquid electrolytes and other degradation issues have limited their use previously. using a solid electrolyte with elastic properties solves many of these problems."" 
 the researchers then tested several variations of the new solid-state batteries to analyze their performance over more than 300 cycles of charging and discharging at elevated temperature of 122 degrees fahrenheit, noting that they outperformed previous designs using metal fluoride even when these were kept cool at room temperatures. 
 the researchers found that the key to the enhanced battery performance was the solid polymer electrolyte. in previous attempts to use metal fluorides, it was believed that metallic ions migrated to the surface of the cathode and eventually dissolved into the liquid electrolyte, causing a capacity loss, particularly at elevated temperatures. in addition, metal fluorides catalyzed massive decomposition of liquid electrolytes when cells were operating above 100 degrees fahrenheit. however, at the connection between the solid electrolyte and the cathode, such dissolving doesn't take place and the solid electrolyte remains remarkably stable, preventing such degradations, the researchers wrote. 
 ""the polymer electrolyte we used was very common, but many other solid electrolytes and other battery or electrode architectures - such as core-shell particle morphologies - should be able to similarly dramatically mitigate or even fully prevent parasitic side reactions and attain stable performance characteristics,"" said kostiantyn turcheniuk, research scientist in yushin's lab and a co-author of the manuscript. 
 in the future, the researchers aim to develop new and improved solid electrolytes to enable fast charging and also to combine solid and liquid electrolytes in new designs that are fully compatible with conventional cell manufacturing technologies employed in large battery factories.

 - atlanta, ga 
 the inventure prize will expand its reach through a new statewide competition. 
 the georgia chamber of commerce announced the 
 georgia inventure prize , which is open to students attending public and private colleges across the state. the contest aims to foster innovation, entrepreneurship and start-up creation. 
 partners in the georgia chamber initiative include: the university system of georgia, the technical college system of georgia, private colleges and georgia tech. 
 the concept is modeled after 
 georgia tech's inventure prize , which started in 2009 to leverage the maker culture on campus and encourage students to push their ideas even further. over the years, tech students invented a 
 system to protect first responders , a 
 first-of-its-kind aiming device for competitive archery , a visual, color-based, rapid and disposable test for anemia and 
 much more . 
 the georgia chamber said the new contest further establishes the state as a leader for entrepreneurship and small business success. the initiative will strengthen georgia's pipeline of inventors and startup companies. 
 ""as the largest statewide business advocate, the georgia chamber of commerce understands the importance of entrepreneurship and innovation, as it is a longstanding chamber position to support the implementation of policies that promote commercialization, research activity and collaboration among the private and public sectors,"" said chris clark, georgia chamber president and ceo. ""we encourage participation and look forward to working with our georgia inventure prize partners in our continued efforts to develop local talent and increase access to venture capital."" 
 georgia tech's own inventure prize continues to 
 reward 
 students for innovations that aim to solve the world's big problems. the 2019 competition kickoff will take place sept. 12. 
 it also inspired a similar annual innovation competition among the colleges in the atlantic coast conference. the 
 acc inventure prize 
 started in 2016.

student-teams-compete-service-academies-swarm-challenge-gtri-assistance.txt,"student teams compete in service academies swarm challenge - with gtri assistance 
 the georgia tech research institute supported the darpa service academies swarm challenge.

 - atlanta, ga 
 what does the future of air-to-air combat sound like? at this point, it could sound very much like a swarm of angry bees. 
 that's how researcher michael day described the recent darpa service academies swarm challenge, which pitted mixed groups of up to 25 highly autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (uavs) on a side against one another in a next-generation version of the traditional ""capture the flag"" game. the friendly live-fly competition involved student teams from the u.s. air force academy, the u.s. military academy, and the u.s. naval academy, with each team developing and testing their own innovative offensive and defensive tactics to conduct mock swarm-on-swarm battles. 
 day, a research scientist at the 
 georgia tech research institute 
 (gtri), co-led the support efforts required to stage the competition, working with the teams to help them operate the swarms, which included fixed-wing, propeller-driven marcus uav zephyr aircraft and dji flame wheel quadcopters. gtri coached the teams and shared its simulation software to help the competitors develop tactics for both protecting their own space and invading another team's base. warren lee, branch head for gtri's unmanned flight operations, co-led the project with day. 
 the competition was sponsored by the 
 defense advanced research projects agency 
 (darpa), which has a history of fostering competition to help advance cutting-edge technology. in addition to gtri, the event was supported by the naval postgraduate school (nps) and the space and naval warfare systems command (spawar). it was held in april 2017 at camp roberts, a california army national guard facility. 
 the vehicles were adapted from foam-wing radio-control hobbyist aircraft and rotorcraft designed to carry cameras. but these aerial vehicles were modified with computers that contained sophisticated autopilots, as well as separate computers that helped them coordinate with swarm teammates, locate opponents, and conduct offensive and defensive maneuvers - including aerial dogfights. 
 but the tactics weren't the only thing tested at the competition. 
 ""a big challenge for us was logistical,"" said day. ""getting this many aircraft ready to fly and launched safely in the brief window of time we had required a lot of preparation."" 
 the competition was built on lessons learned from an earlier event that pitted gtri researchers against colleagues from the naval postgraduate school. that competition involved swarms composed of ten highly autonomous unmanned aircraft - all of them the same type - on each team. 
 building the aircraft 
 starting in august 2016, gtri researchers began building and testing the aircraft slated for use in the competition. they built them in batches, assembling the basic vehicles, installing the electronics and then testing them. each of the fixed-wing aircraft had an autopilot, flight computer, two radios, a gps receiver, and avionics to operate the flight controls. 
 gtri has years of experience incorporating autonomy into unmanned air vehicles, having conducted swarm research projects for agencies that include darpa and the office of naval research. 
 ""our operators and integrators are experienced, and we've gone through the highs and lows in terms of successes and failures,"" said lee. ""we felt extra pressure in this program to make sure that each and every aircraft was ready to fly so the teams could fully trust them and focus their efforts on the competition."" 
 in all, lee's group, which included senior research engineer gary gray and research engineer evan hammac, built 144 aircraft, a mix of the foam-wing and quadcopter models. they were delivered to the service academies in time for students to become familiar with the aircraft operation. members of gtri's uav team visited each of the academies twice to work with the cadets and midshipmen. 
 ""it was exciting and very rewarding to be able to work with the students on this project,"" said day. ""they have a lot of demands on their time from their studies, so it was really hands-on and ambitious."" 
 in addition to building and testing the aircraft and working with the students, gtri also built seven nps-designed launchers for the zephyrs, which have a 54-inch wingspan. the launchers get the aircraft up to flight speed, accelerating the launch process - which was part of the overall competition. 
 ""to get them all into the air, you can't spend more than about 30 seconds with each aircraft,"" noted day, who was part of the gtri group that supported the competition on the ground at camp roberts. 
 ""when you have 30 aircraft in the sky, it's very different from when you only have five or 10,"" he said. ""there's a higher level of stress because there are a lot more tasks to manage. we had a lot of lessons from our flight operations that we were able to share with the students."" 
 earlier, lee's team built 65 skywalker aircraft for the low-cost uav swarming technology (locust) program supported by the office of naval research (onr). 
 flying in simulation 
 in developing swarm tactics, gtri relies heavily on simulation to prepare for actual flight tests. computer time to run simulations is much less expensive than flying time, and allows for hundreds or thousands of test runs in the time that would be required for a single flight test. 
 ""we can do testing in our laboratory using a variety of simulation tools and have the ability to run thousands of different scenarios, look at the results of different types of engagements, and then use machine learning techniques to hone in on new swarm-versus-swarm tactics,"" said don davis, division chief of gtri's robotics and autonomous systems division. ""in many cases, the simulation leads us to ideas we wouldn't have thought of if we had been bound by human experience in this area."" 
 among the tools used by the service academy teams was scrimmage (simulating collaborative robots in a massive multi-agent game environment), developed by gtri researchers led by senior research engineer kevin demarco. scrimmage allows the interactions of tens, hundreds, or even thousands of air vehicles to be studied simultaneously. the system's interface was designed to be familiar to anyone who has played video games. 
 ""we can run the simulations faster than real time, so we can apply modern techniques that require much more data,"" said demarco. ""we developed scrimmage to allow users to see exactly how a new algorithm is affecting an aircraft's flight maneuvers. we can run it on high-performance computing clusters to conduct millions of simulations and then have our machine-learning algorithms process that data to improve the algorithms."" 
 the simulator doesn't run on the real aircraft, but does use the aircraft control software as part of its testing. 
 one of the combat tactics developed on scrimmage and used by the service academies swarm challenge aircraft is called ""greedy shooter."" each uav equipped with the software can locate the nearest enemy and go after it. the algorithm doesn't rely on collaboration among air vehicles, so multiple aircraft might attack the same enemy. 
 ""in scrimmage, we have shown that you get a 50 percent success rate with this,"" said demarco. 
 but another algorithm developed by senior research scientist charles pippin allows the air vehicles to allocate tasks, much as a human team may divide up the work that needs to be done on a project. ""the vehicles can negotiate among themselves and decide who will be assigned to each target. there is no specific leader, but in a decentralized way, the aircraft make those decisions,"" demarco explained. 
 in the swarm challenge, each of the vehicles had information about all of the other vehicles, but in real combat situations, that wouldn't be the case. scrimmage is helping gtri researchers determine how much information is needed to gain improvements from the task allocation model. 
 gtri researchers are also comparing the swarm strategies against a legacy system - the old-fashioned ""wingman"" approach in which two aircraft work as a team. that simple approach has advantages over more complicated algorithms even when computers are tracking all the air vehicles. 
 ""lots of agents running simple algorithms can make swarms look more intelligent than they actually are,"" demarco said. ""our hypothesis is that by being able to solve the two-versus-two challenge, we may be able to extend what we learn to a swarm."" 
 the competition and outcome 
 at the three-day competition, service academy teams faced off against each other inside a ""battle cube,"" a three-dimensional airspace 500 meters on a side and 78 meters above the ground. each team was given 20 fixed-wing uavs and 20 quadcopters and, under the challenge rules, could select a mix of 25 vehicles (with five in reserve, for a total of 30) for each of two 30-minute battle rounds. 
 each team had to defend its flag - a large, inflatable ground target - while trying to score the most points. points could be awarded in three ways: physically landing a uav on the opponent's flag, simulated firing on an opponent's uav, and launching as many aircraft as possible. 
 the u.s. naval academy was declared the winner of the competition. (full information about the event is available at 
 www.darpa.mil / news-events / 2017-05-11 ). 
 in addition to helping advance swarm tactics, the competition also helped the next generation of air force, army, and navy leaders get a head start on future swarm technology. 
 ""this competition wasn't as much about who won and who lost as it was about offering hands-on insights about this quickly evolving and increasingly important technology,"" said davis. ""gtri is pleased to help train and equip the next generation of warfighters. together, we showed that it is possible to get swarms of vehicles in the air and into mock combat against each other."" 
 among the lessons learned was the importance of rapidly launching the aircraft. davis said the team able to get into the air first had an advantage over others. the competition also stretched the wireless networks used to communicate among the aircraft, and that will need improvement in the future. 
 ""the biggest surprise to me was how well everything worked and how well the swarms operated,"" davis said. ""this is another step in developing the knowledge and experience required to use uav swarms in the field. there's a lot more that needs to be done, but we're making progress."" 
 in the future, highly autonomous vehicles could ultimately find uses throughout the military. 
 ""uavs will be extending the capabilities of the warfighter,"" davis said. ""i don't think we should expect swarms of uavs to primarily just replace people. i think it's appropriate to think of uavs as tools that warfighters can use to address a threat.""

 a select group of graduates each semester are tasked with putting years of memories, observations, and feelings into words that will inspire their classmates and everyone in the seats. 
 spring 2021 commencement reflection speakers 
 may 06, 2021 
 - atlanta, ga 
 on friday and saturday, georgia tech will celebrate commencement during extraordinary, and extraordinarily weird, times. graduates and their families and friends will gather in bobby dodd stadium. they'll be wearing face coverings and minding their distance. 
 but some things will remain untouched by the pandemic - the joy, the tears, the collective pat on the back for this singular accomplishment, and the traditions, including a select group of graduates who, each semester, are tasked with putting years of memories, observations, and feelings into words that will inspire their classmates and everyone in the seats. this semester's student reflection speakers are more than up to the challenge. they're preparing to knock it out of the proverbial park. 
 isabella sanders 
 is receiving a ph.d. in industrial engineering (as well as an mba from scheller college), and she has already begun teaching in the department of systems engineering at the u.s. military academy in west point, new york. 
 her motivation for serving as a reflection speaker had a lot to do with recognizing the support network behind every graduate, especially at the ph.d. level. ""i think a lot of ceremonies focus on the people who are graduating, but there isn't enough focus on the people who support the graduates,"" she said. ""so my speech is about thanking those people. it isn't a trip that you take by yourself, and i feel like it's good to thank everyone who got you to where you are."" 
 for sanders, a new york native who did her undergraduate work at mit, these are not her first tech graduate degrees. she also holds a master's in operations research and another in geographic information science and technology. in her remarks, she's not planning to spend too much time on the upheavals of the past 14 months. ""most people who have supported our ph.d. journeys have been in our lives long before the coronavirus hit, so my reflections were not largely affected by the pandemic."" 
 the reflection speaker at friday's master's ceremony will be computer science graduate 
 sheryl ratnam 
 from santa clara, california. she, like sanders, finished her degree in december but is returning to campus for this special day. two months ago, she began working as a software development engineer at amazon. 
 ""i really wanted to take this as an opportunity to celebrate a remarkable group of people who have inspired me in more ways than one,"" ratnam said. ""i'm grateful to have met lifelong friends at georgia tech, and am honored to have learned alongside the best and brightest."" she  thinks of her reflection speech as a thank you and a gesture of appreciation ""for georgia tech, and the class of 2020, both of which have paved the path toward my future . "" 
 for ratnam, how - and how much - she will talk about the pandemic is a balancing act. not mentioning it at all would be to ignore ""a monumental historical event that has no doubt shaped our academic and personal journeys."" she instead will focus on the ways that covid-19 has brought into sharp relief, for many people, an awareness of ""all that we can accomplish despite the obstacles that may stand in our way."" 
 saturday, may 8, will feature two bachelor's ceremonies, one in the morning and one in the afternoon. morning speaker 
 sidartha rakuram 
 is a computer science graduate from petaling jaya, malaysia. the first time he set foot in the u.s., in 2017, he was on his way to atlanta for faset. now, he is ""excited at the opportunity to reflect on all the memories we have made over the past few years. commencement is also such a joyous celebration, and i am so honored."" 
 rakuram's emphasis will be on gratitude. he plans to ""reflect on the love and kindness we experienced that has helped all of us through our time at tech - whether it was family, friends, or the faculty and staff here - and i will be thanking them all in the address."" 
 later this month, he will return to malaysia to begin working at astro, a leading entertainment and content provider. while he looks forward to being back home with his family, he knows this goodbye is going to be tough. still, he has ""told all my friends that they have an open invitation to visit."" 
 abigail burke 's journey to tech was considerably shorter, originating in nearby peachtree city. the economics and international affairs major will be delivering the reflection speech at the final commencement ceremony of spring 2021. she was motivated to apply, in part, because all four of her grandparents will be sitting in the audience. 
 for burke, the pandemic ""was at the forefront of my mind as i was brainstorming what to talk about. it's been a difficult time for everyone, and graduating this year is an immense accomplishment for the class of 2021,"" she said. ""with most of my extraneous activities gone, i had the chance to focus on my close friendships and get involved at georgia tech in ways i didn't expect."" that included working as the assistant manager for the mccamish pavilion voting precinct in november, and as an intern for a voter education startup. these experiences helped shape the reflection speech she ended up writing. 
 after graduation she will take some time for herself - by working on a ranch in colorado - before heading to the university of oxford to pursue a master's degree in social science of the internet. 
 but not until she's had her moment on the stage, reflecting on ""what has ultimately made my time at georgia tech meaningful.""

students-spend-summer-launching-startups.txt,"students spend summer launching startups 
 startup summer is part of create-x, a newly launched initiative to enhance and support entrepreneurship programs for undergraduate students. 
 aug 17, 2015 
 - atlanta, ga 
 shiv patel thought he invented a solution to a problem plaguing roommates. his original idea would help people split expenses on everything from pizza delivery to vacation homes. 
 patel is one of the teams picked for this year's startup summer, a 12-week internship for georgia tech students and recent graduates who want to launch startups based on their own inventions and prototypes. the program teaches students to understand potential customers and the market so they can build a product or service that addresses a real and quantified need. 
 that approach showed patel the faults in his idea. for it to work, he would need the ability to issue instant, virtual pre-paid debit cards. this would require the infrastructure and support of a bank, but most said the concept was too futuristic or too costly to set up. 
 he put aside his original concept and instead created 
 mercez , a tool to help people when they're travelling and shopping abroad. the company's first product, truecost, helps people avoid foreign transaction fees, unfavorable exchange rates and miscellaneous fees by providing daily updates showing which of their credit cards provides the best deal on any given day. 
 ""i have motivation, but startup summer gives me the support and structure and honest advice i need,"" said patel, a computer science major. ""instead of letting me be discouraged when my first idea didn't work, they helped me ask the questions i needed to find something else."" 
 that entrepreneurial confidence to try and try again is what georgia tech wants to instill in students, said raghupathy sivakumar, the wayne j. holman chair in the school of electrical and computer engineering and a startup summer instructor. 
 the confidence comes from the methodical steps students take in the program. they incorporate companies, perform customer discovery, build product iterations, determine pricing strategies, gain customer traction, take the product to market and deal with founder equity allocations. 
 startup summer is part of create-x, a newly launched initiative to enhance and support entrepreneurship programs for undergraduate students. 
 georgia tech alumnus christopher w. klaus provided significant funding for create-x, and eight of the 10 startup summer teams accepted an investment from the fund. while 13 teams were accepted this year, three shut down operations after realizing there was not a market for their idea. 
 alumni and industry veterans served as mentors for the teams. 
 ""the networking has been unbelievable,"" said josh lieberman, one of the founders of 
 teq charging . ""so many in the georgia tech alumni network are offering their support and advice."" 
 teq created a power strip to charge electric vehicles. the technology and design increases the efficiency - and lowers the cost - of current charge stations by sequentially charging vehicles, said isaac wittenstein, another co-founder. installing this plug-in system throughout parking lots or decks allows drivers to charge when they need it. 
 lieberman and wittenstein, both mechanical engineering majors, ventured into the electric vehicle market during startup lab, a course within the create-x program taught by sivakumar, that exposes students to startups and teaches them how to develop a business model. they teamed up with the third teq co-founder, dorrier coleman, who worked on electric vehicles during capstone design. he graduated in may. 
 teq recently earned second place in atlan10, which ranked the most innovative young startups in atlanta. 
 another team, 
 replantable , is selling one of its products at sevananda natural foods mart in atlanta's little five points. 
 the team created a soilless growing system using led lights, which eliminates the need for direct exposure to sunlight. the system circulates water and has minerals making it possible for people to grow up to five pounds of fruits and vegetables a week, said alex weiss, one of the co-founders. the nanofarm stands about 5-feet tall and takes up about as much space as a dining room chair. 
 weiss and ruwan subasinghe graduated from tech in may and have been friends since freshman orientation in 2011. 
 at sevananda they're selling seedling pods that can be screwed onto one-gallon water jugs so people can start growing their own food. the nanofarm should be available for purchase later this fall. 
 until then, replantable and the other nine teams will show off their startups at demo day, taking place at 5 p.m. tuesday at the historic academy of medicine.

 research highlighted this week in the journal science analyzes a class of ""joiners,"" employees who support the founders of startup companies. 
 georgia tech's technology square is home to a growing community of startup companies. georgia tech associate professor henry sauermann and collaborator michael roach from cornell university have studied the people who join the founders of startup companies. these ""joiners"" are simliar to founders in many ways, though there are important differences. (credit: john toon, georgia tech)

 - atlanta, ga 
 a growing interest in the startup culture has focused attention on company founders who often take great risks to launch new ventures. but what about the people who join these founders to help them develop and commercialize innovative new products and services? a research highlight published this week in the journal 
 science 
 reports on research analyzing these ""joiners,"" and finds that while they resemble founders in their willingness to take risks and their desire for the freedom of a startup, there are important differences. for instance, joiners are less interested in management and more interested in functional roles such as research and development, making them more like the people who go to work for established companies. ""sometimes you can have a single founder who handles the full range of activities for a startup, but especially in technology you need additional people to research and develop the products,"" said 
 henry sauermann , an associate professor in the 
 scheller college of business 
 at the georgia institute of technology. ""there are many people who are interested in working for startups but who don't want to be founders."" sauermann and co-author michael roach, an assistant professor in the dyson school of applied economics and management at cornell university, found the differences while examining the entrepreneurial interests of 4,200 ph.d. candidates who were within two years of obtaining degrees in stem fields. nearly half (46 percent) of these scientists and engineers reported an interest in joining a startup as an employee, while slightly more than one in ten (11 percent) said they expected to found their own companies. the researchers surveyed these ph.d. candidates about personal characteristics such as acceptance of risk, desire for autonomy, interest in commercializing new technology and willingness to take on managerial tasks. they also asked about interests in entrepreneurship, in roles as both startup founders and the joiners who support them. the study, which includes a more comprehensive companion article to be published in the journal 
 management science , may be the first to consider founders and joiners as separate groups. ""a key insight from our research is that many of the characteristics that we often think of as unique to founders, such as a tolerance for risk and the desire to bring new ideas to life, also generalize to the broader entrepreneurial workforce, including people who want to work in startups but don't want to be founders themselves,"" roach said. understanding how the personal preferences of newly-minted ph.d. scientists and engineers fits into their entrepreneurial interests may be important to helping them find the best application for their hard-won knowledge and skills. increasingly, startups provide an attractive career path for ph.d. graduates who may not find academic research attractive or may experience difficulty in finding positions in academia - but who still want to be involved in research and commercialization activities, roach said. more emphasis may be needed on preparing stem doctorates for these entrepreneurial employee career paths. ""most university programs designed to foster entrepreneurship - such as courses, workshops and incubators - focus on training people to be a founder,"" roach noted. ""but founders make up a small share of the entrepreneurial workforce, and we do very little to train the larger share of people who will work in startups as employees rather than founders. for example, many programs focus on how to write business plans and secure funding, while less attention is paid to how to work effectively in a small startup team."" the high degree of interest in entrepreneurship among science and engineering ph.d. candidates surprised sauermann, who expected that the soon-to-be-graduates might prefer a safer career path in established companies. ""a surprising number of people from this group found entrepreneurship attractive,"" he said. ""this may mean we don't have as much of a problem getting people interested in startups as is widely believed. it may be more a question of how the transition from the ph.d. training to the startup world happens."" the paper is based on a 2010 study of ph.d. candidates about to graduate from 39 different u.s. tier one colleges and universities. in a follow up study, roach and sauermann surveyed the group to examine the career transitions they made into industry, startups and academia. results are being analyzed, and the two researchers hope to follow this group to see how their careers develop. the data may also help provide information on how context affects careers. for instance, exposure to an entrepreneurial environment appears likely to increase an individual's willingness to work in a startup, but doesn't seem to boost their interest in being a founder. ""an interest in being a founder is more closely associated with individual traits and preferences that predispose them to entrepreneurship,"" roach said. ""at the same time, individuals who lack these traits are unlikely to become interested in being a founder even when exposed to entrepreneurial influences. one implication of this is that programs that hope to stimulate entrepreneurship may do more to increase the pool of entrepreneurial workers than to make people into founders."" the study should be encouraging for those promoting the entrepreneurial career path, sauermann said. ""not everybody has to start their own company,"" he added. ""you can also make a difference for the world by joining a founder."" the overall research is supported by the ewing marion kauffman foundation, the national science foundation and the georgia research alliance. its larger goal is to examine the educational experiences and career paths of ph.d. scientists and engineers. research news georgia institute of technology 177 north avenue atlanta, georgia 30332-0181 usa media relations contact : john toon (404-894-6986) ( jtoon@gatech.edu ) writer : john toon

 a new study examines the roles of supporting scientists in the research enterprise. 
 as university research has become more complex and interdisciplinary, laboratory teams have grown in size, with increasing numbers of specialists in such areas such as statistical analysis, electron microscopy or mass spectrometry. (georgia tech photo) 
 dec 13, 2018 
 - atlanta, ga 
 as university research has become more complex and interdisciplinary, laboratory teams have grown in size, with increasing numbers of specialists in such areas such as statistical analysis, electron microscopy or mass spectrometry. 
 a paper published december 10 in the journal 
 proceedings of the national academy of sciences 
 takes a closer look at these specialists, who perform essential roles in research and resulting academic publishing - but who may never lead production of a journal paper themselves. these supporting scientists often do their work outside the traditional tenure track and may never obtain permanent positions as professors. 
 ""more and more critical scientific work is taking place in teams, and there are people who are building their careers supporting these teams,"" said 
 john walsh , a professor in georgia tech's 
 school of public policy 
 and a co-author of the study. ""these supporting scientists are here to stay as a part of our scientific workforce, but we don't really have a career system that accounts for and recognizes the contributions they make."" 
 since the 1960s, the ranks of these ""middle authors"" has grown from 25 to 60 percent of the research authors publishing in the three fields the study examined. with titles such as ""research scientist,"" ""laboratory technician"" or ""postdoctoral fellow,"" these authors often move from one temporary assignment to another, and may drop out of research publishing in as few as five years after receiving a ph.d. 
 ""there seems to be more volatility in scientific careers,"" walsh noted. ""careers are getting shorter, and the point at which authors drop out, the half-life of a scientist, is getting shorter."" the study found that the time at which half of a cohort has left academic publishing has declined from 35 years in the 1960s to only five years a half century later. 
 walsh and colleagues staša milojevic and filippo radicchi from the 
 school of informatics, computing, and engineering at indiana university 
 used data from the clarivate analytics web of science to study the changing demographics of scientific careers by looking at researchers in the fields of astronomy, ecology and robotics. they examined the careers of 71,164 scientists in astronomy, 20,704 in ecology and 17,646 in robotics to determine when publishing careers began and the publishing roles played by individual scientists. the national science foundation-supported research analyzed millions of bibliographic items produced during the study period. 
 the researchers looked for factors that might predict the career length for newly minted ph.d. scientists. they found that the long-term survival of lead authors correlated with the number of publications during their first five years, while the success of supporting scientists didn't seem to have a predictor. 
 the study wasn't able to determine where the dropout scientists went after they stopped publishing, but walsh notes there are number of career choices that would utilize ph.d. skills - teaching, research administration or industrial research - without the expectation of traditional academic publishing. 
 with academic research based on the conventional roles of principal investigators and graduate students, the supportive scientists necessary for today's research might not find a place in traditional college and university career paths. 
 ""if you build the hiring, promotion and compensation systems on a model of a principal investigator and graduate students, these important contributors may be left out,"" he said. ""we may need to rethink the career and reward system because these specialists are becoming a larger and larger share of the scientific workforce."" 
 what's causing the shift toward more transient members of research teams? walsh says factors include the need for large teams to take on big science challenges, and competition for research support that drives the division of labor in team-based approaches - similar to what happened in factories - to get work done faster and more efficiently. 
 ""there is very strong pressure to be good and to be fast,"" he said. ""one of the effects of what has been called the bureaucratization of research is that as groups get larger, you see more specialization and people who become permanent staff members who help support the team."" 
 walsh said the growth of this ""temporary workforce"" represents a change in the university research enterprise. 
 ""a significant and growing share of authors in each of these fields we studied spent their entire career as part of a research group, but never as a leader,"" he said. ""we saw this as strong evidence of a transition in the organization of scientific work.""

study-finds-lurking-malice-cloud-hosting-services.txt,"study finds ""lurking malice"" in cloud hosting services 
 a study of 20 major cloud hosting services has found that as many as 10 percent of the repositories hosted by them had been compromised.

 oct 19, 2016 
 - atlanta, ga 
 a study of 20 major cloud hosting services has found that as many as 10 percent of the repositories hosted by them had been compromised - with several hundred of the ""buckets"" actively providing malware. such bad content could be challenging to find, however, because it can be rapidly assembled from stored components that individually may not appear to be malicious. 
 to identify the bad content, researchers created a scanning tool that looks for features unique to the bad repositories, known as ""bars."" the features included certain types of redirection schemes and ""gatekeeper"" elements designed to protect the malware from scanners. researchers from the georgia institute of technology, indiana university bloomington and the university of california santa barbara conducted the study. 
 believed to be the first systematic study of cloud-based malicious activity, the research will be presented october 24 at the acm conference on computer and communications security in vienna, austria.  the work was supported in part by the national science foundation. 
 ""bad actors have migrated to the cloud along with everybody else,"" said 
 raheem beyah , a professor in georgia tech's 
 school of electrical and computer engineering . ""the bad guys are using the cloud to deliver malware and other nefarious things while remaining undetected. the resources they use are compromised in a variety of ways, from traditional exploits to simply taking advantage of poor configurations."" 
 beyah and graduate student xiaojing liao found that the bad actors could hide their activities by keeping components of their malware in separate repositories that by themselves didn't trigger traditional scanners. only when they were needed to launch an attack were the different parts of this malware assembled. 
 ""some exploits appear to be benign until they are assembled in a certain way,"" explained beyah, who is the motorola foundation professor and associate chair for strategic initiatives and innovation in the school of electrical and computer engineering. ""when you scan the components in a piecemeal kind of way, you only see part of the malware, and the part you see may not be malicious."" 
 in the cloud, malicious actors take advantage of how difficult it can be to scan so much storage. operators of cloud hosting services may not have the resources to do the deep scans that may be necessary to find the bars - and their monitoring of repositories may be limited by service-level agreements. 
 while splitting the malicious software up helped hide it, the strategy also created a technique for finding the ""bad buckets"" hosting it, beyah said. many of the bad actors had redundant repositories connected by specific kinds of redirection schemes that allowed attacks to continue if one bucket were lost. the bad buckets also usually had ""gatekeepers"" designed to keep scanners out of the repositories, and where webpages were served, they had simple structures that were easy to propagate. 
 ""we observed that there is an inherent structure associated with how these attackers have set things up,"" he explained. ""for instance, the bad guys all had bodyguards at the door. that's not normal for cloud storage, and we used that structure to detect them."" 
 the researchers began by studying a small number of known bad repositories to understand how they were being used. based on what they learned, they created ""barfinder,"" a scanner tool that automatically searches for and detects features common to the bad repositories. 
 overall, the researchers scanned more than 140,000 sites on 20 cloud hosting sites and found about 700 active repositories for malicious content. in total, about 10 percent of cloud repositories the team studied had been compromised in some way. the researchers notified the cloud hosting companies of their findings before publication of the study. 
 ""it's pervasive in the cloud,"" said beyah. ""we found problems in every last one of the hosting services we studied. we believe this is a significant problem for the cloud hosting industry."" 
 in some cases, the bad actors simply opened an inexpensive account and began hosting their software. in other cases, the malicious content was hidden in the cloud-based domains of well-known brands. intermingling the bad content with good content in the brand domains protected the malware from blacklisting of the domain. 
 beyah and liao saw a wide range of attacks in the cloud hosted repositories, ranging from phishing and common drive-by downloads to fake antivirus and computer update sites. ""they can attack you directly from these buckets, or they can redirect you to other malicious buckets or a series of malicious buckets,"" he said. ""it can be difficult to see where the code is redirecting you."" 
 to protect cloud-based repositories from these attacks, beyah recommends the usual defenses, including patching of systems and proper configuration settings. 
 looking ahead, the researchers hope to make barfinder available to a broader audience. that could include licensing the technology to a security company, or making it available as an open-source tool. 
 ""attackers are very clever, and as we secure things and make the cloud infrastructure more challenging for them to attack, they will move onto something else,"" he said. ""in the meantime, every system that we can secure makes the internet just a little bit safer.""

 researchers have successfully identified biological signatures in pediatric patients with newly diagnosed crohn's disease (cd) capable of predicting whether a child will develop disease-related complications requiring major surgery within three to five years. the results of this research, ""prediction of complicated disease course for children newly diagnosed with crohn's disease: a multicentre inception cohort study,"" have been published in the journal, the lancet. 
 this groundbreaking work is the result of the crohn's & colitis foundation's ""risk stratification"" study, the largest new-onset study completed on pediatric crohn's disease patients. it is a multicenter research initiative that consists of 25 u.s. institutions and three from canada and a cohort of 1,112 cd children enrolled at diagnosis, of which 913 were included in the published study. of the 28 research sites, four are located in atlanta - emory university, georgia institute of technology, children's healthcare of atlanta, and the children's center for digestive health care. the goal of this research was to identify measurable indicators of the two most common complications in pediatric crohn's disease that require surgery - stricturing and penetrating disease. 
 stricturing, also referred to as fibrostenosis, is characterized by a build-up of fibrotic scar tissue which leads to thickening of the intestinal wall and narrowing of the intestinal passage. penetrating disease is the result of sustained inflammation that spreads beyond the intestinal wall resulting in the creation of fistulas, abnormal connections between the intestine and other organs. penetrating complications can also lead to the formation of abscesses at the sites of fistulas. 
 ""twenty five percent of patients with crohn's disease account for 80 percent of complications, hospitalizations, surgery and health care costs. the aim of risk is to preemptively identify those 25 percent of patients at diagnosis,"" subra kugathasan, m.d., emory university, principal investigator and lead author of the paper. ""through the study of baseline gene expression, immune reactivity, and intestinal bacteria, we have identified distinct biological signatures capable of predicting stricturing and penetrating disease, at diagnosis. after analyzing millions of biological and clinical data points, risk has generated a composite risk stratification model."" 
 ""stricturing and penetrating disease account for substantial morbidity in both pediatric and adult patients with crohn's disease, but there are no validated models to predict risk and the effect of treatment,"" said caren heller, m.d., chief scientific officer of the foundation. 
 risk study researchers looked at intestinal gene expression levels to identify risk factor genes whose levels are altered (increased or decreased) at enrollment, and identified distinct biological gene expression signatures at baseline that could distinguish children who will develop strictures form those who develop fistulas or abscesses, without the confounding effects of treatment on gene expression. therefore, these genetic signatures together with other biological and clinical variables they evaluated could be used as predictors of complications and treatment outcomes at diagnosis. 
 ""importantly, the functional nature of these genetic signatures is consistent with the clinical presentation of the complications,"" said ted denson, m.d., cincinnati children's hospital, co-principal investigator and lead author of the paper. ""this means that while patients who develop fibrostenosis exhibit, at diagnosis, increased levels of several genes involved in the fibrosis process, patients who develop penetrating disease have increased levels of genes involved in the inflammatory response."" 
 in addition to providing predictive biological signatures for development of complications, the risk study also found that patients who receive early anti-tnfa biologic treatment, within three months of diagnosis, were less likely to develop penetrating complications. however, patients with stricturing complications were poorly responsive to early intervention with biologics. these data support the utility of risk stratification of pediatric crohn's disease patients at diagnosis, and may guide early tailored use of anti-tnfa therapy. the data also highlight the unmet medical need to find new treatment options for children likely to develop strictures. 
 ""these discoveries are great steps toward precision medicine in the treatment of pediatric crohn's disease,"" said andrés hurtado-lorenzo, ph.d., director of translational research of the foundation. ""in the coming years, we plan to translate these findings into a risk diagnostic tool that could use these biological signatures as biomarkers to predict risk of complications and to help clinicians make therapeutic decisions at diagnosis."" 
 the foundation has made significant investments in support of pediatric ibd research through the pro-kiids network, an umbrella for clinics participating in pediatric ibd research. although many projects are expected to arise from this network the risk stratification has been the flagship study. 
 ""pediatric patients are the fastest growing group of the ibd population. under the auspices of the pro-kiids network, every major pediatric ibd center in the country is touched by our work or funding,"" said michael osso, president and ceo of the foundation. ""through the network, and the results of the risk study, we are furthering research that will significantly lower the treatment burden on kids, and help minimize side effects on the quality of life surrounding the most vulnerable of patients."" 
 as part of the study, georgia tech postdoctoral researcher urko marigorta analyzed rnaseq gene expression data from biopsies provided by cincinnati children's hospital. the work identified dozens of pathways that are differentially expressed in complicated disease, and showed that immune activity is more disrupted in penetrating disease while extracellular matrix is more involved in stricturing disease. inclusion of these profiles in a statistical model with the serological and classical markers improved the predictive accuracy of the model significantly. 
 ""we performed statistical and bioinformatic analyses of the genomic data which led to enhanced discrimination of which patients are likely to progress to complicated disease,"" said greg gibson, a professor in the georgia tech school of biological sciences and one of the paper's co-authors. ""the involvement of tnf-alpha signaling in progression to stricturing disease is consistent with the overall finding that these are the patients who respond to tnf-alpha therapy."" 
 this seminal work and its discovery represent over $10 million investment by the crohn's & colitis foundation, nearly 10 years of work, and collaborative team effort. dr. thomas walters from the hospital for sick kids, canada shares lead authorship with drs. kugathasan and denson. in addition, dr. jeffrey hyams (connecticut children's medical center), and dr. marla dubinsky (mount sinai hospital, new york) share authorship. 
 about the risk stratification study 
 the risk stratification study enrolled 1,800 patients from 28 clinics, with a focus on 913 children with crohn's disease enrolled at diagnosis and complication-free following 90 days after diagnosis. this 36-month prospective inception cohort study included well documented clinical, demographic, and biological sample collection every six months on all patients for three years with continuing follow up for five years.

study-shows-electronic-air-cleaning-technology-can-generate-unintended-pollutants.txt,"study shows that electronic air cleaning technology can generate unintended pollutants 
 the benefits to indoor air quality of one type of purifying system can be offset by the generation of other pollutants 
 a research team at the georgia institute of technology has found that the benefits to indoor air quality of one type of purifying system can be offset by the generation of other pollutants that are harmful to health. 
 jul 14, 2021 
 - atlanta, ga 
 as the covid-19 pandemic raged, news reports show that sales of electronic air cleaners have surged due to concerns about airborne disease transmission. but a research team at the georgia institute of technology has found that the benefits to indoor air quality of one type of purifying system can be offset by the generation of other pollutants that are harmful to health. 
 led by associate professor 
 nga lee ""sally"" ng 
 in georgia tech's school of chemical and biomolecular engineering and the school of earth and atmospheric sciences, the team evaluated the effect of a hydroxyl radical generator in an office setting. hydroxyl radicals react with odors and pollutants, decomposing them, and hydroxyl radical generators have been marketed to inactivate pathogens such as coronaviruses. 
 however, ng's 
 study 
 found that in the process of cleaning the air, the hydroxyl radicals generated by the device reacted with volatile organic compounds present in the indoor space. this led to chemical reactions that quickly formed organic acids and secondary organic aerosols that can cause health problems. secondary organic aerosols is a major component of pm 2.5 
 (particulate matter with a diameter smaller than 2.5 mm), and exposure to pm 2.5 
 has been associated with cardiopulmonary diseases and millions of deaths per year. 
 the paper, ""formation of oxidized gases and secondary organic aerosol from a commercial oxidant-generating electronic air cleaner,"" is published in the journal 
 environmental science and technology letters . 
 while the pandemic has made various types of electronic cleaners increasingly popular, ng explained that consumers are probably not aware of the secondary chemistry taking place in the air, with the pollutants generated not being directly emitted by the cleaning device itself. 
 ""there are increasing concerns regarding the use of electronic air cleaners as these devices can potentially generate unintended byproducts via oxidation chemistry similar to that in the atmosphere,"" ng said. 
 two types of air cleaning technologies are commonly used to remove indoor pollutants such as particles or volatile organic compounds and to inactivate pathogens: mechanical filtration and electronic air cleaners that generate ions, reactive species, or other chemical products such as photocatalytic oxidation, plasma, and oxidant-generating equipment (e.g., ozone, hydroxyl radical), among others. 
 ng's team selected a hydroxyl generator for the study to measure the oxygenated volatile organic compounds and the chemical composition of particles generated by the device in an office on the georgia tech campus. 
 while previous research reported pollutant formation from various electronic air cleaners (ionizers, plasma systems, photocatalytic systems with ultraviolet lamps, etc.), ng believes that her team's study is the first to monitor the chemical composition of secondary pollutants in both gas and particle phases during the operation of an electronic device that dissipates oxidants in a real-world setting. 
 advanced instrumentation made ng's study possible. gas-phase organic compounds were measured using a high-resolution time-of-flight chemical ionization mass spectrometer, purchased through a national science foundation major instrumentation grant. the study received support from georgia tech's covid-19 rapid response fund. 
 ng noted that future studies on air cleaning technology should not be limited to inactivation of viruses or reduction of volatile organic compounds, but should also evaluate potential oxidation chemistry and the formation of unintended harmful gaseous and particulate chemicals. 
 ""more studies need to be conducted on the effects of these devices in a variety of environments,"" ng said. ""electronic air cleaners greatly rose in prominence because of the pandemic, and now there are a lot of these devices out there. millions of dollars are being spent on these devices by businesses and schools. the market is huge. 
 ""our results show that care must be taken when choosing an adequate and appropriate air cleaning technology for a particular environment and task,"" she said. 
 ng stressed the importance of future studies concerning the unintended effects of electronic purifiers, as these devices are not currently well regulated and do not have testing standards. 
 ""there needs to be more peer-reviewed scientific data on electronic air cleaners,"" ng said. ""we hope that additional studies will lead to more government guidelines and regulation.""

study-shows-how-bacteria-behave-differently-humans-compared-lab.txt,"study shows how bacteria behave differently in humans compared to the lab 
 study shows how bacteria behave differently in humans versus the lab.

 most of what we know today about deadly bacteria such as 
 pseudomonas aeruginosa 
 was obtained from studies done in laboratory settings. research reported may 14 in the journal 
 proceedings of the national academy of sciences 
 shows that this laboratory-based information may have important limits for predicting how these bugs behave once they've invaded humans. 
 among the differences are increased expression of genes responsible for antibiotic resistance, the bane of drugs currently used to treat a wide range of infections. the new research could help scientists understand how to draw more accurate conclusions from their laboratory work - and provide doctors with better information on treating bacterial infections. 
 ""bacteria in human infections are often tolerant of antibiotics, but when we culture them outside the human they are highly susceptible,"" said 
 marvin whiteley , a professor in the 
 school of biological sciences 
 at the georgia institute of technology and co-director of the emory-children's cystic fibrosis center. ""in this paper, we show that several genes important for antibiotic tolerance are highly induced in humans compared to our laboratory and mouse modeling systems. there appears to be something unique in the human that is promoting resistance."" 
 what might be causing that difference remains a mystery, though bacteria are known to be affected by their environment. understanding how bacterial genes and their expression levels differ in humans could allow researchers to search for laboratory conditions that better mimic the human conditions - and provide better guidance for the use of antibiotics. 
 ""understanding which antibiotic resistance genes are highly expressed in humans may inform our therapeutic decisions on antibiotic usage,"" said whiteley, who holds the bennie h. & nelson d. abell chair in molecular and cellular biology at georgia tech and is a 
 georgia research alliance 
 eminent scholar. ""for instance, one might predict antibiotic resistance of an infecting community from gene expression data without the need for culturing microbes in the clinical lab."" 
 the study was supported by the national institutes of health, the cystic fibrosis foundation, and the lundbeck foundation. in addition to the georgia tech researchers, the research team included scientists at the texas tech university health sciences center, the university of mississippi medical center, the university of california, and several clinical and research organizations in denmark. 
 pseudomonas aeruginosa is an important pathogen that threatens immunocompromised people, including those with cystic fibrosis, diabetes and obesity. it is a major hospital-acquired infection, and the centers for disease control and prevention characterizes multi-drug resistant strains of the bacteria as a serious threat. 
 in their research, the scientists analyzed rna sequencing data from both human clinical infections and laboratory experiments. the human samples were obtained from collaborating clinicians, who took the samples directly from patients and put them into a chemical that preserved their rna for later processing. the laboratory experiments studied different strains of the bacterium under a variety of growth conditions, from antibiotic treatment to competition with other bacteria. 
 the researchers also included previously published in vitro and mouse experiment data from the whiteley laboratory and other research teams. data analysis techniques included a machine learning approach known as support vector machines, which was used to distinguish between gene expression profiles of samples taken from human and in vitro sources. 
 ""we saw high expression in several genes notorious for antibiotic resistance, including genes that encode efflux pumps that extrude antibiotics from the cell as well as an enzyme that degrades certain antibiotics, such as ampicillin,"" said daniel cornforth, a research scientist in whiteley's laboratory and the paper's first author. ""there were also less studied antibiotic resistance genes, including three related to zinc transport that our previous work has identified as critical antibiotic resistance determinants that were also highly expressed in the human patients."" 
 though the research focused only on a single troublesome pathogen, whiteley believes the results could have broader implications. ""we actually know very little about bacteria behaviors during human infection and most model systems cannot replicate most aspects of human infection. i expect that this work would be generalizable to other bacteria."" 
 by identifying how bacteria behave differently in humans compared to standard laboratory settings, the work could provide a foundation for additional study with more samples and different types of infection. 
 ""the key takeaway from this work is that now microbiologists can perform transcriptomics on bacterial populations in a range of human infections, so we can better understand what bacteria are actually doing in these clinical infections,"" said cornforth. ""we can also determine where our laboratory models succeed and where they fail in mimicking these infection environments."" 
 this study was funded by national institutes of health grant r01gm116547-01a1, a human frontiers science grant, cystic fibrosis foundation grant whitel16g0, lundbeck foundation grant r204-2015-4205 and lundbeck foundation grant r105-a9791, and by cystic fibrosis postdoctoral fellowships cornfo15f0 and ibbers16f0.

 the first spacecraft built at georgia tech is expected to fly this summer.

 they clapped when it cleared the launch pad. they oohed in awe as the booster rockets separated, then roared when the pair landed in synchronicity. 
 and they howled with laughter when they saw a car in space. 
 ""it was awesome! it was unbelievable to see something so historic,"" said swapnil pujari. 
 he was one of 30 or so georgia tech aerospace engineering students who crowded into a lab in the engineering science and mechanics building tuesday afternoon to watch a livestream of spacex's first test flight of the world's most powerful rocket - the falcon heavy. 
 from the sound in the room, the launch was an unquestionable success. 
 ""i got goosebumps when i saw the two boosters land at the same time,"" said william jun, a fourth-year undergraduate in the daniel guggenheim school of aerospace engineering. ""i feel like i've witnessed the beginning of a new era."" 
 it's hard to imagine what he'll feel the next time the falcon heavy launches. 
 tuesday's launch only carried one piece of cargo, a red tesla roadster that is expected to orbit the sun for the next billion years. the next heavy rocket will be stuffed with satellites. one of them is scheduled to be prox-1, a 154-pound, rectangular-shaped metal box that was built and tested by jun, pujari and other georgia tech students. it's the first spacecraft built on campus that will fly in space. 
 ""this is the part of the space industry that we live for,"" said professor glenn lightsey, who watched the launch with the students. ""ultimately, there is a day when you find out if the thing you've thought about and planned for actually works or not. today (tuesday) it happened for spacex. six months from now, it will happen for us at georgia tech."" 
 prox-1 is a 24"" by 22"" by 12"" satellite that will deploy a smaller spacecraft, lightsail 2, which will attempt the first controlled solar sail flight in earth orbit. 
 as that sail unfurls, prox-1 will move and observe lightsail from a short distance and acquire images of the glimmering structure in action. georgia tech will serve as mission control. 
 ""our students are going to have their hardware in space, making measurements and sending their data back to earth,"" said lightsey. ""this is a really unique experience that wasn't even possible before this century. it's a new way of doing things in stem (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) education."" 
 prox-1 is currently at the air force research lab in new mexico, undergoing a series of tests to make sure the satellite can withstand the rugged, violent ride inside the falcon heavy. it's one of the final pre-flight steps for a six-year project that has included more than 400 georgia tech students. from there it will be shipped to florida and await an official launch date from spacex. 
 although they enjoyed the experience together for tuesday's launch, don't expect many of the same students to gather on campus to watch prox-1 blast into space. 
 ""oh, i will be in florida for sure!"" said pujari.

 - atlanta, ga 
 a new program will help local governments across georgia plan and implement smart development. 
 georgia tech is leading the effort that brings together industry and public agencies to support communities in their efforts to implement cutting-edge technologies. 
 the 
 georgia smart communities challenge 
 is open to large cities and smaller towns, which have not been as prominent in smart development because of a lack of access to resources. 
 the program, also called ""georgia smart,"" will provide seed funding and access to technical assistance, expert advice and a network of peers. a georgia tech researcher will advise each team and conduct research in support of their needs and goals. 
 ""we've spent the past year in workshops and dialogue with local governments across georgia to better understand their challenges and priorities,"" said debra lam, managing director, smart cities and inclusive innovation at georgia tech. ""from these communications, we developed a program that is sensitive to the local context while fast-tracking smart communities. we aim to create more models for smart development that can be shared and applied across the state and beyond."" 
 georgia smart is seeking proposals in the areas of smart mobility and smart resilience. applications are due may 1. 
 local georgia governments of any size -- cities, counties or consolidated city-county governments -- will lead selected teams. each of the four winning teams will receive direct grant funding of up to $50,000, in addition to a required local match. 
 georgia power is the lead sponsor of the program, with additional financial support from the atlanta regional commission. 
 additional partners include: association county commissioners of georgia, georgia centers for innovation, georgia chamber of commerce, georgia department of community affairs, georgia municipal association, metro atlanta chamber and technology association of georgia. 
 ""creating a better-connected georgia requires research and collaboration from many stakeholders across every layer of the public and private sector,"" said christine primmer, strategic manager of the georgia power smart cities initiative. ""we are proud to be a leading partner in the georgia smart communities challenge as one component of our larger commitment to improving every community we serve while also building the future of energy with a more reliable and adaptive power grid."" 
 smart community opportunities can help local governments and the entire region address multiple issues including mobility and economic development, said doug hooker, executive director, atlanta regional commission. 
 ""community initiatives can be more successful through collaborative, people-focused approaches, and those qualities are what make the georgia smart communities challenge an important effort for the region,"" hooker said. 
 a series of 
 workshops and webinars 
 will take place in march and april, including an april 9 event on campus, to assist communities with the application process. each team is required to send at least one representative to at least one of these events.

surfaces-grip-gecko-feet-could-be-easily-mass-produced.txt,"surfaces that grip like gecko feet could be easily mass-produced 
 the science behind sticky gecko's feet lets these materials pick up about anything, and now they could be easily mass-produced. 
 the inset on the upper right illustrates how the gecko adhesion surface is made by pushing lab razor blades into a setting polymer. the razor blades are pulled out, leaving indentations and stretching some of the polymer up, resulting in flexible walls that produce the gecko adhesion effect. credit: georgia tech / varenberg lab 
 may 07, 2020 
 - atlanta, ga 
 why did the gecko climb the skyscraper? because it could; its toes stick to about anything. engineers can already emulate the secrets of gecko stickiness to make strips of rubbery materials that can pick up and release objects, but simple mass production for everyday use has been out of reach until now. 
 researchers at the georgia institute of technology have developed,  in a new study , a method of making gecko-inspired adhesive materials that is much more cost-effective than current methods. it could enable mass production and the spread of the versatile gripping strips to manufacturing and homes. 
 polymers with ""gecko adhesion"" surfaces could be used to make extremely versatile grippers to pick up very different objects even on the same assembly line. they could make picture hanging easy by adhering to both the picture and the wall at the same time. vacuum cleaner robots with gecko adhesion could someday scoot up tall buildings to clean facades. 
 ""with the exception of things like teflon, it will adhere to anything. this is a clear advantage in manufacturing because we don't have to prepare the gripper for specific surfaces we want to lift. gecko-inspired adhesives can lift flat objects like boxes then turn around and lift curved objects like eggs and vegetables,"" said michael varenberg, the study's principal investigator and an  assistant professor in georgia tech's george w. woodruff school of mechanical engineering . 
 current grippers on assembly lines, such as clamps, magnets, and suction cups, can each lift limited ranges of objects. grippers based on gecko-inspired surfaces, which are dry and contain no glue or goo, could replace many grippers or just fill in capability gaps left by other gripping mechanisms. 
 drawing out razors 
 the adhesion comes from protrusions a few hundred microns in size that often look like sections of short, floppy walls running parallel to each other across the material's surface. how they work by mimicking geckos' feet is explained below. 
 up to now, molding has produced these mesoscale walls by pouring ingredients onto a template, letting the mixture react and set to a flexible polymer then removing it from the mold. but the method is inconvenient. 
 ""molding techniques are expensive and time-consuming processes. and there are issues with getting the gecko-like material to release from the template, which can disturb the quality of the attachment surface,"" varenberg said. 
 the researchers' new method formed those walls by pouring ingredients onto a smooth surface instead of a mold, letting the polymer partially set then dipping rows of laboratory razor blades into it. the material set a little more around the blades, which were then drawn out, leaving behind micron-scale indentations surrounded by the desired walls. 
 varenberg and first author jae-kang kim published details of their new method  in the journal  acs applied materials & interfaces  on april 6, 2020. 
 forget about perfection 
 though the new method is easier than molding, developing it took a year of dipping, drawing, and readjusting while surveying finicky details under an electron microscope. 
 ""there are many parameters to control: viscosity and temperature of the liquid; timing, speed, and distance of withdrawing the blades. we needed enough plasticity of the setting polymer to the blades to stretch the walls up, and not so much rigidity that would lead the walls to rip up,"" varenberg said. 
 gecko-inspired surfaces have a fine topography on a micron-scale and sometimes even on a nanoscale, and surfaces made via molding are usually the most precise. but such perfection is unnecessary; the materials made with the new method did the job well and were also markedly robust. 
 ""many researchers demonstrating gecko adhesion have to do it in a cleanroom in clean gear. our system just plain works in normal settings. it is robust and simple, and i think it has good potential for use in industry and homes,"" said varenberg, who studies surfaces in nature to mimic their advantageous qualities in human-made materials.

 behold the gecko's foot. it has ridges on its toes, and this has led some in the past to think their feet stick by suction or some kind of clutching by the skin. 
 but electron microscopes reveal a deeper structure - spatula-shaped bristly fibrils protrude a few dozen microns long off those ridges. the fibrils make such thorough contact with surfaces down to the nanoscale that weak attractions between atoms on both sides appear to add up enormously to create overall strong adhesion. 
 in place of fluff, engineers have developed rows of shapes covering materials that produce the effect. a common shape makes a material's surface look like a field of mushrooms that are a few hundred microns in size; another is rows of short walls like those in this study. 
 ""the mushroom patterns touch a surface, and they are attached straightaway, but detaching requires applying forces that can be disadvantageous. the wall-shaped projections require minor shear force like a tug or a gentle grab to generate adherence, but that is easy, and letting go of the object is uncomplicated, too,"" varenberg said. 
 varenberg's research team used the drawing method to make walls with u-shaped spaces in between them and walls with v-shaped spaces in between. they worked with polyvinylsiloxane (pvs) and polyurethane (pu). the v-shape made in pvs worked best, but polyurethane is the better material for industry, so vanenberg's group will now work toward achieving the v-shape gecko gripping pattern in pu for the best possible combination.

surveillance-testing-shown-reduce-community-covid-19-spread.txt,"surveillance testing shown to reduce community covid-19 spread 
 in early 2020, georgia tech researchers designed a saliva-based polymerase chain reaction (pcr) test and encouraged community members to test weekly to track the health of the campus. 
 feb 07, 2022 
 covid-19 is often asymptomatic and can lead infected individuals to spread the disease without knowing it. yet, regular surveillance testing of a community can catch these cases and prevent outbreaks. 
 in early 2020, georgia tech researchers designed a saliva-based polymerase chain reaction (pcr) test and encouraged community members to test weekly to track the health of the campus. their strategy confirmed 62% of the campus' positive cases in the fall 2020 semester. the method of surveillance testing - focusing on case clusters and then having patients isolate - reduced positivity rates from 4.1% in the beginning of the semester to below 0.5% mid-semester. their findings were published in the journal 
 epidemiology . 
 ""one of the ways you can mitigate spread is not to think about testing as just an indicator for how bad things are, but actually use enough testing that you can begin to pull infected people out of circulation to reduce the spread,"" said joshua weitz, georgia tech professor in the 
 school of biological sciences 
 who developed the infectious disease models used to monitor campus. 
 surveillance testing not only kept the community safe, but also enabled an open campus during a period of the pandemic when vaccines were not available. the strategy showed that combining multiple mitigation efforts - from testing to social distancing - can keep a university operational. 
 designing the test 
 the program relied on saliva pcr tests compared to the more common nasal swab pcr tests. 
 ""i saw data very early on that the saliva tests were actually probably a little bit more sensitive than the nasal ones,"" said greg gibson, professor in the 
 school of biological sciences . ""i just knew that students would be more likely to do something that takes 30 seconds to give us spit. it's easy and safe, so it was just a no-brainer."" 
 saliva-based tests were a practical solution for a campus. the test could be self-administered, requiring fewer medical personnel and creating ease of access for students. the tests were also safer than nasal swabs because the collection tube contained a viral deactivation buffer that killed active virus but preserved the rna at room temperature for analysis. 
 the georgia tech campus biomedical research labs were also ideal for this type of test. andrés garcía, executive director of the 
 parker h. petit institute for bioengineering & bioscience , realized robotics labs could build and run tests and make the program scalable. 
 ""testing requires precisely distributing different amounts of fluid to volumes, and this is a task really well suited for a robot,"" garcía said. ""with the large number of tests that we were expecting to need to administer, there was really no choice because having the robot really cut down on the human error."" 
 another novel strategy was double pooling. each saliva sample was pooled twice into a group of five samples and processed. this had multiple advantages, according to gibson. one was it prevented false results because each sample had to test positive twice to be considered positive. and, by pooling, the testing system could clear dozens of individuals at once, while also focusing on a positive individual and then referring them for further diagnostic testing. 
 ""a purely surveillance test where you don't give anybody results can be done without much regulation, but it's minimally useful,"" said gibson, who is a regents' professor, tom and marie patton chair in biological sciences, and serves as director of the center for integrative genomics at georgia tech. ""the double pooling strategy was a way for us to be able to identify exactly who was responsible for positive tests, and then go back to their original test and do a diagnostic one in a clia-certified lab."" clia (clinical laboratory improvement amendments) certification indicates a lab has met federal quality standards for diagnostic testing on human samples. 
 the testing strategy 
 creating an effective testing infrastructure was also key to the success of the program. a university is a high-density environment where a community lives, learns, and works. when the program was first implemented in the fall 2020 semester, georgia tech had 7,370 people in residence and 5,000 students, faculty, and staff who visited daily. 
 with the ability to run 1,500 tests at the beginning of the semester and up to 2,850 by the end, the program enabled most people on campus to test weekly. testing weekly helped catch cases early with covid-19's seven-day incubation period, and positive individuals isolated for 10 days. 
 part of why this approach was so successful was because of what gibson calls ""synergistic effectiveness."" by combining testing with mitigation strategies like masking and social distancing, georgia tech was able to reduce positivity rates. 
 ""we've shown that testing doesn't have to be comprehensive with everybody testing every other day to be effective,"" gibson said. 
 this strategy enabled the researchers to focus on campus hotspots and control spread. in the beginning of the fall 2020 semester, campus positivity was at 0.5% until a cluster was identified in greek housing in august. this enabled a targeted campaign where 90% of on-campus residents were tested. the asymptomatic positivity rate peaked at 4.1%, but steadily declined back to 0.5% by mid-september thanks to rapid identification and isolation of positive individuals. 
 ""we are a technical university - that doesn't have a medical school or a school of public health - that developed its own effective testing program and was able to deploy it to test a large segment of the population and keep the campus in operation,"" said garcía, who additionally holds the petit director's chair in bioengineering and bioscience and is a regents' professor in the 
 george w. woodruff school of mechanical engineering . 
 due to the success of surveillance testing, cases were kept at a manageable number. most importantly, campus was able to stay open throughout the pandemic. the georgia state legislature also adopted georgia tech's surveillance testing system in january 2021 and is using the program to track and manage cases during this year's legislative session. the strategy continues to keep georgia tech an active campus with in-person learning as the pandemic evolves. ideally, the program established at georgia tech will remain in place, prepared to deal quickly with future infectious disease epidemics should the need arise, according to gibson. 
 ""we developed a program that in practice - and psychologically - provided a benefit to community members,"" said weitz, who also serves as the tom and marie patton chair in biological sciences and co-director of the interdisciplinary ph.d. in quantitative biosciences. ""many people could go get tested and know that they weren't infectious so that they had a less likely chance of infecting others. or, if they did end up testing positive, they were able to isolate themselves so they didn't infect others. that is of significant benefit.""

 coulter department chair earns one of the highest honors in health and medicine 
 ladies and gentlemen of the academies 
 oct 19, 2020 
 - atlanta, ga 
 the national academy of medicine ( nam ) has elected georgia tech professor 
 susan margulies 
 to its prestigious 2020 class. election to nam is considered one of the highest honors in the fields of health and medicine and recognizes individuals who have demonstrated outstanding professional achievement and commitment to service. she is only the second person from georgia tech to receive the honor. the late bob nerem, founding director of the petit institute for bioengineering and bioscience, is the other. 
 established originally as the institute of medicine in 1970 by the national academy of sciences, the nam addresses critical issues in health, science, medicine and related policy and inspires positive actions across sectors. 
 margulies is the wallace h. coulter professor and chair in the wallace h. coulter department of biomedical engineering (bme) at georgia institute of technology and emory university, a shared department between the two schools. she is also a georgia research alliance eminent scholar in injury biomechanics. her research interests center around traumatic brain injury in children and ventilator-induced lung injury with a focus in these areas on prevention, intervention, and treatments. 
 ""we are incredibly proud and offer our warmest congratulations to susan margulies as she is named to the 2020 class of the national academy of medicine,"" said steven w. mclaughlin, provost and executive vice president for academic affairs at georgia tech. ""this well-deserved distinction is a testament to her as an exemplary scholar, leader, and collaborator."" 
 new nam members are elected by current members through a process that recognizes individuals who have made major contributions to the advancement of the medical sciences, healthcare, and public health. 
 margulies came to georgia tech and emory in 2017 from the university of pennsylvania. she now leads a bme department that is consistently ranked as one of the nation's most prominent programs of its kind in both graduate and undergraduate education. in september,  u.s. news & world report  ranked bme's graduate and undergraduate programs no. 2 in the u.s. it is the largest bme department in the country, with 68 faculty members on two campuses and more than 1,500 undergraduate and graduate students. 
 margulies, also a member of the petit institute, earned her bse in mechanical and aerospace engineering at princeton university and a ph.d. in bioengineering from the university of pennsylvania. she completed a postdoctoral fellowship at mayo medical school. in february, margulies was also elected to the national academy of engineering, which is among the highest professional distinctions conferred on an engineer. 
 other academy admissions 
 in fact, seven faculty members from all kinds of disciplines at georgia tech were elected to the national academy of engineering, national academy of sciences, and the american academy of arts and sciences during the spring. 
 the induction of three georgia tech scholars into the national academy of sciences marked a significant milestone for the institute. it's the first time three members of the tech community joined the academy in the same year - and they represent three different colleges. 
 marilyn brown 
 (who also joined the national academy of engineering and was part of a 2007 nobel peace prize-winning team) studies energy in the school of public policy, 
 randall engle 
 studies attention and memory in the school of psychology, and 
 arkadi nemirovski 
 studies optimization in the h. milton stewart school of industrial and systems engineering. 
 until now, just one current faculty member was among the academy's membership. 
 georgia tech researchers make up more than 10% of the national academy of engineering's membership, a number that grew by four this spring. 
 that includes 
 marilyn brown . while brown is not strictly an engineer, the academy cited her for bridging engineering, policy, and social and behavioral studies to achieve cleaner energy. 
 the other new members are 
 thomas kurfess , who has helped guide the digital transformation of manufacturing in the george w. woodruff school of mechanical engineering; 
 alexander shapiro 
 in the h. milton stewart school of industrial and systems engineering, who studies optimization modeling that involves uncertainty; and 
 susan margulies . 
 the list of this year's inductees into the american academy of arts and sciences includes artists and activists, lawyers and experimentalists, bioethicists and anthropologists. singer / songwriter joan baez, filmmaker richard linklater, and former u.s. attorney general eric holder are some of the newest members. 
 so, too, is 
 susan lozier , dean and betsy middleton and john clark sutherland chair in georgia tech's college of sciences. lozier studies the ocean and large-scale circulation, particularly the seas' role in climate variability and climate change. 
 she joins six other georgia tech faculty members in the academy, which was founded in 1780 by john adams, john hancock, and others to advance learning in service to the public good.

 researchers have taken an important step toward creating a new technique for repairing intestinal injuries.

 oct 23, 2017 
 - atlanta, ga 
 by combining engineered polymeric materials known as hydrogels with complex intestinal tissue known as organoids - made from human pluripotent stem cells - researchers have taken an important step toward creating a new technology for controlling the growth of these organoids and using them for treating wounds in the gut that can be caused by disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease (ibd). 
 investigators from the georgia institute of technology and the university of michigan reported this research october 23 in the journal 
 nature cell biology . the research, done in an animal model, was supported by the national institutes of health, the crohn's and colitis foundation, and the regenerative engineering and medicine research center operated by emory university, georgia tech and the university of georgia. 
 the authors used the engineered hydrogels to create a 3d growth environment - known as a matrix - which provides optimal physical and biochemical support for organoid growth. earlier approaches to creating this growth environment, pioneered by study co-author jason spence, associate professor of internal medicine at the university of michigan, had used a natural matrix derived from a tumor cell line. the use of animal products is a significant clinical challenge due to potential zoonotic infections, which can be spread from animals to humans. 
 ""the use of a mouse tumor-derived matrix would limit any future applications of these organoid technologies in humans, and this work opens the door to research directed specifically for clinical applications,"" noted asma nusrat, study co-author and the aldred scott warthin professor and director of experimental pathology in the university of michigan's school of medicine. 
 in addition to allowing growth of organoids within the engineered hydrogel in a tissue culture incubator, the research team demonstrated that the hydrogel could act like glue, allowing organoids to stick in place and contribute to wound healing when transplanted into an injured mouse intestine. the success could point the way to a new type of therapy aimed at repairing intestinal damage in humans, and potentially for repairing damage in other organs. 
 ""we have shown that the hydrogel matrix helps the human intestinal organoids (hios) engraft into the intestinal tissue, that they differentiate and accelerate the healing of the wound,"" said 
 andrés j. garcía , regents' professor in georgia tech's 
 woodruff school of mechanical engineering . ""this work provides a proof of principle for using stem cell-derived human intestinal organoids in a therapeutic setting."" 
 because the hydrogels are based on defined synthetic materials, they offer an advantage for potential therapeutic use in the body. 
 ""the fully defined nature of these synthetic bioengineered hydrogels could make them ideal for use in human patients in the event that hios are used for therapy in the future,"" said miguel quirós, a university of michigan postdoctoral fellow and co-lead author in the study. added nusrat: ""in this work, we demonstrated that the hydrogels facilitate the transplantation of hios into an injured intestine, suggesting that this technique has significant implications for treating intestinal injuries caused by diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease."" 
 the synthetic matrix, developed at georgia tech, can be easily modified to suit the needs of the cells being hosted. for instance, georgia tech graduate student ricardo cruz-acuña, the paper's co-lead author, experimented with several combinations before determining that a hydrogel made up of 96 percent water and containing a particular cell adhesion peptide was ideal for the hios. 
 using a tiny colonoscope, quirós and cruz-acuña delivered the hydrogel, along with the organoids, into wounds that had been made in the intestines of immune-compromised mice. the implanted cells were labeled so they could be detected later. after four weeks, the hios had completely engrafted into the injured area, forming 3d structures resembling normal tissue. the synthetic hydrogel had disappeared, replaced by natural extracellular matrix produced by the cells themselves. 
 ""because our hydrogel system is easily modified, we can just alter other parameters to create the mechanical and biological properties desired to support many types of cells or organoids,"" said garcía, who holds the rae s. and frank h. neely chair. ""the specifics may be different for other cells intended for different applications."" 
 as next steps, the researchers would like to test their hydrogel matrix in animals with normal immune systems and in disease models. they may also need to optimize the method for delivering the hydrogel material containing the hios to replace the labor-intensive techniques used in the research. garcía, nusrat and spence expect that trials in large animals would likely be needed before any human trials could be considered. 
 beyond the intestinal applications, the researchers are also studying the use of hydrogels to deliver organoids to damaged kidneys and lungs. 
 in addition to those already mentioned, the research team included priya h. dedhia, sha huang, vicky garcía-hernández, alyssa j. miller and dorothée siuda at the university of michigan; and attila farkas from the hungarian institute of sciences.

 just tiny puddles. that's what some of our cells' organelles are, and this synthetic organelle, engineered in the lab, shows how they can work.

 sep 20, 2018 
 - atlanta, ga 
 a couple of sugars, a dash of enzymes, a pinch of salt, a splash of a real common lab chemical, all arranged in watery baths. and researchers had made a synthetic organelle, which they used in a 
 new study 
 to explore some odd cellular biochemistry. 
 the researchers at the georgia institute of technology made the chemical medley in the lab to closely mimic membraneless organelles, mini-organs in cells that are not contained in a membrane but exist as pools of watery solutions, or puddles. and their model demonstrated how, with just a few ingredients, the organelles could carry out fine-tuned biological processes. 
 the researchers 
 published the results of their study in the journal 
 acs applied materials & interfaces 
 for the september 26, 2018 issue. the research was funded by the national institutes of health's national institute of general medical science and by the national science foundation. 
 a quick look at membraneless organelles should aid in understanding the research's significance. 
 what are membraneless organelles? 
 organelles that are pools of watery solutions and not objects with membranes are a fairly recent discovery. a prime example is the 
 nucleolus . it resides inside of the cell's nucleus, which is an organelle that does have a membrane. 
 in the past, researchers thought the nucleolus disappeared during cell division and reappeared later. in the meantime, researchers have realized that the nucleolus has no membrane and that during cell division it gets diffused the way water bubbles do in vinaigrette dressing that has been shaken up. 
 ""after cell division, the nucleolus comes back together as a single compartment of fluid,"" said 
 shuichi takayama, the study's principal investigator and a professor in the wallace e. coulter department of biomedical engineering at georgia tech and emory university . 
 membraneless organelles can be made up of a few different aqueous solutions, each with different solutes like proteins or sugar or rna or salt. differences in the 
 thermodynamics 
 of the solutions, that is, how their molecules bounce around, keep them from merging into a single solution. 
 instead, they 
 phase separate 
 the way oil and water do, even after intermingling. but there's no oil in this case. 
 ""they're all waters,"" takayama said. ""they just don't mix with each other because they have different solutes."" 
 what lifelike processes did the synthetic experiment demonstrate? 
 during intermingling, important things happen. the nucleolus, for example, is vital to dna transcription. but the synthetic set-up, a collection of watery solutions made by the study's first author, taisuke kojima, carried out a simpler series of reactions that demonstrated how membraneless organelles could process sugar. 
 ""we had three phases of solutions that each held different reactants,"" kojima said. ""it was like a ball with three layers: an outer solution, an intermediate solution, and a core solution. glucose was in the outer layer; an enzyme,  glucose oxidase , was in the second layer, and  horseradish peroxidase  was in the core along with a colorimetric substrate that gave us a visible signal when the last reaction we were looking for occurred."" 
 the glucose in the outer layer interfaced with the glucose oxidase in the second layer, which catalyzed the glucose to hydrogen peroxide. it landed in the second layer and interfaced with the horseradish peroxidase in the core layer, which catalyzed the hydrogen peroxide along with the compound that turns colors, which changed the color of the core layer. 
 ""this type of cascading reaction is what one would expect to see membraneless organelles perform,"" takayama said. 
 the cascade even transported each reaction product from one compartment to the next, something very typical in biological processes, like organs digesting food or an organelle processing molecules. 
 what can a surprise discovery teach us? 
 part of the reaction took the researchers by surprise, and it resulted in a novel discovery. 
 ""when researchers think about membraneless organelles, we often think that the reactions inside them are more efficient when their enzymes and 
 substrates 
 are in the same compartment,"" takayama said. ""but in our experiments, that actually slowed the reaction down. we said, ‘whoa, what's going on here?'"" 
 ""when the substrate is in the same place where the product of the reaction also builds up, the enzyme sometimes gets confused, and that can impede the reaction,"" said kojima, who is a postdoctoral researcher in takayama's lab. ""i was pretty surprised to see it."" 
 kojima put the enzymes and substrate into separate solutions, which interfaced but did not merge to a single solution, and the reaction in his synthetic organelle worked efficiently. this showed how unexpected subtleties may be fine-tuning organelle chemistry. 
 ""it was a goldilocks regime, not too much contact between substrate and enzyme, not too little, just right,"" takayama said. 
 ""sometimes, in a cell, a substrate is not abundant and may need to be concentrated in its own little compartment and then brought into contact with the enzyme,"" takayama said. ""by contrast, some substrates can be very abundant in the nucleus, and it might be important to partition them off from enzymes to get just enough contact for the right kind of reaction.""

targeting-radiation-resistance-why-some-tumors-are-so-stubborn.txt,"targeting radiation resistance: why some tumors are so stubborn 
 kemp lab uses genome-scale modeling to understand tumor metabolism and predict tumors' responses to radiation therapy 
 melissa kemp and josh lewis have used genome-scale modeling to predict tumors' responses to radiation therapy. 
 may 11, 2021 
 - atlanta, ga 
 radiation therapy has been - and will be - a cornerstone of cancer treatment for good reason: it works. 
 mostly. 
 currently, more than half of cancer patients receive radiation as part of their treatment. but 20 percent of them, give or take, will find that they need different options because their tumors are resistant to radiation therapy. it's a bad place to be: they may still face the potential side effects without the therapeutic benefit, and they've lost precious time. 
 what if clinicians had a way to predict and possibly improve radiosensitivity for individual patients? a team of researchers at the georgia institute of technology and emory university is working on something with that ultimate goal in mind. 
 ""there still isn't a great understanding of why some tumors don't respond well to radiation, and it's a significant hurdle to the long-term survival of many patients,"" noted 
 joshua lewis , who sought answers to the radiation resistance question while a graduate student in the lab of 
 melissa kemp 
 in the wallace h. coulter department of biomedical engineering. 
 together, they've taken steps to begin to understand the underlying metabolism and build a tool to predict whether specific tumors will be one of the stubborn ones that doesn't respond. in back-to-back papers, with lewis as lead author, kemp said they created a new pipeline, ""in which you can automatically take data, plug it into our whole cell modeling of metabolism, and actually predict the way certain tumors of various cancer types, from various patients, are going to respond."" 
 she added: ""this is the first example of really asking, with respect to radiation resistance, why there are differences that manifest themselves in tumor metabolism."" 
 in january, they published the first study with collaborators from wake forest and indiana university in the journal 
 cell systems . 
 the newest research appears this month in 
 nature communications . 
 lewis based the studies on his ph.d. thesis, ""genome-scale modeling of redox metabolism and therapeutic response in radiation-resistant tumors,"" which he defended a year ago. 
 shortly after lewis began grad school, wake forest researcher cristina furdui approached the kemp lab with the radiation resistance problem, ""asking us to apply our expertise in systems biology,"" he said. ""it's a more holistic approach than working with individual molecules or proteins, taking into account many different factors and their interactions, seeing if that leads to a particular response to radiation therapy."" 
 lewis used a well-established type of cellular modeling called ""flux balance analysis,"" in which, ""you try to model the entire metabolism of a cell - all the different chemical reactions. we model them using different biochemical equations."" the researchers then plug those equations into a computer. within seconds, they can accurately analyze about 13,000 different metabolic reactions. 
 ""we came up with our own approach for making more accurate flux balance analysis models by integrating multiple different types of omics data,"" said lewis, now pursuing his medical degree in the emory md / phdprogram. ""omics"" measure characteristics of molecules like genes, proteins, or metabolites, which comprise the cells of an organism. 
 by integrating genomics, transcriptomics, and metabolomics data, the researchers could model redox metabolism - the process of oxidation and reduction reactions, or the loss and gain of electrons - in cancer cells, ""and use that to accurately predict how certain tumors react to radiation therapy,"" said lewis, who mined data from the cancer genome atlas (tcga). 
 ""we looked for metabolic enzymes or metabolic targets where, if you tweaked them, it could affect a tumor's radiosensitivity,"" lewis said. ""so, imagine if you're giving a patient radiation therapy, and you could also give them a chemotherapeutic at the same time that inhibits the action of a particular enzyme to make a tumor more sensitive to radiation."" 
 that is, essentially, the first paper. in the second - written only by lewis and kemp - the researchers integrated machine learning with genome-scale metabolic modeling, ""to see if we can better predict what sort of biological features are associated with a patient's response to radiation."" 
 one main challenge for the researchers in either paper, lewis said, was in the datasets they used from tcga. they had good genomics and transcriptomics data, but their metabolomics data was incomplete. the computational models they developed for the 
 cell systems 
 paper helped fill in the blanks, making metabolomic predictions. they fed the data from those models into a machine learning model to better identify biomarkers of radiation resistance. 
 ""we can think clinically of a patient giving a blood sample, and from that blood you're able to measure the levels of different metabolites and determine if the patient would be a good candidate for radiation therapy, or whether we should go ahead and think of other therapies,"" lewis said. 
 that speaks directly to what lewis is training for now in his m.d. program. he wants to be a pathologist and better understand how patients respond to different therapies. 
 ""i'd like to help bridge the gap between research and the clinic,"" he said. 
 he's off to a good start, and it's exciting for kemp. 
 ""josh's computational platform turns easy-to-acquire data into a model representation of hard-to-acquire attributes, like metabolic fluxes and metabolite changes, that are otherwise very challenging to measure with the scale it takes to cover many different patients,"" she said. 
 this research was supported by a national institutes of health / national cancer institute fellowship (f30 ca224968), an nih / nci u01 grant (ca215848), and the wake forest baptist comprehensive cancer center (nih / nci p30 ca12197).

teaching-leadership-skills-engineers-and-scientists.txt,"teaching leadership skills to engineers and scientists 
 dennis hess helps prepare engineers and scientists with the skills required for leadership roles, and he recently published a book on the subject.

 dennis hess wants to help prepare engineers and scientists with the skills required for leadership roles. so, not only has he developed a leadership course for chemical engineering majors, he also recently published his first book on the subject. 
 ""the whole effort on leadership was an outgrowth of one of our required courses in chemical engineering,"" said hess, professor and thomas c. deloach, jr. chair, in the school of chemical and biomolecular engineering. 
 chemical engineering seniors must take a course in chemical and process safety (chbe 4515).  about 15 years ago, hess began teaching the course, which had been offered for about six years before he started teaching it. after teaching the course for one semester, he decided to incorporate some exercises on ethics, professionalism, and decision-making. 
 ""when you make decisions in a chemical process - or any process - you're looking at cost, profits, safety, ethics, and all the interactions of these different things. and, of course, there isn't a clean answer,"" hess said. ""you're optimizing, trying to get the best situation. i found that students had very little insight into how to think about that. they knew how to make good decisions if they based it on technical information. but when you take other things into account - the ethical and behavioral questions - this is what a leader deals with all of the time."" 
 four years ago, hess wondered if students could benefit from having some background in leadership as viewed through their technical background and mindset. he reflected on his time as a leader and how he, as a technical person, interacted with non-technical people and dealt with biases, values, priorities, and beliefs of individuals. 
 ""i realized that i think about things in a certain way. i interact mostly with technical people, and with very few people outside [the technical field]. the biggest issues you encounter are soft-skill issues,"" he said. 
 so, hess approached david sholl, the department chair, with an idea to teach a course focusing on the problems that leaders face early in their career. he could not find many books or articles that dealt with early career leadership issues. 
 ""leadership books are usually written by mbas because they are frequently the people in high-level leadership positions,"" he said. ""and, people in those positions deal with somewhat different types of problems than the ones you deal with early in your career."" 
 he likes a particular quote that sums up the situation nicely: ""good judgment is the result of experience, and experience is the result of bad judgment."" 
 hess says, ""that is how we learn. it's instructive, but it's a slow process because you aren't going to make all of the mistakes within a reasonable time frame."" 
 in class, hess likes to present scenarios and then ask students to make decisions or suggest approaches to dilemmas based on that information. for example, he asks them to imagine they are the project leader in charge of putting a team together. there is a person who is among the most talented in the field, but he is rude, arrogant, impatient, and people quit the team when they have to work with him. should you put him on the team? what are the consequences of putting him on the team or not putting him on the team? if you put him on the team, how do you manage that? 
 ""there is no good, hard answer,"" hess said. ""and, that drives technical people up the wall! they want to know the answer. there is no right answer to most of these situations. you figure out the best thing to do given all of your constraints, analogous to solving design problems, but with people difficulties added to the mix."" 
 one of the points he makes is that the same leadership dilemma can exist in two different organizations or teams, but the best approach may be different. that's because the people, personalities, cultures, and time frames are different. 
 ""i don't claim that the course will take care of these problems,"" he said. ""what it is intended to do is build awareness that these kinds of situations exist and to discuss ways to think about addressing such issues."" 
 his advice to students is: don't get frustrated. use your technical skills - organization, critical thinking, and creative problem-solving - to solve the people issues. 
 the class is offered to graduate students in the fall and to undergraduates in the spring. so far, the course has been available only to chemical engineering students. after his second time teaching the course, hess decided to turn his class notes and slides into his first book. the title is 
 leadership by engineers and scientists: professional skills needed to succeed in a changing world , and it was published in april by the american institute of chemical engineers in association with wiley. 
 the book is brief by design, fewer than 250 pages, with lots of references for more information. it is written as a textbook, with homework questions as well as many discussion questions and scenarios, and ways to think about some of the situations. hess will use the book in his class this fall, but he said the book also will be useful for others. 
 ""anyone who is considering or has recently been placed in a leadership position should benefit from the perspective offered in this book,"" he said. ""if you aren't in a formal leadership position, it will help you to understand what your manager is going through. and, this should help you become a better employee.""

team-demonstrates-digital-health-platform-department-veterans-affairs.txt,"team demonstrates digital health platform for department of veterans affairs 
 a public-private team has developed a proof-of-concept digital health platform for the department of veterans afffairs. 
 the veterans health administration serves more than 8 million veterans a year through more than 1,700 sites of care. among them is the atlanta va medical center, shown here. (credit: vha) 
 jan 31, 2017 
 - atlanta, ga 
 ""liberate the data."" that was a principal design goal for a team of public-private health care technology collaborators established by the u.s. department of veterans affairs and veterans health administration to develop a working and scalable proof-of-concept 
 digital health platform 
 (dhp) to support the department's long-term vision. 
 the open-source project demonstrated both proven and emerging technologies for interoperability and advanced functionality innovations from both the public and private sectors. the proof-of-concept delivers capabilities that va and vha leadership had identified as strategically important to support clinical and operational policy and program transformation plans needed to address expected changes in veteran populations, service needs and care delivery models. 
 for example, the demonstration included the capability to obtain patient data from disparate military and commercial electronic records systems, and accept information from a broad range of ancillary services and consumer medical devices. 
 the public-private collaboration, established in partnership with the va's office of information and technology, included the vha, office of the national coordinator for health information technology (onc), the georgia institute of technology and private-sector companies providing services in analytics, customer relationship management, and application program interfaces. georgia tech served as the project's lead architect and provided overall project management. 
 ""if you can liberate the data from deep inside a system and securely move it to the cloud and manage its movement through well-designed application programming interfaces (apis), that gives you a lot of options for reorganizing work flows and processes,"" said steve rushing, senior strategic adviser in georgia tech's health extension services. ""we are doing for health care what has already been done for other industries that have used interoperability standards as the foundation for apis to exchange information among different systems."" 
 the team - including partner organizations salesforce (crm), mulesoft (api gateway), apervita (real-time analytics) and ucb (portfolio of predictive analytics solutions for epilepsy) - conducted its first demonstration just six weeks after the contract with the va was signed. using fast healthcare interoperability resources (fhir), a standard describing health data formats and elements, and a rest api transport protocol, the team built an api gateway surrounding vista and georgia tech's testing and teaching electronic health record system, known as gtonfhir. the project used anonymous patient data. 
 the overall project created 21 system apis, which control how specific types of data flow into and out of the dhp. this included data exchanges with the cerner ehr (representing the department of defense and a community hospital), duke university medical center (epic) as an academic medical provider, docsnap personal health record (connecting to a navy medicine pilot project), and personal health monitoring devices via apple healthkit and validic. 
 results of the proof-of-concept collaboration point to better experiences for veterans, said laverne council, who was the va's chief information officer at the time the project was conducted. 
 ""the dhp leverages the power of public-private partnerships,"" she said. ""we brought together some of the brightest engineers and health informaticists from some of the most innovative companies and assembled them at georgia tech. there, over a period of eight weeks, we established an api gateway, the cornerstone of the digital health platform, consisting of 21 apis that connected to three different ehr systems including our own, vista, a class leading customer relationship management system, georgia tech's fast healthcare interoperability resources (fhir) server, and a real time analytics system. we also developed a veteran-facing mobile app. we integrated low-cost, high-quality video communication into the fabric of the veteran experience, and we integrated internet-connected health devices that track activities and vitals including blood pressure, weight and blood glucose."" 
 because the architecture is not tied to any proprietary system, the proof-of-concept accommodates future developments by connecting to and from other web services, apps, devices or electronic health systems that use the fhir or other accepted industry open standards, rushing said. also, by keeping much of the original vista system accessible via the api gateway, the strategy protects the investment in and could accelerate the deployment of the agency's existing health information technology innovations across the vha system during the period of full dhp component acquisition and deployment, he explained. 
 ""in electronic health records, like almost any other major enterprise application, about 60 percent of the code is tied to routine workflow needed on a day-to-day basis. changing these doesn't add strategic value because the new programming will look much like the old,"" rushing said. ""the important strategic implementation is done at the edges of the system, and that's where the va wanted us to focus our interoperability engineering and demonstrate the power of liberating the data. by using an architecture that is api-driven, we addressed the interoperability requirement, kept what works and added new vha-created and private industry innovations where needed."" 
 among the innovations is an analytics layer. by studying the health records of service members transitioning from active duty to veteran status, the analytics layer makes recommendations about care, such as enrollment in specialized services for veterans suffering from traumatic brain injury (tbi). 
 ""this is basically doing the same thing - with a different intent - that happens every time you sign into facebook or amazon,"" said rushing. ""the system learns about you from your records to help health professionals precisely meet your personal needs. rather than wait until a veteran has a seizure because of a service-related injury, the system would use the analytics to recommend a protocol for proactively managing the problem."" 
 as an independent third party, georgia tech combined the best components from the va / vha and private sector companies, negotiated any differences and worked with private-sector staff in five different programming teams to meet the va's goals. ""we just wanted the best services for veterans,"" said rushing. ""that was our driving objective."" 
 the demonstration addressed the specific challenges of three groups of former service members: iraq war veterans with traumatic brain injuries, women veterans who need gender-specific services not traditionally provided by the va, and vietnam-era veterans who are now suffering age-related illnesses such as diabetes and congestive heart failure. tbis alone affect some 87,000 veterans. 
 the system was demonstrated to va and vha officials in september and october 2016, and the georgia tech team is now wrapping up the documentation for what has been done. 
 ""the va is looking for a flexible, future-focused health platform and architecture focused on a services-based model,"" said jon duke, m.d., director of georgia tech's center for health analytics and informatics. ""they are taking a really ambitious approach to it, and this could have a tremendous impact on care for veterans as well as on health systems more broadly."" 
 the project illustrates the role georgia tech can play because it doesn't have a medical school or hospital and isn't tied to any specific technology platform. 
 ""when we are working with health systems, we're neither a competitor nor a vendor,"" duke noted. ""we approach each problem from a ‘white hat' perspective, working to find the right data and infrastructure needed, often using open-source platforms."" 
 the impetus for the project was vha strategic planning, started in the spring of 2016, on developing a successor to vista, which has served the agency for 40 years. the strategic planning scope was expanded beyond replacement of vista as a single ehr application system to include best practices driving enterprise information technology modernization across other industries. this included the move to a platform of interoperable cloud-based application system components. 
 the envisioned architecture with its ""liberated data"" allows for clinical and operational functionality extensions over time by connecting a robust portfolio of interoperable web services and mobile app innovations. by building out this architecture, the project demonstrated that these services and apps could be acquired and deployed in alignment with va and vha technology needs for systematically transforming clinical and operations work flows. 
 the proof-of-concept's scope of work included a tactically critical goal: treating vista as just another ehr. the intent was for dhp to not only be agnostic regarding commercial ehrs, but agnostic toward vista as well.  this was achieved by moving vista data and core modules to the cloud and leveraging existing successful va initiatives to build open-source interoperable api gateway connections, such as the enterprise health management platform (ehmp). 
 the independence from commercial ehrs and vista showed that va investments in vista modernization and vha investments in industry leading healthcare information technologies, such as telemedicine and home monitoring, could move forward within the dhp deployment cycle and not wait for full deployment, rushing said.

 bitpay lets businesses accept bitcoin as a form of payment. 
 sep 24, 2014 
 - atlanta, ga 
 to some, thinking about bitcoins may bring visions of a super mario brother jumping to take a glimmering gold circle. to tech alumni tony gallippi and stephen pair, it brought a business opportunity - bitpay. a sponsor of georgia tech athletics this season, bitpay is a payment processor that deals in bitcoins, a virtual currency. founded by pair and gallippi in 2011, bitpay provides a way for businesses to take bitcoin as payment - similar to the way a service provider offers internet service to a home or business. ""it's been a 20-year path for me to get here,"" said pair, who graduated from tech in 1994 and began his career in consulting. ""i recognized money was a worthless piece of paper with worthless ink, which meant it was just an informational thing, and you must be able to replicate it in a computer somehow."" in 2010, he read a whitepaper about bitcoin and, sensing its potential, got in touch with his friend tony. ""the first time we both read about it, we needed to learn more,"" he said. ""after studying it, tony picked up on its ability to solve fraud problems with credit cards."" with their interest piqued, pair and gallippi focused on developing business tools for bitcoin, which led to bitpay. pair and gallippi relocated bitpay to atlanta last year because of the city's financial technology community as well as convenient access to tech students as interns. they've since expanded business into south america and europe, raised more than $30 million in venture funding, and have signed up more than 30,000 merchants for their service. ""our ideal customer right now is an ecommerce customer that is selling products,"" pair said. ""international credit card transactions are risky, the rate of fraud is high and the merchant eats the cost. bitcoin lets you take payment from anywhere on earth."" though bitpay focuses on commercial use, pair encourages people to explore using bitcoin for their personal transactions, starting with 
 bitcoin.org . ""don't put your life savings in it, but download bitcoin software, play around, buy something, test out the technology,"" he said. ""it operates just like cash, but for the internet. you use it the same way you use cash, it's just electronic."" his young son is interested in exploring the technology but is still learning the ropes. a couple years ago he had saved $200 in change and spent hours counting it out to buy an electric scooter. ""he blurted out, ‘bitcoin is way better than this,'"" pair said. ""what he didn't realize is that you pay in exact in amounts with bitcoin, so he wouldn't have had the change in the first place."" though neither pair nor gallippi remembers his first purchase with bitcoin, they remember the significant ones. bitpay 
 used bitcoin 
 to sponsor georgia tech athletics this season, and gallippi used it to buy a tesla.

 - atlanta, ga 
 this week georgia tech surpassed 200,000 covid-19 tests collected and processed on campus since surveillance testing began last fall. the institute's regular testing of students, faculty, and staff has kept the number of positive cases relatively low on campus. 
 in january georgia tech, in collaboration with the georgia department of public health (dph), began administering covid-19 vaccines. health experts recommend that, even though the vaccine is being administered, weekly surveillance testing should continue. 
 ""studies show that the moderna and pfizer vaccines are effective at preventing severe illness from covid-19. what we don't know yet is how effective they are at preventing asymptomatic infection and whether they prevent people from carrying the virus and spreading it to other people,"" said dr. ben holton, senior director of stamps health services. ""that's why the current recommendations from the cdc are, even if you've had two doses of the covid-19 vaccine, you still need to wear a mask and practice social distancing, because we don't know yet if you can spread the virus after being vaccinated. we are encouraging people to continue getting tested after they have had the vaccine."" 
 testing is done on a walk-up basis, is free of charge, and takes just a few minutes. participants should login to 
 mytest.gatech.edu 
 with their georgia tech account, complete the survey, and generate a tracking barcode for the test before visiting one of the 
 testing sites 
 on campus , 
 how testing works 
 the samples are transferred to the test lab three times a day for evaluation. to reduce the number of polymerase chain reaction, or pcr, tests that must be run each day, the saliva samples are pooled so that a single test can examine samples from five individuals. an innovative dual pooling strategy can identify one individual in a set of samples who is presumed positive. 
 what is dual pooling? let's follow your sample: 
 your sample is split into 
 two pools . each pool contains a total of 
 five samples . with six pools from 15 participants, everyone is uniquely in two of the pools. 
 the samples are mixed together and each 
 pooled sample 
 is tested with a single test. 
 everyone who participates in surveillance testing 
 will receive a notification 
 that they are either recommended or not recommended for a follow-up diagnostic test. 
 if 
 neither of your pools 
 comes back positive, then 
 you are informed that you are not recommended for a follow-up test 
 and no further action is required at this time. 
 if 
 both of your 
 pooled samples are positive , your original sample is then 
 tested individually 
 in the clia lab to confirm the sample has sars-cov-2. 
 if 
 one of your pools 
 comes back positive but your 
 other pool does not , then usually 
 your sample was not the positive one . however, sometimes there is ambiguity and the lab retests it anyway, which is why some people are notified that they are recommended for a diagnostic test, but subsequently test negative. this double positive requirement minimizes false positives. 
 the surveillance and diagnostic testing is normally completed within 36 to 48 hours, allowing contact tracers to identify other community members who may have been exposed. 
 surveillance testing participants may notice they are asked to reconsent before their next test when they visit 
 mytest.gatech.edu . the lab will now perform additional tests to identify the strain of virus, for the purpose of informing policy to help keep campus safe. the reconsent acknowledges this fact. individuals will not be provided the strain information, since it does not change any follow-up procedures for a positive result. 
 continued surveillance testing is important in identifying asymptomatic covid-19 members of the tech community and keeping the daily case counts low.

tech-developer-wins-independent-game-festival.txt,"tech developer wins at independent game festival 
 daniel carr recently won an award for the best student game at the recent independent game festival in san francisco. 
 daniel carr accepts the best student game award at the independent game festival. (submitted photo) 
 may 26, 2023 
 from an early age, daniel carr knew exactly what he wanted to do when he grew up. 
 ""when i was in elementary school and was asked, ‘what do you want to be when you're older?' my answer was a game developer,"" he said. 
 in his final semester at tech before graduating with a b.s. in computer science, carr won the best student game award at the independent game festival (igf) in san francisco for his adventure game, 
 slider . 
 he began studying game development in high school, leading him to eventually enter a game jam -- a competition that tasks participants with creating a game from scratch in a short time. though he didn't find immediate success in his first contest, carr kept going. 
 the game, a pc title in which players solve puzzles and rearrange maps to help reconnect humanity, emerged from a competition in november 2021. the game received positive feedback after the jam, and while carr felt like there was more to be done, he nearly let the project fall by the wayside. 
 ""i remember along the way, there was a lot of doubt in me,"" he recalled. ""i asked myself, ‘should i carry this through all the way?' i remember someone telling me that you have to trust yourself at the start of the vision you set out on because while you're working through it, you'll doubt yourself a lot. and, i just did that and kept working on it."" 
 carr looked to the tech community for help and pitched the game to the georgia tech video game development club (vgdev) in january 2022. work on the game continued over the next two semesters, and they submitted 
 slider 
 to igf, which receives over 600 entries, later that year. carr and the team didn't expect a response, but to their surprise, in early january, they were named one of six finalists in the student category. 
 over spring break, carr and six other vgdev members went to san francisco for the conference. carr still didn't believe that winning was a possibility, so when 
 slider 
 was announced during the award ceremony, he was genuinely shocked. he took the stage and reflected on the hard work that went into the game's development by nearly 30 individuals over the years. 
 while winning was a highlight of the trip, carr found himself similarly enthralled with the universal language of gaming. 
 ""one of the coolest things was seeing how much of an international community there is around game development -- there were all sorts of games from european countries, latin america, and all over the world. everyone is making games."" 
 a playable demo of 
 slider 
 is available on steam , and carr plans to leave the link active through development in the hopes of expanding the game's reach. as someone who grew up on pc gaming, he knows the platform is accessible to a vast audience. despite the recent accolades, he explains that the game is not a finished product, but taking his own advice, he plans to trust his vision and keep working on it. 
 with one degree in hand, carr is now interning with amazon and will return to tech in the fall to get his master's degree in computational intelligence. he plans to keep game development as a hobby for the time being but admits that he'll never close the door on pursuing it as a career in the future.

 three of georgia tech's own join the honorary and research organization founded in 1780. 
 rafael bras, marilyn brown, and susan margulies 
 apr 24, 2023 
 a civil engineer, geographer, and biomedical engineer from georgia tech have joined the ranks of distinguished artists, thinkers, and scientists as members of the american academy of arts & sciences, an organization that dates to the early days of the united states. 
 the academy was founded in 1780 by john adams, john hancock, and others to recognize accomplished individuals and engage them in addressing the greatest challenges facing the nation. its membership includes alexander hamilton as well as the man who played him on broadway, lin-manuel miranda - also elected in 2023 with georgia tech's 
 rafael l. bras , 
 marilyn brown , and 
 susan margulies . 
 bras is a civil engineer and hydrologist who served for 10 years as georgia tech's provost and executive vice president for academic affairs. 
 ""i have had a wonderful and fulfilling career and enjoyed my share of awards and recognition. each one has been meaningful and special. but being elected to the american academy of arts & sciences is different,"" said bras, professor and k. harrison brown family chair in the 
 school of civil and environmental engineering . ""i cannot help wondering how this son of a puerto rican civil servant and a home economics teacher got here."" 
 bras is a renowned scholar of earth's water cycle who, early in his career, helped create the field of hydrologic science by reshaping thinking about water in the environment. he has helped lead significant projects around the world, including efforts to protect venice, italy, from flooding. he is a member of the national academy of engineering. 
 ""my mother never understood what i did for a living. if she were alive, i could mention that alexander graham bell and darwin were members. or that tim berners-lee, inventor of the world wide web, and bob metcalf, turing award winner and inventor of the ethernet, are members. she would not be impressed,"" said bras, who is also a faculty member in the school of earth and atmospheric sciences. 
 ""if i mentioned that my name will be forever in a list with the likes of john adams, benjamin franklin, george washington, martin luther king jr., nelson mandela, jimmy carter, hillary clinton, yo-yo ma, pablo casals, tom hanks, lin-manuel miranda, and sonia sotomayor, she would be somewhat incredulous - but impressed and very proud."" 
 most recently, he has been engaged in 
 understanding the occurrence of landslides and related geohazards 
 triggered by heavy rainfalls, including hurricanes, in his native puerto rico. the effort is part of an idea to develop a national center for landslide geohazards research that would be based at georgia tech with hubs on the island and elsewhere. he also is 
 editor of a newsletter for leaders 
 to examine global issues with other research and academic leaders. 
 marilyn brown, regents' professor and brook byers professor of sustainable systems 
 in the 
 school of public policy , is a national leader in climate change mitigation studies. her research focuses on the design and impact of policies aimed at accelerating the development and deployment of sustainable energy technologies. 
 ""i'm grateful and honored to be elected to the company of such esteemed experts,"" said brown. ""i look forward to working with them to foster smart and achievable policy solutions to help advance moves toward a new green economy and a more sustainable tomorrow."" 
 brown created and co-leads the 
 climate and energy policy lab oratory 
 and the master of sustainable energy and environmental management program at georgia tech. leading 
 drawdown georgia , brown and her team track greenhouse gas emissions by source across the state to identify solutions to reach carbon neutrality. she is also a member of the national academy of sciences and national academy of engineering. 
 ""in its earliest days, the academy sought members who would help address issues and opportunities confronting a young nation,"" nancy c. andrews, chair of the academy's board of directors, said in a 
 release 
 announcing the new members. ""we feel a similar urgency and have elected a class that brings diverse expertise to meet the pressing challenges and possibilities that america and the world face today."" 
 an international leader in clean energy policy, brown is known for her pioneering work developing economic-engineering models incorporating behavioral and social science principles into policy analysis of energy systems. her influential research quantified the ""energy-efficiency gap,"" which highlights the importance of promoting cost-effective energy conservation improvements as a tool to improve energy security and reduce the impact of climate change. 
 in 2000, she led the scenarios for a clean energy future project, which at the time was the most detailed carbon-reduction analysis funded by the u.s. department of energy and the u.s. environmental protection agency. 
 later, she contributed to the work of the intergovernmental panel on climate change working group that was a co-recipient of the 2007 nobel peace prize. 
 the academy also elected susan margulies, who remains on the georgia tech faculty 
 as a professor in the 
 wallace h. coulter department of biomedical engineering 
 while leading the national science foundation's  directorate for engineering. 
 she's a research leader in pediatric traumatic brain injury and lung injury associated with mechanical ventilators. she was elected to both the national academy of engineering and the national academy of medicine in 2020. 
 she stepped down as chair of the coulter department in 2021 to accept the nsf appointment. 
 the academy's 2023 class also includes geneticists, historians, economists, and authors. among them are ilya kaminsky, a poet and essayist, and reginald desroches, president of rice university. both are former georgia tech faculty members.

 floyd franklin blair came to georgia tech in 1938, and this nov. 15, he celebrates his 100th birthday.

 - atlanta, ga 
 floyd franklin blair came to georgia tech in 1938, and this nov. 15, he celebrates his 100th birthday. 
 blair arrived at tech with his saxophone and soon joined a band with fellow students. they called themselves the technicians, and they had gigs every friday and saturday evening, as well as playing at sunday afternoon tea dances. during his sophomore year, he was hired by harry hearn's dance band and became a card-carrying professional musician, earning the money to pay for his education. 
 after graduating with an electrical engineering degree in may 1942, with four years of rotc experience, he joined the u.s. army. blair was assigned to the usaaf and sent to randolph field in texas, where he trained as a pilot. only one out of 100 cadets made the cut to become a p-47 pilot, and floyd blair was among them. 
 the p-47 fighter plane was dangerous because it was used for strafing enemy targets, exposing the plane and pilot to the infamous german flak guns. it carried a heavy payload of bombs and was instrumental in winning world war ii. 
 fast forward to d-day, june 1944, and 1st lt. floyd blair was part of the 404th fighter group and a participant in operation overlord, flying his p-47 over the landing on normandy. every pilot had a code name, and blair's was ""ramblin' wreck."" the 404th supported the ground troops at the battle of the bulge as they pushed the front line forward. 
 in september 1944, the town of sint-truiden, belgium, was liberated, and the germans abandoned their air base. the 404th moved out of their tents and onto the base, enjoying decent quarters for the first time since the invasion began. by november, blair organized a five-piece band after requesting instruments and permission to drive to holland to purchase a sound system. the locals spoke flemish and french, which the americans did not understand, so they named the band nix compris, which translates to ""nothing understood."" they were a hit with the locals as well as the troops. 
 blair was promoted to captain in january 1945 and continued to fly mission after mission. when he reached his 100th mission in april 1945, he completed his tour, turned in his parachute, and left the 404th. he was awarded a distinguished unit citation; french croix de guerre with palm; belgian fourragere with palm; campaign medals for normandy, northern france, rhineland, and ardennes-alsace; distinguished flying cross; and an air medal with 15 bronze oak leaf clusters and three silver oak clusters. 
 when blair was discharged, he went to work for westinghouse in florida and became a licensed electrical engineer. the army recalled him to serve for two years during the korean conflict. he went on to have a career as an advisor and consultant, retiring at the age of 95. 
 he was awarded the french legion of honor medal in 2016. 
 today, he lives in ocala, florida, with his wife, sharon, and is hoping to return to normandy to celebrate the 80th anniversary of d-day in 2024.

 national manufacturing day is friday, october 3. 
 mfg day is a celebration of what 12 million people around the united states experience every day-pride at working in manufacturing. 
 oct 01, 2014 
 - atlanta, ga 
 forget what you've heard about the offshore loss of georgia manufacturing jobs. it has had to adapt to stay globally competitive, but manufacturing is thriving. in fact, manufacturing comprises 12 percent of georgia's $454 billion economy and supports more than 486,000 jobs. on oct. 3, 
 national manufacturing day , georgia tech will bring focus to four key issues facing the industry: the skilled labor shortage, a need to ensure the sector's continued economic vitality, polish its image, and make it attractive to future generations. as part of national manufacturing day, tech and its business partners are showcasing georgia's successes with plant tours, education roundtables, and symposiums across the state including: power partners 
 in athens win-tech 
 in kennesaw newton college and career academy 
 in covington evco plastics 
 in calhoun armstrong world industries 
 in macon (for a complete list of tours and symposiums across georgia and registration information, please visit georgia tech's dedicated national manufacturing day page 
 via this link .) tech, through three key business and economic development units, supports initiatives and leads state efforts to keep manufacturing a robust part of the economy: the 
 georgia manufacturing extension partnership 
 (gamep), a federally and state funded unit of tech's enterprise innovation institute, works extensively with businesses 
 across the state 
 to reduce costs, increase productivity and revenue, incorporate best technological practices, and save or create jobs. the 
 georgia tech manufacturing institute 
 leverages tech's wealth of faculty research and expertise across the different fields that affect manufacturing, from management and engineering to robotics and policy. the

 karen fite . she notes georgia ranks 11 th 
 compared with other states in international exports and 84 percent of its exports come from manufacturing. what's more, employees in the manufacturing sector earn two to three times what retail employees make and roughly 30 percent higher than the georgia average, fite says. according to ben wang, executive director of the georgia tech manufacturing institute, ""our ultimate goal is to engage all of our partners in understanding the major manufacturing challenges, leverage the expertise of georgia tech in addressing those challenges, and accelerate the process of getting products to market."" tech's efforts underscore its longstanding role as a national leader in manufacturing, both in research and innovation, and in providing technical aid to small, medium and large manufacturers across georgia and the southeast. in 2012 president barack obama tapped tech president g.p. ""bud"" peterson to serve on the steering committee for the advanced manufacturing partnership, charged with enhancing u.s. manufacturing's global competitiveness. fite says, ""although highlighted on oct. 3 through this larger initiative, manufacturing is important to georgia's economy every day and continues to remain an important focus of schools, the communities, and the state"".

 last year, amid an initial wave of covid-19 infections and as mask wearing became mainstream, georgia tech 
 researchers set out to design a better face mask 
 to improve comfort and protection for the wearer. 
 now, they are recruiting 200 georgia tech students to participate in a six-week research study this semester sponsored by the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc). all study participants will receive $150. 
 participants will be divided into two groups. one will continue to wear whatever mask they currently use, whenever they would usually wear one. the other group will be asked to wear a mask provided to them. using a simple online qualtrics form, both groups will log their daily activities, as well as any health symptoms that may arise during the six-week study. 
 ""there were a lot of misconceptions early on in the pandemic with the role of masks,"" said sundaresan jayaraman, professor in georgia tech's school of materials science and engineering. ""our desire and hope is to dispel misconceptions around masks and show how effective and useful they are."" 
 but the project goes beyond function. the mask designed by jayaraman and sungmee park, principal research scientist in the school of materials science and engineering, is meant to be comfortable and stylish as well. they also want to learn how masks affect social and psychological elements of the wearer's life. 
 ""we want to get a feel for, ‘what is their view of masks? does the mask affect their social life? does it make a difference if the mask matches their outfit?' park said. 
 the study will include three phases. in the first two weeks, all participants will wear their own face coverings and continue their usual habits. the second two weeks will have half the cohort wear the masks provided by the research team. during the last two weeks, all participants will return to their usual habits - wearing their preferred mask, whether it's the new one or not, and logging their activities and any symptoms. 
 the study is approved by georgia tech's institutional review board and is registered as a clinical trial with 
 clinicaltrials.gov . those interested in participating can learn more and sign up at

tech-researchers-suggest-better-route-fda-approved-drugs.txt,"tech researchers suggest better route to fda-approved drugs 
 a new study proposes more microbial engineering for drugs based on plant alkaloids. 
 amy ehrenworth (photo by renay san miguel / georgia tech) 
 mar 21, 2017 
 - atlanta, ga 
 alkaloid-based pharmaceuticals derived from plants can be potent treatments for a variety of illnesses. but getting these powerful therapeutic agents from plants can take a long time and cost plenty of money, because it often takes a lot of plants to make a small amount of drug product. 
 yet advances in metabolic engineering of microbes could lead to cheaper, faster production of drugs already approved by the food and drug administration (fda). that's the conclusion of a 
 study 
 published recently in 
 nature chemical biology 
 by amy ehrenworth, a ph.d. student, and 
 pamela peralta-yahya , an assistant professor and ehrenworth's advisor in the school of chemistry and biochemistry. 
 metabolic pathways are at the heart of the solution, peralta-yahya says. these pathways are like production lines comprising the enzymes required to assemble specific products, such as therapeutic alkaloids. thanks to advances in metabolic engineering and synthetic biology, plant metabolic pathways can be installed in microbes, enabling microbes to make the plant products. 
 many drugs that are based on plant natural products are produced by semi-synthesis. that usually involves taking compounds from the plant and chemically transforming them to get the desired drug products at the end of the production line. 
 some of those chemical steps can be arduous. in the case of modified alkaloids, 
 ehrenworth and peralta-yahya showed in 2015 
 that microbes can be modified to produce them more easily. for the new work, ehrenworth surveyed drug databases to find alkaloid-drug candidates eligible for production efficiencies through engineered microbes. 
 when it comes to lowering the cost of drug production, ""our insight was that we shouldn't necessarily be using engineered microbes to make the exact plant natural product,"" peralta-yahya says. ""instead we should use engineered microbes to make something that is closer to an fda-approved drug."" 
 ""you can grow vats of microbes overnight, so it's a much quicker process,"" ehrenworth says. ""you're also not killing trees."" 
 ehrenworth is referring to the 
 chinese happy tree , the source of the alkaloid drug camptothecin. two cancer drugs, topotecan and irinotecan, are derivatives of camptothecin, and their production starts from the natural alkaloid. 
 ""both of those derivatives are modified at the same location on the molecule,"" ehrenworth says. engineering microbes to make the last common intermediate before the final drug compounds would reduce the chemical steps required. 
 to search for drugs that would benefit from this kind of metabolic engineering, ehrenworth searched databases of more than 2,000 fda-approved pharmaceuticals available from 
 drugbank.ca , the fda, and other sources. she and peralta-yahya determined that seven fda-approved modified-alkaloid drugs would be the most beneficial targets for metabolic engineering: solifenacin, galantamine, cisatracurium, levorphanol, butorphanol, irinotecan, and topotecan. 
 ""i was surprised by how many modified alkaloids could be engineered using current technology,"" peralta-yahya says. ""i thought maybe we would find one or two. but there were many, and you can literally start working on them tomorrow."" 
 chemists and biologists don't need to wait for new technologies or processes to be discovered or built, peralta-yahya adds. ""it's all there.""

 ask georgia tech researchers working with advanced materials for examples, and they give a pop culture reference. two of them even cite the same reference. 
 ""it's like 
 the terminator , liquid metal that then becomes a solid,"" says 
 alberto fernandez-nieves , associate professor in the school of physics. 
 ""think of 
 the terminator ,"" says another school of physics associate professor, 
 jennifer curtis . 
 pop culture so effectively appropriates next-level science research, that it comes as no surprise that these scientists first thought of oscar-winning director james cameron's shapeshifting ""mimetic polyalloy"" assassin from the future in 
 terminator 2: judgment day . 
 ""or that animated movie, 
 big hero 6 ,"" curtis adds, referring to a 2014 disney film about nanobots combining to form bigger objects. ""we would love to find an original way to create small shapes. and then make them intelligent enough to properly reconfigure in some other way."" 
 georgia tech scientists aim to make those science-fiction scenarios real through collaborative, interdisciplinary research at the 
 center for the science and technology of advanced materials and interfaces 
 (stami). 
 launched in 2016, stami comprises four groups: 
 center for organic photonics and electronics 
 (cope) 
 georgia tech polymer network 
 (gtpn) 
 community for research on active surfaces and interfaces 
 (crāsi, pronounced crazy) 
 soft matter incubator 
 (smi) 
 of all those acronyms, cope's has been around the longest, since 2003. cope helped develop the optical technologies that enable flat-screen hdtv to deliver sharper resolutions on any monitor size while consuming less power. 
 over the years, cope has attracted some $84 million in research funding and 
 research-related 
 awards , says 
 seth marder , regents professor in the school of chemistry and biochemistry and cope's founding director. that's because ""we were able to create multi-investigator proposals with a very high degree of success,"" marder says. 
 because proposals from centers with teams of researchers tend to attract more funding, marder and colleagues set up stami to brew ideas and foster collaboration among researchers across georgia tech. 
 ""people who work in advanced materials recognize that collaborative approaches are critical,"" marder says. at cope and now in stami, he adds, ""we recognize that if you build the strong human relationships, the strong collaborative scientific relationships will be that much stronger, that much more fun, and it will lead to that much more productivity and the opportunity to do other things."" 
 the promise of advanced materials 
 when subjected to stimuli - such as current, light, heat, or chemicals - liquids, foams, gels, liquid crystals, and other substances may respond and change, or even acquire new functions. 
 the liquid crystal displays (lcds) and organic light-emitting diodes (oleds) in smartphones and tv / computer monitors are organic photonic technologies in action. they are marvelous combinations of thin films, electrolytic gels, and molecules that respond to light and electricity. 
 soft matter is anything that can be prodded, poked, folded, warped, or deformed by weak external causes, including heat and mechanical forces. examples abound but the science around them is relatively young. 
 polymers, strings of repeating molecular units, can be natural, like the dna in cells, or synthetic, like the plastics in houses. manipulating them can yield stronger construction materials or more effective medical treatments. 
 advanced materials can mean progress from healthcare to defense technology and consumer electronics. but getting materials to work together - and allowing users to program, control, and predict their behaviors - is key to realizing the next-generation promises. 
 cope: collaboration before collaborating was cool 
 it was the spirit of teamwork that first brought marder to georgia tech in 2003, after appointments at the 
 jet propulsion laboratory , 
 california institute of technology , and the 
 university of arizona . 
 he and three others who were focused on optical sciences started cope shortly after they arrived at tech. they believed that a center like cope would help them brainstorm research ideas while increasing their chance of funding. 
 that teamwork helped marder ignore temptations to move to other universities. ""what kept me at georgia tech is the people,"" he says. ""if you're fundamentally connected with the people around you, that's a pretty strong adhesive."" 
 to that end, marder became a strong protagonist for cope's collaborative propensity. materials science can involve physics, chemistry, biology, and engineering, and reaching across tech's colleges and schools is key. cope pioneered this approach. 
 ""you're not just bringing people together to work on a problem; you need the right culture,"" says 
 bernard j. kippelen , a professor in the school of electrical and computer engineering and current cope director. ""georgia tech is uniquely positioned in that respect because interdisciplinary research is part of georgia tech's dna."" 
 research themes exemplify the intrinsic interdisciplinarity: 
 organic photovoltaic materials, for solar cell technology 
 flexible organic materials that can go inside or on the body, for medical and sensing applications 
 organic materials to protect sensors and human eyes from laser pulses, of interest to the defense department 
 organic materials to enable rapid and safe removal of heat from its source, for computers and consumer electronics 
 ""we focus on organic - carbon-based - materials,"" kippelen says, because they can be processed at room temperature, making manufacturing easier. and because the building blocks are molecules, physical properties can be controlled by changing chemical structure. 
 ""as we study more of these materials to understand why they work, we come across new surprises, new breakthroughs that were not anticipated,"" kippelen says. ""it's the gift that keeps giving."" 
 gtpn: pushing polymers for fun and profit, but mostly fun 
 when 
 john reynolds 
 joined 
 ibm research 
 in the late 1970s, scientists had just discovered that plastics can conduct electricity. until then, ""if you wanted high conductivity, you had to get a piece of metal,"" says reynolds, a polymer chemist. ""that an organic polymeric material could do that was earth-shattering."" the breakthrough eventually won the 
 2000 nobel prize in chemistry . 
 now reynolds is a professor in the school of chemistry and biochemistry and in the school of materials science and engineering.  he also serves as director of gtpn, which launched shortly after he joined tech in 2012. reynolds leads with co-directors 
 david collard , 
 zhiqun lin , 
 elsa reichmanis , and 
 paul russo . 
 ""georgia tech and the interdisciplinary atmosphere is why i moved here,"" he says. ""the walls between colleges and schools here are very low, and that makes georgia tech special."" 
 reynolds has had a front-row seat for many advances his gtpn colleagues are making in polymer science.  he anticipates new materials for applications such as: 
 electrochromism, reversibly changing a material's color in the presence of an electric field 
 energy savings through separation of hydrocarbon and industrial chemicals using nanoporous membranes 
 energy storage, such as batteries and capacitors to store chemical energy and electrical charge 
 drug and active-molecule release using polymer-modified nanoparticles 
 when it comes to electrochromic application, reynolds notes, this technology using polymer gel electrolytes has allowed automakers to eliminate the mechanical switch on rear-view mirrors to suppress blinding high-beam lights from the vehicle behind. most mirrors now use light sensors and color-changing electrochemical systems to dim that harsh glare. 
 ""that's a $1 billion a year sales business for a 
 company 
 in michigan,"" reynolds says. 
 yet the most innovative aspect of gtpn, reynolds says, is its impact on graduate students and researchers at tech. they're not just increasing their knowledge of chemistry and physics. ""they grow professionally by participating in meetings and seminars, hosting people, and learning how to be professionally social. and they get contacts with companies."" 
 smi: fundamental science from soft matter 
 soft matter is described by the 
 university of edinburgh school of physics and astronomy 
 as ""all things squishy."" 
 in that spirit, the 
 school of physics 
 has been hosting 
 squishy physics 
 public events since 2012. restaurant chefs from atlanta and beyond prepare foods that illustrate aspects of soft matter: ""gelation (jams and jelly), phase transitions (melting chocolate ice cream), emulsions (hollandaise and other sauces), foams (meringue), and glass formations (confections),"" says the squishy physics web page. 
 ""in many cases, soft materials are mixtures of phases - solids in liquids, gases in liquids, or liquid-liquid mixtures, for example,"" says fernandez-nieves, director of smi. ""a polymer gel may be 99% water, but it behaves like a spring. if you push on it, it deforms and retains its shape due to the presence of restoring forces, and thus it's a solid from that perspective. it's an elastic material. and it's made of 99% water and 1% polymer."" 
 smi is itself in its early phase, launching in july 2016 to coalesce soft matter research interest at tech and provide brainstorming opportunities, workshops, and seed grants. 
 so what exactly is smi incubating: ideas or specific research projects? 
 ""both,"" fernandez-nieves says. ""you can use soft materials as models to address interesting questions beyond soft matter."" the holy grail in the field is matter with controllable and predictive qualities. ""what do i need to do to make that happen? that's where fundamental science comes in."" 
 a recent research 
 pape r co-authored by fernandez-nieves offers an example of soft matter's potential. microgels and polymer networks made of natural fibrin, a blood-clotting protein, self-assemble to form tunnels that could allow healing substances to pass through. the department of defense, hoping for battlefield applications, supported part of the research. 
 smi is a place ""where you can incubate ideas and so they can come to fruition,"" fernandez-nieves says. ""i think of smi as driven by people with ideas and drive, and the desire to do new things."" 
 you don't have to be crāsi to study interfaces, but it helps 
 since 1978, 
 odyssey of the mind 
 has staged global problem-solving competitions for students in kindergarten through college. the competition stresses teamwork. thinking outside the box isn't just encouraged; it's necessary. 
 at tech, 
 jennifer curtis 
 and 
 michael filler , crāsi co-directors, are hosts of their own odyssey of the mind-style competitions for professors only. the focus is on thinking 
 way 
 outside the box in getting advanced materials - their surfaces, actually - to communicate, work together, and respond to human commands. 
 these gatherings of the minds are needed, because none of the next-level advances in materials science happens without figuring out surfaces and interfaces, says filler, an associate professor in the 
 school of chemical and biomolecular engineering . 
 ""there is an opportunity to target interfaces, the position where materials change from a to b,"" he says. ""they're ubiquitous, and they're really hard to study, because they're dynamic."" 
 ""the big thing we would love to do is control how smaller objects interact with each other to make programmable, reconfigurable matter,"" curtis says. 
 the idea of assembling matter is not new. but with the types of assemblies curtis and filler are talking about, it might be easier to kill the terminator. why? 
 ""we're just not good enough with the interfaces, programming them and controlling them,"" filler says. 
 that's the obstacle crāsi wants to topple. like smi, crāsi also launched in the summer of 2016 to start conversations about possible solutions to tough science problems. so far, crāsi has hosted a total of 10 events, mostly odyssey of the mind competitions. curtis and filler never share the agenda for their meetings because they don't want any biases to creep into the discussion. 
 curtis is pleased with the buy-in from researchers. ""there's a critical mass of people who want to be in the same room to talk science and explore ideas,"" she says. ""we're really trying to identify the grand challenge of the next decade.""

 in their second attempt at the 
 american solar challenge , a group of georgia tech students made it from independence, missouri, to las vegas, new mexico, in a solar-powered vehicle they built on campus. 
 the 
 georgia tech solar racing 
 team drove their car almost 1,000 miles, finishing fifth and winning an award for perseverance. the team had previously attempted the challenge in 2018, but this was the first time they were able to make it to the finish line off the power of the sun. 
 ""along the way, we had to grapple with unexpected breakdowns, steep mountain passes, city traffic, wildfire haze, and much more,"" said joseph stein, a mechanical engineering major and president of solar racing. ""but we also had a chance to drive a car we built across some truly stunning landscapes, and talk about sustainable technology with people we met on the road."" 
 georgia tech solar racing is a student organization that designs and builds solar-powered race cars for track and cross-country competitions around the world. completing the american solar challenge took years of work to get their car, 
 endurance , ready for the grueling drive. the group had to qualify for the challenge by driving 350 miles in a track race in topeka, kansas, before attempting the five-day drive out west. 
 stein hopes the team's accomplishments will inspire other students to get involved in the many inspiring engineering endeavors taking place on campus. 
 ""tech students are pushing the limits of hyper-efficient vehicle technology and advancing the institute's vision of using technological innovation to create a sustainable future,"" he said. 
 solar racing is recruiting new members from all majors and skill levels this semester. the club is holding info sessions on sept. 1 and sept. 2 from 4:30 to 6 p.m. iin room 2405, manufacturing related disciplines complex (mrdc). learn more about solar racing at

tech-study-stands-flamingos-unique-pose.txt,"tech study stands up for flamingos' unique pose 
 tech researchers have a new theory on why flamingos stand and sleep on one leg. 
 may 24, 2017 
 - atlanta, ga 
 when it comes to big questions about birds, here's one that rivals those about chickens crossing roads and that whole chicken-and-egg quandary: why do flamingos stand on one leg? 
 ""anytime i go to the zoo, i always hear a kid ask why or how they do that,"" says 
 young-hui chang , a professor in the school of biological sciences who studies locomotion in animals from both a neurological and a biomechanical lens. ""it's a natural question."" 
 because science has yet to provide a definitive answer, chang and fellow researcher 
 lena ting 
 investigated how flamingos are able to stand and sleep on one leg so easily for so long. ting is a professor in the 
 wallace h. coulter department of biomedical engineering 
 at emory university and georgia tech who studies balance control in humans and mammals. 
 their findings, published this week in 
 biology letters , suggest a reason that differs from most previous suggestions: it's about reducing muscular effort. 
 potential applications stretch from better robotics, orthopedic braces, and artificial limbs, to more focused treatments for neurological or balance problems. 
 but chang argues that simply providing clarity to long-standing questions about long-standing flamingos has great value as well. 
 ""there's something to be said for just scientific curiosity and learning how nature works,"" he says. flamingos aren't the only birds that stand on one leg, he adds, but ""the extreme example is the flamingo. it's precisely from these extreme examples in nature where you can really gain a lot of insight."" 
 a firmer foundation for flamingos 
 surprisingly, chang says, given how long the question about flamingos has been around, ""there hasn't been a whole lot of research done."" others have suggested that the birds engage in this behavior to avoid muscle fatigue or to conserve body heat. 
 chang and ting studied live birds at the 
 zoo atlanta 
 flock, one of the largest breeding flocks of chilean flamingos in the u.s. they also used two cadaver birds from the 
 birmingham zoo 
 and flamingo skeletons from the 
 university of california at berkeley's museum of paleontology . 
 zoo atlanta and  georgia tech institutional animal care and use committees  (iacucs) approved all procedures using live animals. no animal was killed or harmed for the purposes of the study. 
 their research shows that a ""passively engaged gravitational stay apparatus"" helps the birds support their weight and maintain balance while on one reed-thin leg. the bird's specialized anatomy, clever posture, and gravity combine to give the flamingo this ability, which does 
 not 
 involve bones locking into position. chang says it's more like a hammock or sling than a lock, but it does require the unique anatomy of flamingos. 
 ""the biomechanics are such that when they stand on one leg, they become very stable and are able to maintain that posture without activating muscle,"" ting says. ""if they deviate from that posture to two legs, that no longer holds. it's very posture-specific, a one-legged posture that can support their body weight."" 
 the ""passively engaged"" part of the flamingo's gravitational stay apparatus is exactly as it sounds: it requires minuscule, if any, active muscular or nerve control, chang adds. 
 those who marvel at a large, fluffy pink lump of flamingo body held up by one slender leg may be surprised to learn that the ""joint"" in the middle of that leg is actually an ankle, not a knee. ""most people don't realize that knee and hip joints are not actually in view in most birds,"" chang says. ""they're near the body, kind of behind the wing. the flamingo thigh is almost perfectly horizontal."" 
 all that contributes to biomechanics that might actually require greater muscular effort if not for the flamingo's ability to ""stay"" in a pose, which flamingos can get out of easily in flight-or-fight situations. 
 giving robots - and people - stronger legs to stand on 
 a one-legged standing test, actually termed a ""flamingo test,"" is used to diagnose human balance disorders with the help of pressure plates, instruments that measure balance, force, and other data. humans are usually more than willing to stand on pressure plates. but flamingos? they tend to squawk at things foreign in their environment. 
 ""the zoo didn't want us to interact with the adult flamingos because they don't handle change in their environment very well,"" ting says. but zoo workers could handle juvenile flamingos and placed them near the plates after they were fed, hoping that postprandial sleepiness would yield measurable data. 
 the cadaver birds actually provided a eureka moment for chang. after putting one into the one-legged pose, ""i don't know what made me do it, but i just kind of grabbed the leg and picked it up,"" he says. the bird maintained its posture. ""here we have a non-living animal able to stand on one leg. obviously, if it's not alive, then the muscles are not activated."" 
 can flamingo biomechanics help treat human movement and balance disorders? 
 ""if we know how much is passive mechanics and how much the nervous system has to control, it puts researchers in a better position to treat people,"" chang says. flamingo biomechanics can mean better wearable artificial limbs and longer battery life for stability supports. 
 robots could also benefit. getting robots to balance can be difficult; sensing the environment and making adjustments is how they currently do it. ""but if you design the biomechanics of a robot in the right way, not so much sensing but a sort of feedback control,"" ting says, ""then they would have this passive ability, and they would be more robust in uncertain environments.""

 each year, the university system of georgia (usg) honors outstanding teachers and departments from its 26 member institutions with regents awards. of the 
 nine awards 
 presented for fiscal year 2021, georgia tech took home two. the writing and communication program (wcp) won the teaching excellence award for department or program, and school of physics professor michael schatz was the unanimous choice for the award for excellence in online teaching. 
 the wcp, directed by class of 1958 professor melissa ianetta, was recognized for its dual dedication to faculty and student development. 
 ""the preparation of postdoctoral fellows and lecturers for the workplace could alone be the defining quality of an exceptional program, and wcp accomplishes this through an innovative curriculum of courses and resources,"" wrote tristan denley, executive vice chancellor and chief development officer of the usg. ""at the same time, wcp invites tech students to develop skills in composition, technical communication, and learning support."" 
 schatz, meanwhile, was honored for his innovation in an online classroom environment, specifically group problem-solving sessions, interactive strategies, and animated lectures. 
 the selection committee was ""deeply impressed"" by his ""reach beyond the georgia tech classroom through service to local and statewide communities at so many levels, from teacher training in atlanta and fulton county schools, to [his] development of a physics mooc (massive open online course) that reached thousands and utilized lab activities that students could do with their smartphones,"" wrote denley.

 georgia tech welcomes students at new student convocation in bobby dodd stadium. 
 aug 19, 2022 
 - atlanta, ga 
 in spring, summer, and fall of 2022, georgia tech welcomed 5,131 new first-year and transfer students. sixteen percent of incoming students come from a household where neither parent graduated from college - an increase of 2.5% over last year. hailing from 47 states and 84 countries, 43% of the first-year class comes from a home in which a language in addition to english is spoken. 
 ""there has never been a more important time for our state and nation to produce talented, globally connected students than now, and tech is responding by expanding access to more students from a wide variety of backgrounds,"" said rick clark, assistant vice provost and executive director of undergraduate admission. ""last year, for the first time in georgia tech's history, 40 % of our undergraduate population was comprised of women - a trend that will continue as our new first-year class is 42% female."" 
 in recent years, due in part to tech's global reputation and demonstrated value, popularity among high school students and college transfer students has increased dramatically. nearly 27% of new students (1,400) are transferring from another university - the majority through tech's strategic pathway programs, including those designed for veterans, first-generation students, pell-eligible students, and more. 
 this year, a record 50,568 students applied for first-year admission - a 25% increase in the past two years. the overall admit rate is 17%, with 35% of georgia applicants and 13% of non-georgia applicants being admitted. 
 ""we are particularly proud that while many schools nationally are declining in their underrepresented students on campus, our new class includes a record number of black, hispanic, and first-generation students,"" clark added. ""there is no question companies like google, microsoft, and others, are moving to atlanta and hiring on campus because they value the education, experience, perspective, and diversity our graduates provide."" 
 the most popular majors selected by first-year students are computer science, mechanical engineering, biomedical engineering, aerospace engineering, and business administration, with 89% planning to pursue an advanced degree. outside the classroom, students plan to be involved in co-op or internship programs, undergraduate research, community service, study abroad, entrepreneurship, instrumental music, and fraternities or sororities. 
 campus tours move to john lewis student center 
 beginning aug. 29, the undergraduate admission daily visit program will move to the new john lewis student center. these programs were previously held in the bill moore student success center, where offices are located for the undergraduate admission team. 
 ""we are really excited about this change because it will allow visitors to be able to better experience student life on campus,"" said andrew cohen, associate director for guest experience for undergraduate admission. ""it will also allow us to show more of campus due to the central location."" undergraduate admission hosts around 40,000 visitors a year in the form of campus tours, visits, and other information sessions

technique-may-improve-lung-delivery-bacteria-killing-phage.txt,"technique may improve lung delivery of bacteria-killing phage 
 a new technique could provide an alternative to antibiotics for lung infections. 
 technique may improve lung delivery of bacteria-killing phage 
 jul 16, 2018 
 - atlanta, ga 
 a new delivery system for bacteriophages-viruses that selectively attack harmful bacteria-could help give doctors a new way to battle lung infections that threaten older patients and people with cystic fibrosis. 
 phage therapy is a promising alternative to antibiotics because it attacks specific pathogens, does not harm the body's normal contingent of bacteria and won't contribute to multi-drug resistance. however, therapeutic bacteriophages can be difficult to purify and challenging to deliver to the site of an infection, especially when that location is the lungs. 
 a research team headed by the georgia institute of technology has demonstrated a new delivery technique that uses dry, porous microparticles coated with phages. in animal testing, the phage-coated polymer particles successfully treated pneumonia in infected mice and dramatically reduced bacterial levels in an animal model of cystic fibrosis. the technique might one day allow delivery of the dry-powder phage using a device similar to a common inhaler. 
 reported july 16 in the journal 
 nature biomedical engineering , the research was supported by the national institutes of health and the children's healthcare of atlanta pediatric technology center, a partnership between georgia tech and children's healthcare of atlanta. 
 ""phage delivery is an area where the right type of material could make a difference in therapeutic applications,"" said 
 andrés garcía , the rae s. and frank h. neely chair and regents' professor in georgia tech's 
 george w. woodruff school of mechanical engineering. 
 ""we set out to engineer a biomaterial carrier that would keep the phage active while delivering them deep into the lungs in a uniform fashion. this is a key step in moving this potential therapy forward."" 
 phage therapy has generated more interest as concerns about antibiotic use has grown. specific bacteriophages can target bacteria such as pseudomonas aeruginosa - which causes some forms of pneumonia and is the major pathogenic bacteria in cystic fibrosis - without affecting other bacteria. phage activity propagates beyond the coated particles, but is limited by the host population, so once the targeted bacteria are eliminated, the phage disappear. 
 researchers have previously used a nebulizer to deliver wet phage mixtures to the lungs, but that approach is inefficient and inconvenient for patients. as an alternative, garcía and his collaborators developed a microparticle carrier made from the same polymer material used in dissolving sutures. they made the porous particles large enough to avoid rapid clearance by the body, but light enough to be delivered deep into the lungs. 
 the phage are incubated on the particles, then dried. when introduced into animal lungs as a puff of dry powder, the phage begin attacking the bacteria. for mice infected with pneumonia, the phage carried on the particles cleared the infection - while untreated mice died. a significant reduction in bacterial populations was observed in transgenic mice whose lungs simulated conditions typical of cystic fibrosis. 
 ""when we immobilized the phage on the particles, we could retain good activity for days - as long as two weeks at room temperature,"" garcía said. ""we could store these particles, and when we delivered them to mice, get good distribution through the lungs. we believe the particles help stabilize the phage and improve the distribution in the lungs."" 
 nael mccarty, marcus professor of cystic fibrosis and director of the emory+children's cystic fibrosis center of excellence at emory university and children's healthcare of atlanta, and one of the study's co-authors, said the development of the delivery technique potentially advances the use of phage in treatment of cystic fibrosis. 
 ""cystic fibrosis is a common, life-limiting genetic disorder that affects many organ systems, but the most important impact on human health is chronic infections of the lung.  bacterial pneumonia that is resistant to multiple drugs is a challenge we must deal with frequently with cystic fibrosis,"" he said. ""treatment with antibiotics often makes space for other opportunistic bacteria to take hold. phage therapy could complement existing therapies without worsening antibiotic resistance. the technique developed and tested through this important collaboration could address one of the major challenges we have with phage therapy, which is delivery."" 
 the phage-coated microparticles were more effective at clearing bacteria than dried phage particles by themselves. the polymer material is biodegradable and was cleared from the animals within a few days. the technique was successful in attacking different strains of bacteria within biofilms, and the researchers did not see evidence that the bacteria were developing resistance. 
 though the phage aren't believed to attack mammalian cells, they can create an immune system response, and produce a toxins that can be harmful. they are grown in cultures containing the bacteria they attack, so separating them at the purity levels required is another challenge. 
 among the next steps are to test the particle-delivery technique in larger animals and against mixtures of bacteria, which often infect humans. the technique must also be tested against chronic infections, which often are seen in persons with cystic fibrosis.

 the problem was clear: how do you bundle large, oddly shaped loads like those made from steel and do it in a way that won't cause injuries? 
 currently the steel industry and others bundle products for shipping using razor-sharp steel strapping. however, that strapping can cut workers on their arms, hands and faces, said hannah larson, who graduated in december with a degree in mechanical engineering. 
 polyester woven strapping would be a safer and stronger solution, but the material was designed to work on flat services. the challenge became how to apply this strapping to tension loads that have round or irregular shapes, said michael bailey, who also graduated in december with a degree in mechanical engineering. 
 the answer is 
 tensionr , a tool designed to safely tension woven polyester strapping around objects regardless of shape or size. 
 the device, developed by bailey, larson and three other recent mechanical engineering graduates, is one of six competing for the 
 inventure prize , georgia tech's annual invention competition. winners will be announced march 14. 
 the other team members are: austin forgey from mcdonough; lauren perrine from potomac, md.; and brandon will from circle pines, minn. 
 the group won best mechanical engineering team during the 2017 capstone expo. the project was then called 
 blankity blank 
 and the sponsor was skyline steel. 
 ""while we've all graduated we realized the scale of this problem goes beyond just one industry and that it's important to have a safer option,"" said larson, who is from roswell. ""we believe we have a unique solution for any application."" 
 tensionr will protect more than 20 million workers at their jobs every day, the team said. and by pairing a differential with a dual barrel tensioning system, tensionr evenly supplies the necessary amount of tension for safer product handling, they said. 
 the group formed a company, dual strapping solutions llc, and are continuing to fine tune the design. 
 ""we're all strong mechanical engineers but we have a large learning curve with the entrepreneurial side,"" said bailey, who is from canton. ""the inventure prize is an additional catalyst to jumpstart our business.""

thinning-ice-sheets-may-drive-sharp-rise-subglacial-waters.txt,"thinning ice sheets may drive sharp rise in subglacial waters 
 up to twice the amount of subglacial water that was originally predicted might be draining into the ocean - potentially increasing glacial melt, sea level rise, and biological disturbances. 
 aug 21, 2023 
 two 
 georgia tech 
 researchers, 
 alex robel 
 and 
 shi joyce sim , have collaborated on a new model for how water moves under glaciers. the new theory shows that up to twice the amount of subglacial water that was originally predicted might be draining into the ocean - potentially increasing glacial melt, sea level rise, and biological disturbances. 
 the paper, 
 published in 
 science advances , 
 ""contemporary ice sheet thinning drives subglacial groundwater exfiltration with potential feedbacks on glacier flow,"" is co-authored by 
 colin meyer 
 ( dartmouth ), 
 matthew siegfried 
 ( colorado school of mines ), and 
 chloe gustafson 
 ( usgs ). 
 while there are pre-existing methods to understand subglacial flow, these techniques involve time-consuming computations. in contrast, robel and sim developed a simple equation, which can predict how fast exfiltration, the discharge of groundwater from aquifers under ice sheets, using satellite measurements of antarctica from the last two decades. 
 ""in mathematical parlance, you would say we have a closed form solution,"" explains robel, an assistant professor in the 
 school of earth and atmospheric sciences . ""previously, people would run a hydromechanical model, which would have to be applied at every point under antarctica, and then run forward over a long time period."" since the researchers' new theory is a mathematically simple equation, rather than a model, ""the entirety of our prediction can be done in a fraction of a second on a laptop,"" robel says. 
 robel adds that while there is precedence for developing these kinds of theories for similar kinds of models, this theory is specific in that it is for the particular boundary conditions and other conditions that exist underneath ice sheets. ""this is, to our knowledge, the first mathematically simple theory which describes the exfiltration and infiltration underneath ice sheets."" 
 ""it's really nice whenever you can get a very simple model to describe a process - and then be able to predict what might happen, especially using the rich data that we have today. it's incredible"" adds sim, a research scientist in the 
 school of earth and atmospheric sciences . ""seeing the results was pretty surprising."" 
 one of the main arguments in the paper underscores the potentially large source of subglacial water - possibly up to double the amount previously thought - that could be affecting how quickly glacial ice flows and how quickly the ice melts at its base. robel and sim hope that the predictions made possible by this theory can be incorporated into ice sheet models that scientists use to predict future ice sheet change and sea level rise. 
 a dangerous feedback cycle 
 aquifers are underground areas of porous rock or sediment rich in groundwater. ""if you take weight off aquifers like there are under large parts of antarctica, water will start flowing out of the sediment,"" robel explains, referencing a diagram sim created. while this process, known as exfiltration, has been studied previously, focus has been on the long time scales of interglacial cycles, which cover tens of thousands of years. 
 there has been less work on modern ice sheets, especially on how quickly exfiltration might be occurring under the thinning parts of the current-day antarctic ice sheet. however, using recent satellite data and their new theory, the team has been able to predict what exfiltration might look like under those modern ice sheets. 
 ""there's a wide range of possible predictions,"" robel explains. ""but within that range of predictions there is the very real possibility that groundwater may be flowing out of the aquifer at a speed that would make it a majority, or close to a majority of the water that is underneath the ice sheet."" 
 if those parameters are correct, that would mean there's twice as much water coming into the subglacial interface than previous estimates assumed. 
 ice sheets act like a blanket, sitting over the warm earth and trapping heat on the bottom, away from antarctica's cold atmosphere - and this means that the warmest place in the antarctic ice sheet is at the bottom of a sheet, not on the surface. as an ice sheet thins, the warmer underground water can exfiltrate more readily, and this heat gradient can accelerate the melting that an ice sheet experiences. 
 ""when the atmosphere warms up, it takes tens of thousands of years for that signal to diffuse through an ice sheet of the size, of the thickness, of the antarctic ice sheet,"" robel explains. ""but this process of exfiltration is a response to the already-ongoing thinning of the ice sheet, and it's an immediate response right now."" 
 broad implications 
 beyond sea level rise, this additional exfiltration and melt has other implications. some of the places of richest marine productivity in the world occur off the coast of antarctica, and being able to better predict exfiltration and melt could help marine biologists better understand where marine productivity is occurring, and how it might change in the future. 
 robel also hopes this work will open the doorway to more collaborations with groundwater hydrologists who may be able to apply their expertise to ice sheet dynamics, while sim underscores the need for more fieldwork. 
 ""getting the experimentalists and observationalists interested in trying to help us better constrain some of the properties of these water-laden sediments - that would be very helpful,"" sim says. ""that's our largest unknown at this point, and it heavily influences the results."" 
 ""it's really interesting how there's a potential to draw heat from deeper in the system,"" she adds. ""there's quite a lot of water that could be drawing more heat out, and i think that there's a heat budget there that could be interesting to look at."" 
 moving forward, collaboration will continue to be key. ""i really enjoyed talking to joyce (sim) about these problems,"" rober says, ""because joyce is an expert on heat flow and porous flow in the earth's interior, and those are problems that i had not worked on before. that was kind of a nice aspect of this collaboration. we were able to bridge these two areas that she works on and that i work on.""

 the report presents life-cycle assessment as an essential tool in helping researchers and policymakers evaluate low-carbon fuel standards to reduce emissions.

 gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel - the most commonly used transportation fuels - are among the largest sources of greenhouse gas emissions, and their use is affecting the climate in significant and long-term ways. a new national report, however, provides a powerful toolkit to help researchers and policymakers better evaluate low-carbon technologies and work toward reducing emissions. 
 valerie thomas , anderson-interface chair of natural systems and professor in the 
 h. milton stewart school of industrial and systems engineering 
 and the 
 school of public policy 
 at georgia tech, served as chair for the report titled "" current methods for life cycle analyses of low-carbon transportation fuels in the united states ."" issued by the 
 national academies of sciences, engineering, and medicine , the report presents life-cycle assessment as an essential tool in helping researchers and policymakers evaluate low-carbon fuel standards to reduce emissions. thomas, whose research focuses on energy, environmental impacts, and technology development and policy, is affiliated with georgia tech's 
 strategic energy institute , 
 brook byers institute for sustainable systems , and 
 renewable bioproducts institute . 
 alternative fuel sources such as electricity for electric vehicles, biofuels for aircraft, and hydrogen for fuel-cell trucks do emit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, whether by resource extraction, production processes, or other supply-chain and market contributions. when considering low-carbon fuel standards to reduce emissions, policymakers are often met with a range of questions from stakeholders, from potential impacts of a specific policy to total emissions released from the production of a particular fuel. 
 ""if a new transportation fuel is meant to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, we need to be confident that emissions are indeed likely to be reduced,"" thomas said. ""determining the total net emissions of alternative fuels requires an understanding of how they are made and how they affect markets."" 
 life-cycle assessments are a method used to evaluate environmental impacts of fuels and technologies throughout their production and use, but according to thomas, more research is needed to strengthen their reliability. the 16-member committee led by thomas evaluated current methods for life-cycle analyses of low-carbon transportation fuels in the u.s., with the goal of establishing a comprehensive and reliable approach for applying life-cycle assessment to developing low-carbon fuel standards. 
 in preparing the report, the committee gathered input from life-cycle assessment experts, including researchers specializing in aviation fuels, biofuels, hydrogen fuels, fossil fuels, and soil carbon implications of biofuel production. the report, which includes 70 total recommendations, includes suggestions for improving models, increasing transparency, and verifying emissions. the report provides an understanding of the state-of-the-science in quantifying the climate impact of a transition to new transportation fuels. 
 ""we suggest that the approach to life-cycle assessment needs to be guided by the question the analysis is trying to answer,"" thomas said. ""different types of assessment are better suited for answering different questions. while some methods work well for fine tuning a well-defined supply chain, other methods are needed to understand the global, economy-scale effect of a major technology or policy change."" 
 thomas hopes that research programs will be created to advance key theoretical, computational, and modeling needs to better evaluate the transition to low carbon fuels. 
 the national academy of sciences was founded in 1863 by an act of congress and it includes the national academies of science, engineering, and medicine. its charge is to ""provide independent, objective analysis and advice to the nation and conduct other activities to solve complex problems and inform public policy decisions.""

 a trio of georgia tech professors has joined the ranks among the nation's most distinguished leaders in science, engineering, and innovation, as marion usselman, loren williams, and samuel graham have been named 
 american association for the advancement of science 
 (aaas) fellows for 2022. 
 the world's largest general scientific society, aaas has been awarding the honor since 1874. with the addition of usselman, williams, and graham, nearly 100 georgia tech professors have been recognized for their achievements. in total, the aaas class of 2022 features 506 individuals following in the footsteps of past honorees including sociologist and civil rights leader w.e.b. du bois, astronaut ellen ochoa, nobel laureate steven chu, and computer programming pioneer grace hopper. 
 marion usselman 
 - education 
 honored for distinguished contributions to gender equity in universities and major contributions to curriculum and teacher professional development. 
 ceismc 
 marion usselman , a principal research scientist in the center for education integrating science, mathematics, and computing ( ceismc ), arrived at georgia tech in 1996 with a ph.d. in biophysics from the johns hopkins university and a passion for improving education and access in typically white male-dominated stem fields. at that time women made up just 28% of the institute's undergraduate population. she has spent the last 26 years working diligently to help increase that number and give the next generation of women and other historically underserved populations a true seat at the stem table. 
 as part of the integrating gender equity and reform nsf project, usselman and her colleagues conducted an in-depth georgia tech institutional self-study that examined the barriers that women and minorities faced when choosing their career path, as well as the methods used in the classroom that may have influenced their choices.  the results of the study, and of many subsequent educational projects, showed usselman that there was plenty of work to be done, particularly in the k-12 arena. 
 to that end, usselman has spearheaded the effort to reform k-12 stem education in georgia and nationally, leading up a ceismc team dedicated to designing and developing educational innovations. she's co-authored over 60 refereed journal and conference papers and brought in more than $40 million in funding as the primary writer on over 20 funded stem-education grant proposals.  in addition, her team has created extensive curriculum materials for k-12 students and teachers, particularly in the engineering and computer science areas, and implemented many stem-related professional learning opportunities for k-12 teachers. 
 ""my team has spent the last 15 to 20 years designing curricular exemplars, based on well-established research on how people learn and factors that encourage a sense of belonging and identity, so that teachers can try out inclusive methods of instruction and experience success in engaging students who are traditionally underrepresented in stem fields,"" she said. ""it is important to change teachers' hearts and minds, but we believe that is best done by giving them something to try that works, not by lecturing. because that is how people learn."" 
 loren williams - biological sciences 
 honored for distinguished contributions to the fields of biophysics and the origins and evolution of life on earth, particularly for advancing our understanding of the evolution of the translation system. 
 school of chemistry and biochemistry 
 loren williams 
 was content in his work as a crystallographer, but when he began studying new ribosome structures at the turn of the century, he found a true passion for uncovering the origins of life on earth and set out on a path that has now earned him the distinction of becoming an aaas fellow. 
 while its basic function is to produce proteins, williams noticed that the ribosome could offer a previously unseen look into the past. while he admittedly didn't know much about evolution at the time, williams couldn't shake his curiosity surrounding the similarities in bacterial and archaeal ribosomes across the span of nearly 4 billion years. 
 ""ninety percent of everything became boring from that point on, because all of a sudden what i was looking at was small. i and i kept going for a couple years, but in my head, i was like, ‘what am i doing here?' i just thought, ‘ok, i don't know what to do.' i just kept staring at the ribosome,"" williams said. 
 continuing his award-winning and nasa-funded research as ""a scientist in a sea of engineers at georgia tech,"" williams explained that the translation system unites all living things and predates luca - the last universal common ancestor - while serving as a molecular time machine. 
 ""it's been frozen ever since. so, if we can understand the origins and evolution of the translation system, we are looking back before luca, which is really looking back to the origin of life,"" he said. ""in my lab over the last 15 years, we have worked out how to understand the evolution of the ribosome, which is kind of like a movie of the origin of life and we're slowly looking at it frame by frame and figuring out how to do that."" 
 williams' initial interest in the structures superseded his desire to receive grants or publish papers, and at the time, he didn't see the makings of a viable research program. nevertheless, despite some initial rejection, williams pressed on, and now, as an aaas fellow can now reflect on the gamble he took. 
 ""i feel like i've kind of come back from the dead in a way, and it's a nice feeling because i really thought i was finished,"" he said. ""science is a funny business."" 
 samuel graham jr. - engineering 
 honored for developing optical / electrical methods and models to characterize thermal response / properties of wide bandgap electronics including rf and power electronics and for developing chip-embedded cooling for high heat flux operation. 
 george w. woodruff school of mechanical engineering 
 graham 
 is being recognized for his cutting-edge research into the thermal characterization and thermal management of gallium nitride-based wide bandgap semiconductors used in radio frequency communications, solid-state lighting, and power electronics. his work has been instrumental in numerous department of defense and industrial programs in the development of these technologies, and he was recently recognized with the 2022 asme allan kraus thermal management medal and the 2022 hawkins memorial lecture in heat transfer at purdue university. 
 graham served as the eugene c. gwaltney jr. school chair for the  george w. woodruff school of mechanical engineering 
 at georgia tech, where he remains a professor, while also serving as dean of the a. james clark school of engineering at the university of maryland. he holds a ph.d. and a master's degree in mechanical engineering from tech, a place that allowed him to fulfill his childhood dream. 
 ""i am honored to be recognized as a fellow of aaas. moreover, i am thankful for my students and collaborators throughout my career that have made my work enjoyable and have inspired me to make an impact on technologies that will benefit society. i wish to say thank you to aaas and am happy to support its mission to advance science for the benefit of all,"" he said. 
 graham also serves on several advisory boards to advance science and engineering. this includes serving as chair of the emerging technologies technical advisory committee in the u.s. department of commerce, the engineering science research foundation of sandia national laboratories, the at scale initiative at pacific northwest national laboratory, and the institute for nuclear power operations.

 microscopic, bottle-like structures with corks that melt at precisely-controlled temperatures could potentially release drugs inside the body or fragrances onto the skin, according to a recently published study. typical drug delivery systems act more like sponges than bottles. for example, drugs are absorbed into polymer particles and then allowed to diffuse out over time. the researchers hope that the new system may allow for greater control of drug delivery. cargo would stay inside the hollow polymer particle when plugged with a solid cork. when the cork is melted by body heat, the drugs would quickly flow out of the particle bottle. ""it's just like when you open wine, you remove the cork,"" said younan xia, a professor in the wallace h. coulter department of biomedical engineering at georgia tech and emory university. xia also holds joint appointments in school of chemistry and biochemistry and the school of chemical and biomolecular engineering at georgia tech. the melting corks are made of fatty acids, derived from natural oils and fats. the length of the hydrocarbon chains on these molecules can be made longer or shorter to increase or decrease, respectively, the temperature at which they melt. this way, the fragrances in deodorants, for example, would be released only when a person gets hot and sweaty. the new system for temperature-regulated release was detailed in a recent online edition of the journal 
 angewandte chemie international edition . the research was sponsored by the national cancer institute, a national institutes of health director's pioneer award, and startup funds from georgia tech. funds were also provided by the korea science and engineering foundation (kosef) and the korean ministry of education and science. drug delivery systems have also been designed to release their cargoes in response to ph change, ultrasound, mechanical signals and electric or magnetic fields. xia's system is the first bottle-and-cork design, but it isn't the first to release drugs in response to temperature. his system, however, has several advantages over other temperature-regulated delivery systems, such as quick and efficient loading of small molecules, macromolecules and even nanoparticles up to 100 nanometers in size. other temperature-based systems can release their cargoes early. in xia's system, the contents are bottled up until the body hits the desired temperature and then they are quickly released. ""it's like bottled water,"" xia said. ""when you are thirsty, you can just drink it."" the melting corks are made from a group of phase-changing materials - fatty acids or fatty alcohols - that change from solid to liquid when heated to specific melting points. as a proof of principle for the temperature-sensitive delivery system works, in the new study xia's lab loaded fluorescent dye into the hollow polymer particles. the holes were then corked with solid 1-tetradecanol, a fatty alcohol. after washing away any dye that might be stuck to the outer surfaces of the bottles, a fluorescent micrograph showed that all of the dye was completely bottled up. the bottles were then heated to 25 and 37 degrees celsius - just below the corks' melting point - but no dye escaped, even after 4 days and vigorous washing in a buffer solution. this performance is better than other delivery systems, xia said, which typically release some of the drug prematurely. when bottles were heated to 39 degrees celsius, the melting point of 1-tetradecanol, the corks melted and the dye was instantly released. ""you can bottle everything and then you put a stopper on top. whenever you need it, just unplug it and things will come out quickly,"" said xia, who is a georgia research alliance eminent scholar in nanomedicine. the corks tested in the study are expected to pose no harm once inside or on the human body. 1-tetradecanol and lauric acid, a fatty acid that has also been test as a cork, have very low toxicity in small doses, xia said, because they are derived from natural fats and oils. these same fats are often used as ingredients for food and pharmaceuticals. xia said that hydrophobic drugs, such as the majority of anticancer treatments, could be easily loaded into the hollow particles for delivery inside the body. future studies will examine this possibility in more detail in animal models. hydrophilic drugs could also be delivered with this system, but the surface of the bottle would need to be modified. the hollow polymer particles in xia's study were made of polystyrene, which couldn't be injected safely into the body to deliver drugs, but would work in a scented body cream for applying to the skin. xia's lab is currently working on making these microscale particle bottles out of polymers that are approved by the u.s. food and drug administration, such as polycarprolactone, so they can bring translational capability to this system. ""no companies are making anything like this yet,"" xia said. dong choon hyun, a post-doctoral fellow at georgia tech, was the lead author of the study. unyong jeong, a materials science & engineering professor at yonsei university in korea, was a collaborator on the project. this research is supported by the national cancer institute under award r01ca138527, the national institutes of health director's pioneer award (dp1od000798), and startup funds from georgia tech. the research was also sponsored by kosef (008-05103) and a world class university grant from nrf of the korean ministry of education and science (r32-20031). any conclusions or opinions are those of the authors and do not necessarily represent the official views of the sponsoring agencies. citation : d.c. hyun, et al., ""microscale polymer bottles corked with a phase-change material for temperature-controlled release,"" (angewandte chemie international edition, 2013). dx.doi.org / 10.1002 / anie.201305006 research news georgia institute of technology 177 north avenue atlanta, georgia 30332-0181 usa media relations contacts : brett israel (404-385-1933) ( brett.israel@comm.gatech.edu ) or john toon (404-894-6986) ( jtoon@gatech.edu ) writer : brett israel

 snakes and lizards have distinct body movement patterns. lizards bend from side to side as they retract their legs to walk or run. snakes, on the other hand, slither and undulate, like a wave that travels down the body. however, there are species of lizards that have long, snakelike bodies, and limbs so tiny even scientists have wondered about their purpose. understanding how these hybrid-looking lizards move could provide insight into why an evolutionary transition from lizardlike to snakelike motion occurred. 
 using biological experiments, robot models, and a geometric theory of locomotion from the 1980s, researchers at the georgia institute of technology investigated how and why intermediate lizard species, with their elongated bodies and short limbs, might use their bodies to move. led by living systems physics professor 
 daniel goldman , the research team studied body-limb coordination in a diverse sample of lizard bodies. their multidisciplinary approach uncovered the existence of a previously unknown spectrum of body movements in lizards, revealing a continuum of locomotion dynamics between lizardlike and snakelike movements. their findings, published in the june issue of 
 proceedings of the national academy of sciences , deepen the understanding of evolution's implications for locomotion, and have additional applications for advanced robotics designs. 
 ""we were interested in why and how these intermediate lizards use their bodies and limbs to move around in different terrestrial environments,"" goldman said. ""this is a fundamental question in locomotion biology and can inspire more capable wiggling robots."" 
 a multidisciplinary approach 
 baxi chong, a ph.d. student in 
 goldman's lab 
 and first author of the paper, became interested in the short-limbed, elongated lizard species 
 brachymeles 
 at a presentation by 
 philip bergmann , associate professor of evolutionary biology at clark university, in which bergmann discussed the evolution of the species. chong, a theoretician, had a tool in mind that he believed could help explain how the rare lizard moved, so he reached out to bergmann to collaborate. bergmann sent footage of the lizards in the wild to goldman's lab for analysis. 
 eva erickson, a recent graduate from georgia tech and goldman's lab, then applied new artificial intelligence techniques to analyze the lizards' body movement in bergmann's videos as well as other lizard species. known as neural network tracking, the software uses ai to identify features of images - such as legs and bodies - and track those features and their movements. 
 it has typically been thought that organisms either wiggle like snakes, bend like lizards, or use no body bending at all. when analyzing the footage, however, the researchers saw a wide variety of snakelike waves (traveling waves) and lizardlike movements (standing waves) represented across a diversity of lizard species. 
 ""markerless animal pose estimation software has been greatly improving, allowing much greater insight into the kinematics of organisms,"" said erickson, who will enter a ph.d. program at brown university in fall 2022. ""through tracking videos with the program deeplabcut, we found that these species perform a diverse array of wave patterns as they locomote."" 
 the next question was how to make sense of the diversity of wave patterns. according to chong, while there are endless ways to think about the waves and what they mean, the information is so complex that it is nearly impossible for humans to understand without using laborious and time-consuming equations. 
 instead, chong used a mathematical technique developed by particle physicists and control theorists in the last decades. while the theory, now referred to in the locomotion field as geometric mechanics, was initially introduced to study idealized locomotion - to understand how three connected points might swim in water - chong adapted the theory to include the concept of legs. 
 using geometric mechanics, chong produced diagrams that visualized the body-limb coordination data, replacing complicated calculations with much simpler diagrammatic analysis. they were able to both see and show the advantage of snakelike waves in short-limbed elongate lizard locomotion and predict that the advantage arises as the primary thrust generation shifts from the limbs to the body. 
 ""the advantage of geometric mechanics is that we don't have to explore every possibility of locomotion to determine which one is the best,"" chong said. 
 findings from the neural network tracking and geometric mechanics enabled the group to form a theory: that the style of lizard movement - whether they move using standing waves to run or a traveling wave to slither - is closely related to degree of limb size and body elongation. 
 testing the theory with real and robotic lizards 
 the researchers tested the theory in two ways. first, they changed the environment, putting sand-dwelling lizards in what they would never come across naturally: sand with air blowing up through it. they observed that short-bodied lizards with strong legs were forced to wiggle their way out, in a movement known as ""terrestrial swimming."" essentially, they were able to trick lizards into using snakelike locomotion to move, further supporting the existence of a spectrum of locomotion patterns. 
 the team then built a robot model to investigate the advantages of lizardlike and snakelike body movements in the intermediate lizard species. known as a robophysical model, the robot functions as a physicist's model of a living system that can also be used to vary parameters such as limb length and how the lizard's body drags on the ground. with such capabilities, they can test the predictions of their theoretical model while also gaining understanding of the biological system. 
 the team then built a robot model to investigate the advantages of lizardlike and snakelike body movements in the intermediate lizard species. known as a robophysical model, the robot functions as a physicist's model of a living system. with the robot, they can test the predictions of their theoretical model while also gaining insights into the intermediate lizard's biology and locomotion. 
 ""we built the robophysical model to be reconfigurable - we can vary limb length and change how the lizard robot propels itself with the addition and removal of a belly plate,"" said tianyu wang, a robotics ph.d. student and member of goldman's lab. ""we then used the robot to run similar experiments in sand while tracking its motions and performance."" 
 the researchers found that, when more body weight was distributed on the belly rather than the limbs, snakelike body movement had the clear advantage in getting lizards where they need to be - even for those lizards with the strongest legs. 
 overall, the team observed that the degree of body elongation and limb reduction in lizards is directly related to how body and limb movements are coordinated, indicating a closely intertwined continuum between body shapes and locomotion style. the researchers even found the tiny limbs to be of significant use to the lizards, not only with propulsion, but also with lifting their bellies off the ground. 
 insights 
 the researchers' findings enabled them to conclude that evolution was not just acting to lengthen bodies or shorten limbs, but both - and in a highly coordinated and functional way. 
 ""our work really helps explain why these intermediate species are able to compete with other species and persist in their own right for millions of years,"" bergmann said. ""they aren't evolving to be snakelike but are completely functional species with their own ecological roles."" 
 also, roboticists can apply concepts discovered in the researchers' work. for example, using the findings from goldman's lab, roboticists have created snake-, lizard-, and amphibian-inspired robots that could one day be used in search and rescue operations. 
 ""with the robophysical models, we can develop principles that can also inform the next generation of robots that might have to crawl around in rubble or move around in extraterrestrial environments like the surface of moons or planets,"" goldman said. 
 finally, an important aspect of the study was its multidisciplinary approach. by taking videos from an evolutionary biologist, applying ai tracking software and geometric mechanics to understand movement, and building a robophysical model to test their hypothesis, each student brought individual expertise to bear on the research question. 
 ""i have to say, this really was an awesome student-led project,"" goldman said.

 a tiny mirror could make a huge difference for scientists trying to understand what's happening in the micron-scale structures of living cells. by growing cells on the mirrors and imaging them using super-resolution microscopy, a group of scientists from universities in the united states, china and australia have addressed a problem that has long challenged scientists: seeing the structures of three dimensional cells with comparable resolution in each dimension. cells are normally grown on transparent glass slides for microscopy examination. the new technique uses the unique properties of light to create interference patterns as light waves pass through a cell on the way to the mirror and then back through the cell after being reflected. the interference patterns provide, at a single plane within the cell, significantly improved resolution in the z-axis - what scientists see as they look directly into a cell perpendicular to the slide. this improved view could help researchers differentiate between structures that appear close together with existing microscope technology - but are actually relatively far apart within the cells. microscope resolution in the x and y axes is typically superior to resolution in the z axis, regardless of the microscopy technique. the mirror approach works with super-resolution microscopy as well as with other technologies. reported in the nature journal 
 light: science & applications , the technique was developed by scientists at peking university, the georgia institute of technology, and the university of technology sydney (uts). ""this simple technology is allowing us to see the details of cells that have never been seen before,"" said dayong jin, a professor at uts and one of the paper's co-authors. ""a single cell is about 10 micrometers; inside that is a nuclear core about 5 micrometers, and inside that are tiny holes, called the 'nuclear pore complex,' that as a gate regulates the messenger bio-molecules, but measure between one fiftieth and one twentieth of a micrometer. with this super-resolution microscopy we are able to see the details of those tiny holes."" being able to see these tiny structures may provide new information about the behavior of cells, how they communicate and how diseases arise in them, said peng xi, a professor at peking university and another of the paper's co-authors. ""previously, the vision of biologists was blurred by the large axial and lateral resolution,"" he said. ""this was like reading newspapers printed on transparent plastic; many layers were overlapped. by placing a mirror beneath the specimen, we can generate a narrowed focal spot so there is only one layer of the newspaper to read so that every word becomes crystal clear."" the new system, he noted, allows scientists to see the ring structure of the nuclear pore complex for the first time, and the tubular structure of the human respiratory syncytial virus (hrsv). ""with this simple, but powerful weapon, biologists can tackle many interesting phenomena that were invisible in the past because of poor resolution,"" xi added. while changing the optical system was relatively simple, growing cells on the custom-made mirrors required adapting existing biological techniques, said phil santangelo, another co-author and a professor at georgia tech and emory university. techniques for growing the cells on the mirrors were largely developed by eric alonas, a georgia tech graduate student, and hao xie, a student in the ph.d. program of peking university and georgia tech. ""most people are not growing cells on mirrors, so it required some work to get the cell culture conditions correct,"" santangelo said. ""we had to make sure the mirror coating didn't affect cell growth, and staining the cells to make them fluoresce also required some adaption. ultimately, growing cells on the mirrors became a simple process."" the new technique, known as mirror-enhanced, axial narrowing, super-resolution (means) microscopy, begins with growing cells to be studied on a tiny mirrors custom-made by a manufacturer in china. a glass cover slide is placed over the cells, and the mirror placed into a confocal or wide-field microscope in the place of a usual clear slide. the technique improves axial resolution six-fold and lateral resolution two-fold for stimulated emission depletion (sted) nanoscopy. the ability to increase the resolution and decrease the thickness of an axial section without increasing laser power is of great importance for imaging biological specimens, which cannot tolerate high laser power, the researchers noted. for scientists attempting to study structures and molecules inside cells, the interference effects can make a dramatic difference in what can be observed. ""the two waves interacting with one another causes a region between the glass surfaces and the cell to be bright, and other parts to be dark,"" explained santangelo, who is an associate professor in the wallace h. coulter department of biomedical engineering at georgia tech and emory university. ""they cause light to be removed from some locations so you get darkness, and there is a bright spot in a specific region rather than being all bright."" santangelo believes the technique could find broad applications for scientists using fluorescence microscopy to examine cells and subcellular structures. further research could lead to improvements such as the ability to make the mirror's surface movable, allowing more control over how the cells can be imaged. ""there is more to do with this,"" he said. ""we have demonstrated a basic topic that can be applied now in other ways."" the time differences between australia, china and the united states provided a challenge for the team's collaboration, but the researchers say the work was very worthwhile. ""the development of the mirror-enhanced super-resolution microscopy is a great example of what collaborative, international and multi-disciplinary research can achieve,"" said jin, who is the director of the initiative for biomedical materials & devices at uts. ""it is a significant achievement for the team, and the field, and one that we're proud to have been involved in."" citation : xusan yang, et al., ""mirror-enhanced, axial narrowing, super-resolution microscopy,""

 needles almost too small to be seen with the unaided eye could be the basis for new treatment options for two of the world's leading eye diseases: glaucoma and corneal neovascularization. the microneedles, ranging in length from 400 to 700 microns, could provide a new way to deliver drugs to specific areas within the eye relevant to these diseases. by targeting the drugs only to specific parts of the eye instead of the entire eye, researchers hope to increase effectiveness, limit side effects, and reduce the amount of drug needed. for glaucoma, which affects about 2.2 million people in the united states and is the second leading cause of blindness worldwide, the goal is to develop time-release drugs that could replace daily administration of eye drops. a painless microneedle injection made once every three to six months - potentially during regular office visits - could improve treatment outcomes by providing consistent dosages, overcoming patient compliance issues. in the second disease, corneal neovascularization, corneal injury results in the growth of unwanted blood vessels that impair vision. to treat it, the researchers developed solid microneedles for delivering a dry drug compound that stops the vessel growth. ""the power of microneedles for treating eye conditions is the ability to target delivery of the drug within the eye,"" said 
 mark prausnitz , a regents' professor in the 
 school of chemical and biomolecular engineering 
 at the georgia institute of technology. ""we are developing different microneedle-based systems that can put the drug precisely into the part of the eye where it's needed. in many cases, we hope to couple that delivery with a controlled-release formulation that would allow one application to treat a condition for weeks or months."" the research, which was supported by the national eye institute of the national institutes of health (nih), was reported november 13 in the journal 
 investigative ophthalmology & visual science . the research was done using animal models, and could become the first treatment technique to use microneedles for delivering drugs to treat diseases in the front of the eye. glaucoma results from elevated pressure inside the eye that can be treated by reducing production of the aqueous humor fluid in the eye, increasing flow of the fluid from the eye, or both. glaucoma is now controlled by the use of eye drops, which must be applied daily. studies show that as few as 56 percent of glaucoma patients follow the therapy protocol. the microneedle therapy would inject drugs into space between two layers of the eye near the ciliary body, which produces the aqueous humor. the drug is retained near the injection side because it is formulated for increased viscosity. in studies with an animal model, the researchers were able to reduce intraocular pressure through the injections, showing that their drug got to the proper location in the eye. because the injection narrowly targets delivery of the drug, researchers were able to bring about a pressure reduction by using just one percent of the amount of drug required to produce a similar decline with eye drops. the research team, which also included georgia tech postdoctoral fellow yoo chun kim and emory university emeritus professor of ophthalmology henry edelhauser, hopes to produce a time-release version of the drug that could be injected to provide therapy lasting for months. ""the ultimate goal for us would be for glaucoma patients visiting the doctor to get an injection that would last for the next six months, until the next time the patient needed to see the doctor,"" said prausnitz. ""if we can do away with the need for patients to use eye drops, we could potentially have better control of intraocular pressure and better treatment of glaucoma."" to treat corneal neovascularization, the researchers took a different approach, coating solid microneedles with an antibody-based drug that prevents the growth of blood vessels. they inserted the coated needles near the point of an injury, keeping them in place for approximately one minute until the drug dissolved into the cornea. in an animal model, placement of the drug halted the growth of unwanted blood vessels for about two weeks after a single application. in addition to the researchers already mentioned, the corneal neovascularization research included emory university professor of ophthalmology hans grossniklaus. while the research reported in the journal did not include time-release versions of the drugs, a parallel project is evaluating potential formulations that would provide that feature. eye injections with hypodermic needles much larger than the microneedles are routinely used to administer compounds into the center of eye. these injections are well tolerated, and prausnitz expects the use of microneedles would also not cause significant side effects. ""increasingly, eye drops are not able to deliver drugs where they need to go, so injections into the eye are becoming more common,"" said edelhauser. ""but hypodermic needles were not designed for the eye and are not optimal for targeting drugs within the eye."" in contrast to the larger hypodermic needles, the microneedles are tailored to penetrate the eye only as far as needed to deliver the drugs to internal spaces within the layers of the eye. for the glaucoma drug, for instance, the needle is only about half a millimeter long, which is long enough to penetrate through the sclera, the outer layer of the eye, to the supraciliary space. both potential treatments would require additional animal testing before human trials could begin. yoo c. kim, henry f. edelhauser, and mark r. prausnitz hold microneedle patents, and mark prausnitz and henry edelhauser have significant financial interest in clearside biomedical, a company developing microneedle-based products for ocular delivery. this potential conflict of interest has been disclosed and is overseen by georgia institute of technology and emory university. citations : yoo c. kim, henry f. edelhauser and mark r. prausnitz, ""targeted delivery of antiglaucoma drugs to the supraciliary space using microneedles,"" (investigative ophthalmology & visual science, 2014) and yoo c. kim, hans e. grossniklaus, henry f. edelhauser and mark r. prausnitz, ""intrastromal delivery of bevacizumab using microneedles to treat corneal neovascularization,"" (investigative ophthalmology & visual science, 2014). research reported in this news release was supported by the national eye institute of the national institutes of health under award numbers r01ey022097 and r24ey017045. the content is solely the responsibility of the authors and does not necessarily represent the official views of the national institutes of health. research news georgia institute of technology 177 north avenue atlanta, georgia  30332  usa media relations contacts : john toon (404-894-6986) ( jtoon@gatech.edu ) or brett israel (404-385-1933) ( brett.israel@comm.gatech.edu ). writer : john toon

 researchers have created a new type of tiny 3d-printed robot that moves by harnessing vibration from piezoelectric actuators, ultrasound sources or even tiny speakers. swarms of these ""micro-bristle-bots"" might work together to sense environmental changes, move materials - or perhaps one day repair injuries inside the human body. 
 the prototype robots respond to different vibration frequencies depending on their configurations, allowing researchers to control individual bots by adjusting the vibration. approximately two millimeters long - about the size of the world's smallest ant - the bots can cover four times their own length in a second despite the physical limitations of their small size. 
 ""we are working to make the technology robust, and we have a lot of potential applications in mind,"" said 
 azadeh ansari , an assistant professor in the 
 school of electrical and computer engineering 
 at the georgia institute of technology. ""we are working at the intersection of mechanics, electronics, biology and physics. it's a very rich area and there's a lot of room for multidisciplinary concepts."" 
 a paper describing the micro-bristle-bots has been accepted for publication in the 
 journal of micromechanics and microengineering . the research was supported by a seed grant from georgia tech's institute for electronics and nanotechnology. in addition to ansari, the research team includes george w. woodruff school of mechanical engineering associate professor jun ueda and graduate students deagyu kim and zhijian (chris) hao. 
 the micro-bristle-bots consist of a piezoelectric actuator glued onto a polymer body that is 3d-printed using two-photon polymerization lithography (tpp). the actuator generates vibration and is powered externally because no batteries are small enough to fit onto the bot. the vibrations can also come from a piezoelectric shaker beneath the surface on which the robots move, from an ultrasound / sonar source, or even from a tiny acoustic speaker. 
 the vibrations move the springy legs up and down, propelling the micro-bot forward. each robot can be designed to respond to different vibration frequencies depending on leg size, diameter, design and overall geometry. the amplitude of the vibrations controls the speed at which the micro-bots move. 
 ""as the micro-bristle-bots move up and down, the vertical motion is translated into a directional movement by optimizing the design of the legs, which look like bristles,"" explained ansari. ""the legs of the micro-robot are designed with specific angles that allow them to bend and move in one direction in resonant response to the vibration."" 
 the micro-bristle-bots are made in a 3d printer using the tpp process, a technique that polymerizes a monomer resin material. once the portion of the resin block struck by the ultraviolet light has been chemically developed, the remainder can be washed away, leaving the desired robotic structure. 
 ""it's writing rather than traditional lithography,"" ansari explained. ""you are left with the structure that you write with a laser on the resin material. the process now takes quite a while, so we are looking at ways to scale it up to make hundreds or thousands of micro-bots at a time."" 
 some of the robots have four legs, while others have six. first author deagyu kim made hundreds of the tiny structures to determine the ideal configuration. 
 the piezoelectric actuators, which use the material lead zirconate titanate (pzt), vibrate when electric voltage is applied to them. in reverse, they can also be used to generate a voltage, when they are vibrated, a capability the micro-bristle-bots could use to power up onboard sensors when they are actuated by external vibrations. 
 ansari and her team are working to add steering capability to the robots by joining two slightly different micro-bristle-bots together. because each of the joined micro-bots would respond to different vibration frequencies, the combination could be steered by varying the frequencies and amplitudes. ""once you have a fully steerable micro-robot, you can imagine doing a lot of interesting things,"" she said. 
 other researchers have worked on micro-robots that use magnetic fields to produce movement, ansari noted. while that is useful for moving entire swarms at once, magnetic forces cannot easily be used to address individual robots within a swarm. the micro-bristle-bots created by ansari and her team are believed to be the smallest robots powered by vibration. 
 the micro-bristle-bots are approximately two millimeters in length, 1.8 millimeters wide and 0.8 millimeters thick, and weigh about five milligrams. the 3d printer can produce smaller robots, but with a reduced mass, the adhesion forces between the tiny devices and a surface can get very large. sometimes, the micro-bots cannot be separated from the tweezers used to pick them up. 
 ansari and her team have built a ""playground"" in which multiple micro-bots can move around as the researchers learn more about what they can do. they are also interested in developing micro-bots that can jump and swim. 
 ""we can look at the collective behavior of ants, for example, and apply what we learn from them to our little robots,"" she added. ""these micro-bristle-bots walk nicely in a laboratory environment, but there is a lot more we will have to do before they can go out into the outside world."" 
 the micro-bot fabrication was performed at the georgia tech institute for electronics and nanotechnology, a member of the national nanotechnology coordinated infrastructure, which is supported by the national science foundation through grant eccs-1542173.

tips-balanced-snacking.txt,"tips for balanced snacking 
 preparing snacks requires planning, but it can save time, money, and energy. 
 stock up on non-perishable snacks that can be kept in your desk or backpack without spoiling. 
 jun 29, 2022 
 - atlanta, ga 
 when the hunger monster strikes and you want a snack, it's easy to grab a bag of chips or a pack of cookies. but with a little planning, you can satisfy the craving with a healthier option. danielle southern, nutritionist in health initiatives in the division of student engagement and well-being, provides five tips for mindful and balanced snacking. 
 stock up on portable non-perishables. 
 a variety of items can be kept in your office or backpack without spoiling. 
 nuts or nut butter, jerky, trail mix, corn tortilla chips, popcorn, graham crackers, and cereal do not require refrigeration. 
 consider cold snacks. 
 having access to a refrigerator or lunch bag with an ice pack increases your snack options. 
 yogurt, cottage cheese, a sandwich or wrap, string cheese, berries, and dips like hummus, salsa, and guacamole stay fresh longer when refrigerated. if you don't have a place to keep these snacks cool, eat them within two hours to ensure they stay fresh. 
 pair a protein or fat with a carbohydrate. 
 this combination balances blood sugars and energy levels, making it easier to focus on projects and participate in other activities throughout the day. 
 examples of these pairings include tortilla chips and guacamole, sliced vegetables and hummus, cheese and crackers, and apples and peanut butter. 
 if you didn't bring a snack from home, find grab-and-go options at various campus locations. 
 coffee shops (blue donkey, kaldi's, and gold & bold) typically have fruit, nuts, and protein bars to accompany your beverage. coffee drinks that are milk-based (cow's milk or soy milk) can provide the protein / fat / carbohydrate combination. 
 the dive in the campus recreation center has smoothies, fruit cups, hummus, and wraps. 
 rising roll has avocado toast, smoothies, wraps, and milk-based coffee drinks. 
 remember to hydrate. 
 water is the fluid our bodies need the most, but 100% of your fluid needs do not have to come from plain water. 
 high water fruits and vegetables (such as cucumbers, leafy greens, watermelon, grapes, and apples), tea, coffee, milk, sparkling water, and soups all contain fluids. be mindful of sodium and caffeine levels, as these can lead to more fluid losses when consumed in excess. 
 not a fan of plain water? try adding fruit slices, flavor drops, or low-sugar drink mixes. you can even experiment with different temperatures of water or use ice cubes made from frozen 100% fruit juice. 
 ""prepping snacks can take some planning, but it can save you time, money, and energy,"" said southern. ""experiment with different snack combinations to see what works best for you. your tastes can change over time, and that's ok.""

tips-delightful-stargazing-2023.txt,"tips for delightful stargazing in 2023 
 public nights begin at the georgia tech observatory. 
 several telescopes will be set up for viewing or visitors may bring their own telescope to public nights at the georgia tech observatory. 
 feb 01, 2023 
 - atlanta, ga 
 stargazers are invited to the georgia tech observatory to view celestial events this semester. several telescopes will be set up for viewing, or you may bring your own telescope. (please note that the first public night, originally scheduled for thursday, feb. 2, from 7 to 9 p.m. on the grounds between the howey and mason buildings, has been canceled due to weather.) 
 jim sowell, principal academic professional and director of the 
 georgia tech observatory , acts as a tour guide for public nights. ""a clear evening with some celestial objects visible is as much a delight for me as it is for the visitors,"" he said. 
 sowell and members of the georgia tech astronomy club will be available to answer questions. the viewing target for feb. 2 is a comet that is barely visible with the naked eye, so viewers at georgia tech will have to use a telescope. the public night is from 7 to 9 p.m., with best viewing of the comet between 9 p.m. and midnight. however, forecasters are calling for heavy rain, so the odds of having the program are extremely low. visitors to the georgia tech observatory should check for updates on the 
 astronomy website . 
 other celestial events to consider in 2023 range from a meteor shower to the ""ring of fire"" solar eclipse. 
 when to view the planets: 
 venus can be seen in the evening sky beginning in february and then it ""rules the sky"" into july. 
 jupiter and venus will be approximately 0.5 degrees apart on march 1 and 2, appearing close to colliding even though the two are millions of miles apart. march 2 is another public night at the georgia tech observatory, so a large crowd is expected. 
 jupiter remains visible until mid-march, then returns to the evening sky in autumn. 
 mercury will be best seen after sunset during the first half of april. 
 mars remains visible until july. it is currently bright but slowly fades during this time. 
 saturn is near the sun's direction and returns to the evening sky in late summer. 
 the perseid meteor shower always occurs on aug. 11. stargazers need to be away from bright lights to experience this, but no telescope is needed. 
 a blue moon 
 - 
 the second full moon in a calendar month 
 - 
 occurs in august. 
 a ring of fire solar eclipse, when the moon covers the sun's disk, will occur mid-day on oct. 14. 
 ""from georgia tech we will see a partial solar eclipse where more than 50% of the sun's disk will be blocked out at the peak,"" sowell said. ""you will need to use eye-safe glasses, like those used for the 2017 eclipse, or use eye-safe telescopes, such as the several we have at the observatory."" 
 unfortunately, there is no lunar eclipse visible from atlanta for 2023. ""europe and asia are getting two nice eclipses this year, so if you want to see them you will have to travel,"" sowell said. 
 public nights at the georgia tech observatory are free, but remember to pay for parking if you use a visitor lot. 
 additional public nights will be held this spring on march 2, from 7 to 9 p.m.; march 30, from 8:00 to 10:00 p.m.; and on april 27, from 9 to 11 p.m.

title-ix-turns-50.txt,"title ix turns 50 
 title ix made a monumental impact on the quest for equality and continues to do so half a century later. 
 much of the attention on title ix focuses on opportunities for women to participate in athletics. 
 jun 21, 2022 
 - atlanta, ga 
 title ix - the federal law that prevents discrimination based on sex by any education program receiving federal funds - turns 50 on june 23. the clause, part of the education legislation passed in 1972, made a monumental impact on the quest for equality and continues to do so half a century later. 
 ""when i was growing up, i didn't have the opportunity to play organized sports. it was for the boys,"" said nell fortner, georgia tech women's basketball head coach. ""now, little girls start playing soccer at age 4 or 5. they get to play t-ball. they get to do everything just like the boys. that was not the world i grew up in, and it's really cool to see."" 
 although title ix was implemented too late to affect fortner's early years, it has played a big role in her adulthood. 
 ""i hate to even think about having to spend my whole life without title ix because it gave me my career,"" she said. ""it gave me tremendous opportunities, from coaching the 2000 olympics team to traveling the world playing sports against the best women's teams. without title ix, i would have had none of those opportunities."" 
 much of the attention on title ix focuses on opportunities for women to participate in athletics. but the law also prohibits sex discrimination, which has been defined to include sexual assault and sexual harassment, as well as sex-based discrimination in a school's courses, programs, and activities. the law also prohibits discrimination based on pregnancy. 
 ""the federal government identified that women were dropping out or were being told to leave because they were pregnant,"" said alexis martinez, georgia tech's executive director of equity and compliance programs. ""title ix put in protections in the education space that made it illegal to remove a woman from their job or from school because she was pregnant. in higher education we work with pregnant students to help them finish their studies."" 
 title ix also increased conversations and actions involving parity for women who were earning degrees and applying for faculty positions. 
 ""women wanted placement in the same kinds of job opportunities as men,"" martinez said. ""instead of being offered lecture or adjunct positions, they wanted full professor positions, and they deserved them because they were doing the same work. and then with the same titles, you want the same pay. so, all of that is also covered under title ix."" 
 there are also provisions for access to scholarships and financial aid, as well as housing to ensure there is no discrimination based on sex. 
 ""at georgia tech, there was a particular focus on stem fields. the federal government recognized that women were not going into science, engineering, and math. so, they included a particular focus in the legislation to make sure that women were given access to those fields,"" martinez said. 
 over the last 50 years, progress has been made toward equity, but there is still more to be done, according to joeleen akin, senior associate athletic director for student-athlete development and senior woman administrator for the georgia tech athletic association. 
 ""it's always going to be a work in progress,"" said akin, who, as senior woman administrator, holds the highest female position on the athletic association staff. she oversees volleyball, women's basketball, men's and women's swimming and diving, softball, and men's golf, as well as other departments such as sports medicine, student-athlete development, and player development. 
 ""most of the time i'm in the room when decisions are made,"" she said. ""todd stansbury, director of athletics, is inclusive, welcoming, and empowering. he really values the role of the senior woman administrator and makes sure that i'm involved in decision making, which is very important."" 
 when it comes to what's next for title ix, akin is keeping an eye on the ncaa's name, image, and likeness (nil) policy, which will allow college athletes to monetize their success on the field through brand partnerships. 
 ""there's a lot of uncertainty regarding how nil will affect title ix. how will it affect women, and how are we going to continue to provide equitable opportunities to women as well? what is it going to look like two years from now?"" she asks. 
 student-athletes are also top of mind for aileen morales, georgia tech head softball coach, who grew up with title ix as the norm. 
 ""gender should never limit your opportunities,"" she said. ""title ix is good for everyone because it provides similar opportunities regardless of gender. we're very appreciative of the women who paved the way before us, pushing for legislation, and then continuing to fight for opportunities for women in sports and in education."" 
 morales said a benefit of title ix that is sometimes overlooked is how it helps student-athletes after graduation. 
 ""being part of a team teaches student-athletes how to work with others and how to deal with adversity. when they go out into the world, the experience will help them to lead people and navigate challenges."" 
 note: the library, the athletic association, and the equity and compliance programs office are designing a graphic panel exhibit to celebrate the 50th anniversary of title ix, which will open in early august and run through december.

 - atlanta, ga 
 georgia tech's undergraduate research journal, 
 the tower , is back after a dormant period. current editor-in-chief, clinton smith has sought out a new crop of undergraduate and graduate students, along with faculty members, to review submissions and refresh the journal's look. 
 the tower 
 aims to continue highlighting students' research efforts for years to come. 
 here is a breakdown of the submission process and what we can expect from 
 the tower 
 in the future: 
 submissions are reviewed on a rolling basis with one deadline per semester. the current deadline for the spring 2021 semester is april 19. there are two submission categories, which include undergraduate research opportunity program (urop) summaries and a research report. the urop summaries are 300-600-word summaries of research, including preliminary results. the research report submission should follow the same guidelines as published articles in scientific journals: abstract, introduction, methods, results, discussion, references, and figures. in the submission 
 page , students are instructed to submit an abstract, research paper, and the name of the faculty advisor overseeing the project among other submission criteria. 
 after they receive a submission, the submissions and review team seeks out undergraduate students, grad students, and faculty involved in the same or intersecting area of research. there are currently two students in the submissions and review team, and with their efforts, each entry has an average of at least six reviewers. the team sends a rubric to each reviewer and, after careful consideration, will notify the applicant of their submission status. this holistic process takes a couple of months for each submission. 
 the upcoming issue will include news, interviews, abstracts, and articles among other sections yet to be announced. the staff is also in the process of pitching ideas for interviews, spotlights, and features to be added to the journal. smith is aiming to have a diverse pool of submissions from different majors to reflect the research community on campus. in previous years, the journal has received submissions from biomedical engineering, mechanical engineering, computer science, and economics, but are hoping to attract students from all majors. 
 the journal will be published on an annual basis with its comeback issue planned for spring 2022. print and online versions of the next issue will be distributed on campus.

transfer-technique-produces-wearable-gallium-nitride-gas-sensors-0.txt,"transfer technique produces wearable gallium nitride gas sensors 
 a new technique allows gallium nitride gas sensors to be grown on a standard substrate and then transferred to a different support.

 a transfer technique based on thin sacrificial layers of boron nitride could allow high-performance gallium nitride gas sensors to be grown on sapphire substrates and then transferred to metallic or flexible polymer support materials. the technique could facilitate the production of low-cost wearable, mobile and disposable sensing devices for a wide range of environmental applications. 
 transferring the gallium nitride sensors to metallic foils and flexible polymers doubles their sensitivity to nitrogen dioxide gas, and boosts response time by a factor of six. the simple production steps, based on metal organic vapor phase epitaxy (movpe), could also lower the cost of producing the sensors and other optoelectronic devices. 
 sensors produced with the new process can detect ammonia at parts-per-billion levels and differentiate between nitrogen-containing gases. the gas sensor fabrication technique was reported november 9 in the journal 
 scientific reports . 
 ""mechanically, we just peel the devices off the substrate, like peeling the layers of an onion,"" explained 
 abdallah ougazzaden , director of georgia tech lorraine in metz, france and a professor in georgia tech's 
 school of electrical and computer engineering 
 (ece). ""we can put the layer on another support that could be flexible, metallic or plastic. this technique really opens up a lot of opportunity for new functionality, new devices - and commercializing them."" 
 the researchers begin the process by growing monolayers of boron nitride on two-inch sapphire wafers using an movpe process at approximately 1,300 degrees celsius. the boron nitride surface coating is only a few nanometers thick, and produces crystalline structures that have strong planar surface connections, but weak vertical connections. 
 aluminum gallium nitride (algan / gan) devices are then grown atop the monolayers at a temperature of about 1,100 degrees celsius, also using an movpe process. because of the boron nitride crystalline properties, the devices are attached to the substrate only by weak van der waals forces, which can be overcome mechanically. the devices can be transferred to other substrates without inducing cracks or other defects. the sapphire wafers can be reused for additional device growth. 
 ""this approach for engineering gan-based sensors is a key step in the pathway towards economically viable, flexible sensors with improved performances that could be integrated into wearable applications,"" the authors wrote in their paper. 
 so far, the researchers have transferred the sensors to copper foil, aluminum foil and polymeric materials. in operation, the devices can differentiate between nitrogen oxide, nitrogen dioxide, and ammonia. because the devices are approximately 100 by 100 microns, sensors for multiple gases can be produced on a single integrated device. 
 ""not only can we differentiate between these gases, but because the sensor is very small, we can detect them all at the same time with an array of sensors,"" said ougazzaden, who expects that the devices could be modified to also detect ozone, carbon dioxide and other gases. 
 the gallium nitride sensors could have a wide range of applications from industry to vehicle engines - and for wearable sensing devices. the devices are attractive because of their advantageous materials properties, which include high thermal and chemical stability. 
 ""the devices are small and flexible, which will allow us to put them onto many different types of support,"" said ougazzaden, who also directs the international joint research lab at georgia tech cnrs. 
 to assess the effects of transferring the devices to a different substrate, the researchers measured device performance on the original sapphire wafer and compared that to performance on the new metallic and polymer substrates. they were surprised to see a doubling of the sensor sensitivity and a six-fold increase in response time, changes beyond what could be expected by a simple thermal change in the devices. 
 ""not only can we have flexibility in the substrate, but we can also improve the performance of the devices just by moving them to a different support with appropriate properties,"" he said. ""properties of the substrate alone makes the different in the performance."" 
 in future work, the researchers hope to boost the quality of the devices and demonstrate other sensing applications. ""one of the challenges ahead is to improve the quality of the materials so we can extend this to other applications that are very sensitive to the substrates, such as high-performance electronics."" 
 the georgia tech researchers have previously used a similar technique to produce light-emitting diodes and ultraviolet detectors that were transferred to different substrates, and they believe the process could also be used to produce high-power electronics. for those applications, transferring the devices from sapphire to substrates with better thermal conductivity could provide a significant advantage in device operation. 
 ougazzaden and his research team have been working on boron-based semiconductors since 2005. their work has attracted visits from several industrial companies interested in exploring the technology, he said. 
 ""i am very excited and lucky to work on such hot topic and top-notch technology at gt-lorraine,"" said taha ayari, a ph.d. student in the georgia tech school of ece and the paper's first author. 
 in addition to ougazzaden, the research team includes georgia tech ph.d. students taha ayari, matthew jordan, xin li and saiful alam; chris bishop and youssef elgmili, researchers at institut lafayette; suresh sundaram, a researcher at georgia tech lorraine; gilles patriarche, a researcher at the centre de nanosciences et de nanotechnologies (c2n) at cnrs; paul voss, an associate professor in the georgia tech school of ece; and jean paul salvestrini, a professor at georgia tech lorraine and adjunct professor in the georgia tech school of ece. 
 the research was supported by anr (agence nationale de recherche), the national agency of research in france through the ""ganex"" project.

triboelectric-nanogenerators-boost-mass-spectrometry-performance.txt,"triboelectric nanogenerators boost mass spectrometry performance 
 researchers have harnessed triboelectric nanogenerators to improve the sensitivity of mass spectrometers. 
 anyin li, a postdoctoral fellow in the georgia tech school of chemistry and biochemistry, demonstrates the use of a sliding triboelectric nanogenerator to produce electrical charges for the mass spectrometer device shown next to him. (credit: rob felt, georgia tech) 
 feb 27, 2017 
 - atlanta, ga 
 triboelectric nanogenerators (teng) convert mechanical energy harvested from the environment to electricity for powering small devices such as sensors or for recharging consumer electronics. now, researchers have harnessed these devices to improve the charging of molecules in a way that dramatically boosts the sensitivity of a widely-used chemical analysis technique. 
 researchers at the georgia institute of technology have shown that replacing conventional power supplies with 
 teng devices 
 for charging the molecules being analyzed can boost the sensitivity of mass spectrometers to unprecedented levels. the improvement also allows identification to be done with smaller sample volumes, potentially conserving precious biomolecules or chemical mixtures that may be available only in minute quantities. 
 though the mechanism by which the enhancement takes place requires more study, the researchers believe the unique aspects of the teng output - oscillating high voltage and controlled current - allow improvements in the ionization process, increasing the voltage applied without damaging samples or the instrument. the research, which was supported by the national science foundation, nasa astrobiology program and the department of energy, is reported february 27 in the journal 
 nature nanotechnology . 
 ""our discovery is basically a new and very controlled way of putting charge onto molecules,"" said 
 facundo fernández , a professor in georgia tech's 
 school of chemistry and biochemistry 
 who uses mass spectrometry to study everything from small drug molecules to large proteins. ""we know exactly how much charge we produce using these nanogenerators, allowing us to reach sensitivity levels that are unheard-of - at the zeptomole scale. we can measure down to literally hundreds of molecules without tagging."" 
 fernández and his research team worked with 
 zhong lin wang , a pioneer in developing the teng technology. wang, a regents professor in georgia tech's 
 school of materials science and engineering , said the tengs provide consistent charging levels that produce quantized ion pulses of adjustable duration, polarity and frequency. 
 ""the key here is that the total charge delivered in each cycle is entirely controlled and constant regardless of the speed at which the teng is triggered,"" said wang, who holds the hightower chair in the school of materials science and engineering. ""this is a new direction for the triboelectric nanogenerators and opens a door for using the technology in the design of future instrumentation and equipment. this research demonstrates another practical impact of teng technology."" 
 mass spectrometry measures the mass-to-charge ratio of ions to identify and quantify molecules in both simple and complex mixtures. the technology is used across a broad range of scientific fields and applications, with molecules ranging from small drug compounds on up to large biomolecules. mass spectrometry is used in biomedicine, food science, homeland security, systems biology, drug discovery and other areas. 
 but in conventional electrospray mass spec techniques, as much as 99 percent of the sample can be wasted during ionization, said fernández, who holds the vasser woolley foundation chair in bioanalytical chemistry. that's largely because in conventional systems, the mass analysis process is pulsed or scanned, while the ionization of samples is continuous. the new teng pulsed power source allows scientists to time the ionization to match what's happening inside the mass spectrometer, specifically within a component known as the mass analyzer. 
 beyond improved sensitivity and the ability to analyze very small sample quantities, the new technique also allows ion deposition on surfaces, even non-conducting ones. that's because the oscillating ionization produces a sequence of alternating positive and negative charges, producing a net neutral surface, fernández said. 
 mass spectrometers require large amounts of power for creating the vacuum essential to measuring the mass-to-charge ratio of each molecule. while it's possible that future teng devices could power an entire miniature mass spectrometer, the teng devices are now used just to ionize samples. 
 ""the nanogenerators could eliminate a big chunk of the mass spectrometer system because they wouldn't need a more powerful device for making the ions,"" fernández said. ""this could be particularly applicable to conditions that are extreme and harsh, such as on a battlefield or in space, where you would need a very robust and self-contained unit."" 
 triboelectric nanogenerators, developed by wang in 2012, use a combination of the triboelectric effect and electrostatic induction to generate small amounts of electrical power from mechanical motion such as rotation, sliding or vibration. the triboelectric effect takes advantage of the fact that certain materials become electrically charged after they come into moving contact with a surface made from a different material. wang and his research team have developed tengs with four different working modes, including a rotating disc that may be ideal for high throughput mass spectrometry experiments. this paper is the first publication about an application of teng to an advanced instrument. 
 wang's team has measured voltage levels at the mass spec ionizer of between 6,000 and 8,000 volts. standard ionizers normally operate at less than 1,500 volts. the technology has been used with both electrospray ionization and plasma discharge ionization, with the flexibility of generating single polarity or alternating polarity ion pulses. 
 ""because the voltage from these nanogenerators is high, we believe that the size of the sample droplets can be much smaller than with the conventional way of making ions,"" fernández said. ""that increases the ion generation efficiency. we are operating in a completely different electrospray regime, and it could completely change the way this technology is used."" 
 the teng technology could be retrofitted to existing mass spectrometers, as fernández has already done in his lab. with publication of the journal article, he hopes other labs will start exploring use of the teng devices in mass spectrometry and other areas. ""i see potential not only in analytical chemistry, but also in synthesis, electrochemistry and other areas that require a controlled way of producing electrical charges,"" fernández said. 
 the research was initiated by postdoctoral fellows in the two laboratory groups, anyin li and yunlong zi. ""this project really shows how innovation can happen at the boundaries between different disciplines when scientists are free to pursue new ideas,"" fernández added. 
 this work was jointly supported by nsf and the nasa astrobiology program, under the nsf center for chemical evolution, che-1504217. research was also supported by the u.s. department of energy, office of energy sciences (award de-fg02-07er46394), and the national science foundation (dmr-1505319). any opinions, findings, and conclusions or recommendations expressed in this material are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of the sponsors.

 the turner foundation recently awarded the georgia tech foundation a $40,000 grant to support two projects of the region's new sustainability network, rce greater atlanta, officially acknowledged by the united nations university. the projects include a training program on the u.n. sdgs (sustainable development goals) to be led by the rce greater atlanta youth network and the fourth iteration of the environmental justice academy leadership development program. project leads are georgia tech's center for serve-learn-sustain, atlanta metropolitan state college, center for sustainable communities, epa region 4, and cifal atlanta at kennesaw state university. 
 rce greater atlanta is part of the global rce network, which includes 168 networks worldwide, with seven in the u.s. rces support implementation of the u.n. sdgs at the regional level through education and training. rce greater atlanta brings together 10 universities and colleges with nonprofit, community, government, and business partners to offer broad-based, multi-stakeholder educational and training programs that support key regional sustainable development efforts. it focuses especially on equity and justice issues inherent in sustainable development. 
 one of rce greater atlanta's most important initiatives is its youth network. the rce global network recognizes the need for youth to be educated on the sdgs since they will be the ones facing and solving these problems in the future. the rce greater atlanta youth network connects college students and young alumni from the network's college and university members to each other and to the other members of rce greater atlanta to collaborate on sustainability programs, engage in professional development, and work on projects with other rce youth networks across the u.s. and the world. the turner foundation grant will support students in the youth network to create an online training program and complementary in-person workshops focused on the network's seven priority sdgs: 1-no poverty; 2-zero hunger; 3-good health and well-being; 4-quality education; 9-industry, innovation, and infrastructure; 11-sustainable cities and communities; and 13-climate action. the grant will also fund a conference on youth action around the sdgs. 
 ""i am honored that the rce greater atlanta youth network is a recipient of the turner foundation grant. working with youth network members to create training modules focused on our rce's priority sdgs will be a wonderful opportunity to collaborate across schools to ensure we are producing an educational tool that best represents what students want. this project will be a great sdg learning opportunity for not only the youth network members involved in the process of creating the modules, but also the larger greater atlanta community,"" said isabella stubbs, georgia tech environmental engineering student and youth network co-lead. 
 the second project to be supported by the turner foundation grant is the environmental justice academy (eja), an intensive leadership development program for community leaders that is now also including faculty, staff, and student participants from higher education partners. launched in 2016 by epa region 4, the eja trains participants to identify environmental challenges and achieve sustainable, community environmental improvement goals. redesigned and led by atlanta metropolitan state college (amsc), center for sustainable communities, and epa region 4, the fourth academy began on march 28, 2019. under the direction of attorney anne heard, executive in residence; kenja mccray, associate professor of history; and dean vance gray of the social sciences division, amsc's goal is supporting the academy in growing and thriving in a location central to the communities the college serves. the turner foundation grant supported the college's aims by underwriting scholarships for 16 eja participants, the overwhelming majority of whom serve the most vulnerable populations in the southeastern region of the united states. 
 the funding will go a long way to ensuring the continued success of the youth network and environmental justice academy. ""the mission and purpose of the environmental justice academy is to assist front-line organizations and communities in building additional capacity to immediately mitigate current and potential environmental hazards and challenges, and to help transform some of our most distressed and underserved communities into ones that are vibrant, thriving and sustainable. the grant from the turner foundation will serve as the principal catalyst for the success of this initiative,"" states garry harris, president, center for sustainable communities, and lead consultant for the eja. 
 serena newhall, program specialist with cifal atlanta at kennesaw state university, adds, ""youth engagement is at the center of successful implementation of the sdgs, which is why the youth network operates at the core of rce greater atlanta. turner foundation funding will allow us to create a platform for knowledge-sharing that will address the ongoing training needs of our youth network, providing them with the practical tools needed to identify and respond to the social, economic, and ecological sustainability needs of their communities, while in the process learning to recognize their own individual strengths, passions, and potential for leadership."" 
 ted turner, turner foundation founder and chairman, has always been interested in the totality of the planet. in fact, he believes so emphatically in protecting the environment from further degradation that he views it as no less than ""an effort to ensure the survival of the human species."" to that end, in 1990 he founded the turner foundation, whose principles are rooted in its commitment to protecting and restoring the natural systems of  land ,  air , and  water  on which all life depends. 
 one of the turner foundation's priorities is to grow the movement, with an emphasis on engaging youth and addressing environmental injustice. ""supporting the united nations' acknowledged greater atlanta regional center of expertise was a natural fit,"" says judy adler, president of turner foundation inc. ""we were impressed with the commitment to collaboration among student leaders at 10 of atlanta's higher education institutions, and the potential for atlanta to be a global model for implementing the u.n. sustainable development goals (sdgs) at the local level."" the turner foundation's sister foundation is the un foundation, which works with the un to implement the sdgs - the world's shared plan to end extreme poverty, reduce inequalities, and protect the planet by 2030. 
 the turner foundation hopes this grant will help to harness the energy of students and community leaders to be sustainable development changemakers in atlanta and beyond.

 a power management and storage system could boost energy harvesting.

 a two-stage power management and storage system could dramatically improve the efficiency of triboelectric generators that harvest energy from irregular human motion such as walking, running or finger tapping. the system uses a small capacitor to capture alternating current generated by the biomechanical activity. when the first capacitor fills, a power management circuit then feeds the electricity into a battery or larger capacitor. this second storage device supplies dc current at voltages appropriate for powering wearable and mobile devices such as watches, heart monitors, calculators, thermometers - and even wireless remote entry devices for vehicles. by matching the impedance of the storage device to that of the triboelectric generators, the new system can boost energy efficiency from just one percent to as much as 60 percent. the research was reported december 11 in the journal 
 nature communications . ""with a high-output triboelectric generator and this power management circuit, we can power a range of applications from human motion,"" said simiao niu, a graduate research assistant in the 
 school of materials science and engineering 
 at the georgia institute of technology. ""the first stage of our system is matched to the triboelectric nanogenerator, and the second stage is matched to the application that it will be powering."" triboelectric nanogenerators use a combination of the triboelectric effect and electrostatic induction to generate small amounts of electrical power from mechanical motions such as rotation, sliding or vibration. the triboelectric effect takes advantage of the fact that certain materials become electrically charged after they come into moving contact with a surface made from a different material. however, the output is alternating current, which can power applications such as led lighting - but is not ideal for mobile devices. ordinary alternating current can be converted to direct current by using a transformer - but such a device requires consistency in the number of cycles per second. because biomechanical energy sources such as walking or finger tapping produce fluctuating amplitude and variable frequencies, a standard transformer can't be used. in addition, the output from a triboelectric generator tends to have high voltage and low current - while applications for it require just the opposite: low voltage and higher current. to address the problem, niu and collaborators under the supervision of professor 
 zhong lin wang 
 at georgia tech developed their power management system, which converts the fluctuating power amplitudes and variable frequencies to a continuous direct current. the power management system can work with any triboelectric generator that produces a minimum of 100 microwatts. the system requires some power to operate, but compensates by increasing the overall output as much as 330 times to reach milliwatt levels. ""it doesn't matter what kind of mechanical motion or what frequency of mechanical motion you have as long as the energy input is high,"" said niu. ""this is a critical step in the commercialization of triboelectric nanogenerators because it opens up a range of new applications."" with finger tapping as the only energy source, the power unit provides continuous direct current of 1.044 milliwatts. the unit can work continuously with the motion, allowing devices to be operated even as the device charges the battery or capacitor. beyond portable electronics, niu believes the system could be useful in powering networks of sensors, allowing long-term operation without the need for replacing batteries. ""in a sensor network, you would have so many devices that you could not replace all of the batteries,"" he said. ""this technology would allow you to power the sensors by harvesting energy from the environment and then directly providing energy for each component of the network."" with the energy management circuitry demonstrated in this proof-of-concept, the next step will be to miniaturize the circuitry to fit into an overall system, said zhong ling wang, a regents professor in the georgia tech school of materials science and engineering who led development of the original triboelectric nanogenerators. ""this new device provides a bridge between the triboelectric nanogenerator and many different types of applications,"" he said. ""this work will allow us to build a package that can power wearable and mobile devices from the motion of humans. with constant output from a battery or large capacitor, you can drive just about any device that you want."" the power management system could also be applied to piezoelectric and pyroelectric generators, which also produce alternating current. in 2012, wang and his research team announced triboelectric nanogenerators that produce small amounts of electricity from motion in the world around us - by capturing the electrical charge produced when two different kinds of plastic materials rub against one another. based on flexible polymer materials, the triboelectric generators provide alternating current (ac) from activities such as walking. variations in generator structures allow a variety of applications depending on the source of mechanical energy. wang's team has reported four major groups of generators including those that operate by (1) vertical contact-separation mode, (2) lateral sliding mode, (3) single-electron mode, and (4) freestanding triboelectric-layer mode. there are also hybrid combinations of these major structural modes. citation : simiao niu, xiaofeng wang, fang yi, yu sheng zhou and zhong lin wang, ""a universal self-charging system driven by random biomechanical energy for sustainable operation of mobile electronics,"" (nature communications, 2015).

two-tech-women-pave-their-own-way-automotive-industry.txt,"two tech women pave their own way in automotive industry 
 georgia tech graduates jenn voelker and julia vorpahl are in the driver's seat working for karma automotive in california. 
 mar 23, 2023 
 women make up just 24% of the automotive industry, but georgia tech graduates jenn voelker and julia vorpahl haven't let statistics stop them from paving their own way in a male-dominated field. 
 both voelker and vorpahl work for karma automotive, a luxury electric vehicle manufacturer based in california. beginning with their time at tech, they've never let gender bias stop them from pursuing their passion. 
 ""it's math,"" vorpahl, a 
 visualization and digital design modeler at karma, said. ""you either get the question right, or you get the question wrong. i think that attitude really helps when you get into a professional environment. it teaches you to have tougher skin where if you are the best for that job, you will get the job. that's what georgia tech instilled."" 
 vorpahl grew up in the industry watching her family operate what is now the oldest independently owned mercedes-benz dealer in metro atlanta after her grandfather, an engine designer for the german automaker, came to america and opened the shop in 1967. she arrived at georgia tech unsure if she'd follow in her family's footsteps, but ultimately, she landed an internship at daimler, the nation's largest commercial vehicle manufacturer. 
 while other interns came in with a background in automotive design, vorpahl's willingness to learn and tireless work ethic landed her a full-time job as the only woman in the company's design studio. 
 during her three years at daimler before accepting her position at karma in 2022, she'd occasionally make the drive from portland, oregon, back to georgia. along the way, she crossed paths with truckers, who often expressed surprise that vorpahl was among those behind the scenes designing their rigs. she often heard questions like ""why do you work there?"" or ""how did you end up there?"" 
 and her response was simple. ""women like cars, too."" 
 that rang true through voelker's childhood as well. when the senior director of program management for karma arrived in atlanta for her first year at georgia tech, she knew she'd found a place that could help her turn an aptitude for math and science, and a fervor for cars, into a career. 
 ""best move i ever made,"" voelker said on her decision to enroll at tech, although it wasn't just the institute's stellar reputation that lured her from her home state of new hampshire. ""i visited campus in february. there was 6 feet of snow on the ground and then i came to atlanta, and the flowers were blooming."" 
 after changing her major from mechanical engineering to industrial design, voelker got her foot in the door through an internship with masterack, a commercial cargo vehicle equipment manufacturer based in atlanta. she attended tech at a time when women made up around 27% of the undergraduate population, so when she entered the workforce, she wasn't fazed. ""it never bothered me. i have always felt like i fit right in, especially when it's 
 the right school, the right class, or the right company where everybody appreciates learning from each other and working together towards a common goal ,"" she said. 
 in fact, her experience on north avenue taught her to 
 always keep learning and never give up , a piece of advice she now passes along to other women entering the industry. 
 "" don't be afraid to g ive your opinion in meetings, speak up and use all of the knowledge that you've learned over the years toward whatever project you're working on,"" said voelker, who worked her way up the ladder at masterack for 18 years before seeking a new challenge at karma. ""that's one thing that i haven't backed down on. if i have a strong opinion about something, i have no fear of saying it."" 
 vorpahl and voelker each commended karma for their dedication to promoting hard-working women and a culture that fosters diversity - a principle that vorpahl especially values after completing two study abroad programs at the university of singapore and the university of strathclyde. 
 ""one of the biggest advantages was seeing how people from different countries approach design and how different schools approach design. you don't want a bunch of people who all think exactly the same way. otherwise, we'd all be driving around in the exact same vehicle,"" she said. 
 leading karma's commercial vehicle product line, voelker noted that she has continued to see more women 
 in leadership positions and at industry conferences , and she hopes that momentum carries over to the next generation. highlighting the importance of igniting both young girls' and boys' interest in stem, voelker recently spoke to a local second grade class to share her experiences. 
 ""i've been really fortunate to have had some great mentors over my career, so i love to pay it forward to the younger generation,"" she said. ""they were so excited, and i hope that stays with them and excites them to learn more about engineering."" 
 in addition to providing an example to young women of how to succeed in a competitive industry, vorpahl also hopes to share the technical aspects of what she's learned in the field with her alma mater and offer future graduates a roadmap to a career in automotive design. 
 ""the students would thrive in this industry because it is so nitpicky, and tech minds would just love it,"" she said. ""there's not really a direct path from the georgia tech studios into car studios, so i'm hoping that i can show them that path."" 
 voelker and vorpahl are bonded by their employer and their alma mater, but it's their shared passion for seeing their hard work hit the pavement that continues to drive them.

two-way-cell-based-treatment-repairs-muscle-after-rotator-cuff-injury.txt,"two-way cell-based treatment repairs muscle after rotator cuff injury 
 new treatment helps muscle regenerate following shoulder surgery 
 mar 26, 2024 
 a team of georgia tech researchers has introduced a 
 new therapeutic system 
 to offset the poor clinical outcomes often associated with common rotator cuff surgery. 
 it's the kind of surgery that makes headlines whenever a famous athlete is sidelined with a torn rotator cuff. major league baseball all-star pitchers clayton kershaw and justin verlander, for example, both had rotator cuff surgeries and made successful comebacks. 
 for those of us who can't throw baseballs 95 miles an hour, the rotator cuff may tear over time from repeated overhead motions (painters and carpenters, for instance). or an injury can occur as we age and our body's tissues naturally degenerate. and although rotator cuff injuries are common, they can be serious, leading to muscle degeneration after surgery. 
 now, two professors from the 
 wallace h. coulter department of biomedical engineering , a joint department of georgia tech and emory university, have addressed the problem with a novel cell-based dual treatment, which they describe in a study published recently in the journal 
 tissue engineering . 
 ""we're thinking mainly of an aging population with this study - the people most likely to have these injuries,"" said 
 johnna temenoff , whose research group collaborated with the lab of 
 ed botchwey 
 on this work. ""the great thing about this system is, it isn't specific to a particular population. these are cells we all have, and this treatment system might work even better in younger patients."" 
 local delivery 
 the rotator cuff is a group of muscles and tendons surrounding and protecting the shoulder joint, keeping the head of the upper arm bone firmly in the shallow socket of the shoulder. it's tight jumble of tissues, and not an easy environment for muscle regeneration. 
 ""with a rotator cuff injury, you're actually tearing the tendon,"" said temenoff, director of the nsf engineering research center for cell manufacturing technologies ( cmat ) at georgia tech. ""and that causes the muscle to atrophy."" 
 while pro athletes have access to world-class training and rehabilitation to help rebuild the shoulder following surgery, for many patients that rotator cuff muscle doesn't fully regenerate, even after a successful surgery. temenoff isn't sure why. 
 ""that's a big unknown,"" she said. ""and it's a big field of study right now, an active area of research. there is a need for regenerative therapies that can be used in conjunction with rotator cuff restoration surgery, as a long-term treatment option -that is what we are addressing."" 
 in previous studies using mouse models, temenoff found that she could change the cellular environment in the muscle with the local injection of microparticles loaded with a protein called stromal cell-derived factor (sdf), which can attract various pre-regenerative cells circulating to the muscle. 
 the push-pull effect 
 the idea is to mobilize the cells that can heal, the cells that rebuild muscle at the source. getting enough of them to do the work is the trick. 
 temenoff's lab 
 has developed microparticles that use heparin, a natural sugar-based molecule found in the body that has a high negative charge. sdf is positive-charged, so that electrostatic interaction between the two particles allows for controlled release of sdf over time. 
 sdf interacts almost magnetically with a receptor on pro-regenerative cells in bone marrow or circulation to ""call"" them to a certain location. however, older people may not have enough of these cells in circulation to make much of a difference in healing. that's where 
 botchwey's lab 
 entered with the major assist. 
 his team provided experience with a bone marrow mobilizing agent (called vpc01091) that can send healing cells into circulation around the body. in clinical settings, bone marrow mobilizing agents are used to ""push"" stem cells out of the marrow and into the blood. these cells can regenerate and differentiate into all kinds of cells in multiple tissue environments. 
 the researchers set out to develop a single therapeutic option by combining the two technologies. here's what happened when they tested the system in rats: the mobilizing agent was injected systemically while the sdf was injected locally into the shoulder. so, while the mobilizing agent ""pushed"" pro-healing cells into circulation, sdf's magnetic effect ""pulled"" them to the injury site, resulting in the desired regenerative effects. 
 the researchers found different levels of regeneration spatially-in other words, where they applied the local injection really matters. further research will aim to fine-tune the process, so clinicians can recruit healing cells to even more specific areas of the damaged muscle. temenoff and her collaborators believe they are onto something that will result in better muscle regeneration, with potential applications beyond the rotator cuff.

 - atlanta, ga 
 a new fabrication technique that produces platinum hollow nanocages with ultra-thin walls could dramatically reduce the amount of the costly metal needed to provide catalytic activity in such applications as fuel cells. the technique uses a solution-based method for producing atomic-scale layers of platinum to create hollow, porous structures that can generate catalytic activity both inside and outside the nanocages. the layers are grown on palladium nanocrystal templates, and then the palladium is etched away to leave behind nanocages approximately 20 nanometers in diameter, with between three and six atom-thin layers of platinum. use of these nanocage structures in fuel cell electrodes could increase the utilization efficiency of the platinum by a factor of as much as seven, potentially changing the economic viability of the fuel cells. ""we can get the catalytic activity we need by using only a small fraction of the platinum that had been required before,"" said younan xia, a professor in the wallace h. coulter department of biomedical engineering at georgia tech and emory university. xia also holds joint faculty appointments in the school of chemistry and biochemistry and the school of chemical and biomolecular engineering at georgia tech. ""we have made hollow nanocages of platinum with walls as thin as a few atomic layers because we don't want to waste any material in the bulk that does not contribute to the catalytic activity."" the research - which also involved researchers at the university of wisconsin-madison, oak ridge national laboratory, arizona state university and xiamen university in china - was reported in the july 24 issue of the journal 
 science . platinum is in high demand as a catalyst for a wide range of industrial and consumer applications. the high cost of platinum needed for the catalysts deposited on electrodes has limited the ability to use low-temperature fuel cells in automobiles and home applications. in catalytic applications, only the surface layers of platinum contribute to the chemical reaction, leading researchers to develop new structures designed to maximize the amount of platinum exposed to reactants. the hollowing out process reduces the amount of the precious metal not contributing to the reaction, and allows the use of larger nanocrystals that are less susceptible to sintering, an aggregation phenomenon which reduces catalyst surface area. ""we can control the process so well that we have layer-by-layer deposition, creating one layer, two layers or three layers of platinum,"" said xia, who is also a georgia research alliance eminent scholar. ""we can also control the arrangement of atoms on the surface so their catalytic activity can be engineered to fit different types of reactions."" hollow platinum structures have been made before, but not with walls this thin, he added. earlier work produced shells with wall thicknesses of approximately five nanometers. the new process can produce shell walls less than one nanometer thick. with both the inner layer and outer layer of the porous nanocages contributing to the catalytic activity, the new structures can use up to two-thirds of the platinum atoms in an ultra-thin three-layer shell. some palladium remains mixed with the platinum in the structures. ""this approach creates the highest possible surface area from a given amount of platinum,"" said xia. the nanocages can be made in either cubic or octahedral shapes, depending on the palladium nanocrystals used as templates. the shape controls the surface structure, thus engineering the catalytic activity. the goal of this research was to reduce the cost of the cathodes in fuel cells designed to power automobiles and homes. the fuel cell's oxygen-reduction reaction takes place at the cathode, and that requires a substantial amount of platinum. by reducing the amount of platinum by up to a factor of seven, the hollow shells could make automotive and home fuel cells more economically feasible. the researchers measured the durability of the platinum nanocages for oxygen-reduction reaction, and found the catalytic activity dropped by a little more than one-third after 10,000 operating cycles. earlier efforts to maximize surface area relied on making very small platinum nanoparticles just two or three nanometers in diameter. particles of that size tended to clump together in a process known as sintering, reducing the surface area. ""by using hollow structures, we can use much larger particle sizes - about 20 nanometers - and we really don't lose any surface area because we can use both the inside and outside of the structure, and the shells are only a few atomic layers thick,"" xia added. ""we expect the durability of these larger particles to be much better."" other applications, such as catalytic converters in automobiles, also use substantial amounts of platinum. the new hollow shells are unlikely to be used in automobile catalytic converters because they operate at a temperature beyond what the structures can tolerate. however, the platinum nanocages could find use in other industrial processes such as hydrogenation. contributing to the experimental work done at georgia tech, researchers at arizona state university and oak ridge national laboratory used their specialized microscopy facilities to map the nanocage structures. researchers at the university of wisconsin-madison modeled the system to help understand etching of palladium from the core while preserving the platinum shell. researchers have explored alternatives to platinum, but none of the alternatives so far has provided the equivalent amount of catalytic activity in such a small mass, xia noted. ""if you took all of the platinum that we have available today and made a cube, it would only be seven meters on each side,"" he added. ""that's all the platinum we have now, so we need to find the most efficient way to use it."" other authors in the paper include professor manos mavrikakis and researchers luke roling and jeffrey herron from the university of wisconsin-madison, miaofang chi from oak ridge national laboratory, professor jingyue liu from arizona state university, professor zhaoxiong xie from xiamen university, and lei zhang, xue wang, sang-il choi, madeleine vara and jinho park, from georgia tech. citation : lei zhang, et al., ""platinum-based nanocages with subnanometer-thick walls and well-defined, controllable facets,"" (science, 2015). research news georgia institute of technology 177 north avenue atlanta, georgia 30332-0181 usa media relations : john toon ( jtoon@gatech.edu ) (404-894-6986) writer : john toon

 - atlanta, ga 
 by treating living cells like tiny absorbent sponges, researchers have developed a potentially new way to introduce molecules and therapeutic genes into human cells. 
 the technique first compresses cells in a microfluidic device by rapidly flowing them through a series of tiny ""speed bumps"" built into the micro-channels, which compresses out small amounts of fluid - known as cytosol - from inside the cells. the cells then naturally recover and refill themselves, sucking up surrounding fluid and pulling in macromolecules or genes mixed into it. though the abrupt collisions can reduce cell volume by as much as 30 percent, the cells rapidly rebound and less than five percent of cells experience viability loss. 
 the new technique is known as cell volume exchange for convective transfer, or cell vect. it is believed to be the first compression process to prompt highly transient cell volume exchange by utilizing the ability of cells to lose and rapidly recover their cytosol. the research, which was supported by the national science foundation, national institutes of health and wallace h. coulter foundation, was reported online april 17 by the journal 
 materials today . 
 ""we are taking advantage of an intrinsic mechanical property of cells,"" said anna liu, a ph.d. candidate in the laboratory of associate professor 
 todd sulchek 
 in georgia tech's 
 woodruff school of mechanical engineering . ""when cells are compressed suddenly over a period of microseconds, they lose some of their volume. the cells are exchanging volume with the fluid around them, and that's what allows them to convectively take up macromolecules from their environment."" 
 the technique could be useful for cell transfection, in which a target gene is introduced into human cells to cause behavior that the cells wouldn't ordinarily exhibit, such as expression of a protein. there are a number of existing techniques for introducing genetic material into living cells, including the use of specially-designed viruses, but existing techniques have significant disadvantages. 
 a broad range of therapeutic and diagnostic applications could benefit from introduction of large molecules, which could also be used as markers for quality control purposes in cell manufacturing. ""there are a lot of reasons to want to deliver molecules to the interior of cells, but there are not a lot of good ways to do it,"" said liu, who is a national science foundation graduate research fellow. 
 the researchers discovered the compression and volume change phenomena while developing techniques for sorting cells according to their mechanical properties. in their microfluidic devices, compression forced softer cells to move in one direction, while stiffer cells took a different path. though the research focused on cancer detection, it also produced a new understanding of what happens to cells when they are compressed rapidly. 
 ""our technique doesn't depend at all on the properties of macromolecules to do the work,"" liu explained. ""the activity is all caused by the convective influx of fluid volume back into the cells. the molecules in the fluid are just along for the ride, which allows us to transfer molecules without regard to their size or properties."" 
 speed of compression is critical. if cells undergo compression over longer periods of time, they can deform gradually and maintain their volume. the entire cell vect compression and relaxation process takes milliseconds, causing the cells to deform suddenly without conserving volume. yet the process has little to no effect on cell viability. ""we have done a variety of tests to see if cell viability, function and gene expression are altered, and we haven't seen any significant differences,"" liu said. 
 the researchers have studied a wide range of human cell types, from prostate cancer to leukemia cells, and even primary t cells. they began with delivering a polysaccharide, dextran, and followed up with proteins, rna and plasmids. to explore the limits of the technique, they used cell vect to move 100-nanometer particles into cells. 
 beyond transferring therapeutic and diagnostic macromolecules that are now difficult to introduce into cells, the technique could allow larger macromolecules to be delivered to cells, opening new possibilities for cell engineering and therapies. 
 ""cell vect means we are no longer limited by the size of the cargo that a virus can carry,"" said 
 alexander alexeev , an associate professor in the woodruff school of mechanical engineering and a collaborator on the research. ""this may open a new way for researchers to engineer living cells using more complex molecules. cargo size would no longer be a critical issue."" 
 by introducing labeling molecules into cells, the cell vect technique could also provide a reliable and reproducible quality control technique for manufacturing processes that generate therapeutic cells, sulchek noted. 
 in future work, the researchers plan to develop a better understanding of how the technique works, study the parameters of the process - and observe cells over long periods of time to make sure there are no ill effects. 
 ""there is still a basic science understanding that we need to develop,"" sulchek said. ""we'd like to characterize what leaves the cells, and under what conditions they leave. we want to know how fast things return, what are the limitations of that return, and where they go in the cell when they do return.""

uncovering-hidden-protein-tail-puts-brakes-cell-signaling.txt,"uncovering a hidden protein ""tail"" that puts the brakes on cell signaling 
 researchers have found a ""braking"" mechanism in g protein signaling.

 - atlanta, ga 
 using an informatics tool that identifies ""hotspots"" of post-translational modification (ptm) activity on proteins, researchers have found a previously-unknown mechanism that puts the brakes on an important cell signaling process involving the g proteins found in most living organisms. 
 the mechanism, dubbed a ""tail,"" is part of a small protein known mostly for its role in attaching larger structures to the cell membrane. when researchers inactivated the tail, a signaling response that had previously taken 30 minutes to occur happened almost immediately - with an intensity four times greater than normal. 
 the research took place in yeast, but if a similar process occurs in human g proteins, the discovery could provide a new drug target for controlling important cellular processes - and potentially offer a new class of biosensors able to more sensitively detect and respond to certain chemical agents. the research, supported by the national institutes of health's 
 national institute of general medical sciences 
 (nigms), was reported may 1 in the journal 
 cell reports . 
 ""we have discovered the mechanism that regulates how quickly a pathway gets turned on by an external stimulus,"" said 
 matthew torres , an associate professor in the 
 school of biological sciences 
 at the georgia institute of technology. ""by genetically altering the control mechanism underlying this process, we are able to modulate how much of a signal from outside the cell gets inside the cell and how quickly it gets through. it's all the more astonishing because this mechanism has been hiding in plain sight for decades."" 
 g proteins, also known as guanine nucleotide-binding proteins, are a family of molecules that operate as molecular switches inside cells. they transmit signals acquired from a variety of extracellular stimuli to the interior of a cell - through the membrane, which otherwise wouldn't allow communication. 
 the tail found by torres and doctoral candidate shilpa choudhury likely escaped attention because it is flexibly attached to the g protein gamma subunit of a closely-collaborating protein team known as g beta / gamma. protein structures have generally been identified by x-ray crystallography techniques which cannot resolve structures that are in motion. 
 prior to their work, the g gamma subunit has been known primarily as the protein that connects the larger g beta subunit to the cell membrane. without the work of 
 saph-ire 
 - an informatics program that maps ptm activity using machine learning - the role of the tail structure might not have been identified. 
 ""for years, people had focused on g beta / gamma as a complete unit, and not as separate components,"" said choudhury, the paper's first author. ""the gamma is a tiny protein compared to the larger g beta subunit, but we now know that it has a major role in the activity of the signaling system."" 
 in yeast, g beta / gamma subunits activate a signaling pathway in response to pheromones, a process which normally takes about 30 minutes after stimulation of a pheromone receptor at the cell membrane. torres and choudhury suspected that protein modifications, ptms, were somehow causing the delay. their computer program saph-ire - developed in the torres lab and announced in 2015 - pointed the finger straight at the g gamma subunit. 
 the program analyzes existing meta-data repositories of protein sequence and ptm activity to reveal ""hotspots"" of protein alteration. saph-ire was designed to accelerate the search for important regulatory targets on protein structures and to provide a better understanding of how proteins communicate with one another inside cells. 
 pulling from worldwide ptm databases that use mass spectrometry to identify sequences that are chemically altered, saph-ire pointed to a specific location on the g gamma protein. using genetic mutation techniques, choudhury modified a section of the protein to render the tail structure inactive. 
 but removing the tail from the process by itself wasn't enough. to activate the signaling process, structures on the tail had to interact with a separate effector protein. when both were inactivated, the researchers saw a dramatic effect when the receptor was stimulated. 
 ""you can think of the signaling pathway like a wheel travelling down a hill where two pads of the bicycle brake are gripping the wheel to slow it down,"" said torres. ""activating the pheromone receptor is like releasing the wheel down the hill. when both brakes are active, the wheel moves very slowly because the two brakes are working together to slow its speed and momentum. this turns out to be how the pathway behaves in normal cells immediately after receptor stimulation."" 
 ""if you take away one of the brakes, you get partial braking and the wheel is allowed to move slightly faster, but is still restrained from moving as fast as it can. this is how the pathway behaves in normal cells within the first 20 minutes after receptor stimulation. but if you eliminate both brakes, releasing the wheel down the hill results in very high speed and momentum - kind of like a golf cart without a governor."" 
 this is exactly what happened when choudhury prevented ptms on both g gamma and the effector protein. ""when we do that, we see a rapid activation of the signaling pathway that occurs six times faster, and is four times more intense than with the normal condition with the pathway brakes intact."" 
 beyond identifying the control mechanism for the pathway, the researchers also learned how it controls the ability of yeast to respond to pheromones in a ""switch-like"" manner that is either on or off versus an analog manner that is analogous to a volume knob on a stereo. 
 while torres and choudhury made their discovery in yeast, they believe it will have broad implications because all organisms that have g proteins, including humans, have g gamma tails that are riddled with ptms. among the next steps will be to see if the same type of braking system is exhibited by g gamma subunits and g beta / gamma effectors in human cells. if so, that could provide insights that could identify potentially new drug targets. 
 ""the tail exists, and it's important in this process of controlling interactions with g beta / gamma effectors, which are essential for turning on signaling pathways,"" torres said. ""we suspect the importance of g gamma as a regulator g protein signaling will extend beyond any single organism.""

undergrads-help-save-money-and-reduce-georgia-techs-carbon-dioxide-emissions.txt,"undergrads help save money and reduce georgia tech's carbon dioxide emissions 
 roof-retrofitting plan to reduce a building's energy demand was a course project 
 jun 29, 2016 
 - atlanta, ga 
 many years from now, when five current undergraduate students revisit georgia tech as alumni, they can point to a building on campus and say, ""i helped make that building more environmentally friendly."" 
 these students devised a way to reduce the building's carbon footprint while meeting a requirement for an undergraduate course. their project, developed over the course of one semester, has received funding from georgia tech and will be implemented. 
 carbon dioxide emissions are altering many aspects of the global climate system, posing a variety of risks to society, says 
 kim cobb , a professor in the 
 school of earth and atmospheric sciences 
 (eas). however, slowing the rate of global co 2 
 emissions has proven difficult. according to recent 
 data from the environmental protection agency , the u.s. alone emitted 5.6 billion metric tons of the gas in 2014, about 9 percent more than in 1990. the recent 
 paris agreement  - which sets out a plan to limit global warming by controlling greenhouse gas emissions - was signed by 197 countries but ratified by only 18. 
 according to cobb, relatively modest changes in energy demand add up to significant co 2 
 emissions reductions in the long term. in the undergraduate course 
 eas 3110 , entitled ""energy, the environment, and society,"" she challenges students to develop projects during the semester that will reduce real-world carbon footprints. 
 in the past seven years, winning projects from the course's ""carbon reduction challenge"" have resulted in aggregate reductions of about 2,100 metric tons of co 2 , according to cobb. ""that's roughly equivalent to the annual carbon footprints of 100 americans,"" she says. 
 cobb requires that proposed 
 projects offset or avoid at least 20,000 lbs , or about 9 metric tons, of co 2 
 emissions. projects proving the largest co 2 
 reductions are selected as winners of the challenge. 
 this year's winning group consisted of ruchi aggarwal, kyle j. hamilton, janet l. ploussard, max b. rosenbaum, and marissa n. snyder.  their project, called ""rays the roof,"" involved retrofitting the roof of the o. lamar allen sustainable education building (seb) with a white, reflective material, which reduces the amount of heat the building absorbs. 
 at a cost of $49,000 to implement, rays the roof would reduce the building's co 2 
 emissions by approximately 453 metric tons over the next 20 years, according to the team. the project will also extend the lifetime of seb's roof by 10 years and yield savings of $59,000 on the cost of electricity over 20 years, the team calculated. 
 if the project is successful, similar retrofits may be implemented on other campus buildings, says mark l. demyanek, assistant vice president for operations and maintenance at georgia tech's facilities management. 
 developing a plan to satisfy the requirements took much more time and effort than the group anticipated. the team needed precise calculations on potential energy and money savings, primary sources to support their claims, and exact wording in their final proposal. group members working on separate portions of the project collaborated throughout the entire semester. 
 ""i didn't realize how much time it takes to meet with contractors, georgia tech facilities employees, product sales representatives, and all others who were a part of making this project happen,"" says snyder, the third-year biology major who initially proposed the white-roof idea. 
 rays the roof received funding through georgia tech's revolving green fund, which is administered by facilities management. according to demyanek, the fund is devoted to executing energy conservation and sustainability projects developed and vetted by facilities management, including projects proposed by cobb's students over the past two years. 
 demyanek says the fund was established in 2012 to support projects and construction practices that advance georgia tech's vision for a greener future. to that end, seb was fitted with multiple energy-monitoring devices upon its completion in 1997. the abundance of data from these monitors made seb the perfect candidate for the rays the roof project. 
 federico del risco, a facilities management mechanical engineer, assisted the students throughout, ensuring that proper research was completed, calculations were correct, and key language was included in their final proposal.  "" the rays team came to us with a really good idea,"" he says. ""after we reviewed their numbers and technical feasibility, it was just a matter of providing the proper guidance for them to shape the project into a suitable format for requesting funds."" 
 along with the distinction of having their project funded, each year's winner of the carbon challenge goes to washington, d.c., to discuss their projects with staffers who work for georgia's congressional representatives. 
 ""some of the people we met with were very intrigued by our project because they never realized that something as simple as a white roof could save so much energy in the long run,"" says aggarwal, a first-year mechanical engineering major. ""with the growing emphasis on green initiatives in washington, and the ease with which our project could be implemented, our idea excited several staffers,"" she adds. 
 ""the congressional staffers enjoyed hearing about the winning team's project,"" says robert knotts, georgia tech's director of federal relations. ""more importantly, the students learned a lot about how science and engineering can influence policy."" 
 that is precisely cobb's goal in rewarding the winning groups with trips to congress. ""the students have shown how much can be achieved through thoughtful individual and collective action, but that is no substitute for meaningful climate policy,"" cobb says. ""i hope my students recognize that and feel inspired to identify solutions to our carbon problem, wherever their careers take them.""

unique-bacterial-chemist-war-potatoes.txt,"unique bacterial chemist in the war on potatoes 
 a bacterial warrior the only one of its kind? this enzyme is ""wacko"" in the ways it breaks down a poison related to tnt. 
 a bacterial warrior the only one of its kind? this enzyme is ""wacko"" in many ways in its breakdown of a poison related to tnt. on top of that, 5naa-a is known so far only to exist in a single living organism on earth. could it be the lone master of a rare bacterial enzymatic kung fu, in the war on potatoes? or does a genomic clue point to its existence in one other solitary case? 
 oct 03, 2016 
 - atlanta, ga 
 in fertile farm soils where potatoes grow, 
 streptomyces scabies 
 bacteria wage war using chemicals related to explosives and pesticides. 
 but a microbial spoiler defuses one of 
 s. scabies ' poisons. researchers at the georgia institute of technology have gained new insights into a one-of-a-kind mechanism it employs, which could someday contribute to the development of new agents to degrade tough pollutants and help rescue crops. 
 when 
 s. scabies 
 infects potatoes, it spews poisons called thaxtomins, which riddle potatoes with familiar dark scabs. perhaps a trifle to the potato connoisseur excising them with a paring knife, on a global scale, the blemishes add up to a slash in agricultural production. 
 unprecedented moves 
 scientists investigating potato soil found that bacteria of the species 
 bradyrhizobium sp. js329 
 run interference. though their tough enzymes don't break down thaxtomins, they do render innocuous another 
 s. scabies 
 toxic secretion called 
 5-nitroanthranilic acid 
 (5-naa). 
 still, understanding how it is broken down could prove useful to agriculture. ""the 5naa molecule is similar enough to thaxtomin that studying its degradation might inspire future work to engineer an enzyme or bacterium, or even the plant itself, to detoxify thaxtomin,"" lieberman said. 
 one enzyme in particular uses seemingly unprecedented and spectacular chemical tricks to tear apart 5-naa's otherwise ironclad chemical structure. 
 researchers uncovered them and published the results in the 
 journal nature chemical biology on monday, october 3, 2016 . the research was funded by the national science foundation, pew charitable trusts, georgia internship for teachers, and the u.s. department of energy. 
 chemical warfare 
 s. scabies 
 bacteria are masters of chemical warfare, and not just against potatoes. 
 ""this family of bacteria is known for the ability to synthesize lots of different molecules, including ones that humans use as antibiotics,"" said senior researcher 
 raquel lieberman, an associate professor 
 at georgia tech's 
 school of chemistry and biochemistry . 
 ""they're good at killing other organisms,"" she said. though the thaxtomins they secrete are well-known for marring potatoes, little is known about toxin 5naa. 
 enzymatic kung fu 
 5naa has met its match in bacterium bradyrhizobium sp. js329, which we'll call ""brady"" for short. 
 ""brady"" produces enzymes that can combat 5naa, the first of which is called 5naa-a. the added ""a"" after the dash stands for ""aminohydrolase,"" a term that means it uses water to alter part of toxin 5naa. 
 the ""substitution reaction"" that enzyme 5naa-a carries out is common in organic synthesis, but extremely rare in living things. ""there's only one other known enzyme confirmed to utilize this particular chemical mechanism,"" lieberman said. 
 lieberman's team, which specializes in making protein crystals of enzymes like 5naa-a, observed the moment of the ensuing reaction.  ""we were able to capture the critical step (hydrolysis) in the crystal for this paper,"" she said. 
 ""it does this wacko chemical reaction,"" lieberman said. 5naa-a helps destroy toxin 5naa in two ways that are like outlandish kung fu moves. 
 breaking the wrong arm 
 toxin 5naa enters the ""brady"" bacterium with a deadly weapon. a nitro group, or no2, is part of its structure, which makes 5naa a nitroaromatic compound. 
 ""basically, all these nitroaromatics are either explosive or toxic,"" lieberman said. "" tnt 
 is not that different from this compound."" 
 plenty of bacteria have evolved enzymes to tackle synthetic nitroaromatics -- pollutants like dyes, pesticides or explosives that have been dumped in our environment. the enzymes tend to use the same strategy. ""the nitro groups are typically the first target of any degrading enzyme, because they are so toxic,"" lieberman said. 
 not so for enzyme 5naa-a. 
 it goes after another group on the toxic molecule, the amine, which is innocuous. it's like a kung fu master breaking the arm opposite of the one with the weapon. but it works. 
 by hydrolyzing the amine, enzyme 5naa-a sets up toxin 5naa for destruction by other enzymes.  ""the fact that it does it without removing the nitro is the weird part. it's an unexpected move,"" lieberman said. 
 kryptonite suicide 
 then there's the weirdness around metal. 
 5naa-a is a metalloprotease, an enzyme that needs a metal ion to do its work.  but unlike other metalloproteases, it doesn't have one embedded in it.  it can operate with one of four different metals, but 5naa-a can't seem to find the metal on its own. 
 ""it relies on 5naa to bring it to the party,"" lieberman said. 
 in other words, poison 5naa seems to tow a metal ion up to enzyme 5naa-a, which then takes it away and uses it to destroy the poison. it's like superman handing off kryptonite to an arch enemy. 
 ""at least that's very much what we think is happening,"" lieberman said.  ""we're going to investigate the details further."" 
 solitary master 
 the sum of 5naa-a's weird ways led lieberman's team to check an enormous genome database for matches of the gene sequence that can produce an enzyme like 5naa-a.  they found only one single known other example on earth. 
 ""that enzyme gene sequence comes from sediment in yellowstone national park,"" lieberman said. it is not yet confirmed that bacteria housing it actually detoxify 5naa, though it's likely. 
 even if it does, enzyme 5naa-a remains uncommonly rare, given the myriad microbes on earth producing an even higher number of enzymes. ""the fact that there may just be one other is mind-boggling,"" lieberman said. 
 high school researchers 
 in another rarity, a high school science teacher is one of the authors on the research paper. 
 casey bethel , who was named 
 georgia teacher of the year for 2017 , helped the other researchers break through a barrier that was holding up progress. 
 ""we use so-called tags to identify the enzyme we're interested in when we go to harvest it. we suspected the tags were interfering in the crystallization process,"" bethel said. so, he cloned the proteins with removable tags, which significantly helped the project move forward. 
 bethel participates in georgia tech's 
 main k-12 outreach, ceismc , which, among other things, boosts stem education among underserved populations in georgia public schools. and for three years, ceismc has helped him improve his teaching skills. 
 bethel has also 
 brought high school students to work in lieberman's lab with him . he's thrilled that he -- and they -- could be a part of the study. ""fantastical! unimaginable! who'd think that a high school teacher would be published in a nature journal?"" bethel said. 
 since starting with georgia tech's outreach, bethel has seen at least 60 of his former students choose stem studies and careers. ""whereas before, the number was close to zero,"" he said. ""it's indescribable. it's momentous, magnificent and impactful. i'll never be able to measure the impact.""

 robotic exoskeletons designed to help humans with walking or physically demanding work have been the stuff of sci-fi lore for decades. remember 
 ellen ripley in that power loader in 
 alien ? or the crazy mobile platform 
 george mcfly wore in 2015 in 
 back to the future, part ii 
 because he threw his back out? 
 researchers are working on real-life robotic assistance that could protect workers from painful injuries and help stroke patients regain their mobility. so far, they have required extensive calibration and context-specific tuning, which keeps them largely limited to research labs. 
 mechanical engineers at georgia tech may be on the verge of changing that, allowing exoskeleton technology to be deployed in homes, workplaces, and more. 
 a team of researchers in 
 aaron young's 
 lab have developed a universal approach to controlling robotic exoskeletons that requires no training, no calibration, and no adjustments to complicated algorithms. instead, users can don the ""exo"" and go. 
 their system uses a kind of artificial intelligence called deep learning to autonomously adjust how the exoskeleton provides assistance, and they've shown it works seamlessly to support walking, standing, and climbing stairs or ramps. 
 they described their ""unified control framework"" march 20 in 
 science robotics . 
 ""the goal was not just to provide control across different activities, but to create a single unified system. you don't have to press buttons to switch between modes or have some classifier algorithm that tries to predict that you're climbing stairs or walking,"" said young, associate professor in the 
 george w. woodruff school of mechanical engineering .

 immunotherapy can eradicate cancer or fall down trying, and this sensor monitors that success or failure.

 apr 02, 2019 
 - atlanta, ga 
 new immunotherapies can dramatically defeat cancer. but more often, cancer evades them, and doctors need to know quickly when that happens, so they can adjust treatment. an experimental urine test to detect immunotherapy effectiveness very early has received a major funding boost. 
 the national institutes of health has granted $1.8 million to a research project at the georgia institute of technology, where 
 the lab of gabe kwong 
 has already established a platform to detect complex disease and immune activity. kwong will use the new funding from the nih's national cancer institute to advance the platform to evaluate immunotherapy progress. 
 the platform uses an intravenous injection of ""activity sensors,"" nanoparticles that detect early enzyme activity of immune cells attacking cancer. the sensor confirms the attack with a fluorescent signal in the urine. 
 shifty resistance 
 cancer's defenses are crafty and can thwart treatment from the start or disrupt initially successful treatment later on, so progress must be continually monitored, which kwong's lab is engineering the particle to do. early resistance to therapy looks very different from later resistance. 
 ""we need to be able to classify different forms of resistance, so we can combat them better,"" said kwong, an  assistant professor in the wallace h. coulter department of biomedical engineering at georgia tech and emory university . 
 he plans to adapt the sensing technology to profile those subtleties. it is already engineered to have advantages over other tests that have recently entered the market, which look for signals that come later, such as dead cancer cells shedding their dna into the bloodstream. 
 ""these tests can be quite effective, but some issues limit them, particularly in early detection: you have five liters of blood. whatever the cells shed gets diluted significantly in your bloodstream,"" kwong said. 
 that makes these signals harder to detect in blood tests. 
 enriched signals 
 ""our sensors' signals get concentrated in the urine, so, not only are they not diluted in the blood, but we usually see a hundred- to thousandfold signal enrichment."" 
 kwong's lab has already developed the sensors, which are biocompatible nanoparticles, refined them as a reliable platform, and engineered variations that experimentally sense blood clots, liver fibrosis, 
 organ transplant rejection , and cancer. kwong has 
 published multiple papers 
 on activity sensor urine test successes. 
 kwong's endgame ambitions: ""in five to ten years, we want to expand the platform to detect most all major complex diseases and progress in treating them."" 
 q & a 
 what is the activity sensor and how does the urine test work? 
 the sensors are nanoscale balls with bristles made of short amino acid strands that have fluorescent ""reporter"" molecules attached to their tips. the sensors tend to accumulate in compromised tissue like cancer. 
 when immunotherapy -- which can be engineered t cells or the body's own t cells aided by medication -- attack cancer cells, the t cells secrete an enzyme called granzyme that severs 
 target amino acid strands 
 in the cancer cells, triggering their death. the activity sensor's bristles mimic those strands, so granzymes cut the bristles at the same time. 
 ""that releases the reporter molecules, which are so small that they easily make it through the kidney's filtration and go into the urine,"" said kwong who directs the laboratory for synthetic immunity in the coulter department. 
 then the urine turns a fluorescent color that can be analyzed to determine the intensity of the immunotherapy's attack on cancer. 
 [thinking about grad school?  here's how to apply to georgia tech. ] 
 is there a need for this kind of test? 
 ""many patients, especially those with solid tumors, are not responding to this treatment,"" kwong said. ""the non-responders need to be detected very quickly."" 
 there are also diagnostic pitfalls the experimental sensor is devised to overcome: for example, a current measure of treatment success is tumor shrinkage, but when t cells initially cram into a tumor, it can swell. that sometimes leads doctors to believe that a therapy that is actually very effective is not working, and they may discontinue it. 
 ""this test does not measure size; it measures activity,"" kwong. ""if those swelling tumors are very high in granzyme activity, that's a great sign, and we will be able to pick that up."" 
 how is the dream of detecting most known complex diseases even feasible? 
 quite conveniently, the human genome produces ""only"" 550 proteases, a particular type of enzyme relevant to detecting and combating disease. kwong believes researchers can adapt this platform to detect any of them and that there's a need for that. 
 ""granzymes are also activated by other things like an infection, so detecting granzyme alone risks getting interference when you're looking at cancer treatment effectiveness. we're developing a panel of sensors that gives us the specificity of t cell activity in tumors over the possible activity of t cells fighting, say, a cold,"" kwong said. 
 ""we want to build 550 different protease-detecting probes, and depending on what disease you have, they would expose a profile of the proteases in varying ratios."" 
 the probes could be combined into a cocktail to detect budding cancer, immunotherapy effectiveness or infections, and machine learning would analyze their respective fingerprints in the urine signals.

us-carbon-and-pollution-emissions-policies-are-air.txt,"u.s. carbon and pollution emissions policies are ‘up in the air' 
 this easy-to-read companion piece to a new ozone modeling study explains legal snags energy-clean air policies currently face. 
 the coal-fired jeffrey energy center near emmett township, kansas. credit: wikicommons cc bounzie66 
 oct 29, 2019 
 - atlanta, ga 
 if endangered air quality energy regulations and incentives fall flat, carbon gas emissions are predicted to accelerate. additional pollutants from coal power plants would synergize with global warming to hamper the thus far successful fight against harmful ozone, according to 
 a new study . then ground-level o 3 , which damages the human respiratory system, may eventually resurge. 
 energy policy expert marilyn brown explained to 
 research horizons 
 online the current peril facing many emissions-related policies face. this is a companion article 
 to one written about the study . 
 brown is a 
 regents professor and brook byers professor 
 of sustainable systems in the georgia institute of technology's school of public policy. she  co-authored the new ozone study 
 with researchers in the school of civil and environmental engineering that modeled what stripping away the policies could do to future ozone levels. 
 research horizons: 
 before we get to emissions and energy regulations, there is a perhaps larger, very serious issue: what is happening to the generous tax incentives for people and companies who contribute to cleaner air and lower carbon emissions? 
 marilyn brown: 
 some incentives are being retired early like production and investment tax credits, which have been very influential in the spread of solar and wind power. a major one, the investment tax credit gives a 30% tax reduction for investments in solar or wind farms or the purchase of solar rooftop panels by homeowners. the production tax credit for utilities reduces tax liabilities by 23 cents for each kilowatt-hour of electricity generated by solar, wind or other renewable energy sources. these measures have been absolutely transformational in the u.s. power industry. 
 rh: 
 where did these incentives come from, and how long have they been in place? 
 brown: 
 they started spreading at the state level probably about 30 years ago. iowa was the first state with its significant wind resources. with the energy policy act of 1992, the incentives became national policy. tax credits have been an on-and-off policy but mostly on, and they have really helped remake the energy landscape. but the incentives have to be renewed periodically, and then they go up for debate in congress. 
 rh: 
 has this been a partisan issue? one party came up with the incentives, and the other has tried to knock them down? 
 brown: 
 that's not what we've seen. these were not partisan agendas in particular in their implementation. for example, the last extension of the production tax credits two years ago benefitted the economics of 
 plant vogtle 's two new units, because nuclear power now qualifies as an eligible resource. these incentives have been on a planned gradual retirement trajectory. 
 in our new study, we just removed them entirely, along with other key policies under threat to see the effect on ozone levels with them completely gone. such removal actions are occasionally debated in congress, so it's not unrealistic to see them suddenly disappear. the paper quantifies the resulting ozone penalty, and that is a first. our results show that we would have less success fighting ozone, and eventually it would resurge, which would be bad for the health of many people. costs would rise sharply for places in ozone non-attainment to try to meet healthy targets, and many of them would fail, as many do today. 
 [ready for graduate school?  here's how to apply to georgia tech. ] 
 rh: 
 but there was recently a more political back-and-forth over a plan by the previous administration, correct? 
 brown: 
 the last administration created the clean power plan (cpp), and it was stayed - not approved - by federal courts in 2016, so it was not implemented. the current administration basically replaced it with the affordable clean energy (ace) plan. cpp would have phased out coal-fired electricity generation in favor of natural gas and sustainable energy solutions. ace, on the other hand, emphasizes improvement in the efficiency of coal plants, but there is a strong a consensus that coal plants can't be made much more efficient. 
 rh: 
 foundational clean air regulations, the iconic corporate average fuel economy, or cafe, standards - first enacted in 1975 - are also under threat. 
 brown: 
 the cafe standards are very much up in the air right now. they could be frozen or done away with, but the automobile industry appears to be divided on this. seventeen auto makers - ford and honda among them - came out in support of cafe's progressive tightening of fuel standards because they said doing away with them could destabilize their industry. cafe lays down a trajectory of improvement that car makers are already anticipating in their product engineering. but cafe is also being litigated. also, california has the right to have its own emissions standards, which have a strong influence on fuel economy for all cars sold in the u.s., and that's being challenged, too. 
 rh: 
 why the concentration on ozone in the study as opposed to, say, particulates? 
 brown: 
 the clean air act regulates many pollutants, but it seems that ozone is the one we are having the most trouble with. thirty percent of americans live with levels exceeding public health targets. progress has been quite slow because ozone's precursors come from coal plants, and those precursors are what have to be regulated. there are no new coal plants under construction or plans to build any, but many coal plants are still active, and they can boost capacity a lot. for example, you could get about 250% more coal being used in the great lakes region by 2050. that would come from existing coal plants being dispatched much more. 
 rh: 
 it sounds like many things could converge at once. 
 brown: 
 if they did, it could make for a perfect ozone storm. but keep in mind that there are other forces at work like the market and technology as well as consumer choices and other innovations that could help keep the fight against ozone going - actually against many pollutants and greenhouse gases.

 united states military agencies often look to the georgia institute of technology to recruit highly skilled workers, drawing from the institute's expertise in fields such as aerospace engineering and cybersecurity. today, with modern warfare increasingly fought via satellite control networks, a new branch of the u.s. military has taken notice of georgia tech. 
 on nov. 11, georgia tech and the u.s. space force launched a strategic partnership to develop a high-caliber aerospace workforce and collaborate on advanced aerospace research. as part of a comprehensive agreement, the two parties signed a memorandum of understanding, making georgia tech the newest member of the u.s. space force's university partnership program. 
 lt. general nina m. armagno, u.s. space force director of staff, joined georgia tech provost steven w. mclaughlin and executive vice president for research chaouki t. abdallah to sign the agreement. the signing ceremony, which fell on veterans day, took place on georgia tech's campus. 
 ""at the heart of the space force's university partnership program is the need to advance our science and technology to build the next generation of space capabilities, while developing the workforce of the future,"" armagno said. ""with its reputation as a leader in cutting-edge aerospace research, we are confident that georgia tech will be an outstanding partner."" 
 the 
 u.s. space force 
 - the sixth and newest branch of the u.s. armed forces - established the university partnership program to identify, develop, and retain a diverse, stem-capable workforce to further its mission to protect u.s. and allied interests in space. through the partnership, the space force will seek to recruit new members and also create educational and leadership development programs for existing space force employees. georgia tech was selected for its outstanding aerospace engineering research, its expertise in national defense and security, the diversity of its students, and its robust rotc program. 
 ""georgia tech is proud of its longstanding collaborations with nasa and the department of defense to help achieve strategic national objectives,"" abdallah said. ""we look forward to charting bold new areas of research with the space force and leveraging our expertise in aerospace engineering and national security to address today's most complex space-based military challenges"" 
 georgia tech joins 11 universities selected for the u.s. space force university partnership program in fiscal year 2021. they include howard university, massachusetts institute of technology, north carolina agricultural and technical state university, purdue university, university of colorado boulder, university of colorado colorado springs, university of north dakota, university of southern california, university of texas at austin, and university of texas at el paso. 
 the institutions were selected based on four criteria: the quality of stem degree offerings and space-related research laboratories and initiatives; rotc program strength; diversity of student population; and degrees and programming designed to support military, veterans, and their families in pursuing higher education. 
 the signing ceremony was the culmination of a daylong campus visit for lt. general armagno and the space force delegation. in the morning, she met with air force rotc students and gave a public talk at the 
 sam nunn school of international affairs 
 about the space force's integration into the u.s. military. in the afternoon, she held a discussion with aerospace engineering students, toured the 
 space systems design lab , and received an overview of the 
 georgia space grant consortium 
 and 
 aerospace engineering outreach . 
 ""georgia tech is honored to be selected as a space force university partnership school, and we look forward to collaborating in educating leaders for the aerospace workforce of the future,"" mclaughlin said. ""i am confident that we will continue to drive technological advancements for the u.s. space force, just as we have done for nasa and the department of defense."" 
 as a next step, georgia tech and the space force will outline specific implementation milestones to meet the program's objectives. this initial work will include establishing educational programs such as scholarships, internships, and mentorship opportunities, and identifying specific research areas of mutual benefit to the space force and georgia tech.

 fullscalenano, an early-stage company that automates nanomaterial imaging and measurement and a venturelab portfolio startup, received the techconnect innovation award at the techconnect world innovation conference & expo may 22-25 in washington, d.c. nanomet's technology was developed at georgia tech by chin-hui lee, co-founder and a professor in georgia tech's school of electrical and computer engineering. the company also joined venturelab, the incubator at georgia tech for startups created by faculty, students, and staff. venturelab works with those startups to help them commercialize research into viable companies. ""we created the algorithms that allow us to process thousands of images, faster and with better overall reliability,"" lee said. ""this is a new frontier in science that we hope will lead to faster and more cost-effective innovation for industry."" the company is headquartered in tallahassee, florida, but its software development team hub is in atlanta. the techconnect innovation awards identify the top 15 percent of submitted technologies. innovation rankings are based on the potential positive impact of the technology on a specific industry sector. submissions come from global academic technology transfer offices, early-stage companies, small business innovative research awardees, and government and corporate research laboratories. fullscalenano won for its nanomet automated nanomaterials software that measures and characterizes thousands of nanomaterials in seconds. ""we are honored to receive this award that recognizes our innovative approach to measuring and characterizing nanomaterials, essential particles that are used in today's product innovations, from medicine to manufacturing,"" said jeffrey whalen, ceo and co-founder. nanomaterials are tiny particles that can't be seen with the naked eye. the only way they can be viewed is by taking pictures with an electron microscope that contains a built-in camera. measuring and characterizing these images is a slow, manual process - done one by one using a ruler - that takes hours, whalen said. nanomet speeds up the task, using an automated system that processes images in seconds, takes thousands of measurements, and provides objective quality assurance, enabling a shorter time to market. nanomet ""sees"" every individual pixel in an electron microscope image to properly identify the exact edges of nanomaterials, providing a repeatable process that saves time and money. nanomaterials are used or being evaluated in a variety of products from batteries to shampoos and in a number of industries from food and medicine to electronics and the environment. in medicine alone , applications being developed for nanoparticles include delivery of chemotherapy drugs directly to cancer tumors, resetting the immune system to prevent autoimmune diseases, and delivering drugs to damaged regions of arteries to fight cardiovascular disease. other industry uses include producing hydrogen from water, reducing the cost of producing fuel cells and solar cells, and cleaning up oil spills, water pollution, and air pollution.

 liquid cooling system lets microchips perform more operations per second, but at cooler temperatures than current commercial options.

 in the online world of computer gaming, overclocking is a common practice by which hyper-competitive gamers look to push as much processing power as possible for the slightest advantage and edge to win and enjoy the games they play. 
 running these gaming systems' graphics or central processing units at rates faster than they were designed for allows for higher performance, including rendering at higher frames per second with higher resolutions and texture details. but it also creates a lot more heat and that requires more cooling and care of those key microlectronic components. 
 but daniel lorenzini has developed a liquid cooling system - on a micro scale - that allows for the microchips to be overclocked, or perform more operations per second, but at cooler temperatures than commercial thermal control hardware. 
 lorenzini developed and refined the technology in the lab of yogendra joshi at the georgia institute of technology's george w. woodruff school of mechanical engineering. 
 under conventional liquid cooling methods, microchips are cooled by passing coolant liquids through a block over the chips' casings, which include a metal lid called an integrated heat spreader (ihs) and a thermal interface material (tim), which is a gel-like substance. those components lead to heat resistance and therefore limit the system performance due to thermal throttling. 
 but the liquid cooling system designed by lorenzini, who is slated to receive his doctorate in mechanical engineering from tech on may 3, 2019, allows for microchips to be cooled directly. 
 ""i've been looking at more direct or microfluidic cooling to the chips and by doing this, we are able to remove more heat,"" he said. 
 ""it's much more efficient and allows us to remove up to five times the power than that of conventional technologies,"" lorenzini added, ""because you can increase the voltage to the processors so it's faster and stable, while running at a higher frequencies."" 
 with the help of venturelab, the georgia tech program that works with institute faculty and students to commercialize their research, lorenzini is forming emcool, as the company being organized around the technology will be called. 
 the breakthrough could be a significant one for the gaming industry, the first sector lorenzini identified as being ready-made for his micro cooling system. 
 but it has potential for other industries, said jonathan goldman, a venturelab principal, whoevaluates tech-derived intellectual property and research for viability as commercialized and fundable technology startups. 
 ""what he's done is a disruptive improvement to the challenge of cooling these chips,"" goldman said, adding the technology has use in other high-performance computing applications such as data science, media, healthcare, manufacturing, and retail. 
 through venturelab and his work with goldman, lorenzini was able to secure a $50,000 grant from the national science foundation innovation corps (i-corps) in 2018 and the emcool team participated in a six-week customer discovery boot camp to further define customer segments. 
 that was followed by another $50,000 grant - with venturelab's assistance - from the georgia research alliance for prototype development. 
 and in the first quarter of 2019, lorenzini raised $100,000 in an angel round from investors in his native mexico. those funds will be received once emcool is formally incorporated, which is expected in june. 
 the mexican government awarded lorenzini with its entrepreneurial ingenuity award in 2018 for his work as co-founder of cooling tree systems, one of the first companies in latin america to commercialize liquid cooling systems when such approaches began to replace air cooling solutions in the market. 
 emcool, which already has a provisional patent on the technology lorenzini developed at georgia tech, expects to formally incorporate in may. 
 ""we're guiding them through this process and getting them getting them ready to incorporate and assemble and sell their first systems,"" goldman said. ""we expect to have those commercially available by this fall.""

virtual-top-hats-allow-swarming-robots-fly-tight-formation.txt,"virtual top hats allow swarming robots to fly in tight formation 
 autonomous flying robots created to learn more about human interaction and obey rules of the sky. 
 autonomous blimps are controlled by a 3d-printed gondola frame that carries sensors and a mini camera. it attaches to either an 18- or 36-inch diameter balloon. \ 
 may 15, 2017 
 - atlanta, ga 
 georgia institute of technology researchers have created a team of free-flying robots that obeys the two rules of the air: don't collide or undercut each other. they've also built autonomous blimps that recognize hand gestures and detect faces. 
 both projects will be presented at the 
 2017 ieee international conference on robotics and automation (icra) 
 may 29 - june 3 in singapore. 
 in the first, five swarm quadcopters zip back and forth in formation, then change their behaviors based on user commands. the trick is to maneuver without smacking into each other or flying underneath another machine. if a robot cuts into the airstream of a higher flying quadcopter, the lower machine must quickly recover from the turbulent air or risk falling out of the sky. 
 ""ground robots have had built-in safety ‘bubbles' around them for a long time to avoid crashing,"" said magnus egerstedt, the georgia tech 
 school of electrical and computer engineering 
 professor who oversees the project. ""our quadcopters must also include a cylindrical ‘do not touch' area to avoid messing up the airflow for each other. they're basically wearing virtual top hats."" 
 as long as the georgia tech machines avoid flying in the two-foot space below their neighbor, they can swarm freely without a problem. that typically means they dart around each other rather than going low. 
 ph.d. student li wang figured out the size of the ""top hat"" one afternoon by hovering one copter in the air and sending others back and forth underneath it. any closer than 0.6 of a meter (or five times the diameter from one rotor to another) and the machines were blasted to the ground. then he created algorithms to allow them to change formation midflight. 
 ""we figured out the smallest amount of modifications a quadcopter must make to its planned path to achieve the new formation,"" said wang. ""mathematically, that's what a programmer wants - the smallest deviations from an original flight plan."" 
 the project is part of egerstedt and wang's 
 overall research , which focuses on easily controlling and interacting with large teams of robots. 
 ""our skies will become more congested with autonomous machines, whether they're used for deliveries, agriculture or search and rescue,"" said egerstedt, who directs georgia tech's institute for robotics and intelligent machines. ""it's not possible for one person to control dozens or hundreds of robots at a time. that's why we need machines to figure it out themselves."" 
 the researchers overseeing the second project, the blimps, 3d-printed a gondola frame that carries sensors and a mini camera. it attaches to either an 18- or 36-inch diameter balloon. the smaller blimp can carry a five-gram payload; the larger one supports 20 grams. 
 the autonomous blimps detect faces and hands, allowing people to direct the flyers with movements. all the while, the machine gathers information about its human operator, identifying everything from hesitant glares to eager smiles. the goal is to better understand how people interact with flying robots. 
 ""roboticists and psychologists have learned many things about how humans relate to robots on the ground, but we haven't created techniques to study how we react to flying machines,"" said fumin zhang, the georgia tech associate professor leading the blimp project. ""flying a regular drone close to people presents a host of issues. but people are much more likely to approach and interact with a slow-moving blimp that looks like a toy."" 
 the blimps' circular shape makes them harder to steer with manual controllers, but allows them to turn and quickly change direction. this is unlike the more popular zeppelin-shaped blimps commonly used by other researchers. 
 zhang has filed a request with guinness world records for the smallest autonomous blimp. he sees a future where blimps can play a role in people's lives, but only if roboticists can determine what people want and how they'll react to a flying companion. 
 ""imagine a blimp greeting you at the front of the hardware store, ready to offer assistance,"" zhang said. ""people are good at reading people's faces and sensing if they need help or not. robots could do the same. and if you needed help, the blimp could ask, then lead you to the correct aisle, flying above the crowds and out of the way.""

 by michael pearson 
 hailey park, a third-year computer science student from roswell, knows how complicated voting can be. 
 ""there were a lot of moments when i felt overwhelmed by the sheer amount of information out there, and i didn't know if the information i was consuming was factual,"" she said. 
 now, park is part of the votertech vertically integrated project (vip), an interdisciplinary, cross-college, and student-led research team at the georgia institute of technology. it works to help make it easier for the diverse student body to register and vote. 
 it is getting the job done with all the hallmarks of a typical georgia tech project: in-depth research, good organization, and technology, according to 
 richard barke , a professor in the ivan allen college of liberal art's 
 school of public policy 
 and one of five instructors who mentor the vip team members. 
 ""the voting process is becoming technologically intense, as we're seeing in this current iteration, so it makes sense to see what we can do using technology to address some of the problems with elections and voting,"" barke said. 
 as georgia's oct. 5 registration deadline draws near, the team is developing technologies to help voters find information about registration, ballot information, and early and absentee voting. 
 ""this project takes place during an important election,"" said 
 votertech 
 member caleb torres, a third-year public policy student from atlanta. torres also is chief of staff for georgia tech's undergraduate student government association. ""younger voters, including college students, are turning out in record numbers to the polls, and we want to help ensure every voter is as knowledgeable as possible."" 
 the team of 18 students has split into four groups, each working on a specific issue: one team concentrates on collecting ballot information. the second is working on voter registration efforts. another team has built a website, 
 https: / / vote.cae.gatech.edu , and the fourth is working on a smartphone app. 
 the website offers a simple step-by-step approach to registering to vote or voting, with vetted links to registration sites and information about requesting absentee ballots or finding polling places, in georgia and across the united states. 
 it also provides links to election protection information and what to do if a voter had to cast a provisional ballot. 
 veteran vip organizer 
 jennifer leavey , principal academic professional in the college of sciences, organized votertech last year. leavey is not an expert in politics but wanted to help spark excitement in voting among georgia tech students. 
 ""it took a while for the students to tease out what they wanted to work on, but now they are really taking off,"" leavey said. 
 in addition to leavey and barke, the faculty and staff team includes 
 christopher le dantec , an associate professor in the school of interactive computing and the ivan allen college's school of literature, media, and communication; recha reid, a political scientist and interim assistant director for student innovation and undergraduate research in the office of undergraduate education; and nicole leonard, advising and outreach manager in the georgia tech honors program. 
 ""the work that these students have done demystifies the voting process for students,"" leonard said. 
 reid noted the students' work is already serving as a ""critical hub"" for their peers. 
 ""our vip students have surpassed all expectations with their hard work and creativity to expand the tools we have to inform voters and increase voter turnout among georgia tech students,"" reid said. 
 the november election is far from the end for votertech. le dantec expects the experience with this cycle will give the team a clear idea of the challenges students face in engaging in elections. this data will help inform what the group decides to do going forward. 
 ""this election season will give us a lot more runway to think more expansively about different kinds of technology solutions we might develop to help in future elections,"" said le dantec, an expert in 
 digital civics . 
 william wilson, a second-year computer science student from memphis, tenn., is a member of the vip's registration team. he always wanted to do more to encourage students to vote and found his outlet in votertech. 
 ""the reaction by students has been overwhelming,"" he said. ""students seem really excited to vote, and we hope our project can add to that."" 
 in addition to the website, the team also is sharing information on 
 facebook 
 and 
 instagram . 
 about vips 
 students participating in 
 vertically integrated projects 
 work in multidisciplinary teams on projects that span multiple semesters, receiving academic credit and invaluable experience as they apply their academic skills to real-world projects. 
 the concept was founded in 2001 at purdue university by 
 edward j. coyle , who has been on faculty in georgia tech's school of electrical and computer engineering since 2008. 
 vips have since been adopted at 36 universities worldwide. georgia tech, a leader in the vip consortium, has one of the world's most extensive programs.

want-beat-antibiotic-resistant-superbugs-rethink-strep-throat-remedies.txt,"want to beat antibiotic-resistant superbugs? rethink strep throat remedies 
 it's time to develop alternate drugs against small infections as a strategy to slow the antibiotic resistance crisis, georgia tech evolutionary bacteriologists say. 
 group a streptococci, colored yellow, are the most common culprits in bacterial upper respiratory infections. credit: national institute of allergy and infectious diseases of the nih

 got a sore throat? the doctor may write a quick prescription for penicillin or amoxicillin, and with the stroke of a pen, help diminish public health and your own future health by encouraging bacteria to evolve resistance to antibiotics. 
 it's time to develop alternatives to antibiotics for small infections, according to a  new thought paper by scientists at the georgia institute of technology , and to do so quickly. 
 it has been  widely reported that bacteria will evolve to render antibiotics mostly ineffective  against them by mid-century, and current strategies to make up for the projected shortfalls haven't worked. 
 one possible problem is that drug development strategies have focused on replacing antibiotics in extreme infections, such as sepsis, where every minute without an effective drug increases the risk of death. 
 but the evolutionary process that brings forth antibiotic resistance doesn't happen nearly as often in those big infections as it does in the multitude of small ones like sinusitis, tonsillitis, bronchitis, and bladder infections, the georgia tech researchers said. 
 ""antibiotic prescriptions against those smaller ailments account for about 90 percent of antibiotic use, and so are likely to be the major driver of resistance evolution,"" said  sam brown, an associate professor in georgia tech's school of biological sciences . bacteria that survive these many small battles against antibiotics grow in strength and numbers to become formidable armies in big infections, like those that strike after surgery. 
 ""it might make more sense to give antibiotics less often and preserve their effectiveness for when they're really needed. and develop alternate treatments for the small infections,"" brown said. 
 brown, who specializes in the evolution of microbes and in  bacterial virulence , and first author kristofer wollein waldetoft, a medical doctor and postdoctoral research assistant in brown's lab, published an  essay detailing their suggestion for refocusing the development of bacteria-fighting drugs on december 28, 2017, in the journal  plos biology . 
 duplicitous antibiotics 
 the evolution of antibiotic resistance can be downright two-faced. 
 ""if you or your kid go to the doctor with an upper respiratory infection, you often get amoxicillin, which is a relatively broad-spectrum antibiotic,"" brown said. ""so, it kills not only strep but also a lot of other bacteria, including in places like the digestive tract, and that has quite broad impacts."" 
 e. coli  is widespread in the human gut, and some strains secrete enzymes that thwart antibiotics, while other strains don't. a broad-spectrum antibiotic can kill off more of the vulnerable, less dangerous bacteria, leaving the more dangerous and robust bacteria to propagate. 
 ""you take an antibiotic to go after that thing in your throat, and you end up with gut bacteria that are super-resistant,"" brown said. ""then later, if you have to have surgery, you have a problem. or you give that resistant  e. coli  to an elderly relative."" 
 much too often, superbugs have made their way into hospitals in someone's intestines, where they had evolved high resistance through years of occasional treatment with antibiotics for small infections. then those bacteria have infected patients with weak immune systems. 
 furious infections have ensued, essentially invulnerable to antibiotics, followed by sepsis and death. 
 alternatives get an ""f"" 
 drug developers facing dwindling antibiotic effectiveness against evolved bacteria have looked for multiple alternate treatments. the focus has often been to find some new class of drug that works as well as or better than antibiotics, but so far, nothing has, brown said. 
 wollein waldetoft came across a  research paper in the medical journal  lancet infectious diseases  that examined study after study on such alternate treatments against big, deadly infections. 
 ""it was a kind of scorecard, and it was almost uniformly negative,"" brown said. ""these alternate therapies, such as  phage  or  anti-virulence drugs  or,  bacteriocins  -- you name it -- just didn't rise to the same bar of efficacy that existing antibiotics did."" 
 ""it was a type of doom and gloom paper that said once the antibiotics are gone, we're in trouble,"" brown said. ""drug companies still are investing in alternate drug research, because it has gotten very, very hard to develop new effective antibiotics. we don't have a lot of other options."" 
 but the focus on new treatments for extreme infections has bothered the researchers because the main arena where the vast portion of resistance evolution occurs is in small infections. ""we felt like there was a disconnect going on here,"" brown said. 
 don't kill strep, beat it 
 the researchers proposed a different approach: ""take the easier tasks, like sore throats, off of antibiotics and reserve antibiotics for these really serious conditions."" 
 developing non-antibiotic therapies for strep throat, bladder infections, and bronchitis could prove easier, thus encouraging pharmaceutical investment and research. 
 for example, one particular kind of strep bacteria, group a  streptococci , is responsible for the vast majority of bacterial upper respiratory infections. people often carry it without it breaking out. 
 strep bacteria secrete compounds that promote inflammation and bacterial spread. if an anti-virulence drug could fight the secretions, the drug could knock back the strep into being present but not sickening. 
 brown cautioned that strep infection can lead to rheumatic heart disease, a deadly condition that is very rare in the industrialized world, but it still takes a toll in other parts of the world. ""a less powerful drug can be good enough if you don't have serious strep throat issues in your medical history,"" he said. 
 sometimes, all it takes is some push-back against  virulent bacteria  until the body's immune system can take care of it. developing a spray-on treatment with bacteriophages, viruses that attack bacteria, might possibly do the trick. 
 if doctors had enough alternatives to antibiotics for the multitude of small infections they treat, they could help preserve antibiotic effectiveness longer for the far less common but much more deadly infections, for which they're most needed.

 a new device under development could help first responders more accurately assess the effects of blood loss due to hemorrhage. 
 researchers have shown that they can accurately assess blood loss by measuring seismic vibrations in the chest cavity and by detecting changes in the timing of heartbeats. that could lead to development of a smart wearable device that could be carried by ambulance crews and medics and made available in emergency rooms and surgical facilities.

 emergency medical technicians (emts), military medics, and emergency room physicians could one day be better able to treat victims of vehicular accidents, gunshot wounds, and battlefield injuries thanks to a new device under development that may more accurately assess the effects of blood loss due to hemorrhage. 
 a research team has now shown that it can accurately assess blood loss by measuring seismic vibrations in the chest cavity and by detecting changes in the timing of heartbeats. the knowledge, developed in the laboratory, could potentially lead to development of a smart wearable device that could be carried by ambulance crews and medics and made available in emergency rooms and surgical facilities. 
 ""we envision a wearable device that could be placed on a person's chest to measure the signs that we found are indicative of worsening cardiovascular system performance in response to bleeding,"" said 
 omer inan , associate professor in the 
 school of electrical and computer engineering 
 at the georgia institute of technology. ""based on information from the device, different interventions such as fluid resuscitation could be performed to help a victim of trauma."" 
 the research, supported by the office of naval research, was reported july 22 in the journal 
 science advances . it included collaborators from the translational training and testing laboratories in atlanta, an affiliate of georgia tech, and the university of maryland. 
 blood loss can result from many different kinds of trauma, but the hemorrhage can sometimes be hidden from first responders and doctors. heart rates are normally elevated in people suffering from trauma, and blood pressure - now the most commonly used measure of hemorrhage - can remain stable until the blood loss reaches a life-threatening stage. 
 ""it's very difficult because the vital signs you can measure easily are the ones that the body tries very hard to regulate,"" inan said. ""yet you have to make decisions about how much fluid to give an injured person, how to treat them - and when there are multiple people injured - how to triage those with the most critical needs. we don't have a good medical indicator that we can measure noninvasively at an injury or battlefield scene to help make these decisions."" 
 using animal models, inan and graduate students jonathan zia and jacob kimball carefully studied seismic vibrations from the chest cavity and electrical signals from the heart as blood volume was gradually reduced. the researchers wanted to evaluate externally measurable indicators of cardiovascular system performance and compare them to information provided by catheters making direct measurements of blood volume and pressure. 
 the key indicator turned out to be a seismocardiogram, a measure of the micro-vibrations produced by heart contractions and the ejection of blood from the heart into the body's vascular system. but the researchers also saw changes in the timing of the heart's activity as blood volume decreased, providing another measure of a weakening cardiovascular system. 
 ""the most important lower-level feature we found to be important in blood volume status estimation were cardiac timing intervals: how long the heart spends in different phases of its operation,"" inan said. ""in the case of blood volume depletion, the interval is an important indicator that you could obtain using signals from a wearable device."" 
 in such a device, these noninvasive mechanical and electrical measures could be combined to show just how critical a patient's blood loss was. machine learning algorithms would use the measurements to generate a simple numerical score in which larger numbers indicate a more serious condition. 
 ""we would give an indicator that is representative of the overall status of the cardiovascular system and how close it is to collapse,"" inan said. ""if one patient is rated 50 and another is 90, first responders could give priority to the patient with the higher number."" 
 beyond emergency situations, the new assessment technique could be helpful with many types of surgery in which quickly identifying unseen blood loss could improve the outcome for patients. 
 in future work, inan and his collaborators expect to create a prototype device that could take the form of a patch just 10 millimeters square. additional electrical engineering will be needed to filter out the kinds of background noise likely to be found in real-world trauma situations, and for successful operation when the patient is being transported. 
 ""long-term, we want to partner with clinicians to do studies in humans where we would use the wearable patch and be able to take measurements when people were coming into the trauma bay, or even while emts were still deployed,"" inan said. ""this could become a new way of monitoring hemorrhage that could be used outside of clinical settings."" 
 the researchers also want to study the opposite problem - how to determine when enough fluid has been provided to an injured patient. too much fluid can cause edema, similar to the conditions of heart failure patients whose lungs fill with liquid.

website-rates-security-internet-connected-devices.txt,"website rates security of internet-connected devices 
 a new website can help consumers understand the security challenges of internet-connected devices.

 sep 04, 2019 
 - atlanta, ga 
 if you're in the market for an internet-connected garage door opener, doorbell, thermostat, security camera, yard irrigation system, slow cooker - or even a box of connected light bulbs - a new website can help you understand the security issues these shiny new devices might bring into your home. 
 consumer-grade internet of things (iot) devices aren't exactly known for having tight security practices. to save purchasers from finding that out the hard way, researchers from the georgia institute of technology and the university of north carolina at chapel hill have done security assessments of representative devices, awarding scores ranging from 28 (an f) up to 100. 
 their site, 
 https: / / yourthings.info , shows rankings for 45 devices, though a total of 74 have been evaluated. that's hardly a complete roundup of the tens of thousands of devices available, but the big idea behind the project is to help consumers understand important issues before connecting a new iot helper to their home networks. 
 ""a lot of people who purchase these devices don't fully understand the risks associated with installing them in their homes,"" said omar alrawi, a graduate research assistant at georgia tech. ""we want to provide insight by providing security ratings for the devices we have tested."" 
 voice-activated personal digital assistants are among the most common home iot devices, but if not properly installed, they can provide unwanted access to the home networks to which they are connected, warned 
 manos antonakakis , a cybersecurity researcher and associate professor in georgia tech's 
 school of electrical and computer engineering . 
 ""if you have an iot app that is vulnerable, whoever has access to that app not only has access to your personal information, but could also jump into your home and eavesdrop on your conversations,"" he said. ""anything that is connected in the home in proximity to the personal assistant could also interact with it. if there is vulnerable software running on the device, it could be exploited within the home network."" 
 one problem is that most home networks were set up for simple tasks like sharing printers, so they lack the kind of security controls found on enterprise systems at businesses, noted chaz lever, a research engineer in georgia tech's school of electrical and computer engineering. 
 ""the home network is beginning to look a lot like enterprise networks with a range of services that have to be protected,"" lever said. ""but the average consumer is not going to be equipped to do that. they don't have an it staff that is doing audits and securing the devices. if these devices are not secure out of the box and there aren't easy ways to secure them, they can open the home up to a new vector of attacks."" 
 to give consumers helpful advice, the researchers developed a framework for analyzing the devices' security components. in what is believed to be the first effort to objectively assess the risks of iot equipment, they examined the devices themselves, how the devices communicate with cloud servers, the applications running on the devices, and the cloud-based endpoints. 
 ""the more services running on the device, the higher the probability that some of them will be vulnerable to attack,"" antonakakis said. ""providing many services may be attractive from a marketing perspective, but if you have multiple services, the risk increases."" 
 in their study of iot devices, the researchers found wide variations in security depending on the manufacturer. in some cases, equipment made by small and lesser-known companies performed better than devices made by larger companies. 
 ""there are some devices that do security really well, and other manufacturers should learn from those exemplary devices,"" alrawi said. ""we saw the full spectrum of good and bad, and sometimes we were surprised at the results of our evaluation."" 
 because they are designed to be installed by consumers, these iot devices must be easy to use. but ease of use can be the enemy of security. an example is a service known as upnp, which makes devices known to the network during installation so communications can be established. 
 but a device announcing itself on the network can attract attackers, lever noted. ""it's helpful for the devices to communicate what they do, but that opens up vulnerabilities. the choice of protocols affects not only the device, but also the security of the network on which it is running."" 
 internet-connected light bulbs are unlikely to have a long service life, but that's not the case with expensive appliances like internet-connected refrigerators. antonakakis worries that these devices could become security risks without regular updates. 
 ""ideally, the consumer shouldn't have to be aware that their refrigerator needs updates that have to be downloaded to the device,"" he said. ""we want that to happen automatically and securely. why should anyone have to know how to patch their refrigerator?"" 
 while the notion of hacking a slow cooker might seem amusing, the devices have heating elements that could cause a fire if a malicious actor turned up the temperature. attacks can also affect more than a homeowner. in 2016, the mirai botnet took advantage of unsecured internet-connected cameras - many of them baby monitors - to create a massive distributed denial of service attack that left much of the internet unavailable. 
 beyond educating consumers, the researchers hope to encourage better security by device manufacturers by tracking security trends over time. 
 ""we hope to inspire both technical and policy next steps,"" said antonakakis. ""there is a need for establishing policy and standards. we want to raise the security level of all these devices. there is a lot more that could be done."" 
 in addition to those already mentioned, fabrian monrose from the university of north carolina at chapel hill was also a member of the research team.

what-delayed-earths-oxygenation.txt,"what delayed earth's oxygenation? 
 photosynthesizers using water, which releases oxygen, could not compete with those using iron. 
 jul 11, 2019 
 - atlanta, ga 
 powering a massive biosphere on earth, photosynthesis is the light-mediated reaction that converts carbon dioxide and water to carbohydrates and oxygen. about 2.3 billion years ago, this reaction led to a dramatic oxygenation of earth's atmosphere. 
 evidence exists for oxygen-releasing photosynthesis evolving much earlier - perhaps as early as 3 billion years ago. however, the oxygen-rich atmosphere we take for granted today has existed for only about 10% of earth's 4.5-billion-year history. why did oxygenation of the atmosphere occur so much later than the evolution of oxygen-releasing photosynthesis? 
 ""the striking lag has remained an enduring puzzle in the fields of earth history and planetary science,"" says christopher reinhard, an assistant professor in the school of earth and atmospheric sciences (eas). 
 reinhard, former eas postdoctoral researcher kazumi ozaki, and collaborators have proposed a solution to the puzzle. their findings, 
 published in 
 nature communications , suggest that in the oceans of early earth, oxygen-releasing photosynthesizers could not compete effectively with their primitive counterparts. 
 modern photosynthesizers consume water and release oxygen. primitive ones instead consume dissolved iron ions - which would have been abundant in the oceans of early earth. they produce rust as a byproduct instead of oxygen. 
 using experimental microbiology, genomics, and large-scale biogeochemical modeling, ""we found that photosynthetic bacteria that use iron instead of water are fierce competitors for light and nutrients,"" says ozaki, the paper's first author and now an assistant professor in the department of environmental science at toho university, in japan. ""we propose that their ability to outcompete oxygen-producing photosynthesizers is an important component of earth's global oxygen cycle."" 
 the study is part of reinhard's research goal to understand how the evolution of the photosynthetic biosphere controlled the composition of earth's atmosphere. ""we want to understand the timing of major biological innovations and their impact on the chemistry of earth's oceans and atmosphere. we consider these principles to be central in understanding our own evolutionary origins and the search for life beyond our solar system."" 
 ""our results contribute to a deeper knowledge of the biological factors controlling the long-term evolution of earth's atmosphere,"" ozaki says. ""they offer a better mechanistic understanding of the factors that promote oxygenation of the atmospheres of earth-like planets beyond our solar system."" the results ""yield an entirely new vantage from which to build theoretical models of earth's biogeochemical oxygen cycle,"" reinhard adds. 
 other authors of the study are katharine thompson, rachel simister, and sean crowe of the university of british columbia. 
 reinhard acknowledges support from the nasa astrobiology institute, the nasa postdoctoral program, the alfred p. sloan foundation, and the nasa nexus for exoplanet system science (nexss).

what-new-gt-packaging-ultra-thin-dry-film-polymer-materials-and-processes-high.txt,"what is new @ gt in packaging? ultra-thin dry film polymer materials and processes for high density 2.5d and fanout packages 
 georgia tech and its industry partners are developing the next generation of ultra-thin polymers to form 20-40µm pitch rdl for 2.5d and fan-out packages. 
 dec 01, 2016 
 - atlanta, ga 
 georgia tech and its industry partners are developing the next generation of ultra-thin polymers to form 20-40µm pitch rdl for 2.5d and fan-out packages. 
 advanced polymer materials are the key to high density packaging by enabling ultra-small vias and wiring layers to achieve 50 ohm impedance rdl wiring layers. 
 traditional polymer dielectrics are thicker films (>20µm) and thus are unsuitable to rdl wiring layers at fine pitch and at 50 ohm impedance. although liquid spin-on polymers such as polyimide and pbo have been used widely in wafer level packaging, such materials are difficult to apply as thin dry films on large panels. 
 in contrast to these materials, georgia tech and its industry partners have been developing ultra-thin (3-10µm) dry film polymer materials and associated rdl via and line formation processes. ultra-thin polymer dry films provide added benefits of better thickness control, improved planarization on underlying copper, large panel processing, and environmental friendliness. the georgia tech program involves a number of material partners in photo-sensitive from tok japan, dry film bcb from dow chemical, as well as non-photo dry film dielectrics from ajinomoto japan. the georgia tech programs that benefit from these polymer dielctrics include all digital applications using glass, advanced laminates and ceramic substrates. 
 the georgia tech team has demonstrated wafer and panel substrates with 2µm lines and spaces by advanced semi-additive processes (sap) using 7µm thin dry film photo resists and projection lithography tool provided by ushio japan. wafer and panel metallization was performed using a 300 mm panel plating line at georgia tech installed by atotech, germany. various approaches are being investigated to demonstrate ultra-small micro-vias below 10µm including solid state uv laser, using a cornerstone™ system installed at georgia tech by esi, excimer laser ablation supported by suss photonic systems, photo lithography processes with advanced dry films provided by tok japan, dow chemical and other partners. by combining these materials and processes, multi-layer structures with 10µm vias and 2.5µm lines and spaces were successfully demonstrated to fabricate a 2.5d logic-hbm emulator designed with guidance from ibm / globalfoundries, amd, intel and others (top figure). 
 to address the limitations of sap processes in pitch scaling,a novel via-in-trench (vit) and via-in-line (vil) embedded trench+via methods have been invented and demonstrated to achieve ultra-small liness and vias on large panels. advantages of the embedded approach are the elimination of seed etching processes and the formation of conductive wires with higher aspect ratios for better electrical conductivity. two different approaches are studied in the georgia tech program; excimer laser ablation by suss photonic systems with non-photo polymer dielectrics and photolithography with photo-polymers. after the trench and via formation, trench and via fill plating from atotech and a low-cost surface planarization process (tool installed at georgia tech by disco japan) to remove copper overburden were used to metallize the fine pitch rdl. using this approach, 2µm lines and spaces with embedded vias have been successfully demonstrated (bottom figure).this is one of the first demonstrations of silicon-like rdl that georgia tech team achieved using glass panels with potential for lower cost cu-polymer rdl materials and processes. 
 this research is being performed in partnership with a large global team of material and tool companies and with support from several on-site industry engineers at georgia tech. 
 this project is part of georgia tech industry consortium in system scaling which includes about 40 end-user and supply chain companies.

 - atlanta, ga 
 2022 has been a pivotal year for infrastructure and sustainability (i&s), the unit behind many of the campus improvement projects under construction on the georgia tech campus. i&s welcomed its first vice president, maria cimilluca, in january; integrated the office of capital planning and space management into the department of design and construction; and appointed gilbert delgado as the assistant vice president for the newly created department of planning, design, and construction. with this strengthened leadership and renewed vision, existing construction on campus forged ahead, new projects broke ground, and design work for future transformative projects continues. 
 complete or soon to wrap up 
 campus center 
 the john lewis student center and stamps commons opened the week of august 1. as part of the 
 campus center project , this final phase consisted of the renovation of the original part of the student center building, the addition of a brand new three-story building in place of the original stamps commons, and upgrades to the kessler campanile and its surrounding plaza. 
 the iconic campanile and surrounding plaza are being reconfigured to improve the accessibility around the site. its water feature will be updated to become more sustainable so that beloved campus traditions that occur in that space can safely continue. these improvements are on track for completion later this fall. 
 10 th 
 street electrical substation improvements - phase 2 
 improvements have increased the electrical resiliency of the plant by upgrading its four electrical substations to protect capacity required for campus cooling. this electrical substation powers the 10 th  street chiller plant that provides chilled water to the campus and currently operates 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. originally constructed in 1995, the plant has been expanded and currently houses seven chillers with a total capacity of more than 15,000 tons. 
 828 / 830 west peachtree demolition 
 the demolition of two buildings along west peachtree is complete, and the space is currently being used for campus parking. during the fall semester, the space will house food trucks and serve as additional parking for gameday visitors. 
 howey physics - lecture hall 5 renovation 
 following the successful renovation of the four large lecture halls in the building, lecture hall 5 is now complete. flexible seating was installed along with new windows to allow daylight into the revitalized space. 
 in progress 
 ramblin' wreck garage 
 constructed to house and display the institute's mechanical mascot, the nearly all-glass structure with showroom-quality lighting and rooftop solar array will foster community spirit in the heart of campus. the garage houses a tool bench, vehicle turntable, and lift for students to maintain the wreck. located near the campus center and the campanile plaza, the garage will showcase the ramblin' wreck and offer outdoor programmable space. the wreck will also be in a direct line of sight from the little theatre in the student center, where prospective student tours depart, reinforcing the connection between the students and georgia tech's rich traditions. 
 gilbert hillhouse boggs building electrical project 
 this resiliency project will replace the existing network transformers, panels, and switchgear that support the electrical distribution systems throughout the facility that houses laboratories and offices spaces for the college of sciences. the upgraded system will increase preparedness and the ability to respond to electrical disruptions. the expected completion date is may 2023. 
 coliseum annex renovation 
 adjacent to mccamish pavilion, the coliseum annex will undergo renovations to its student-athlete track and field and cross country locker rooms, coaches' locker rooms, the training room, and storage and support spaces. a lounge, nutrition space, and hydrotherapy space are also planned. the third-floor renovation will consist of two new smaller locker rooms for officials and visiting teams. project completion is slated for year-end 2022. 
 access control upgrade 
 in progress since 2015, the implementation of a single, campuswide physical access control service is planned for completion by the end of the year. the scope of work includes the replacement of existing access-control hardware systems for an estimated  4,000 entrances to academic buildings, research space, and athletic facilities. 
 community and chefs garden expansion 
 the community garden, located on the east side of the instruction center, will be upgraded to add accessible pathways and garden plots as well as increase the number of individual plots. the installation of cooking instruction tables and facilities will allow for chef demonstrations. more trees will be planted in the orchard area, and there will also be the installation of a new composting area, shed, and fencing. this project is scheduled to be complete in october. 
 just getting started 
 science square 
 twenty acres of mostly undeveloped land just off north avenue near northside drive will be 
 transformed into a new research community . science square will expand the biotech and life science research space and help revitalize and nurture new opportunities on atlanta's west side. a 13-story tower will feature labs, clean rooms, and research space as well as retail space and affordable housing. a $500,000 grant will kickstart job training so people in this community will be able to learn, work, and research here. science square is slated to open in 2024. 
 aerospace engineering aircraft hangar 
 the aircraft hangar facility is proposed to be in the north avenue research area (nara) adjacent to the techway building complex. this project will primarily focus on creating a facility to house small aircraft for the daniel guggenheim school of aerospace engineering research. the facility will be approximately 10,000 gross square feet and consist of two floors. design planning is underway. 
 d.m. smith building renewal 
 renovations will include several upgrades to the building's infrastructure, including strengthening compliance with the americans with disabilities act of 1990 by creating a permanent wheelchair access feature and adding an elevator. new mechanical, electrical, and plumbing systems will increase occupants' health and comfort, as well as the building's energy efficiency. a virtual lab and hoteling spaces will be created for members of the school of public policy. the outer structure will remain largely intact, and all proposed changes will respect the historical character of the building. renovations to the building are planned to begin in late 2023 and conclude in spring 2025. 
 georgia tech veterans walk of honor 
 located outside the veterans resource center, this tribute project will honor all georgia tech alumni, students, and staff who have answered the call to service in the united states armed forces. the walkway leading to the veterans resource center will feature granite inlays and mounted wall plaques recognizing the six branches of the armed forces. each inlay will include a portion of morse code representing the branch's slogan, encouraging discovery and reflection. adjacent elevated signage will display the core values of military service: honor, courage, commitment, respect, duty, valor, service, and integrity. an upper plaza reflection area will feature an american flag and overlook griffin track and mccamish pavilion, with the city skyline in the distance. 
 coming soon 
 student athlete performance center 
 the 115,000-square-foot facility will be built in the footprint of the current edge / rice center in the northeast corner of bobby dodd stadium. the center will house strength and conditioning, nutrition, sports medicine, ticket sales, and academic support. it will also include new expanded space for georgia tech football, featuring a dedicated football-only strength-and-conditioning area, players' lounge, and meeting spaces. the student-athlete performance center will also include premium seating for georgia tech football games and other events held inside bobby dodd stadium. the estimated completion date is early 2026. 
 east campus streetscape 
 renovation of sidewalks and roadways will improve pedestrian and cycle access, safety, and connectivity to the east side of campus and tech square. current sidewalks, curbing, and roadway paving will be improved. designs are underway with phased construction planned for next summer and full completion projected for fall 2024. 
 ferst drive realignment and cycle track 
 realignment of ferst drive at regents drive will allow the elimination of the traffic signal and enable connectivity to the planned bicycle infrastructure southwest of campus. a cycle track will be installed along ferst drive, providing improved safety and separation between cycles and buses at the bus stops. this project is also in the design phase, with construction planned for next summer.

whats-new-gt-packaging-innovative-emi-isolation-structures.txt,"what's new @ gt in packaging? innovative emi isolation structures 
 georgia tech and its industry partners have developed the most advanced package-level electromagnetic interference (emi) shielding structures for emerging highly-miniaturized system packages. 
 dec 15, 2016 
 - atlanta, ga 
 georgia tech and its industry partners have developed the most advanced package-level electromagnetic interference (emi) shielding structures for emerging highly-miniaturized system packages. 
 electromagnetic interference (emi) is defined as unwanted electrical or magnetic coupling between components in a module or system. such coupling or cross-talk results to performance degradation and electromagnetic compatibility issues. with increased multi-functional integration and miniaturization of emerging consumer, iot, and automotive electronics, component-level emi shielding has become extremely important to prevent undesired electromagnetic (em) coupling. 
 emi noise in traditional modules with large components is shielded by metallic cans or creating physical separation between them. shielding with conformal metal coatings on overmolded packages has also been demonstrated. component-level shielding has been developed with integrated via-based shields inside packages. 
 in contrast to the prior approaches described above, georgia tech team has recently pioneered innovative multi-layered structures for more effective emi shielding. in the near field region, magnetic fields, generated from sources such as power inductors and transformers, have lower wave impedance and hence are difficult to be shielded with blanket sheets of a few micron thickness. to address this challenge, unique thin magnetic-nonmagnetic multi-layered structures, which lead to high shielding effectiveness, are developed. the primary shielding mechanism for such thin multi-layered shields is the multiple reflections that occur at interfaces between magnetic and conductive thin layers because of impedance mismatch. furthermore, by employing copper as a conductive material, absorption loss also contributes to high shielding effectiveness. 
 the georgia tech team, in partnership with tango systems, has demonstrated this concept with ultra-thin (< 5 micron) multi-layered shield composed of copper (cu), titanium (ti), and nickel-iron (permalloy) for noise suppression of 100 khz to 100 mhz from dc-dc converters as an example. in this frequency range, such multi-layer shields placed between two magnetic coils show higher isolation or less near-field inductive coupling than traditional shielding materials such as copper or nickel films. multi-layered structures composed of ti, cu, and nife showed 59 db isolation, or more than 20 db shielding effectiveness, much greater than nife-cu shield or the nife-ti multi-layered structures. this approach is now extended for further improvement in shielding effectiveness performance by employing oxide layers such as alumina within the multi-layered structures. 
 in addition to those multi-layered shielding materials, georgia tech team has also been pioneering package-integrated copper via-trench structures for component-level shielding between sensitive rf components. such shields are now custom-designed for isolation between transmission lines, rf inductors, also rf power amplifiers. since undesired em coupling occurs both from above and below the substrates, innovative trench shielding structures with through-substrate vias or micro-vias are designed and demonstrated with 2-4 ghz shielding of above 65 db even with component separation of below 0.5 mm. georgia tech is now extending these trench-via array and multi-layered conductor structures to 5g and other mm-wave modules in the frequency range of 28 ghz to 39 ghz. 
 this research is being performed in partnership with a large global team of material and tool companies and with support from several on-site industry engineers at georgia tech. 
 this project is part of georgia tech industry consortium in system scaling which includes about 40 end-user and supply chain companies and rf module companies.

when-coeds-came-georgia-tech.txt,"when coeds came to georgia tech 
 historian amy bix explores the hurdles women have overcome - and still face - in engineering and stem education. 
 historian amy bix explores the hurdles women have overcome - and sitll face - in engineering and stem education. 
 mar 12, 2020 
 - atlanta, ga 
 by the time the first women enrolled at georgia tech in 1952, male students, professors, and administrators at other universities had been decrying the ""invasion"" of women into engineering departments for decades. 
 and, as historian amy bix outlined in a lively lecture march 2, gendered definitions and perceptions of engineering and other stem fields persist today, despite significant progress and measurable change. 
 ""when coeds came to georgia tech"" was part of the school of history and sociology's spring 2020 speakers series, social justice: power, inequity, and change. it was cosponsored by tech's chapter of the society of women engineers. 
 outsiders and oddities 
 since the late 1800s, bix noted, a significant part of the way men defined their identity as engineering students was to ""ridicule the whole idea of women engineers. so you get entire sets of technical traditions set in place over years that link engineering to masculinity."" 
 bix walked her audience through a brief chronology of the demarcation of professional engineering as a male sphere - from specialized education at universities that barred women; to exclusion from construction, railroad, and military jobs that provided engineering training; to advertisements for toys like erector sets and lionel trains aimed specifically at boys. 
 but, beginning in the early 20 th 
 century, a small number of women pursued engineering degrees, notably at the university of minnesota, iowa state university, and purdue - even though they were commonly viewed as outsiders and oddities. 
 a telling turning point 
 then, the manpower shortage caused by u.s. participation in world war ii created new opportunities for women in engineering, as it did in so many other sectors of the homefront economy. this historical juncture, bix explained, represented a larger cultural reexamination of assumptions about gender and about women's capacity for understanding engineering, machines, and other ""masculine"" realms. 
 within this context, allowing women to train in engineering on college campuses was treated as a necessary part of the larger war effort. some of them even wore pants! and hundreds of them earned engineering degrees. it was an unusual step, but both government and industry supported it as a patriotic plan. 
 it also proved short-lived. 
 after the war, the gi bill sent millions of returning (male) veterans flooding into american colleges and universities, while the number of enrolled women declined across the board. a backlash took shape in the form of a retrenchment of traditional values that emphasized women's inherent suitability for domestic - not professional, and certainly not technological or mechanical - pursuits. 
 ""debutantes looking for husbands"" 
 in the postwar period, georgia tech was part of what bix called ""a culture of masculine engineering."" 
 in 1948, atlanta women's organizations were raising money to support a test case to compel the board of regents to admit women to georgia tech - though many feared that tech's reputation and, indeed, its quality of instruction would become inferior if women were admitted. the year before, a poll of tech students showed 64% opposed it. in addition, 54% said they would find women in class ""distracting."" administrators claimed it would cost too much to renovate facilities to make room for women. many regents were ""hostile,"" as bix put it, chalking it up to ""debutantes looking for husbands."" 
 but by the early 1950s, blake van leer, georgia tech's president, was sympathetic to the arugment for coeducation, noting that the legal trend was heading in that direction. according to bix, he also reasoned that tech could admit women without too much disruption because so few of them were interested or qualified. 
 in 1952, the regents voted 7-5 in favor of coeducation. four women applied, and two of them, barbara diane michel and elizabeth herndon, began as full-time georgia tech students. while herndon later left school to marry, michel became the first woman to go through tech from start to finish, earning a b.s. in industrial engineering in 1956. she was joined that year by a transfer student, shirley clements, who graduated with a degree in electrical engineering. 
 ""is everything perfect now?"" bix asked. ""you know it's not. hostile workplaces, chilly climates, harassment, and discrimination. there is no magic solution to reverse the stem gender imbalance. but we can't ignore the historical shift that has taken place."" 
 about bix 
 bix is a professor of history at iowa state university whose research connects the history of technology, science, and medicine with studies of women and gender, the history of education, and 20 th -century social, cultural, and intellectual history. in 2013, she published 
 girls coming to tech! a history of american engineering education for women 
 (mit press). she is currently working on a book about the powerful cultural shift to diversifying stem education and, in particular, improving girls' stem education. 
 spring speakers series 
 topics in the series thus far have included healthcare, voter suppression, and stop and frisk, and were planned to coincide with black history month (february) and women's history month (march). the final two events this spring will address sex selection in a transnational context and debates over immigration. 
 ""since many of our faculty in the ivan allen college of liberal arts focus on research with important social justice implications, we wanted to make this our lens,"" said jennifer singh, associate professor in the school of history and sociology, and one of the series' organizers. 
 ""these broader topics also allow us to reach students and faculty beyond the liberal arts."" 
 singh sees the value of the interdisciplinary scope of the series for all tech students. even more important, she said, is ""the opportunity to learn beyond the classroom. these layers of exposure are essential to learning.""

 schedule of events

 school of history and sociology 's webpage. for more details about the first women to enroll and the early years of the coeducational transition at the institute, see the fall 1982 issue of the

when-coral-species-vanish-their-absence-can-imperil-surviving-corals.txt,"when coral species vanish, their absence can imperil surviving corals 
 off of fiji, a georgia tech study elucidates a potential silent coral reef killer: disappearing biodiversity appears to threaten the lives surviving corals. 
 tables with coral gardens painstakingly planted by georgia tech researcher cody clements. at bottom, the close up table shows pocillopora corals developing a pattern of death where one individual started dying and then others fell like dominos. this table was a ""monoculture."" it contained only one species and not a group of species. tables with groups of species did better than monoculture tables in the same reef area off of fiji in the pacific. credit: georgia tech / cory clements 
 jan 30, 2019 
 - atlanta, ga 
 waves of annihilation have beaten coral reefs down to a fraction of what they were 40 years ago, and what's left may be facing creeping death: the effective extinction of many coral species may be weakening reef systems thus siphoning life out of the corals that remain. 
 in the shallows off  fiji 's pacific shores, two marine researchers from the georgia institute of technology for  a new study  assembled groups of corals that were all of the same species, i.e. groups without species diversity. when cody clements snorkeled down for the first time to check on them, his eyes instantly told him what his data would later reveal. 
 ""one of the species had entire plots that got wiped out, and they were overgrown with algae,"" clements said. ""rows of corals had tissue that was brown - that was dead tissue. other tissue had turned white and was in the process of dying."" 
 36 ghastly plots 
 clements, a postdoctoral researcher and the study's first author, also assembled groups of corals with a mixture of species, i.e. biodiverse groups, for comparison. in total, there were 36 single-species plots, or monocultures. twelve additional plots contained polycultures that mixed three species. (more details below.) 
 by the end of the 16-month experiment, monocultures had faired obviously worse. and the study had shown via the measurably healthier growth in polycultures that science can begin to quantify biodiversity's contribution to coral survival as well as the effects of biodiversity's disappearance. 
 ""this was a starter experiment to see if we would get an initial result, and we did,"" said principal investigator mark hay, a  regents professor and harry and linda teasley chair in georgia tech's school of biological sciences . ""so much reef death over the years has reduced coral species variety and made reefs more homogenous, but science still doesn't understand enough about how coral biodiversity helps reefs survive. we want to know more."" 
 the results of the study appear  in the february issue of the journal  nature ecology & evolution  and were made available online in january. the research was funded by the national science foundation, by the national institutes of health's fogarty international center, and by the teasley endowment. 
 the study's insights could aid ecologists restocking crumbling reefs with corals -- which are animals. past replenishing efforts have often deployed patches of single species that have had trouble taking hold, and the researchers believe the study should encourage replanting using biodiverse patches. 
 [ready for graduate school?  here's how to apply to georgia tech. ] 
 40 years' decimation 
 the decimation of corals hay has witnessed in over four decades of undersea research underscores this study's importance. 
 ""it's shocking how quickly the caribbean reefs crashed. in the 1970s and early 1980s, reefs consisted of about 60 percent live coral cover,"" hay said. ""coral cover declined dramatically through the 1990s and has remained low. it's now at about 10 percent throughout the caribbean."" 
 ""you used to find living diverse reefs with structurally complex coral stands the size of city blocks. now, most caribbean reefs look more like parking lots with a few sparse corals scattered around."" 
 84 percent loss 
 the fact that the decimation in the pacific is less grim is bitter irony. about half of living coral cover disappeared there between the early 1980s and early 2000s with declines accelerating since. 
 ""from 1992 to 2010, the  great barrier reef , which is arguably the best-managed reef system on earth, lost 84 percent,"" clements said. ""all of this doesn't include the  latest bleaching events  reported so widely in the media, and they killed huge swaths of reef in the pacific."" 
 the  2016 bleaching  event also sacked reefs off of fiji where the researchers ran their experiment. the coral deaths have been associated with extended periods of  ocean heating , which have become much more common in recent decades. 
 10 times more species 
 still, there's hope. pacific reefs support ten times as many coral species as caribbean reefs, and clements' and hay's new study suggests that this higher biodiversity may help make these reefs more robust than the caribbean reefs. there, many species have joined the endangered list, or are ""functionally extinct,"" still present but in traces too small to have an ecological impact. 
 the caribbean's coral collapse may have been a warning shot on the dangers of species loss. some coral species protect others from getting eaten or infected, for example. 
 ""a handful of species may be critical for the survival of many others, and we don't yet know well enough which are most critical. if key species disappear, the consequences could be enormous,"" said hay, who believes he may have already witnessed this in the caribbean. ""the decline of key species may drive the decline of others and potentially create a death spiral."" 
 864 abrasive animals 
 off fiji's shores, clements transported by kayak, one by one, 48 concrete tables he had built on land. he dove them into place and mounted on top of them 864 jaggy corals in planters he had fashioned from the tops of plastic soda bottles. 
 ""i scratched a lot of skin off of my fingers screwing those corals onto the tables,"" he said, laughing at the memory. ""i drank enough saltwater through my snorkel doing it, too."" 
 clements laid out 18 corals on each tabletop: three groups of monocultures filled 36 tables (12 with species a, 12 with species b, 12 with species c). the remaining 12 tabletops held polycultures with balanced a-b-c mixtures. he collected data four months into the experiment and at 16 months. 
 the polycultures all looked great. only one monoculture species,  acropora   millepora , had nice growth at the 16-month mark, but that species is more susceptible to disease, bleaching, predators, and storms. it may have sprinted ahead in growth in the experiment, but long-term it would probably need the help of other species to cope with its own fragility. 
 ""corals and humans both may do well on their own in good times,"" hay said. ""but when disaster strikes, friends may become essential.""

 machine learning algorithms can sometimes do a better job with a little help from human expertise.

 aug 15, 2019 
 - atlanta, ga 
 machine learning algorithms can sometimes do a better job with a little help from human expertise, at least in the field of materials science. 
 in many specialized areas of science, engineering and medicine, researchers are turning to machine learning algorithms to analyze data sets that have grown much too large for humans to understand. in materials science, success with this effort could accelerate the design of next-generation advanced functional materials, where development now depends on old-fashioned trial-and-error. 
 by themselves, however, data analytics techniques borrowed from other research areas often fail to provide the insights needed to help materials scientists and engineers choose which of many variables to adjust - and can't account for dramatic changes such as the introduction of a new chemical compound into the process. in some complex materials such as ferroelectrics, as many as 10 different factors can affect the properties of the resulting product. 
 in a paper published this week in the journal 
 npj computational materials , researchers explain how to give the machines an edge at solving the challenge by intelligently organizing the data to be analyzed based on human knowledge of what factors are likely to be important and related. known as dimensional stacking, the technique shows that human experience still has a role to play in the age of machine intelligence. 
 the research was sponsored by the national science foundation and the defense threat reduction agency, as well as the swiss national science foundation. measurements were performed, in part, at the oak ridge national laboratory in oak ridge, tennessee. 
 ""when your machine accepts strings of data, it really does matter how you are putting those strings together,"" said 
 nazanin bassiri-gharb , the paper's corresponding author and a professor in the 
 george w. woodruff school of mechanical engineering 
 at the georgia institute of technology. ""we must be mindful that the organization of data before it goes to the algorithm makes a difference. if you don't plug the information in correctly, you will get a result that isn't necessarily correlated with the reality of the physics and chemistry that govern the materials."" 
 bassiri-gharb works on ferroelectrics, crystalline materials that exhibit spontaneous electrical polarizations switchable by an external electric field. widely used for their piezoelectric properties - which allow electrical inputs to generate mechanical outputs, and mechanical motion to generate electrical voltages - their chemical formulas are usually complicated, including lead, manganese, niobium, oxygen, titanium, indium, bismuth and other elements. 
 researchers, who have been working for decades to improve the materials, would like to develop advanced ferroelectrics that don't include lead. but trial-and-error design techniques haven't led to major breakthroughs, and she is not alone in wanting a more direct approach - one that could also more rapidly lead to improvements in other functional materials used in microelectronics, batteries, optoelectronic systems and other critical research fields. 
 ""for materials science, things get really complicated, especially with the functional materials,"" said bassiri-gharb. ""as materials scientists, it's very difficult to design the materials if we don't understand why a response is increased. we have learned that the functionalities are not compartmentalized. they are interrelated among many properties of the material."" 
 the technique described in the paper involves a preprocessing step in which the large data sets are organized according to physical or chemical properties that make sense to material scientists. 
 ""as a scientist or engineer, you have an idea whether or not there are physical or chemical correlations,"" she explained. ""you have to be cognizant of what kind of correlations could exist. the way you stack your data to be analyzed would have implications with respect to the physical or chemical correlations. if you do this correctly, you can get more information from any data analytics approach you might be using."" 
 to test the techniques, bassiri-gharb and collaborators lee griffin, iaroslav gaponenko, and shujun zhang tested samples of relaxor-ferroelectric materials used in advanced ultrasonic imaging equipment. griffin, a georgia tech graduate research assistant and the paper's co-first author, did the experimental measurements. zhang, a researcher at the university of wollongong in australia, provided samples for the study. bassiri-gharb and gaponenko, a research affiliate in her group, developed the approach. 
 using a conductive tip on an atomic force microscope, they examined the electromechanical response from a series of chemically related samples, generating as many as 2,500 time- and voltage-dependent measurements on a grid of points established on each sample. the process generated hundreds of thousands of data points and provided a good test for the stacking approach, known technically as concatenation. 
 ""instead of just looking at the chemical composition that provides the highest response, we looked at a range of compositions and tried to figure out the commonality,"" she said. ""we figured out that if we applied this data stacking with some thought process behind it, we could learn more about these interesting materials."" 
 among their findings: though the material is a single crystal, the functional response showed highly disordered behavior, reminiscent of a fully disordered material like glass. ""this glassy behavior really is unexpectedly persisting beyond a small percentage of the material compositions,"" said bassiri-gharb. ""it is persisting across all of the compositions that we have looked at."" 
 she hopes the technique will ultimately lead to information that will improve many materials and their functionalities. knowing which chemicals need to be included could allow the materials scientists to move to the next phase - working with chemists to put the right atoms in the right places. 
 ""the big goal for any materials' functionality is to find the guidelines that will provide the properties we want,"" she said. ""we want to find the straight path to the best compositions for the next generation of these materials."" 
 this research was supported by the national science foundation (nsf) through award dmr-1255379, by the defense threat reduction agency (dtra) though grant hdtra1-15-0035, by the center for the science and technology of advanced materials and interfaces (stami) at georgia tech, and division ii of the swiss national science foundation under project 200021_178782. the piezo-response measurements were in part performed at the center for nanophase materials sciences at oak ridge national laboratory, which is a u.s. department of energy office of science user facility. any opinions, findings, and conclusions or recommendations expressed in this material are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of the sponsoring organizations.

 a common myth today is that young people are all glued to the internet, but in fact, only 30 percent of the world's youth population between the ages of 15 and 24 years old have been active online for at least five years. in south korea, 99.6 percent of young people are active, the highest percentage in the world. the least? the asian island of timor leste with less than 1 percent.   those are among the many findings in a study from the sam nunn school of international affairs assistant professor michael best and the international telecommunication union (itu). the study is the first attempt to measure, by country, the world's ""digital natives."" the term is typically used to categorize young people born around the same time as when the personal computer was introduced and who have spent their lives connected with technology.  nearly 96 percent of american millennials are digital natives. that figure is behind japan (99.5 percent) and several european countries, including finland, denmark, and the netherlands. but the percentage best thinks is most important is the number of digital natives compared to a country's total population. ""that's because a country's future will be defined by today's young people and by technology,"" said best, who co-led the study and, jointly with itu, developed the model that calculated the worldwide figures. ""countries with a high proportion of young people who are already online are positioned to define and lead the digital age of tomorrow.""  the countries with the highest proportion of digital natives among their population are mostly rich nations, which have high levels of overall internet penetration. iceland is at the top of the list with 13.9 percent. the united states is sixth (13.1 percent). a big surprise is malaysia, a middle-income country with one of the highest proportions of digital natives (ranked fourth at 13.4 percent). malaysia has a strong history of investing in educational technology.   the countries with the smallest estimated proportion of digital natives are timor-leste, myanmar, and sierra leone. the bottom 10 consists entirely of african or asian nations, many of which are suffering from conflict and / or have very low internet availability. however, the report notes that internet usage has increased significantly in the developing world during the past five years. the itu believes the digital native population in these regions will more than double by 2017. overall, there are approximately 363 million digital natives out of a world population of nearly 7 billion (5.2 percent). ""youth are transforming our world through the power of information and communication technologies,"" said hamadoun touré, itu secretary-general. ""the 
 youth declaration 
 developed at itu's bynd2015 youth summit in costa rica and presented to the united nations general assembly last week by costa rican president laura chinchilla calls for more measurable targets to monitor the digital empowerment of young people at national, regional, and international levels. this first attempt to measure the number of digital natives around the world is a valuable first contribution to this effort."" the model was developed using data collected by the itu through surveys conducted around the globe. the study is part of the itus measuring the information society 2013 report, which was released on october 7. best is a faculty member in the sam nunn school of international affairs with a joint appointment in the college of computing. his research focuses on information and communication technologies for social, economic, and political development, primarily in low-income countries in africa and asia.

why-covid-conspiracy-theories-spread-understanding-human-behaviors-behind-pandemic.txt,"why covid conspiracy theories spread: understanding the human behaviors behind the pandemic 
 spotlight on covid-19 research in the school of history and sociology. 
 may 12, 2021 
 - atlanta, ga 
 we can't stop covid-19 from spreading without understanding the people who carry it. 
 why do so many people embrace covid-19 misinformation? does lack of health insurance discourage people from getting tested, even when testing is free? and what prevented doctors in italy from sharing what they learned about oxygen levels, even though it could help predict which covid patients were at the highest risk of dying? 
 four faculty members in the school of history and sociology (hsoc) at georgia tech are examining  these questions and more  to help craft effective policy responses to the pandemic. 
 ""this research by the school's faculty shows that the pandemic is not just a problem in biology and medicine. instead, curbing the pandemic requires scholars who understand human knowledge and human behavior, which are topics at the center of the social sciences and humanities,"" said eric schatzberg, chair of the school of history and sociology. 
 understanding covid conspiracies 
 hsoc associate professor  amit prasad  found something surprising when he examined covid-19 conspiracy theories: these theories are not automatically anti-science. often, purveyors of misinformation use the credibility of science and scientists to spread falsehoods. 
 for example, dr. judy mikovits's pseudo-documentary  plandemic  received millions of views despite its false claims-such as ""wearing a mask literally activates your own virus."" why did people believe such claims? 
 mikovits's falsehoods didn't matter to viewers because her use ""of ‘science' and so-called ‘scientific claims' in the video facilitated a sense of trust for the general public,"" wrote prasad. 
 prasad's research also examined how the conspiracy theory that bill gates had created the pandemic spread for different reasons in different communities. for instance, prasad argues that within the black community, the messaging reflected ""the long history of mistrust resulting from racial discrimination and exploitation."" in contrast, among many white people, the conspiracy was driven by messaging about protecting individual freedom and the republic. this analysis shows that ""histories of particular social groups may play a very significant role in the acceptance and spread of misinformation and conspiracies."" 
 prasad's approach differs from past studies that characterized conspiracy theories as anti-science. these studies called for clearer communication of scientific knowledge to combat misinformation. but prasad finds that better communication may not be the most effective solution. ""my research shows that broad characterizations of misinformation and conspiracies as anti-science does not help in properly understanding what is going on,"" he wrote. 
 as georgia and other states begin to transition from mass covid-19 vaccination efforts to a more targeted approach, understanding that vaccine skepticism is caused by social and political factors beyond anti-science beliefs can help create more effective messaging. 
 ""a ‘war' on misinformation and conspiracies, which is aimed at banishing them completely, may not work in our instantaneously and globally connected world,"" concluded prasad. ""instead, we need to carefully study misinformation and conspiracies and deal with them by addressing the social and health issues experienced by particular social groups."" 
 prasad's article,  ""anti-science misinformation and conspiracies: covid-19, post-truth, and science & technology studies (sts),""  is open access and appeared in  science, technology and society  in april 2021. 
 advocating for vulnerable families 
 how do social and economic factors - such as relying on public health insurance, living below the poverty line, or losing work during the covid-19 pandemic - disproportionately affect black children with autism spectrum disorder (asd) and their families? 
 hsoc associate professor  jennifer  singh will research this topic in summer 2021, with funding from a special opportunity for faculty development activities (soda) grant from the ivan allen college of liberal arts. her  survey and interviews  seek to map disruptions not only in children's learning, treatment, and well-being, but also in the well-being of their caregiver. according to singh's research objective, the goal is ""to understand how they have managed socially, emotionally, and economically during the covid-19 crisis."" 
 with this data, singh plans to identify how families are coping with covid-related barriers to their children's continued progress. she hopes to understand how caregivers use support networks to balance their dual roles as financial supporters and supervisors of their children's education. finally, singh hopes to identify unique opportunities and challenges presented by the new learning and social environments that emerged during the pandemic. 
 singh is also working with milan riddick, a fourth-year student in the college of engineering minoring in  health, medicine, and society . riddick's interdisciplinary president's undergraduate research award (pura) project will study ""mistrust of the covid-19 vaccine among black citizens of georgia."" 
 quantifying health and education inequalities 
 lower rates of health insurance coverage were associated with lower levels of covid-19 testing, according to a study of state-level data from march 2020 by hsoc assistant professor  allen hyde  and co-author angran li from zhejiang university in china. this relationship may have exacerbated the spread of the virus and the deaths associated with it. 
 ""further, lack of health insurance coverage may exacerbate racial and class inequality in covid-19 testing and subsequent hospitalizations and death,"" wrote hyde and li.  ""for example, a majority of covid-19-related deaths reported in louisiana are african americans, accounting for 70 percent of the deaths, while african americans only make up 30 percent of the state's population (doubek 2020). similar patterns have occurred in other cities."" 
 in 2018, about 8% of the u.s. population was uninsured. however, that number varied by state and jumped as high as 17.7% in texas. research from the kaiser family foundation shows that in the same year, ""one in five uninsured adults went without needed medical care due to costs."" this could mean that even if uninsured people show symptoms of covid-19, they may not get tested or seek treatment because of financial concerns. although the trump administration announced that covid-19 testing and treatment would be free, people may have been unaware or skeptical that they would not have to pay. 
 hyde and li's research,  ""a slow start on an urgent crisis: how lack of health insurance helps explain deficiencies in coronavirus testing in u.s. states,""  was published in  contexts , official publication of the american sociological association. it gives support to the long-running argument that universal health care can save lives. 
 hyde also worked with li and amanda maltbie, a ph.d. student at the university of alabama, to research the impact of covid-19 on education. the article, forthcoming in the book  social justice and education in the 21st century: research from south africa and the united states , examines how disasters reinforce existing structural inequalities and exacerbate them in the aftermath. 
 what makes knowledge move? 
 ""knowledge does not move transnationally by itself,"" wrote kranzberg professor emeritus  john krige  with co-author sabina leonelli, professor of philosophy and history of science at exeter university. for information to move efficiently around the world, they found, interested parties need to have access to ""technological infrastructure"" - such as the internet - and shared systems for data collection and sharing. 
 when those systems aren't in place, information doesn't move as fast as it should, as was the case when it took doctors in italy two months to get international recognition for their finding that low oxygen levels were a ""key cause and potential predictor"" in covid-19 deaths. but when global data-sharing systems are successful, they plug researchers into more extensive networks that hold them accountable, increase their visibility and clout in their home countries, and help amplify their expertise to others. 
 by understanding the challenges of transnational knowledge movement, krige and leonelli hope to help mitigate them. their paper documented the creation of covid-19 data-sharing systems at a historically significant moment, when they were still ""in the making,"" forming and adapting in real-time to the changing covid-19 situation. the first case study focused on the french debate to use a local, centralized contact tracing app versus the decentralized app created by apple and google. the second examined an international group called the research data alliance that successfully coordinated and shared covid information across borders where other groups failed. 
 in their work, krige and leonelli envision a better future, where doctors, scientists, researchers, government officials, policymakers, and experts in every field can ""engage in a collective effort, driven from the bottom-up, to ensure that everyone, including the most vulnerable victims of covid-19, benefits from the knowledge - and the vaccine - that can contain its spread."" 
 krige and leonelli's research  ""mobilizing the transnational history of knowledge flows. covid-19 and the politics of research at the borders""  is open access and appeared in the journal  history and technology  in march 2021.

 the next time you are outside on a cloudless night, look up at the stars. if they look brighter or seem clearer during these winter nights, it's not your imagination. winter is actually better than summer when it comes to sky gazing. 
 jim sowell is director of the georgia tech observatory. he says there are a few reasons why the cosmos are clearer these days and months. one has to do with how the stars are clustered this season. another is because of earth's atmosphere. the final reason has to do with your evening commute.

will-caitlin-clarks-star-power-raise-wnba-salaries.txt,"will caitlin clark's star power raise wnba salaries? 
 as caitlin clark becomes a household name, she elevates a question wnba players, fans, and advocates have asked for decades: why is there such a significant pay disparity between men's and women's basketball? 
 apr 25, 2024 
 the 2024 women's basketball ncaa tournament championship game boasted more viewers than the men's final for the first time in history. yet, ncaa star caitlin clark will earn an average of only $84,000 a year as the number one wnba draft pick this summer. in contrast, the number one pick in last year's nba draft, victor wembanyama, is earning about $13 million per year.   as clark becomes a household name, she elevates a question wnba players, fans, and advocates have asked for decades: why is there such a significant pay disparity between men's and women's basketball?  mary mcdonald, 
 a professor of sociology and homer c. rice chair of sports and society in the 
 school of history and sociology , explains how racism, sexism, cultural narratives, and under-investment all have helped perpetuate the long-standing wage gap between the nba and wnba. she also discusses how a confluence of changes, including clark's star power and a new bargaining agreement in 2025, may affect it.  wnba players earn less than 1% of their male counterparts  mcdonald begins with a statistic: while women across all occupations make roughly 84 cents on the dollar compared to men, black women make only 64 cents when compared to white men.   ""this racialized gendered devaluing of labor is important to highlight given the wnba's predominantly black playing force,"" mcdonald says. in sports, the wage gap is even more pronounced, she says, pointing to estimates from economist david berri that wnba players earn less than 1% of what nba players make.   ""there is much more at play than simple market economics,"" she says. ""a legacy of exclusion, a complicit sports media, and differing levels of investment by nba owners have disadvantaged the women's game and ability to earn a fair wage.""  anticipated changes in 2025  wnba players like wnba player's association president nneka ogwumike of the seattle storm have not only argued the need to build the basketball-related revenue pie but also to provide wnba players with a larger percentage of the resulting revenue, mcdonald explains. the nba founded the wnba in 1997 and still owns 42% of the league. however, nba players receive 50% of the nba basketball-related revenue while wnba players receive only an estimated 10% of the wnba pot.   but this may change in 2025 when the current wnba collective bargaining agreement expires and the players negotiate a new contract, mcdonald says. importantly, this is also when the wnba's current tv rights deal expires, she adds. based upon their long-standing advocacy, the players will likely continue to ask for what nba players receive in the form of 50% of the basketball-related revenues from both the teams and the league.   ""receiving 50% of total basketball revenue would greatly elevate player salaries. before scaling for rookie and veteran salary differences, this translates into an average of over $500,000 per player per year. and this is based on 2022 figures - the pot of money available in 2025 will likely be much larger, especially with a new tv deal on the horizon,"" mcdonald says. ""the open question is: will wnba owners realize the opportunity they have to grow the league and the game by investing in player salaries and improving travel and working conditions?""   caitlin clark, espn, and social media  although basketball experts have long known about clark, ""her national exposure during iowa's 2022-23 national championship runner-up season last year certainly elevated her status, cultural visibility, and marketability,"" mcdonald says.   clark's rise occurred at the same time as two other important factors: espn increasing coverage and promotion of the women's ncaa tournament and players' ability to use social media to bypass the legacy media gatekeepers and narrate their own ""fresh and appealing"" storylines, mcdonald says. both of these factors have generated greater interest in women's sports.   ""clark's celebrity has helped to generate new public interest in the pay of wnba players, as did the 2022 detainment of phoenix mercury player brittany griner in a russian prison for nearly ten months,"" mcdonald says. ""that story had people questioning why stars like griner have to play overseas in the offseason to earn greater salaries than they receive in the wnba.""  the takeaway  clark is entering the wnba in a period of league expansion and increased media attention. as revenues expand and wnba players continue their work to gain more leverage in the next round of collective bargaining, mcdonald anticipates compensation increases for wnba players in the coming years.   ""the new tv contract in 2025 - which will likely exceed $100 million compared to the existing $65 million deal - will provide greater exposure for the league and its players,"" mcdonald explains. ""this, in addition to public pressure generated by wnba players' advocacy - now including clark's advocacy - and social media activism, all bolster the push for what wnba players have desired and fought for since the league's inception: better marketing, more media exposure, higher salaries, and improved working conditions.""  mcdonald has 
 published extensively 
 on the intersection of sports and gender and is currently writing a book on the wnba tentatively titled 
 'we got next': the affective politics of the wnba.

 georgia tech women's basketball associate head coach latasha ""tasha"" butts, athletic trainer rachel matthews, and guard kierra fletcher sat down for virtual interviews to reflect on their historic 2020-21 season and what a partnership with omed director s 
 gtwbb guard kierra fletcher 
 apr 27, 2021 
 - atlanta, ga 
 the 
 georgia tech women's basketball 
 (gtwbb) team capped a sensational 2020-21 season by 
 making their 10th overall appearance 
 - and first since 2014 - in the national collegiate athletic association (ncaa) tournament, advancing all the way to the sweet 16. under the direction of head coach nell fortner, the yellow jackets' 12 conference wins were the most the program has had since the 2011-12 season. the team was largely led by graduating senior kierra fletcher ( # 41), who will return to the flats for the 2021-22 season after being 
 granted a fifth year of eligibility by the ncaa . 
 in addition to completing a historic season, the team also addressed social and racial inequities both on and off the court, via their 
 say her name 
 campaign and an initiative with 
 omed: educational services  director and tech alumnus sybrina atwaters called the 
 race and reel black consciousness series . 
 associate head coach latasha ""tasha"" butts, athletic trainer rachel matthews, and fletcher sat down for virtual interviews to reflect on the past year and what their partnership with atwaters meant for the team. 
 hill: tell us a little about yourself, your background, and how you became a part of the georgia tech women's basketball team. 
 fletcher: ""i'm originally from detroit, michigan and i've been playing basketball since i was about three years old. i was playing aau [amateur athletic union] basketball about four or five years ago, when one of tech's assistant coaches at the time reached out and told me the team was interested in me. i'm from the midwest, so i wasn't familiar with georgia tech at the time. but after i learned more about tech, i was pretty interested because it's right in the heart of atlanta and atlanta reminds me of detroit. georgia tech is academically prestigious, so that drew me as well. once i got on campus and saw what it was like, and the different programs it offers, i just felt this was the place for me."" 
 matthews: ""columbia, maryland, is home for me. i came to tech in 2013 to start my graduate work, then left for a couple of years for experience. i've been back here at tech for four years now, working specifically with the women's basketball team."" 
 butts: ""i'm originally from georgia. i just completed my second year here at tech, now going into my third. prior to georgia tech, i was at lsu [louisiana state university] for eight years. prior to lsu, i as at ucla [university of california, los angeles] for three years and duquesne university for one year. i played college basketball for the late-great pat summit at the university of tennessee and also had the opportunity to play professionally in the wnba [women's national basketball association] and internationally. all of that led me back home to the state of georgia and here to georgia tech with the women's basketball team."" 
 kierra, what do you like about being a part of the georgia tech women's basketball team? 
 ""i like how diverse our team is. i don't think you really see the type of diversity we have on our team anywhere else. we're not just black and white - we have players from italy, spain, and finland, and i really don't think you see that around the ncaa. everyone comes from different backgrounds but we still come together to do what we need to do and we've really built a family atmosphere."" 
 tell us about the team's historic season. what were some highlights? 
 fletcher: ""i think the biggest accomplishment this year for us, as a team, was making the ncaa tournament. we hadn't been there since 2014, and we made it to the sweet 16. this is something we can definitely build upon going into this upcoming season."" 
 matthews: ""this year was incredibly special for more reasons than one. this season just treated us really well. we were able to find true success in the midst of some craziness, and that's a testament to our ladies and their resilience. it was a really good time. 
 ""we got to travel with our entire program so it was fun to get to know staffers, bond, and connect with many outside of basketball who we didn't know. 
 butts: ""it was rewarding to even have a season - and we got through the season healthy. i'm just thankful that our team got to experience this season and it was rewarding that our team met their goal. they wanted to have our name called on selection monday [the ncaa's announcement of invited tournament participants] and go to the tournament. i'm just so thankful that they were able to reach their goals and go beyond what they thought they'd be able to do and reach the sweet 16. i'm also thankful for their sanity and their mental health during these times."" 
 what has it been like playing in the time of covid-19? 
 matthews: ""it's certainly been challenging. specifically, for me, as the primary health care provider. i administer the covid tests, receive the results, and am also the contact tracer. i also handle some of the other daily ins and outs, such as reminding our ladies of wearing masks and practicing social distancing."" 
 butts: ""the fear was definitely there. going into every single day not fully understanding how you can contract the virus has been stressful. we had moments during the season where some of us had to quarantine as a result of contract tracing, but luckily for us, none of the team contracted covid-19. 
 ""for our players i felt badly, especially for our freshmen. they're entering college and this is their first taste of it - living in a bubble, having to quarantine. but, what i will say is that our ladies handled it very maturely. they saw the bigger picture and they saw the goal."" 
 fletcher: ""the pandemic was a challenge. having to test multiple times a week was a challenge but also the racial inequality and tough conversations about race and police brutality that have been highlighted over this past year were something that were hard to deal with as well. being a black woman myself and just seeing things that are happening to people of color at the hands of law enforcement is something that i've personally struggled with this past year."" 
 speaking of racial inequality and injustices, could you tell us a little more about the team's 
 say her name 
 campaign? 
 fletcher: ""through discussions with omed, i learned so much about diversity and inclusion. we can say that we are diverse team, but do we include everyone? as a team, we wanted to do something impactful - something that people would remember from this season. the 
 say her name 
 campaign that we did included videos of every team member talking about a black woman who lost her life hands at the hands of law enforcement. we looked up the stories of these women and decided to do this to honor one of these women at every game. 
 ""in addition to the short video, we would wear a shirt that read ""say her name"" and we would repeat this phrase in the video. these would be shown at home games on the big screen and we also put these on social media."" 
 matthews: ""much credit to kierra for the initiative - it was her idea. she had conversations with some of the support staff here with the team, which was then presented to the collective, and everyone loved the idea so, we ran with it. we dedicated the games to these black women who were unjustly killed and their stories were told in our arena and on social media. 
 ""but what most people didn't see were the intimate moments our team had. before every game, a black woman's name would be read - such as sandra bland, breonna taylor - and her story would be told. we had a moment before each game that created emotion just before we played. it really gave our ladies, including myself, a time to step outside of ourselves, a time to step outside the nature and the hype of a basketball game and to really look at something much bigger than ourselves. so, while we got to raise awareness and share these stories, it was great for our team to be able to acknowledge something other than ourselves."" 
 butts: ""the campaign started with a conversation between myself and kierra. kierra then took it further and spoke with coach nell about it. after those initial conversations, kierra, cortnee walton, and sydnee durrah [gtwbb recruiting operations and video staff members, respectively] compiled a list of the women we would be representing. 
 ""so many ncaa teams were kneeling [in response to police brutality] but we wanted to make sure that what we did was also educational. we wanted to bring to light these social injustices. so, we had a meeting and talked about some things and then came the discussion of what we wanted to do. we loved the idea of the 
 say her name 
 campaign. we wanted to build off the campaign that the wnba did by dedicating their season to breonna taylor. but, we wanted to take it a little bit further and not only honor breonna taylor but honor a lot of other women who could easily be forgotten. it was very heavy as the season went along to look back and see all of these names but it was something that was necessary."" 
 do you think the team will carry 
 say her name 
 into the next season? 
 butts: ""i honestly don't know but i don't think that's a bad idea. this is not something that's just for 
 now 
 - this is something we live in, every day, and i have no problem continuing with it because we know there will be more names to come."" 
 matthews: ""i'd love to see how we could continue this. how do we reach more people and bring more awareness? i hope to see more of this in our upcoming season."" 
 we've seen professional and student-athletes get pushback when they raise awareness of racial injustice at games. how do you counter someone who says such messaging should be kept out of sports? 
 matthews: ""i think it's great for professional athletes and student-athletes to use their platform to raise awareness. government officials have the attention of their offices; people of other notoriety use their status and their position to push for agendas that they believe in, so i think it's only right that athletes use their platform to freely express themselves. i don't see racial equality as political in the least bit. i think it's freedom of speech, so if they want to use their platform and their outlets to raise awareness for what they believe in, then i support that, and i support our ladies who choose to do so."" 
 tell us about the omed-gtwbb 
 race and reel black consciousness series ? 
 matthews: ""many thanks to dr. sybrina atwaters for having these conversations with our team. i was introduced to her after seeing her on a panel. she had some phenomenal things to share about herself and omed. so, i thought ‘how can we incorporate some of her messaging into our team, which is extremely diverse?' i wanted to do due diligence in educating our ladies on a lot of social issues and give them a space to be honest. so, i reached out to dr. atwaters and she came up with 
 race and reel 
 which i just thought was so clever. 
 ""i found it to be challenging and stimulating. our conversations really impacted me personally, just looking at systemic racism. i'd been educated on racism in the past and how it's still affecting black communities today, but she challenged us to look at things right here on our campus, here in atlanta, to see that racial inequality is right in our back yard."" 
 butts: ""our athletic department was doing lots of things with our student-athletes around these topics, but we wanted to give our team more of an intimate setting, over food, to give them the freedom to be themselves and to be able to speak their minds. rachel and i talked about some things and she mentioned omed, which is how the ball got rolling. 
 ""our first session watching ""dear white people"" was very comfortable and uncomfortable at the same time. our team is black, italian, spanish, finnish; we're from south carolina, michigan, georgia - we are from all over the place. we have a very diverse team. and our coaching staff - we have members who are in their 30s, 40s, and 60s. so, everyone has experienced different things. after watching the show and talking about it, it was interesting to see how different team members interpreted it. it was great to be able to talk and to educate and it was an experience that was good for me. afterwards, our athletes thanked dr. atwaters. i definitely want to continue the initiative in the fall. obviously with covid, we are limited on some things, but i do want to make sure that we continue these discussions."" 
 fletcher: this year and last year were the most i've been involved with omed since i've been at tech. my sophomore or junior year was the first time i had a black professor. i think that opened my eyes to a lot of things, on top of the death of george floyd. our team really took an initiative to be more involved in addressing racial inequality. like i said before, we have a diverse team, so some of them aren't fully aware of the history of race and the u.s. 
 ""we started doing the 
 race and reel , the whole team - including coaches and staff. we would come together once a month on a saturday with dr. atwaters over food and watch a netflix show, take notes, and then come back for a discussion. i felt 
 race and ree l was really impactful for us because it opened our eyes to a lot."" 
 butts: ""george floyd's death woke a lot of people up. this is why we wanted to partner with omed. i always want to be a sounding board for our team, for our coaching staff, and point things out when something is said or done that a person may not realize is offensive. i want to point it out as a black woman. i can't expect everyone to understand where i am coming from but i can educate them."" 
 what's next for you? what's next for the team? 
 butts: ""we're getting ready for things to be opened back up on campus and having athletes on campus for unofficial visits. we will go on the road in july to recruit and he haven't done that in over a year. things haven't slowed down for us, but we will take a few weeks off before we ramp up at the end of may."" 
 matthews: ""there's an ongoing joke that there is no off-season in basketball! so right now, we are training a few hours each week; working on skills, honing skills, and rehabbing some athletes. overall, the summer is the time to exhale, reevaluate and check in with ourselves. it's the primetime for me to get our athletes feeling better after a long, hard season."" 
 fletcher: ""after this next season is over, i'd like to play professional basketball overseas and get my master's degree. if i can't do that, after i'm done playing, my goal is to be a graduate assistant with a team and use my acc post-graduate scholarship to complete a master's degree in criminology. i'd like to work for the fbi."" 
 kierra, what does leadership mean to you? 
 ""i don't think i understood what that meant until my junior year. i lead by example and do the right thing. if i see something that's unjust, i'm going to speak out against it and that's what i've been doing this whole season. 
 ""off the court as well, i'm trying to leave a legacy outside of basketball. eventually, the ball is going to stop bouncing, so i want to do things that people will remember me by and not just remember me as a basketball player, but as someone who tried to do good."" 
 coach butts, kierra was awarded 
 omed's inaugural women of color student-athlete impact award at the 2021 tower awards . what makes her a leader? 
 ""that kid - she's unbelievable! from the first time i stepped on campus two years ago, she and i immediately developed a coach-player bond and i've seen her leadership grow. i've seen her grow so much and this year was a huge year for her. for her to be able to develop her ideas and speak to our team about making a difference in this world is remarkable. 
 ""everyone on our team will run through a wall for her. that speaks to the person that she is. she is going to do wonders in this world.""

 researchers are studying a tiny single-celled protozoan that achieves blazing-fast acceleration while contracting its worm-like body.

 aug 07, 2018 
 - atlanta, ga 
 ask most people to identify the fastest animal on earth and they'll suggest a cheetah, falcon or even a sailfish. to that list of speedy animals, georgia institute of technology assistant professor saad bhamla would like to add the spirostomum ambiguum, a tiny single-celled protozoan that achieves blazing-fast acceleration while contracting its worm-like body. 
 common to many lakes and ponds, the spirostomum ordinarily moves about using tiny hairs called cilia. but its claim to speed involves extremely rapid acceleration while contracting its body when startled. the creature can shorten its body by more than 60 percent in a few milliseconds, going from a four-millimeter flat ribbon to the shape of an american football - all without the kind of muscles humans use. 
 how it does that, and how it does that without damaging fragile internal structures, is part of a four-year national science foundation (nsf) grant bhamla just received. the physics and mathematics of the answers could help advance nanotechnology and accelerate a new generation of robots barely large enough to see with the naked eye. 
 ""as engineers, we like to look at how nature has handled important challenges,"" said 
 bhamla , who is an assistant professor in georgia tech's 
 school of chemical and biomolecular engineering . ""we are always thinking about how to make these tiny things that we see zipping around in nature. if we can understand how they work, maybe the information can cross over to fill the gap for small robots that can move fast with little energy use."" 
 human muscles rely on the activity of actin and myosin proteins, but tiny creatures like this protozoan owe their motion to supramolecular springs, latches and motors that more often are found in the mechanical world. 
 ""if they had only the actin and myosin proteins that make up our muscles, they couldn't generate enough force to actually move that fast,"" bhamla added. ""the smaller they are, the faster they go - up to 200 meters per second squared. that's really off the charts."" 
 bhamla holds a ph.d. in chemical engineering from stanford university, where he was part of a research team studying the world of very small animals. the single-celled creatures he and his collaborators found in ponds and lakes challenged his expectations for what it means to be unicellular. 
 ""my early biology training suggested that cells were just simple bags of fluid that didn't do much but make up more interesting tissues,"" said bhamla. ""the spirostomum is completely different from the cells we are accustomed to."" 
 as part of the nsf's joint molecular cell biology (mcb) and physics of living systems (pols) program, bhamla and his students are using the language of mathematics and physics to describe the activities of spirostomum. 
 ""for instance, we want to know what is the fundamental limit for acceleration in a living cell,"" he said. ""we want to map out everything this creature is doing and model it in the computer, taking an engineering approach. we want to learn how a single cell achieves such remarkable acceleration and uses molecular springs to amplify its power output."" 
 what the researchers learn could be useful to future generations of tiny robots that won't be able to utilize the technologies for propulsion and grasping common to much larger machines. beyond the simple mechanical challenges of making very small robots, engineers will have to confront energy density limitations - which the spirostomum seems to have overcome. 
 robots this small would also be rather fragile, but what the researchers have observed by peering at protozoans is just the opposite. 
 ""it has internal organelles, dna and delicate cytoskeletal components inside,"" bhamla noted. ""we want to understand how they are not damaged by the rapid compression, because the internal pressures must increase rapidly. this may advance our understanding of how truly robust biological materials are under extreme stresses and pressures. "" 
 protozoans like spirostomum are found everywhere in bodies of water, and part of the nsf award will fund sharing that tiny world with k-12 students. already, bhamla has established a collaboration with janet standeven, a science teacher  at the lambert high school in forsyth county, north of atlanta. five high school students are working this summer in a georgia tech lab to learn more about the world of tiny organisms. 
 ""to find these curious and crazy cells, you don't need to go far,"" said bhamla. ""we just go to a pond, collect samples and look them under a microscope. the sky is the limit on how far you can push this, and high school students are capable of a lot given the right mentorship.""

 using x-ray tomography, a research team has observed the internal evolution of the materials inside solid-state lithium batteries as they were charged and discharged.

 using x-ray tomography, a research team has observed the internal evolution of the materials inside solid-state lithium batteries as they were charged and discharged. detailed three-dimensional information from the research could help improve the reliability and performance of the batteries, which use solid materials to replace the flammable liquid electrolytes in existing lithium-ion batteries. 
 the 
 operando 
 synchrotron x-ray computed microtomography imaging revealed how the dynamic changes of electrode materials at lithium / solid-electrolyte interfaces determine the behavior of solid-state batteries. the researchers found that battery operation caused voids to form at the interface, which created a loss of contact that was the primary cause of failure in the cells. 
 ""this work provides fundamental understanding of what is happening inside the battery, and that information should be important for guiding engineering efforts that will push these batteries closer to commercial reality in the next several years,"" said 
 matthew mcdowell , an assistant professor in the 
 george w. woodruff school of mechanical engineering 
 and the 
 school of materials science and engineering 
 at the georgia institute of technology. ""we were able to understand exactly how and where voids form at the interface, and then relate that to battery performance."" 
 the research, supported by the national science foundation, a sloan research fellowship, and the air force office of scientific research, was reported jan. 28 in the journal 
 nature materials . 
 the lithium-ion batteries now in widespread use for everything from mobile electronics to electric vehicles rely on a liquid electrolyte to carry ions back and forth between electrodes within the battery during charge and discharge cycles. the liquid uniformly coats the electrodes, allowing free movement of the ions. 
 rapidly evolving solid-state battery technology instead uses a solid electrolyte, which should help boost energy density and improve the safety of future batteries. but removal of lithium from electrodes can create voids at interfaces that cause reliability issues, limiting how long the batteries can operate. 
 ""to counter this, you could imagine creating structured interfaces through different deposition processes to try to maintain contact through the cycling process,"" mcdowell said. ""careful control and engineering of these interface structures will be very important for future solid-state battery development, and what we learned here could help us design interfaces."" 
 the georgia tech research team, led by first author and graduate student jack lewis, built special test cells about two millimeters wide. they were designed to be studied at the advanced photon source, a synchrotron facility at argonne national laboratory, a u.s. department of energy office of science facility located near chicago. four members of the team studied the changes in battery structure during a five-day period of intensive experiments. 
 ""the instrument takes images from different directions, and you reconstruct them using computer algorithms to provide 3d images of the batteries over time,"" mcdowell said. ""we did this imaging while we were charging and discharging the batteries to visualize how things were changing inside the batteries as they operated."" 
 because lithium is so light, imaging it with x-rays can be challenging and required a special design of the test battery cells. the technology used at argonne is similar to what is used for medical computed tomography (ct) scans. ""instead of imaging people, we were imaging batteries,"" he said. 
 because of limitations in the testing, the researchers were only able to observe the structure of the batteries through a single cycle. in future work, mcdowell would like to see what happens over additional cycles, and whether the structure somehow adapts to the creation and filling of voids. the researchers believe the results would likely apply to other electrolyte formulations, and that the characterization technique could be used to obtain information about other battery processes. 
 battery packs for electric vehicles must withstand at least a thousand cycles during a projected 150,000-mile lifetime. while solid-state batteries with lithium metal electrodes can offer more energy for a given size battery, that advantage won't overcome existing technology unless they can provide comparable lifetimes. 
 ""we are very excited about the technological prospects for solid-state batteries,"" mcdowell said. ""there is substantial commercial and scientific interest in this area, and information from this study should help advance this technology toward broad commercial applications.""

yes-computing-genetic-ancestors-super-accurate.txt,"yes, computing genetic ancestors is super accurate 
 for two decades, geneticists have been using computer simulations to reconstruct genes and proteins millions of years old. but do their algorithms really work? a new study says: yes, and how!

 remnants of extinct monkeys are hiding inside you, along with those of lizards, jellyfish and other animals. your dna is built upon gene fragments from primal ancestors. 
 now researchers at the georgia institute of technology have made it more likely that ancestral genes, along with ancestral proteins, can be confidently identified and reconstructed. they have benchmarked a vital tool that would seem nearly impossible to benchmark. the newly won confidence in the tool could also help scientists compute ancient gene sequences and use them to synthesize better proteins to battle diseases. 
 for some 20 years, scientists have used algorithms to compute their way hundreds of millions of years back into the evolutionary past. starting with present-day gene sequences, they perform what's called ancestral sequence reconstruction (asr) to determine past mutations and figure out the genes' primal forerunners. 
 ""with the help of asr, we can now actually build those ancient genes in the laboratory and express their encoded ancient proteins,"" said  eric gaucher, an associate professor at georgia tech's school of biological sciences . in a separate project, his lab is computing ancient proteins that were very effective in blood clotting 80 million years ago, 
 in hopes of using them to fight hemophilia 
 today. 
 that protein comes from a common ancestor humans share with rats. 
 time travel substitute 
 but asr algorithms have faced logical criticism. species based on those primal genes are long extinct, and scientists can't travel back in time to observe mutations that have happened since. so, how can anyone find any physical benchmark to verify and gauge asr? 
 a team of researchers led by gaucher did it by building an evolutionary framework out of myriad mutations. then they benchmarked asr algorithms against it - no time machine required. their results have shored up confidence that the widely used algorithms are working as they should. 
 ""most of them did a very good job - 98% accurate,"" gaucher said of contemporary algorithms' ability to compute ancient gene sequences. their determination of proteins encoded by those sequences was virtually perfect. 
 gaucher, research coordinator ryan randall and undergraduate student caelan radford published their results on thursday, september 15, 2016, 
 in the journal 
 nature communications . 
 their research has been funded by the nasa exobiology program, e.i. du pont de nemours and company (dupont) and the national science foundation. 
 holographic tree branches 
 ancestral sequence reconstruction is like making a family tree for genes. 
 the many twigs and branches at the treetop would be sequences from species alive today. shimmying down the tree, called a phylogeny in genetics, you would find their common ancestors, millions of years old, in the lower branches. 
 there's a caveat; none of the lower branches exist any longer. they vanished in the extinction of the species bearing those genetic sequences. 
 asr computes them back into place using algorithms based on scientific models of evolution. it's like replacing missing branches with holographic duplicates. 
 algorithm horse race 
 the accuracy of those evolutionary models has been a historic sticking point. and doubts about the algorithms based on them linger in some circles that hold on to an old, tried-and-true algorithm. 
 so, gaucher and researcher coordinator randall pitted the contemporary model-based, or ""maximum likelihood,"" algorithms in a race against the generic, or ""parsimony,"" algorithm. 
 ""parsimony follows the simplest notion of evolution, which is that very little mutation occurs,"" randall said. the models behind contemporary ""maximum likelihood"" algorithms, by contrast, are laced with filigree, data-packed details. 
 for the race, randall made a track of sorts by putting a gene sequence that made a single protein through multiple mutations to construct a real-life phylogeny. she used methods that closely mimicked natural evolution, but that were much, much faster. 
 rainbow phylogeny racetrack 
 in cells, enzymes called polymerases aid in dna duplication.  they work very efficiently, but their rare mistakes are the most common source of mutations, and randall took her lead from this. 
 ""we used a polymerase that is error-prone to speed up mutations, and speed up evolution,"" she said. 
 the genes used at the starting point of the lab evolution made a protein that fluoresced red when placed in bacteria.  as significant mutations arose, the proteins began changing color.  bacteria containing green fluorescing proteins popped up among the red ones. 
 randall divided bacteria with major mutations into new groups, creating branches in the phylogeny, as she went. many mutations produced new colors - yellow, orange, blue, pink - and randall ended up with a gene family tree in rainbow colors. 
 show me the phenotype 
 the colors reflected not only new gene sequences but also new phenotypes - the actual proteins they produced, the organism's working molecules. 
 ""what counts is phenotype,"" gaucher said. ""when you analyze dna strictly by itself, it ignores the context, in which that dna is connected to phenotype,"" he said. 
 dna can mutate and still encode the same amino acids, protein's component parts. then the mutation has no real effect. but when mutations cause dna to encode different amino acids, they're more significant. 
 a worthy test of ancestral sequence reconstruction algorithms must therefore include phenotype. and randall took this into account when she selected mutated proteins. 
 ""i selected for variants to purposely make it hard on the algorithms to infer the phenotypes,"" she said. the race ensued, and the algorithms got limited information to infer the evolutionary tree's many dozens of past mutations. 
 asr a sure bet 
 though the tried-and-true parsimony algorithm performed well, maximum likelihood performed better.  ""even though it got the same number of residues (dna sequences) wrong as parsimony, the incorrectly inferred sequences were still more likely to encode the right phenotypes,"" said undergraduate student caelan radford, who analyzed the experiment's statistics. 
 the margin of error was so tiny that it would not interfere in the determination of past species. 
 the experiment's outcome was not too surprising, because prior simulations had predicted it.  but the researchers wanted the scientific community to have physical proof that feels trustier than proof from a computer.  ""it's a computer algorithm.  it will do what you will tell it to do,"" gaucher said. 
 short history of asr 
 doubts about ancestral sequence reconstruction -- and maximum likelihood algorithms in particular -- go far back.  the idea of performing asr first came up in 1963, but it didn't get started until the 1990s, and back then, researchers battled fervently over wide-ranging methods. 
 ""people would come up with the craziest notion as to why one model was best,"" gaucher said. ""they'd say, ‘well, if i simulate this weird mode of evolution along these branches here, my algorithm will work better than your algorithm.'"" 
 the parsimony algorithm was a way of reigning in the chaos that grew out of a lack of data in evolutionary models at the time.  ""when the model is wrong, ‘maximum likelihood' fails miserably,"" gaucher said. 
 but, now, a host of data and analysis give scientists a great picture of how evolution works (and it's not a parsimony principle): for ages, nothing moves, then change bursts forth, then things stabilize again. 
 ""you get this quick evolution, so lots of stuff works and lots of stuff fails, and the stuff that works then goes on and kind of maintains its status and doesn't change,"" gaucher said.  by confirming the high accuracy of the algorithms, the georgia tech team has also corroborated the validity of current evolutionary science they're based on.

youll-never-dance-alone-artificial-intelligence-project.txt,"you'll never dance alone with this artificial intelligence project 
 project allows people to dance with a virtual character, which learns from them and improvises. 
 dancers perform in georgia tech's geodesic dome. 
 apr 28, 2016 
 - atlanta, ga 
 your next dance partner might not be a person. a new project from the georgia institute of technology allows people to get jiggy with a computer-controlled dancer, which ""watches"" the person and improvises its own moves based on prior experiences. when the human responds, the computerized figure or ""virtual character"" reacts again, creating an impromptu dance couple based on artificial intelligence (ai). the  luminai project  is housed inside a 15-foot-tall geodesic dome, designed and constructed by georgia tech digital media master's student jessica anderson, and lined with custom-made projection panels for dome projection mapping. the surfaces allow people to watch their own shadowy avatar as it struts with a virtual character named  vai , which learns how to dance by paying attention to which moves the current user (and everyone before them) is doing and when. the more moves it sees, the better and deeper the computer's dance vocabulary. it then uses this vocabulary as a basis for future improvisation. ""co-creative artificial intelligence, or using ai as a creative collaborator, is rare,"" said brian magerko, the georgia tech digital media associate professor who leads the project. ""as computers become more ubiquitous, we must understand how they can co-exist with humans. part of that is creating things together."" the system uses kinect devices to capture the person's movement, which is then projected as a digitally enhanced silhouette on the dome's screens. the computer analyzes the dance moves being performed and leans on its memory to choose its next move. ""this episodic memory is filled with experiences of how people have danced with it in the past,"" said mikhail jacob, a computer science ph.d. student and lead developer of the luminai technology. ""for example, the computer learns to predict that when one person pumps their arms into the air, their partner is likely to do something similar. so on seeing that movement, the avatar might pump its arms sideways at the same pace or use that as the basis for its response."" the team says this improvisation is one of the most important parts of the project. the avatar recognizes patterns, but doesn't always react the same way every time. that means that the person must improvise too, which leads to greater creativity all around. all the while, the computer is capturing these new experiences and storing the information to use as a basis for future dance sessions. ""humans aren't fully in the driver's seat anymore. the process gives autonomy back to the computer,"" said jacob. ""luminai forces a person to create something new - potentially something better - with their partner because they're forced to take their (virtual) partner's actions into consideration."" the technology has broader implications than art. as magerko explains it, these days ai mostly relies on instructions fed to it by humans, and programming a computer with every possible instruction is impossible. ""that's because humans are so unpredictable,"" says magerko. ""let's say a computer and a person are going to write a story together about a family conversation at a restaurant. the story could go in a typical fashion or veer wildly into novel territory. the computer won't do well unless it has been programmed with all of the pieces of knowledge that the story could possibly contain. however, if it can learn that knowledge from people and prior experiences, its improvisation can become somewhat consistent and accurate and the ai learning new story content (or dance moves) becomes part of the user experience."" luminai was unveiled for the first time this past weekend in atlanta at the  hambidge art auction  in partnership with the goat farm arts center. it was featured within a dance and technology performance, in a work called  post,  as a finalist for the field experiment atl grant. t. lang dance performed set choreography with avatars and virtual characters within the dome.

 under normal conditions, pd-1 serves an important role as an off-switch, preventing well-intentioned t cells from running amok and attacking normal, healthy cells by mistake. it does this by binding with a protein called pd-l1, found on some normal and some cancer cells. this interaction basically signals the t cell to leave the other cell alone. unfortunately, sometimes the other cell is cancer, which then goes unbothered because pd-1 told the t cell to stand down. 
 the immunotherapy drug used to treat president carter, keytruda, is a checkpoint inhibitor. it inhibited pd-1, freeing the t cells to do their job and destroy the brain tumor. since then, research into the molecule has expanded and pd-1 blockade continues its evolution as a promising treatment against solid tumors. the japanese scientist who discovered the protein in 1992, tasuku honjo, won the nobel prize in 2018. 
 ""it has become a very hot molecule,"" said 
 cheng zhu , professor in the wallace h. coulter department of biomedical engineering at georgia tech and emory university and the george w. woodruff school of mechanical engineering at tech. ""but only a minor fraction of cancer patients - about one third of the melanoma patients who have been treated with the blockade therapy - are responsive, indicating an incomplete understanding of how pd-1 works."" 
 zhu and his colleagues are particularly interested in explaining how pd-1 inhibits t-cell activity, and they unravel one part of the mystery in a new paper in 
 nature communications . using technology zhu developed decades ago that measures the biochemistry on live cell membranes, the researchers discovered that pd-1 disrupts the recruitment of cd8, a protein co-receptor that partners in t cell signaling and activation. 
 ""the results of our study identify a pd-1 inhibitory mechanism that disrupts cooperative molecular interactions and prevents cd8 from augmenting antigen recognition,"" zhu said. ""this explains the molecule's potent inhibitory function regarding t cell activation and also explains its value as a target for clinical intervention."" 
 the lead author on the paper is kaitao li, a research scientist in zhu's 
 cellular and molecular biomechanics lab , who focused on pd-1 for his ph.d. dissertation in 2016. li's interest in the molecule has only grown through his friendship with 
 rafi ahmed's 
 lab at emory. ahmed is a co-author of the new 
 nature communications 
 paper. 
 ""i was taking an immunology class at emory in 2010, and it was the first time i came across the pd-1 molecule,"" li recalled. ""a friend of mine was a grad student in rafi's lab, and eventually, i became very inspired by their work."" 
 ahmed's lab identified pd-1 as a major mediator of t cell dysfunction during chronic infection, work that ultimately translated into human clinical studies of blockade therapy. meanwhile, the zhu lab had been focusing mainly on the basic science of on t cell activation and t cell receptors - tcr, a protein complex used by t cells for recognizing invading antigens. 
 ""what excites me most is that [this study] reinforces and extends the work that dr. zhu did 10 years ago on the sequence of events leading up to t cell activation, but now it brings pd-1 into the story, revealing how pd-1 dampens t cell activation,"" explained simon davis, paper co-author, whose immunology lab at the university of oxford has studied pd-1 and other proteins for about 20 years. ""we had proposed a long time ago that the activation sequence is dictated by the relative strengths of protein interactions involves, but dr. zhu's lab was able to tease all this apart."" 
 while zhu's lab is rich in basic science, there is a translational aspect to this work. a biotech company that spun out davis' work is interested in zhu's discoveries, particularly the series of interactions among all of these critical molecules engaged in the immune response, davis said. 
 and it's bound to get more interesting going forward. zhu and li, who collaborated on pd-1 research for a paper in 2017, said they are planning two more studies focusing on the notable molecule, now the target of a hopeful treatment regimen that still has plenty of room for improvement. 
 ""there has certainly been some clinical success even though we don't fully understand the mechanism behind it,"" zhu said. ""but there is still a long way to go because two thirds of the patients are not responding successfully. why? we have another study planned to try to answer that question.""
