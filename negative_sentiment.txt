 katrina remains one of the deadliest and costliest hurricanes in u.s. history, with more than 1,800 lives lost and damages estimated at over $100 billion. when the levees failed, about 80 percent of new orleans flooded. more than 1 million people across the gulf coast were forced to leave their homes - many never returned. in the years since, the region has served as a laboratory for researchers from the georgia institute of technology who have traveled to new orleans and other locations to study the effects of the disaster. their work has helped determine what went wrong; how best to rebuild the region; and how to help the nation prepare for future calamities. read the full story:

 finding a handful of cancer cells hiding among billions of blood cells in a patient sample can be like finding a needle in a haystack. in a new approach enabled by 3d-printed cell traps, researchers are removing the hay to expose the cancer cells. 
 trapping the white blood cells - which are about the size of cancer cells - and filtering out smaller red blood cells leaves behind the tumor cells, which could then be used to diagnose the disease, potentially provide early warning of recurrence and enable research into the cancer metastasis process. the work, led by researchers at the georgia institute of technology, could advance the goal of personalized cancer treatment by allowing rapid and low-cost separation of tumor cells circulating in the bloodstream. 
 "isolating circulating tumor cells from whole blood samples has been a challenge because we are looking for a handful of cancer cells mixed with billions of normal red and white blood cells," said 
 a. fatih sarioglu , an assistant professor in georgia tech's 
 school of electrical and computer engineering 
 (ece). "with this device, we can process a clinically-relevant volume of blood by capturing nearly all of the white blood cells and then filtering out the red blood cells by size. that leaves us with undamaged tumor cells that can be sequenced to determine the specific cancer type and the unique characteristics of each patient's tumor." 
 the research was reported september 20 in the journal 
 lab on a chip , and was supported by a seed grant from the integrated cancer research center at georgia tech. 
 other attempts to capture circulating tumor cells have attempted to extract them from the blood using microfluidic technology that recognizes specific surface markers on the cancer cells. but because the cancer can change over time, the malignant cells can't be recognized with certainty. and even if they can be captured, the tumor cells must be removed from circuitous channels in the device and separated from the antigen without causing damage. 
 sarioglu and collaborators, including ece graduate student and first author chia-heng chu, decided to take a different approach, building 3d-printed traps lined with antigens to capture the white blood cells in a sample. the 3d printed traps allowed the researchers to greatly expand the surface area for capturing the white blood cells as they pass by in blood samples. zig-zagging fluid channels, some as much as half a meter long, increase the likelihood that every white blood cell would come into contact with a channel wall. 
 "usual microfluidic devices have just a single layer with channel heights of 50 to 100 microns," sarioglu said. "they are thick, but most of it just empty plastic. using 3d printing liberates us from the single channel and allows us to create many channels in three dimensions that better utilize the space." 
 while the 3d printing allowed an increase in channel density, that came with a significant challenge. earlier microfluidic devices could be designed with etched channels to carry the blood. but with 3d printing processes that are fabricated layer-by-layer, channels had to be filled with wax to allow more channels to be built atop them. the torturous channel structure, designed to maximize cell-wall interaction, made it virtually impossible to get the wax out after fabrication. 
 the solution was to design cell traps that fit into standard centrifuges designed to spin samples for separation. the traps were heated in the centrifuge and then spun to allow the melted wax to escape. after removing the liquid wax, the channels received the antigen coating. 
 after the white blood cells are removed, the smaller red blood cells pass through a simple commercial filter that traps the cancer cells and any remaining white blood cells. the tumor cells can then be removed from the filter, which is integrated into the 3d printed device. 
 minimal processing of blood samples is a goal for the project to make the process available to clinics and hospitals without requiring specialized technician skills. less processing also reduces the risk of damage to the tumor cells and minimizes other cellular changes that could skew the evaluation. 
 as part of the proof of principle testing, the researchers coated the white blood cells with biotin to accelerate testing. future cell traps will use antigens designed to attract the cells to the channel walls without the biotin processing step. 
 the researchers tested their approach by adding cancer cells to blood taken from healthy people. because they knew how many cells were added, they could tell how many they should extract, and the experiment showed the trap could capture around 90 percent of the tumor cells. later testing of blood samples from prostate cancer patients isolated tumor cells from a 10-milliliter whole blood sample. 
 testing included cells from prostate, breast and ovarian cancer, but sarioglu believes that the device will capture circulating tumor cells from any type of cancer because the removal mechanism targets blood cells rather than cancer cells. 
 next steps will be to narrow the channels in the device, test white blood cell removal without the use of biotin, boost the percentage of white cell extraction and connect cell traps to increase trapping capacity. 
 "we expect that this will really be an enabling tool for clinicians," sarioglu said. "in our lab, the mindset is always toward translating our research by making the device simple enough to be used in hospitals, clinics and other facilities that will help diagnose disease in patients." 
 other co-authors of the paper include ruxiu liu, tevhide ozkaya-ahmadov, mert boya, brandi e. swain, jacob m. owens, enerelt burentugs, and john f. mcdonald, all from georgia tech, and mehmet asim bilen from emory university.

 scientists have determined the three-dimensional structure of a key part of a protein that is associated with glaucoma and identified regions of this domain that correlate with severe forms of the disease. the new crystal structure is of the olfactomedin (olf) domain in myocilin, a protein implicated in glaucoma. many proteins have olf domains, but mutations in the olf domain of myocilin are linked to early-onset glaucoma. despite decades of research, scientists don't completely understand what biological role myocilin plays nor how these mutations create forms of myocilin that build up in the eye, which causes glaucoma. "now that we have the 3d visual picture, we can map the mutations and understand why they can be bad for the protein," said 
 raquel lieberman , an associate professor in the school of chemistry and biochemistry at the georgia institute of technology. the study was sponsored by the american health assistance foundation, the glaucoma research foundation, and the national institutes of health (nih). the study was featured as the cover story in the april 15 issue of the 
 journal 
 human molecular genetics . glaucoma, the second leading cause of blindness worldwide, is a group of diseases that damage the eye's optic nerve and cause vision loss. elevated eye pressure is the main risk factor for optic nerve damage. researchers have implicated mutant forms of myocilin as a root cause of this increased eye pressure. mutant myocilin is toxic to cells in the part of the eye that regulates pressure. these genetically inherited variants of myocilin are toxic because they clump together in the front of the eye, preventing fluid flow out of the eye, which then raises eye pressure. this cascade of events leads to early-onset glaucoma, which is estimated to affect up to a million people from childhood to age 35. olf domain-containing proteins play roles in fundamental cellular processes and have been implicated in not just glaucoma, but also cancers, inflammatory bowel disorder, attention deficit disorder and childhood obesity. this study reports the first olf domain structure. nearly 100 different mutations in the 230 amino acid olf domain of myocilin are linked to glaucoma. in most protein domains of this size, mutating one amino acid won't cause toxic misfolding; the cell will be able to remove the protein efficiently before it causes a problem. that's not the case with myocilin. "mutating any one of these 100 or so amino acids causes the protein to aggregate," lieberman said. "myocilin is exquisitely sensitive to aggregation and the cell cannot handle it." after determining the olf domain structure, the researchers mapped and categorized the locations of mutations linked to early-onset glaucoma. they identified three different locations on olf where mutations are most likely to trigger protein aggregation. "we were able to provide new information on whether mutations reported among glaucoma cases in the general population are pathogenic or not," lieberman said.   further analysis of the myocilin olf domain in the context of the broader olf family found that olf domains have unique surface features. therefore, a high priority for further research is to develop new reagents to selectively target these specific regions and tease apart the domain's function in a variety of biological and disease contexts. "we're going to be able to figure out what the olf domain does in a more detailed way by having better reagents. the structure enables that new knowledge," lieberman said. this research is supported by grants from the american health assistance foundation, glaucoma research foundation, and the national institutes of health (r01ey021205). any conclusions or opinions are those of the authors and do not necessarily represent the official views of the sponsoring agencies. citation : rebecca k. donegan, et al.

 the book, which was co-authored with david rosen (trinity college), looks at the conflict between surveillance and privacy rights over the last four centuries - and at how this conflict has shaped modern liberalism. while santesso and rosen examine how much of this history has played out in literature (shakespeare, swift, dickens, poe, conan doyle, among others), their work has also taken them very much into real world problems of surveillance, of the sort that has been all over the news recently. the book reflects, for example, their extensive conversations with officers at scotland yard and homeland security, a former agent of the fbi and numerous individuals working in casino surveillance.

 al vivian, a national diversity and inclusion facilitator and son of civil rights leader c.t. vivian, was the keynote speaker for the race at georgia tech: a call to action conversation on thursday, jan. 21. the virtual discussion was the second in a series of campus discussions on race. 
 "talking about issues of race and racism is hard," said vice president for institute diversity, equity, and inclusion archie ervin during the conversation. "over the past year, in the wake of last summer's national racial turmoil, marked by the sensless killings of george floyd, breonna taylor, ahmaud arbery and others, and more recently, the events in our nation's capitol earlier this month, have made these converrsations even more difficult as concerns about racism and its impact have intensified and continues to bubble to the surface of our national discourse." 
 vivian heads basic diversity inc., a national full-service cultural diversity training and consulting firm best known for its race awareness workshop. his father, a confidant of martin luther king jr., founded the organization more than 45 years ago. the firm has worked with a diverse range of clients and organizations including corporations, nonprofits and, government agencies. 
 "i'll start off with a statement that is just outright true: racism in america is nothing new; it's our original sin. it's been with us from the beginning," vivian said, beginning his presentation. "if you don't understand race, your future success will be limited."

-0.494 liberal arts angela davis talks activism and reform at 2021 black history month lecture 
 activist, author, and educator angela davis delivered a virtual keynote address at georgia tech's 2021 black history month lecture on feb. 10. 
 angela davis gave a keynote speech at the 2021 georgia tech black history month lecture 
 feb 11, 2021 
 - atlanta, ga 
 esteemed activist, author, and educator angela davis delivered a virtual keynote address at georgia tech's 2021 black history month lecture on feb. 10. a pioneer in international civil rights and black feminist movements, davis has been a prominent figure for decades, working as an academic and authoring more than 10 books on race, class, gender, prison abolition, and the criminalization of marginalized communities. 
 the lecture was seen by more than 1,700 unique viewers. 
 "we are thankful to carter g. woodson for initiating the observance in 1926 of what was then called negro history week," she opened, referring to the historian and one of the first scholars to study african american history. woodson became known as the "father of black history." "this week is precisely the week we would be celebrating [negro history week] in those days." 
 decades later, black history month became, in davis' words, "the 28 days that are allocated to us to reflect not only on the contributions of black people, but on the meaning of the phenomenal collective struggle for freedom that stretches back to the days when the first africans were forcefully brought to the americas." 
 she was born in birmingham, alabama, in 1944, growing up in the infamous "dynamite hill" neighborhood, which gained its name from frequent bombings to drive out middle-class black residents in the 1950s and 1960s, including the 16 th 
 street baptist church bombing that killed four girls in 1963. davis attended segregated schools but reflected on the resilience her early upbringing and surroundings afforded her, saying, "even as we boldly challenged racial segregation, i later came to understand what a gift it was to be able to grow up in a community that realized that resistance was at the core of our visions of new futures. we learned how to resist not so much as a choice, not as an extracurricular activity, but rather as a condition of life - as a condition of our collective conviction that we would someday be free." 
 after completing high school in new york (via a program that placed black students from the south into integrated schools in the north), she would go on to study at brandeis university in boston; the sorbonne in paris; the university of frankfurt in germany; and the university of california, san diego. in 1969, she received a doctorate in philosophy from humboldt university in what was then east berlin. 
 davis noted the critical role that black women have played in advancing civil rights in the u.s., beginning with early suffrage movements. "especially because i am speaking virtually here at georgia tech in atlanta, i want to pay tribute to stacey abrams," the 2018 georgia democratic nominee for governor and the first black woman of a major political party to win a gubernatorial nomination. through her voting rights advocacy, abrams is largely credited with helping president joseph biden jr. win the state of georgia in the 2020 presidential election and for delivering two democratic georgia senate seats in january. "there's been a long history of black women not only saving the black community but saving the country." 
 the lecture, sponsored by institute diversity, equity, and inclusion and the georgia tech african american student union (aasu), included a question-and-answer session moderated by aasu members shelbe johnson and kemuel russell. 
 viewers asked davis several questions on criminal justice reform. a common theme throughout much of her scholarly work has been the social issues associated with incarceration and the criminalization of communities hardest hit by poverty and racism. she rose to national prominence in 1970 for her arrest - and subsequent acquittal - in a high-profile criminal case for which she spent 18 months in jail and on trial after being placed on the fbi's ten most wanted fugitives list. in 1997, she helped found critical resistance, which aims to dismantle prison systems worldwide. 
 her teaching career has taken her to san francisco state university and the university of california, berkeley. she also has taught at the university of california, los angeles (ucla), vassar college, syracuse university, and stanford university. most recently she spent 15 years at the university of california santa cruz, where she is now a distinguished professor emerita of history of consciousness and of feminist studies. 
 "i was hired to teach at ucla in 1969," she said, but before she could teach, she was fired for being a member of the communist party. "when i think back on the campaign to save my job, i had an enormous amount of support, including from white students and white faculty. what i attempted to do was to develop what we might call an intersectional approach. i was at the same time involved in campaigns to free political prisoners - campaigns against racism against prisoners," davis continued, while describing herself as a prison abolitionist rather than a prison reformer. "i took the position that people who supported me and my right to teach at ucla should also support people in prisons who were facing far worse forms of oppression because of their political beliefs." 
 davis will return to teach at ucla this spring, but noted her slight disdain for the fanfare her return has already brought to the campus. "i don't want to be accepted. i still want to make trouble - i like john lewis' notion of ‘good trouble,'" a nod to the late civil rights giant and georgia congressman. "so whereas i am going to be teaching at ucla again, i will continue to critique the institution, call out the racism, point to the heteropatriarchy, and point to their support of capitalist systems." 
 davis paused when asked a final question about how black people can best handle racial trauma. 
 "for so long, we haven't acknowledged racial trauma. i think what is exciting about this current era is that so many people are taking holistic approaches, teaching us how to make sense of these issues. it's important how you incorporate acknowledgment of people's trauma into the very work of organizing against racism. 
 "since this is the last question, i just want to point out that we can't let up. we can't stop. we should recognize that this is the time that the real work is getting done."

-0.9979 STEM assessing the role of negative citations in science 
 a new study examines the role of negative citations in academic publishing. 
 oct 26, 2015 
 - atlanta, ga 
 the number of times academic articles are cited by subsequent publications is among the time-honored measures used to assess scholarly standing and evaluate academic productivity. but not all of these citations are positive ones, and a paper published this week in the journal 
 proceedings of the national academy of science s finds that as many as one in 50 citations in a top immunology journal were critical in nature. these negative citations may point out limitations, inconsistences or flaws in previous work. the study found that these negative citations were more likely to criticize highly-read papers, and that the criticisms focused on specific sections of the papers. negative citations tended to originate from scholars who were close to the authors of the original articles in academic discipline and social distance - but at least 150 miles away geographically. the research, by authors at the georgia institute of technology, university of toronto and massachusetts institute of technology, may be the first to systematically quantify and examine these negative citations. the authors hope to expand their study to other disciplines, and believe their work could ultimately lead to a re-examination of how citations are used in academia. "given that we rely so heavily on these citation metrics as measures of quality, it's important to note that the intent of these citations isn't homogeneous," said alexander oettl, an assistant professor in georgia tech's 
 scheller college of business 
 and one of the study's three co-authors. "criticism is really the cornerstone of the scientific enterprise, yet it's difficult to get accurate measures of the extent to which criticism of academic papers truly occurs. the negative citations really are different from objective citations." the researchers, who also include nicola lacetera from the university of toronto and christian catalini from mit, began with 15,731 full-text articles that had been published in the 
 journal of immunology , the top academic journal in that field. from those articles, they extracted 762,355 citations, which referred to 146,891 unique published papers. beginning with a manual process, they created a set of citations that was used to train a natural language processing program which classified the remainder of the citations as either objective or negative. the process identified 18,304 negative citations, about 2.4 percent of the total citations studied. "the majority of these negative citations appear to take issue with the ‘results' and ‘discussion' sections of the papers, so they are really not attempting to overturn theory," said oettl. "they can be attempting to constrain results, note inconsistencies with other research, point out statistical flaws or correct other issues." in their study, the authors point out the relative rarity of these negative citations, and speculate that they could either demonstrate a "limited, uninfluential role" for criticism in science - or show a hesitancy to criticize. "making these negative citations isn't without cost," oettl noted. "there could be reputational harm from making these negative citations, and if your criticism turns out to be false, this could heavily impact your reputation within the field. without this cost, perhaps we might see more overt criticism appearing in the journals." the researchers found that while negative citations tended to come from scientists close to the narrow academic topic, the criticism was more likely to involve geographic distance. "we see that the probability of making a negative citation is much, much lower if you are co-located with the scientist whose work is being critiqued," oettl said. "that potentially speaks to the social component, the social cost of criticism - you don't want to criticize someone you may run into on campus. another possible interpretation is that these issues may be aired face-to-face among scientists who are located near each other geographically." in the study, frequently-cited papers were more likely than less-read papers to get negative citations, which stands to reason, oettl said. "these are typically more influential papers, so this may have more to do with more people reading them and more of an incentive for scholars to take issue with important papers," he explained. "furthermore, less important papers may receive less scrutiny, as pointing out limitations and shortcomings of trivial work will not drastically shift the scientific frontier." replication of previous work helps ensure the accuracy of research, and criticism of published studies can lead to correction that makes science more robust. but does the current scientific publishing system encourage enough discussion? "the pessimistic view is that only one in 50 citations is negative in nature, so possibly there isn't as much debate as we would want for a healthy discussion," oettl said. "but on the other hand, by the time a major manuscript makes it into print, it has undergone a tremendous amount of criticism. we now have some evidence of the extent to which criticism, in the form of negative citations, occurs within scientific manuscripts." the researchers chose immunology because they had access to the papers, which were consistent in format. they found similar numbers of negative citations in a small set of mathematics-related papers, but hope to expand their work to determine if their findings apply to other disciplines. ultimately, they hope the work could change the way citations are used in science. "we wanted to put forward a methodology to help future scholars think about how we can possibly expand this classification infrastructure and attract additional metadata to the citations that we make," oettl said. "our paper is very descriptive, but it identifies something that nobody has really demonstrated before: that these negative citations behave very differently from others." though the current study focused on a single discipline, immunology, "we would really like to see this work and methodology expanded to other disciplines," oettl said. "ultimately, though, we care about what role these negative citations play in aiding scientific debate and in the advancement of the scientific frontier." the paper was published october 26 in the journal's early edition. citation : christian catalini, nicola lacetera, alexander oettl, "beyond citation counts: exploring negative citations in science," (proceedings of the national academy of sciences, 2015).

-0.9904 STEM baking and boiling botnets could drive energy market swings and damage 
 evil armies of internet-connected appliances could be hijacked to slightly manipulate energy demand, potentially driving price swings. 
 a study presented at black hat usa 2020 suggests that botnets made up of high-wattage devices such as ovens and air conditioners could be used to manipulate electric energy markets. (credit: john toon, georgia tech) 
 aug 04, 2020 
 - atlanta, ga 
 evil armies of internet-connected ev chargers, ovens, hot-water heaters, air-conditioners, and other high-wattage appliances could be hijacked to slightly manipulate energy demand, potentially driving price swings and creating financial damage to deregulated energy markets, warns a new report scheduled to be presented aug. 5 at the black hat usa 2020 conference. 
 by turning the compromised equipment on or off to artificially increase or decrease power demand, botnets made up of these energy-consuming devices might help an unscrupulous energy supplier or retailer (electric utility) alter prices to create a business advantage, or give a nation-state a way to remotely harm the economy of another country by causing financial damage to its electricity market. if done within the bounds of normal power demand variation, such an attack would be difficult to detect, the researchers said. 
 "if an attacker can slightly affect electricity market prices in their favor, it would be like knowing today what's going to happen in tomorrow's stock market," said tohid shekari, a graduate research assistant in the 
 school of electrical and computer engineering 
 at the georgia institute of technology. "if the manipulation stays within a certain range, it would be stealthy and difficult to differentiate from a typical load forecasting error." 
 believed to be the first proposed energy market manipulation cyberattack, the operation would depend on botnets composed of thousands of appliances that could be controlled centrally by attackers who had taken over their internet of things (iot) controllers. malicious actors have already demonstrated iot botnet attacks such as mirai, which used a network of compromised internet-connected cameras and routers to launch attacks on key internet infrastructure. 
 the attack, dubbed "iot skimmer," would be made possible by the deregulation of energy markets, which has created a system to efficiently supply electrical power. to meet the demand for electrical energy, utility companies must predict future demand and purchase power from the day-ahead wholesale energy market at competitive prices. if the predictions turn out to be wrong, the utilities may have to pay more or less for the energy they need to meet the demands of their customers by participating in the real-time market, which has more volatile prices in general. creating erroneous demand data to manipulate forecasts could be profitable to the suppliers selling energy to meet the unexpected demand, or the retailers or utilities buying cheaper energy from the real-time market. 
 the researchers weren't able to determine whether such an attack might have already taken place because iot devices - beyond being insecure - also lack the kind of monitoring that would be necessary to detect such hijacking. but they used real data sets from two of the largest u.s. energy markets - new york and california - to evaluate the feasibility of their proposed attack. 
 "we did a lot of simulation and mathematical analysis to show that this kind of transfer could occur," said 
 raheem beyah , the motorola foundation professor in the school of electrical and computer engineering who is also georgia tech's vice president for interdisciplinary research and co-founder of the company fortiphyd logic. "we also did a feasibility analysis of the supporting areas to show that this would be possible from various perspectives." 
 the researchers assume that such botnets already exist, and that attackers could simply rent their use on the dark web. more than 20 million smart thermostats already exist in the north american market, and they are connected to at least one high-wattage device - a heating and air-conditioning system that could be controlled by attackers on an intermittent basis. 
 "if you consider all of the smart thermostats and internet-connected electric ovens, water heaters, and electric vehicle chargers that are already in use, there are plenty of devices to be compromised," shekari said. "homeowners would likely never notice if the ev charger turns on when electricity demand is highest, or if the air conditioning cools a little more than they expected when they are not home." 
 to counter the potential attack, researchers suggest both detection and prevention steps. through integrated monitoring of the normal power use of high-wattage iot-connected devices, unexpected peaks or valleys in power consumption triggered by an attacker could be detected. and access to data on expected energy demand - which is now made available publicly - could be restricted to those who actually need it. 
 the primary factor that makes this attack possible is the detailed online data sharing of electricity market information, which is usually updated every five minutes. 
 "this energy demand information is really a data privacy issue, and we need to think long and hard about the balance between transparency and security," beyah said. "there's always a tension there, but limiting the amount of detail could make it more difficult for attackers who want to hide their manipulations to know what the normal variations are." 
 the potential attack highlights the need for considering cybersecurity threats in technology areas where they had perhaps never been possible before. 
 "this is an interesting intersection between the iot security world and energy markets," said beyah. "right now, it seems that there is a large gap between the two worlds. our point is that there are implications for combining iot technology and high-wattage devices that can compromise markets in ways we would never have thought of before." 
 the presentation, "iot skimmer: energy market manipulation through high-wattage iot botnets," will be presented on wednesday, aug. 5, at 2:30 p.m. as part of the black hat usa 2020 conference.

-0.9479 STEM a bipartisan approach to cyber 
 rep. tom graves, rep. kyrsten sinema hold panel discussion at georgia tech to talk about cybersecurity policy and technical challenges. 
 rep. tom graves (r-ga 14) and rep. kyrsten sinema (d-ariz. 9) hold a panel discussion at georgia tech to talk about cybersecurity policy and technical challenges. peter swire, a professor in the scheller college of business, was also on the panel. 
 may 01, 2017 
 - atlanta, ga 
 as the threat of cyberattacks continues to grow, government officials are asking what can individuals and businesses do to protect themselves. 
 "we are starting this conversation of when it is time to go on the offensive as it relates to cybersecurity," said rep. tom graves (r-ga 14). "this creates a lot of policy, ethics and privacy questions." 
 graves and rep. kyrsten sinema (d-ariz. 9) heard some answers to those questions during a panel discussion they held at georgia tech monday. the bipartisan event examined how public policy can help people and companies go on the offense to defeat and unmask cyber attackers. 
 in march, graves put forth a 
 discussion draft of a bill 
 to allow the use of limited defensive measures to identify and stop attackers. while cyber policy discussions are taking place in washington, graves said they wanted to hear from others. 
 "quite frankly we're not satisfied with the direction of where policy has gone as it relates to cybersecurity," he said. 
 monday's panel allowed for a robust discussion on cybersecurity from a policy perspective, an academic perspective and the private sector perspective. 
 in addition to graves and sinema, the other panelists were: 
 john lens, a vice president for the network and security business unit at vmware. 
 stephen pair, co-founder and ceo of bitpay. 
 peter swire, the huang professor of law and ethics in the scheller college of business. 
 candace worley, chief technical strategist for mcafee. 
 georgia tech is a place "where government, industry and universities can come together to talk about some very, very challenging problems in the world," said stephen e. cross, the institute's executive vice president for research. 
 the institute has been developing cybersecurity solutions for more than 20 years. tech houses nearly a dozen labs and centers dedicated to cybersecurity, and has more than 450 scientists, faculty and students involved with this research. 
 georgia tech is also home to the 
 advanced technology development center 
 (atdc), the state's technology incubator. atdc is currently incubating seven companies in the cybersecurity space and assisting 33 entrepreneurs and early-stage startups statewide with entrepreneurial education in cybersecurity.

-0.4567 liberal arts a break in the baby formula supply chain 
 georgia tech experts explain how we got here and how long this shortage could last 
 a national shortage has parents and families across the country struggling to feed newborns as store shelves have been left bare of baby formula products - including many brands critical to young children with specific vulnerabilities. 
 may 27, 2022 
 - atlanta, ga 
 a national shortage has parents and families across the country struggling to feed newborns as store shelves have been left bare of baby formula products - including many brands critical to young children with specific vulnerabilities. retailers are having to ration their supplies, some parents have resorted to shipping in formula from overseas, and social media sites have been used to crowdsource goods to be shipped to parents nervous about where their children's next meal might come from. 
 georgia tech economics expert tibor besedes says it has been a perfect storm of issues to create this stress-inducing situation. 
 "like many other industries, the formula producers have faced supply chain issues with respect to ingredients and containers. waves of covid-19 infections have affected their workforce and how much formula they can produce," explained besedes. 
 the final straw that may have led to this nationwide shortage: an abbott production shutdown in february 2022 after several babies were sickened and two died from bacterial infections connected to consuming baby formula from the sturgis, michigan facility. a recall followed, and that facility is believed to make at least 20% of all formula bought by consumers nationwide. 
 "it is one of a few plants in the u.s. producing formula," said besedes. "that fact itself is a bottleneck as those few plants operating in the u.s. produce 98% of all formula sold in the u.s." 
 "the formula market has been highly concentrated for a long time," explained lindsay rose bullinger, georgia tech assistant professor of public policy. "now we're dealing with a crisis and it's hard to be proactive." 
 the overwhelming majority of those formula products are only made by four different companies, explains wendy white, a nationally known food safety expert. 
 "because infant formula is the sole source of nutrition and targeted at such a vulnerable population, it has extra regulations in the infant formula act of 1980," explains white. 
 this includes mandatory registration for any infant formula manufacturers and requirements for all formulation, processing details, and ingredient lists to be filed with the fda. 
 the regulations are critical, according to bullinger. 
 "we're trying to make a product comparable to breast milk. newborn children can't digest many of the proteins in cow's milk," she explained. 
 formula is developed by scientists in highly regulated environments for infants that are incredibly susceptible to sickness as their immune and digestive systems have just begun adapting to nourishment outside of the womb. 
 diluted or homemade options do not provide the right balance of nutrients that infants need at the most critical time of their lives. manufactured formulas are made in highly sterile environments to avoid harmful additions from getting into these mixtures. 
 "it's incredibly hard to get that right in a home environment without introducing bacteria," bullinger said. 
 those strict regulations also mean that possible scenarios to help alleviate this formula shortage have been complicated. just shipping some in from another country? not so fast. 
 "foreign manufacturers need to obtain fda approvals to begin exporting to the u.s. to make up the shortage," said besedes. "the fda is now looking at manufacturers based in countries with similar regulations to expedite their approvals and increase shipments to the u.s." 
 the first relief came from overseas within the past week - a shipment of about 70,000 pounds of formula. more foreign shipments are expected in the coming days, but the supply may only last for about a week as issues continue to compound. 
 "once there was a recall and parents heard, they started stockpiling formula," said white. the result is taking already short supplies and stretching them even thinner. 
 "the supply chain has to also deal with the unneeded bullwhip effect due to shortage gaming and hoarding behavior, making the situation even worse than what it should be," says operations management associate professor morvarid rahmani. 
 white also says that 50% of the infant formula in america is purchased through government subsidies. 
 states who provide this assistance often sign exclusive contracts with one of these four formula manufacturers. abbott carries the contract in nearly two-thirds of u.s. states - complicating the purchases for families with infants in those locations. 
 "families in communities that are economically disenfranchised may be disproportionately affected," explained bullinger. "but even if you have the money, if you cannot buy formula how else are you supposed to feed an infant." 
 families who rely on supplemental nutrition assistance program (snap, also commonly known as food stamps) or supplemental nutrition for women, infants, and children (wic) may not be able to choose which brand of formula they can receive. they can only get the formula their state has a contract with. if it is out, they may just be out of luck. 
 some of the most hard-to-find infant formulas are the specialized products developed for newborns with milk allergies or other digestive issues. there's a special emphasis on sourcing those products for parents in need. 
 so how much longer could this shortage impact american consumers? at least a few weeks, georgia tech's experts say. 
 "abbott is estimating that it'll take about two weeks to get production to resume but another 6-8 weeks to get formula back on supermarket shelves," says white. 
 that means the closed facility should be open in late may with production back up to full speed sometime in august. limited diversity in the market has left parents in a bind. 
 "a shortage could be alleviated by increasing output of other plants and manufacturers, which is being done, but it is difficult to replace an entire plant," explained besedes. 
 "ramping up production has been difficult because of shortages in labor and ingredients as well as production scheduling challenges," explained rahmani. 
 some desperate parents have had to resort to extreme measures. but pediatricians have said infants should only be fed formula or breast milk. anything else is likely deficient. using alternative feeding methods could lead to long-term problems. 
 "there is a risk that a shortage will mean babies will not be getting the nutrition they need to develop. that could lead to a range of health problems affecting their physical growth and brain development," explained senior research engineer maureen linden from georgia tech's center for inclusive design and innovation. 
 "consumers should listen to their pediatricians and other experts and follow their advice. pediatricians may have available samples they can give out," said besedes. 
 they can also offer advice for alternative baby formula (to the one in shortage) which is available. medical experts are strongly advising against diluting formula or trying to recreate it at home which could cause long-lasting damage. 
 "we may see a rise in the rate of developmental disabilities in the age group that is presently reliant on formula - those presently six months or less," says linden. 
 nutrition is the most important thing in an infant's life. it's the number one priority - making sure we are feeding them and they are developing," explained bullinger. 
 that's why infants often get so many checkups - to make sure they are growing and gaining weight. proper nutrition is critical for that to happen. 
 in the meantime, consumers can take their own action. white says it's worth trying to buy online or shopping around at different stores. 
 the federal government has relaxed regulations for snap and wic recipients to be able to get products with increased flexibility. 
 the white house has also invoked the defense production act which is aimed to help manufacturers ramp up output quickly. 
 "those companies will have first dibs at materials and ingredients that are needed to make formula," said bullinger. 
 "this shortage should be temporary, as demand settles, and supply is replenished from the reopened abbott plant and fda-approved imports," says white. 
 regardless, georgia tech experts have said we should have seen this coming and could have been better prepared and quicker to act - particularly for the sake of the youngest among us. 
 "the fda, biden's administration, and baby formula manufacturers have been slow in taking actions during the past few months to prevent that. this crisis could have been prevented by timely actions," said rahmani. 
 "infants always get the short end of the stick. they can't speak for themselves," said bullinger.

-0.9968 STEM chemical octopus catches sneaky cancer clues, trace glycoproteins 
 tiny cancer signals of the glycoprotein sort evade detection, but they'll have a hard time dodging the new "chemical octopus."

 cancer drops sparse chemical hints of its presence early on, but unfortunately, many of them are in a class of biochemicals that could not be detected thoroughly, until now. 
 researchers at the georgia institute of technology have 
 engineered a chemical trap 
 that exhaustively catches what are called glycoproteins, including minuscule traces that have previously escaped detection. 
 glycoproteins are protein molecules bonded with sugar molecules, and they're very common in all living things. glycoproteins come in myriad varieties and sizes and make up important cell structures like cell receptors. they also wander around our bodies in secretions like 
 mucus 
 or  hormones . 
 but some glycoproteins are very, very rare and can serve as an early signal, or 
 biomarker , indicating there's something wrong in the body - like cancer. existing methods to reel in glycoproteins for laboratory examination are relatively new and have had big holes in their nets, so many of these molecules, especially those very rare ones produced by cancer, have tended to slip by. 
 cancerous traces 
 "these tiny traces are critically important for early disease detection," said principal investigator ronghu wu, 
 a professor in georgia tech's school of chemistry and biochemistry . "when cancer is just getting started, aberrant glycoproteins are produced and secreted into body fluids such as blood and urine. often their abundances are extremely low, but catching them is urgent." 
 this new chemical trap, which took georgia tech 
 chemists several years to develop 
 and is based on a 
 boronic acid , has proven extremely effective in lab tests including on cultured human cells and mouse tissue samples. 
 "this method is very universal," said first author haopeng xiao, a graduate research assistant. "we get over 1,000 glycoproteins in a really small lab sample." 
 in comparison tests with existing methods, the chemical trap, a complex molecular construction reminiscent of an octopus, captured exponentially more glycoproteins, especially more of those trace glycoproteins. 
 wu, xiao and weixuan chen, a former georgia tech postdoctoral researcher, who was also first author of the study alongside xiao, 
 published their results in the journal 
 nature communications . 
 the research was funded by the national science foundation and the national institutes of health. 
 boronic bungles 
 for chemistry whizzes, here's a short summary of 
 how the researchers made the octopus . they took a good thing and doubled then tripled down on it. 
 those who recall high school chemistry class may still know what boric acid is, as do people who use it to kill roaches. its chemical structure is an atom of boron bonded with three hydroxyl groups (h 3 bo 3 ). 
 boronic acids are a family of organic compounds that build on boric acid. there are many members of the 
 boronic acid 
 family, and they tend to bond well with glycoproteins, but their bonds can be less reliable than needed. 
 "most boronic acids let too many low-abundance glycoproteins get away," wu said. "they can catch glycoproteins that are in high abundance but not those in low abundance, the ones that tell us more valuable things about cell development or about human disease." 
 benzoboroxole octopus 
 but the georgia tech chemists were able to leverage the strengths of boronic acids to develop a glycoprotein capturing method that works exceptionally well. 
 first, they tested several boronic acid derivatives and found that one called 
 benzoboroxole 
 strongly bound with each sugar component on the glycopeptide. (" peptide " refers to the basic chemical composition of a protein.) 
 then they stitched many benzoboroxole molecules together with other components to form a " dendrimer," which refers to the resulting branch- or tentacle-like structure . the finished large molecule resembled an octopus ready to go after those sugar components. 
 in its middle, similarly positioned to an octopus's head, was a magnetic bead, which acted as a kind of handle. once the dendrimer caught a glycoprotein, the researchers used a magnet to grab the bead and pull out their chemical octopus along with its ensnared glycopeptides (e.g. glycoproteins). 
 "then we washed the dendrimer off with a low ph solution, and we had the glycoproteins analyzed with things like mass spectrometry," wu said. 
 cancer treatments? 
 the researchers have some ideas about how medical laboratory researchers could make practical use of the new georgia tech method to detect odd biomolecules emitted by cancer, such as 
 antigens . for example, the chemical octopus could improve detection of 
 prostate-specific antigens (psa) 
 in prostate cancer screenings. 
 "psa is a glycoprotein. right now, if the level is very high, we know that the patient may have cancer, and if it's very low, we know cancer is not likely," wu said. "but there is a gray area in between, and this method could lead to much more detailed information in that gray area." 
 the researchers also believe that developers could leverage the chemical invention to produce targeted cancer treatments. immune cells could be trained to recognize the aberrant glycoproteins, track down their source cancer cells in the body and kill them. 
 the research's potential for science goes far beyond its possible future medical applications. 
 the fields of 
 genomics 
 and 
 proteomics 
 have made great strides. following in their footsteps, this new molecular trap could advance the study of the rising field of 
 glycoscience .

-0.8815 STEM cholera bacteria stab and poison enemies so predictably 
 the actions of bacteria locked in battle are nearly as calculable as a chemical reaction. 
 physicist peter yunker applies mathematical equations to enemy colonies of dueling cholera bacteria to accurately predict the speed dynamics of their phase separation into divided territories, a process similar to the separation of oil and water. the equations were originally used to describe phase separate in materials, namely mixed metals (model a equations). credit: georgia tech / rob felt 
 feb 06, 2017

 the enemies were thrown together, so the killing began. 
 brandishing harpoon-like appendages covered in poison, two armies of cholera bacteria stabbed each other, rupturing victims like water balloons. scientists at the georgia institute of technology tracked the battle over sustenance and turf mathematically to gain insights that could, someday, lead to new, targeted therapies to fight infections. 
 but dueling bacteria would not be the infectors in that scenario; they'd be the remedy. 
 conceivably, specially engineered assassin bacteria friendly to humans could kill harmful bacteria while sparing hordes of microbes that keep people healthy. by contrast, the antibiotics we use today vanquish harmful and helpful bacteria alike. 
 "if you could target harmful bacteria in the human gut, you could use engineered bacteria as a living antibiotic," said brian hammer, an 
 associate professor at georgia tech's school of biological sciences . he cautioned, "we're not anywhere near that right now." 
 calculating bacteria 
 but to harness bacteria for use in medicine or industry, or just to better understand how they thrive and spread, it's helpful to determine the consistency of their actions over time. that's where the math comes in. 
 georgia tech researchers applied to the bacteria existing physics equations developed to precisely describe the interactions of atoms and molecules. they found that those calculations could also precisely predict that two cholera armies would separate from each other into phases, like oil and water, when they met on the battlefield. 
 "the models predicted pretty much exactly when the phase separation would occur, and then we observed it happening just like the math said it would," hammer said. the predictive models were based what's called a "model a" equation. 
 "empirically, it's been used to describe metals that undergo phase separation," hammer said. "the type of curve we observed describing our results had never been used to describe living systems before." 
 hammer and georgia tech biologists 
 will ratcliff, an assistant professor , and 
 samuel brown, an associate professor , teamed up with peter yunker, an 
 assistant professor in georgia tech's school of physics 
 for the research. they published their results in 
 the journal nature communications 
 on monday, february 6, 2017. 
 first authors were hammer's former graduate student 
 biologist eryn bernardy , and brown's former postdoctoral assistant 
 luke mcnally . their research was funded by the national science foundation, the nasa exobiology program, the gordon and betty moore foundation, the wellcome trust and the human frontier science program. 
 rotting crab shells 
 cholera bacteria are commonly found in water attached with other microbes to the shells of crabs and tiny krill, and 
 people who drink that water can die 
 within hours due to the severe vomiting and diarrhea the germs cause. the impetus for doing math on dueling cholera came from how they wage turf war on crab shells, which contain a material called chitin that switches on the harpoon function in 
 vibrio cholerae . no chitin, no stabbing. 
 "i was studying this amazing biological system," hammer said, "and i was looking for a way to visualize it." ratcliff and yunker had been applying microscopy and mathematics to study the dynamics of yeast evolution and suggested hammer give the method a try. 
 but before getting to the math itself, it's important to understand a few things about 
 vibrio cholerae . first of all, most microbiologists think cholera bacteria use the harpoons to kill competing bacteria and not to destroy human cells. 
 the poisonous weapon is called a type vi secretion system (t6ss), and is common. "this harpoon system is in about one quarter of gram-negative bacteria," hammer said. "so, this bacterial dueling is going on all around you." 
 gram-negative bacteria have thinner walls, which can be punctured more easily. gram-positive bacteria have thicker walls less susceptible to the harpoons, and human cells may be even more difficult to penetrate. 
 and the stabbing mechanism is not limited to pathogens like cholera. many harmless bacteria use it, too. but more is known about the mechanism in pathogens, because harmful bacteria are more often the focus of scientific study than harmless bacteria, hammer said. 
 armed and generous 
 harpooning cholera stab randomly at all bacteria they come into contact with, including each other, but 
 vibrio cholerae 
 of the same strain are immune to each other's stabs. so, they kill their enemies but not their own kind. 
 the killing also appears to go hand in hand with cooperative social behavior. the researchers found that bacteria that are good at killing together are also good at sharing with each other and building a community. 
 it starts with creating a common pool of food. "bacteria do a lot of their digestion outside their cells," hammer said. but having all that food lying around is risky. 
 "you need a strategy for ensuring that all the effort of chewing up and digesting food benefits you and your relatives, and not someone else who comes and plunders it." when a strain of bacteria kills invaders, it preserves the fruits of its labor, and multiplies, passing on its genes. 
 brown's postdoctoral researcher luke mcnally examined the genomes of many types of bacteria (in addition to cholera) that use poison harpoons. some strains had six or seven harpoons, and some harpoons had multiple poisons. and there appeared to be a correlation between weapons and cooperation. 
 "we found that the more weaponry a bacteria strain had in its genome, the more it looked like it was apt to share," hammer said. 
 purple, red, blue 
 under the microscope, the battling bacteria strains actually did look a little like beads of oil and water separating out on a flat surface. they were stained two different colors like red and blue, so they could be told apart. 
 "we start with two strains well mixed," hammer said. "we jokingly call this the salad dressing model, because you shake oil and water, and they're well mixed, and you let it sit, and they phase separate." 
 when they're well mixed, the two strains of cholera appear as one purple mass, but as they kill each other and conquer separate territories, they divide into red blotches and blue blotches. 
 there are significant differences between how chemical and living systems operate. for example, the bacteria also reproduce and multiply; molecules don't. but the basic math that worked for materials also worked for the bacteria. 
 future applications? 
 "in your gut, a lot of useful bacteria are gram-positive," hammer said. "but there might be a small number of gram-negative bacteria messing up your gut community, and perhaps engineered bacteria with spears could get rid of just those gram-negative." 
 also, an external material like chitin, which switches the harpoon function on in cholera bacteria, could be given along with assassin bacteria to trigger their weaponry, and then deactivate it when the chitin is gone.

-0.8023 STEM colliding privacy, democracy and technology? 
 the institute for information security and privacy at georgia tech examines emerging cyber threats for 2017. 
 sep 28, 2016 
 - atlanta, ga 
 georgia tech's 2017 
 emerging cyber threats, trends and technologies 
 report highlights concerns about global manipulation of information, health care fraud, data encryption and other issues likely to affect society in the year ahead. the report, produced annually, is an expert-driven review of recent cybersecurity trends, developing research and threat considerations. 
 among the findings: 
 global information manipulation by nation-states is now widespread, causing western nations to curtail free speech and news consumers to view information cautiously. 
 health care fraud is taking off in the absence of good defenses, as the value of personal data far surpasses that of stolen credit cards. 
 cultural differences and unresolved approaches to data encryption continue to mire companies and business leaders with uncertainty and risk in north america and europe. 
 crowdsourced and open-source solutions hold promise for addressing insecure, aging electronic voting systems. 
 public proof of who is behind cyberattacks remains elusive. 
 interest is growing in computer science education, suggesting a changing tide in the nation's shortfall of information technology workers. 
 "cyberattacks today are flourishing because almost every organization conducts some portion of its business online - putting even digitally cautious consumers at risk when it is not sufficiently protected," said wenke lee, co-director of the institute for information security and privacy (iisp) and professor of computer science at georgia tech. "there is widespread reluctance to share threat information, and there's a lack of public attribution about who is responsible, making it nearly impossible for the public to defend themselves." 
 georgia tech's broad understanding of cybersecurity issues can be used to develop strategies to address a range of threats, noted bo rotoloni, co-director of iisp. 
 "under this unique combination, georgia tech can help foretell how the ‘white hats' should prepare because we continually witness how the ‘black hats' adapt," said rotoloni, director of the information and cyber sciences directorate at the georgia tech research institute, the university's applied research arm. 
 georgia tech issues the threat report each fall in conjunction with its annual 
 cyber security summit , which is taking place today in tech square. the summit brings together government, industry and academia for objective conversation about the challenges of securing information and cyber-connected systems.

-0.9938 STEM "combosquatting" attack hides in plain sight to trick computer users 
 attackers are tricking computer users with urls that are similar to those of real companies. 
 chart shows the number of combosquatted domains identified in each domain group studied. 
 oct 30, 2017 
 - atlanta, ga 
 to guard against unknowingly visiting malicious websites, computer users have been taught to double-check website urls before they click on a link. but attackers are now taking advantage of that practice to trick users into visiting website domains that contain familiar trademarks - but with additional words that change the destination to an attack site. 
 for example, attackers might register www.familiarbankname-security[.]com or www.security-familiarbankname[.]com. unwary users see the familiar bank name in the url, but the additional hyphenated word means the destination is very different from what was expected. the result could be counterfeit merchandise, stolen credentials, a malware infection - or another computer conscripted into a botnet attack. 
 the attack strategy, known as combosquatting, is a growing threat, with millions of such domains set up for malicious purposes, according to a new study scheduled to be presented october 31 at the 2017 acm conference on computer and communications security (ccs). 
 "this is a tactic that the adversaries are using more and more because they have seen that it works," said 
 manos antonakakis , an assistant professor in the 
 school of electrical and computer engineering 
 at the georgia institute of technology. "this attack is hiding in plain sight, but many people aren't computer-savvy enough to notice the difference in the urls containing familiar trademarked names." 
 researchers from georgia tech and stony brook university conducted the study, which is believed to be the first large-scale, empirical study of combosquatting. the work was supported by u.s. department of defense agencies, the national science foundation and the u.s. department of commerce. 
 combosquatting differs from its better-known relative, typosquatting, in which adversaries register variations of urls that users are likely to type incorrectly. combosquatting domains don't depend on victims making typing errors, but instead provide malicious links embedded in emails, web advertising or the results of web searches. combosquatting attackers often combine the trademarked name with a term designed to convey a sense of urgency to encourage victims to click on what appears at first glance to be a legitimate link. 
 "we have seen combosquatting used in virtually every kind of cyberattack that we know of, from drive-by downloads to phishing attacks by nation-states," said panagiotis kintis, a georgia tech graduate research assistant who is the first author of the study. "these attacks can even fool security people who may be looking at network traffic for malicious activity. when they see a familiar trademark, they may feel a false sense of comfort with it." 
 for their study, the researchers began with the 500 most popular trademarked domain names in the united states, and excluded certain combinations made up of common words. they separated the domains into 20 categories, then added two additional domains: one for for politics - the study was done before the 2016 election - and another for energy. 
 with the resulting 268 trademark-containing urls, they set out to find domain names that incorporated the trademarked name with additional words added at the start or end. they searched through six years of active and passive domain name system (dns) requests - more than 468 billion records - provided by one of the largest internet service providers in north america. 
 "the result was mind-blowing," said kintis. "we found orders of magnitude more combosquatting domains than typosquatting domains, for instance. the space for combosquatting is almost infinite because attackers can register as many domains as they want with any variation that they want. in some cases, registering a domain can cost less than a dollar." 
 in the six-year data set, the researchers found 2.7 million combosquatting domains for the 268 popular trademarks alone, and the combosquatting domains were 100 times more prevalent than typosquatting domains. the combosquatting attacks appear to be challenging to combat, with nearly 60 percent of the abusive domains in operation for more than 1,000 days - almost three years. and the number of combosquatting domains registered grew every year between 2011 and 2016. 
 among the malicious domains, the researchers discovered some that had previously been registered by legitimate companies which had combined words with their trademarks. for some reason, those companies permitted the registrations to lapse, allowing the trademark-containing domain names - which once led to legitimate sites - to be taken over by combosquatting attackers. 
 in many cases, malicious domains were re-registered multiple times after they had expired, suggesting an improvement in "internet hygiene" may be needed to address this threat. 
 "imagine what happens in a city when the garbage isn't picked up regularly," antonakakis said. "the garbage builds up and you have diseases develop. nobody collects the garbage domains on the internet, because it's nobody's job. but there should be an organization that would collect these malicious domains so they cannot be reused to infect people." 
 more stringent anti-fraud screening of persons registering domains would also help, he added. "we don't want to prevent legitimate users from getting onto the internet, but there are warning signs of potential fraud that registrars could detect." 
 what can be done by ordinary computer users and the organizations where they work? 
 "users unfortunately have to be better educated than they are now," antonakakis said. "organizations can provide training in the on-boarding process that takes place for new employees, and they can protect their network perimeters to prevent users from being exposed to known combosquatting domains. more needs to be done to address this growing cybersecurity problem." 
 in addition to those already mentioned, the research included najmeh miramirkhani and nick nikiforakis from stony brook university; charles lever, yizheng chen and rosa romero-gómez from georgia tech, and nikolaos pitropakis from london south bank university.

-0.8517 STEM common nanoparticle has subtle effects on oxidative stress genes 
 a nanoparticle commonly used in food and other products can have subtle effects on the activity of genes expressing enzymes that address oxidative stress inside two types of cells. 
 may 10, 2016 
 - atlanta, ga 
 a nanoparticle commonly used in food, cosmetics, sunscreen and other products can have subtle effects on the activity of genes expressing enzymes that address oxidative stress inside two types of cells. while the titanium dioxide (tio 2 ) nanoparticles are considered non-toxic because they don't kill cells at low concentrations, these cellular effects could add to concerns about long-term exposure to the nanomaterial. researchers at the georgia institute of technology used high-throughput screening techniques to study the effects of titanium dioxide nanoparticles on the expression of 84 genes related to cellular oxidative stress. their work found that six genes, four of them from a single gene family, were affected by a 24-hour exposure to the nanoparticles. the effect was seen in two different kinds of cells exposed to the nanoparticles: human hela cancer cells commonly used in research, and a line of monkey kidney cells. polystyrene nanoparticles similar in size and surface electrical charge to the titanium dioxide nanoparticles did not produce a similar effect on gene expression. "this is important because every standard measure of cell health shows that cells are not affected by these titanium dioxide nanoparticles," said christine payne, an associate professor in georgia tech's school of chemistry and biochemistry. "our results show that there is a more subtle change in oxidative stress that could be damaging to cells or lead to long-term changes. this suggests that other nanoparticles should be screened for similar low-level effects." the research was reported online may 6 in the 
 journal of physical chemistry c . the work was supported by the national institutes of health (nih) through the hercules center at emory university, and by a vasser woolley fellowship. titanium dioxide nanoparticles help make powdered donuts white, protect skin from the sun's rays and reflect light in painted surfaces. in concentrations commonly used, they are considered non-toxic, though several other studies have raised concern about potential effects on gene expression that may not directly impact the short-term health of cells. to determine whether the nanoparticles could affect genes involved in managing oxidative stress in cells, payne and colleague melissa kemp - an associate professor in the wallace h. coulter department of biomedical engineering at georgia tech and emory university - designed a study to broadly evaluate the nanoparticle's impact on the two cell lines. working with graduate students sabiha runa and dipesh khanal, they separately incubated hela cells and monkey kidney cells with titanium oxide at levels 100 times less than the minimum concentration known to initiate effects on cell health. after incubating the cells for 24 hours with the tio 2 , the cells were lysed and their contents analyzed using both pcr and western blot techniques to study the expression of 84 genes associated with the cells' ability to address oxidative processes. payne and kemp were surprised to find changes in the expression of six genes, including four from the peroxiredoxin family of enzymes that helps cells degrade hydrogen peroxide, a byproduct of cellular oxidation processes. too much hydrogen peroxide can create oxidative stress which can damage dna and other molecules. the effect measured was significant - changes of about 50 percent in enzyme expression compared to cells that had not been incubated with nanoparticles. the tests were conducted in triplicate and produced similar results each time. "one thing that was really surprising was that this whole family of proteins was affected, though some were up-regulated and some were down-regulated," kemp said. "these were all related proteins, so the question is why they would respond differently to the presence of the nanoparticles." the researchers aren't sure how the nanoparticles bind with the cells, but they suspect it may involve the protein corona that surrounds the particles. the corona is made up of serum proteins that normally serve as food for the cells, but adsorb to the nanoparticles in the culture medium. the corona proteins have a protective effect on the cells, but may also serve as a way for the nanoparticles to bind to cell receptors. titanium dioxide is well known for its photo-catalytic effects under ultraviolet light, but the researchers don't think that's in play here because their culturing was done in ambient light - or in the dark. the individual nanoparticles had diameters of about 21 nanometers, but in cell culture formed much larger aggregates. in future work, payne and kemp hope to learn more about the interaction, including where the enzyme-producing proteins are located in the cells. for that, they may use hyper-tau, a reporter protein they developed to track the location of hydrogen peroxide within cells. the research suggests a re-evaluation may be necessary for other nanoparticles that could create subtle effects even though they've been deemed safe. "earlier work had suggested that nanoparticles can lead to oxidative stress, but nobody had really looked at this level and at so many different proteins at the same time," payne said. "our research looked at such low concentrations that it does raise questions about what else might be affected. we looked specifically at oxidative stress, but there may be other genes that are affected, too." those subtle differences may matter when they're added to other factors. "oxidative stress is implicated in all kinds of inflammatory and immune responses," kemp noted. "while the titanium dioxide alone may just be modulating the expression levels of this family of proteins, if that is happening at the same time you have other types of oxidative stress for different reasons, then you may have a cumulative effect." seed funding for the research came from the hercules: exposome research center (niehs: p30 es019776) at the rollins school of public health, emory university, nih grant dp2od006483-01 and a vasser woolley faculty fellowship. the content is solely the responsibility of the authors and does not necessarily represent the official views of the national institutes of health. citation : sabiha runa, dipesh khanal, melissa l. kemp, christine k. payne, "tio2 nanoparticles alter the expression of peroxiredoxin anti-oxidant genes," (journal of physical chemistry c, 2016).

-0.9736 STEM computer simulations shed light on the milky way's missing red giants 
 simulations provide test of why the center of the milky way has no visible older stars. 
 a sequence of snap shots based on a simulation of a red giant entering and exiting a clump in a fragmenting accretion disk. in this case, it takes 4 days for the star to travel through the clump (each .1 unit of time is approximately 1 hour). 
 jun 07, 2016 
 - atlanta, ga 
 new computer simulations from the georgia institute of technology provide a conclusive test for a hypothesis of why the center of the milky way appears to be filled with young stars but has very few old ones. according to the theory, the remnants of older, red giant stars are still there - they just aren't bright enough to be detected with telescopes. the 
 georgia tech simulations 
 investigate the possibility that these red giants were dimmed after they were stripped of 10s of percent of their mass millions of years ago during repeated collisions with an accretion disk at the galactic center. the very existence of the young stars, seen in astronomical observations today, is an indication that such a gaseous accretion disk was present in the galactic center because the young stars are thought to have formed from it as recently as a few million years ago. the study is published in the june edition of 
 the astrophysical journal . it is the first to run computer simulations on the theory, which was introduced in 2014. astrophysicists in georgia tech's college of sciences created models of red giants similar to those that are supposedly missing from the galactic center - stars that are more than a billion years old and 10s of times larger in size than the sun. they put them through a computerized version of a wind tunnel to simulate collisions with the gaseous disk that once occupied much of the space within .5 parsecs of the galactic center. they varied orbital velocities and the disk's density to find the conditions required to cause significant damage to the red giant stars. "red giants could have lost a significant portion of their mass only if the disk was very massive and dense," said tamara bogdanovic, the georgia tech assistant professor who co-led the study. "so dense, that gravity would have already fragmented the disk on its own, helping to form massive clumps that became the building blocks of a new generation of stars." the simulations suggest that each of the red giant stars orbited its way into and through the disk as many as dozens of times, sometimes taking as long as days to weeks to complete a single pass-through. mass was stripped away with each collision as the star blistered the fragmenting disk's surface. according to former georgia tech undergraduate student thomas forrest kieffer, the first author on the paper, it's a process that would have taken place 4 to 8 million years ago, which is the same age as the young stars seen in the center of the milky way today. "the only way for this scenario to take place within that relatively short time frame," kieffer said, "was if, back then, the disk that fragmented had a much larger mass than all the young stars that eventually formed from it - at least 100 to 1,000 times more mass." the impacts also likely lowered the kinetic energy of the red giant stars by at least 20 to 30 percent, shrinking their orbits and pulling them closer to the milky way's black hole. at the same time, the collisions may have torqued the surface and spun up the red giants, which are otherwise known to rotate relatively slowly in isolation. "we don't know very much about the conditions that led to the most recent episode of star formation in the galactic center or whether this region of the galaxy could have contained so much gas," bogdanovic said. "if it did, we expect that it would presently house under-luminous red giants with smaller orbits, spinning more rapidly than expected. if such population of red giants is observed, among a small number that are still above the detection threshold, it would provide direct support for the star-disk collision hypothesis and allow us to learn more about the origins of the milky way." the paper, " can star-disk collisions explain the missing red giants problem in the galactic center ," was published on june 1. this research was funded, in part, by the alfred p. sloan foundation (grant # br2013-016) and the national science foundation (ast-1333360).

-0.9956 STEM coskun gets $50,000 pilot grant from spore to study cell signaling in lung cancer 
 petit institute researcher collaborating with emory clinicians to enable personalized precision medicine 
 cell signaling in action.   - photo provided by ahmet coskun

 ahmet coskun is trying to solve a molecular mystery: he wants to know why some patients don't respond to a lung cancer drug that has shown otherwise promising results. he hopes understanding why will help his team develop tools that will enable personalized precision therapies in the future. 
 "most patients are responding to this drug very well, but it fails in some patients, and why it fails is a mystery," said coskun, an assistant professor in the wallace h. coulter department of biomedical engineering at georgia tech and emory university and a researcher in the petit institute for bioengineering and bioscience at georgia tech. 
 coskun aims to take a detailed look at cellular communication and decision-making, to closely visualize cell signaling and develop a new metric to define how cells respond to drugs for lung cancer therapy. to help him get started, the emory lung cancer spore group is awarding him $50,000 over the next year. 
 "our research will result in a molecular screening platform for imaging signaling proteins of human cell cultures and tissues," said coskun, who plans to decipher the role of cellular signals and explain how different cells coordinate signaling to achieve healthy or abnormal results, specifically in patients with non-small cell lung cancer. 
 this year, about 200,000 adults in the united states will be diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer, the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the world. about 15 percent of those people have an epidermal growth factor receptor mutation in their cancer. 
 epidermal growth factor receptor, or egfr, is a protein involved in cell signaling. when it works correctly, it helps control cell division. but when it becomes mutated, as it does in some lung cancer cells, it causes rapid cell growth, helping the cancer spread. 
 for lung cancer patients with the egfr mutation, there is a measure of hope thanks to a drug developed by emory university several years ago. in a 2017 clinical study led by emory researcher suresh ramalingam, patients experienced substantial improvement when treated with an egfr inhibitor called osimertinib, compared to those who received the standard of care. 
 the drug is designed to inhibit egfr's haywire signaling activity in cancer. as coskun noted, though, it doesn't work well for every patient. it's because no two patient tumors are exactly alike - each tumor microenvironment is unique. there are multiple biomarkers and multiple potential targets for cancer drugs to attack. so, inhibiting one protein like egfr won't always make a difference, coskun said. 
 "the standard clinical techniques are limited to focusing on a single marker," said coskun, who is using multiplex cellular imaging, a technology that allows detection of multiple markers. "recent advances in these systems allow visualization of a larger number of markers - up to 30 unique targets. we intend to develop automated, multiplexed platforms to detect numerous markers and to feed the information into an algorithm to diagnose patients and predict their response to therapies." 
 clearly identifying other markers could pave the way for combination therapies with other inhibitor drugs to block other cancer signaling pathways - together, they're a more comprehensive approach to attacking the disease. the ability to look at 30 different proteins or markers - potential drug targets - at one time, in a single cell, wasn't possible before because the technology didn't exist. 
 "the emerging technology that we have developed here at georgia tech and emory allow rapid and high-content signaling network studies in cells and tissues," coskun said. 
 essentially, researchers combine technologies to create a complete molecular profile of a patient's cancer at the single cell level. coskun's team uses microfluidic instruments to acquire microscopic images and then super computers are used to process and visualize complex cellular maps. 
 "these maps will enable personalized precision therapies," coskun said. "that is our goal." 
 coskun and his team will work under the mentorship of ramalingam, executive director of the winship cancer institute at emory and co-lead of the lung cancer spore, a specialized program of research excellence created in 2019 with a $9.7 million national cancer institute grant. it's one of four spore grants in the u.s. focused on lung cancer.

 a new study shows the diversity and resourcefulness of vibrio cholerae, the organism behind the disease cholera.

 in humans, cholera is among the world's most deadly diseases, killing as many as 140,000 persons a year, according to world health organization statistics. but in aquatic environments far away from humans, the same bacterium attacks neighboring microbes with a toxic spear - and often steals dna from other microorganisms to expand its own capabilities. a new study of more than 50 samples of 
 vibrio cholerae 
 isolated from both patients and the environment demonstrates the diversity and resourcefulness of the organism. in the environment, the cholera bacterium is commonly found attached to chitin, a complex sugar used by aquatic creatures such as crabs and zooplankton to form protective shells. in the wild, most strains of cholera can degrade the shells for use as food, and the new study showed how the presence of chitin can signal the bacteria - which have receptors for the material - to produce behaviors very different from those seen in human disease. among the cholera strains studied, less than a quarter were able to take up dna from other sources. almost all of the samples taken from the environment were able to kill other bacteria - a phenomenon called "bacterial dueling" - but just 14 percent of the bacterial pathogen strains isolated from humans had that capability. "it's a dog-eat-dog world out there even for bacteria," said brian hammer, an associate professor in the school of biology at the georgia institute of technology. "bacteria such as 
 vibrio cholerae 
 sense and respond to their surroundings, and they use that information to turn on and off the genes that benefit them in the specific environments in which they find themselves." the research, supported by the national science foundation and the gordon and betty moore foundation, provides information that could lead to development of better therapeutic agents against the disease, which is found in densely-populated areas with limited sanitation and clean water. the research was done with assistance from the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc), and was reported online march 4 in the journal 
 applied and environmental microbiology . in humans, the cholera bacteria produce a diarrheal disease that can kill untreated patients in just a few hours. the deadly effects of the disease, however, are actually caused by a virus that infects the 
 vibrio cholerae 
 strains found in humans. the toxin carried by the virus helps spread the disease among humans, but cholera strains quickly lose the virus and adapt other competitive mechanisms in the environment. to study how cholera regulates these adaptations, georgia tech graduate student eryn bernardy obtained nearly 100 samples of cholera bacteria from a variety of sources globally, including one originally isolated from a 1910 saudi arabian outbreak of the disease. she then studied 53 of the samples for their ability to (1) degrade chitin, (2) take up dna from the environment, and (3) kill other bacteria by poking them with a poisoned spear. colonies of each strain were grown in petri plates containing chitin material. the strains able to digest the material produced a clear ring showing that they had broken down the chitin in the agar growth medium. only three of the cholera colonies failed to degrade the chitin. to study their ability to take up dna, bacterial cells were grown on crab shells, then exposed to raw dna containing a gene for antibiotic resistance. the cells were scraped off the shells and placed onto agar plates containing an antibiotic that would normally kill the bacteria. colonies that survived showed they had taken up the genetic material. to study their ability to compete with other bacteria, each cholera strain was placed into contact with a billion or so 
 e. coli 
 cells on petri plates. after a few hours in contact, the researchers counted the number of 
 e. coli 
 remaining. some cholera strains were able to kill nearly all of the 
 e. coli 
 cells, reducing their numbers to a few hundred thousand. "we found a very sharp difference between the clinical isolates and the environmental isolates," hammer said. "for example, most of the isolates that came out of patients either couldn't kill other bacteria, or were carefully controlling that behavior. patient isolates have a very different way of competing inside the human body. they use the virus-encoded toxin to cause the diarrheal disease and remove their competitors from the intestine." with help from cdc scientists, the researchers correlated the behavior of each strain with their unique dna sequences. they also examined the strains for the presence of the toxin used to cause disease. to deduce the rules governing the bacterium's behavior, hammer and his lab have been studying cholera for the last 15 years, starting with a single strain first isolated in peru in the early 1990s. when a cholera outbreak began in haiti after the 2010 earthquake, his lab worked with the cdc to isolate these new strains. in further study, hammer was surprised to find that the 2010 haitian strains were less capable than the 1991 peruvian variety. "we were very surprised to find that most of the haiti strains did not behave like the one we had been studying for years," he said. "this was a reminder to us that we needed to embrace the diversity of the organisms we've been studying. we thought this would be an opportune time to start looking at how diverse vibrio cholerae really is." hammer compared the diversity of the cholera strains to the diversity of humans, who increasingly receive personalized health care. "in humans, one size doesn't fit all for patient care," he said. "for cholera, the behavior is personalized for each strain. understanding this will be useful in the development of future therapeutics, and we're hopeful that knowing how these bacteria interact with other organisms in complex communities will lead us to things that can truly benefit humans." in addition to those already mentioned, the study included maryann a. turnsek and cheryl l. tarr from the cdc. georgia tech undergraduate sarah k. wilson from the hammer lab, another author on the paper, is now a ph.d. student at the university of wisconsin-madison. this material is based upon work supported by the gordon and betty moore foundation and national science foundation grant no. 1149925. any opinions, findings, and conclusions or recommendations expressed in this material are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of the national science foundation or the moore foundation. citation : eryn e. bernardy, et al., "diversity of clinical and environmental isolates of vibrio cholerae in natural transformation and contact-dependent bacterial killing indicative of type vi secretion system activity," (applied and environmental microbiology, 2016).

-0.8543 STEM create dedicated pandemic clinics now to address covid-19 
 covid-19 needs pandemic clinics focused on treating it and keeping it away from non-covid patients. 
 helping teleworkers stay safe. 
 mar 25, 2020 
 - atlanta, ga 
 covid-19 has caught pinar keskinocak well prepared. for years, she has studied how societies manage pandemics, and how outbreaks overtax the health care system and wrack supply chains to worsen pandemics. here she shares her insights. 
 empty classrooms and supermarket shelves marked the beginning of the covid-19 pandemic. but keskinocak expects more signs of the times to come - such as pop-up pandemic clinics and the shortage and rationing of medical supplies beyond masks and ventilators. 
 keskinocak is the 
 director of the center for health and humanitarian systems at the georgia institute of technology , which studies how government and private sectors can cooperate to handle health and humanitarian crises. and she is william w. george chair and professor in georgia tech's h. milton stewart school of industrial and systems engineering. 
 in previous research, keskinocak's team created a model that accurately ran the course of the 1918 spanish flu pandemic, and when covid-19 struck, her team was already in the middle of modeling how special clinics could significantly slow a pandemic. in the meantime, temporary clinics in wuhan, china, appear to have validated her model. 
 healthcare expansion now 
 the surge of covid-19 patients pushed italy's health care system into a very ugly crisis, and the u.s. needs to take measures now to handle similar patient surges. pandemics often strike in two waves or more, and the second is usually the worst, so measures need to be lasting, keskinocak said. 
 even without covid-19, the u.s. healthcare system has been under strain. emergency rooms are often overcrowded; it takes a long time to schedule an appointment, and there is a chronic shortage of nursing staff. 
 [ read keskinocak's guest op-ed in the new york daily news: covid clinics now ] 
 "we need to expand capacity and unleash creative flexibility in our healthcare systems. we should use more telemedicine and create self-service stations for testing. i would particularly like to see specialized covid-19 clinics established now," keskinocak said. 
 "special clinics could be separate spaces in existing facilities or standalone facilities. as covid-19 spreads, we expect a lot more people with cold- and flu-like symptoms to seek testing and care. the healthcare capacities are just not there for a business as usual approach, and taking it could harm patients by delaying care and increasing risk of infection." 
 gathering covid-19 patients in tight spaces like waiting rooms with other patients would increase the coronavirus' spread, and patients with preexisting conditions could face mortal threat. contagion could also spread into hospitals. 
 "dedicated pandemic clinics could implement targeted hygiene, air filtration, and specialized protective equipment beyond masks and gloves for healthcare workers. they can tailor workflows to test and care for patients quickly and effectively and keep them away from other patients and staff," keskinocak said. 
 payment needs to be easy, too, including financing the uninsured. in the middle of a public health emergency, it is vital to not get bogged down by restrictions meant for normal times. 
 potentially dangerous shortages 
 toilet paper will make a comeback in supermarkets, but in its place, life-saving medications could become perilously scarce. countries need to act now to prevent this from compounding the covid-19 crisis. 
 "dwindling availability of hospital beds, ventilators, and personal protective equipment like masks and gloves during a patient surge - those are the obvious things. but we could also see shortages of items like asthma medication or antidepressants. worst case, even food supplies could run low," keskinocak said. 
 [ read keskinocak's guest op-ed in the hill: medical supply chain dangers ] 
 here's how shortages work and can lead to price gouging and also rationing. the latter can have good effects. 
 "shortages are the result of supply-demand imbalance caused by either an unexpected increase in demand or unexpected decrease in supply or both. shortages are common in crises such as natural disasters or health emergencies. but given the worldwide slowdown of economic activity in pandemics, disruptions could get much worse this time," keskinocak said. 
 "supply chains are actually intricate webs of multiple parts that span the globe. pandemics damage many of those parts, and it can take time to recover. this creates a more serious and worrisome imbalance between supply and demand." 
 toilet paper will return because people fear-hoard it in a panic but consume it at normal rates. when the panic runs its course, demand slows back down to the actual rate of consumption and its normal supply chain, which is relatively simple, catches up. 
 "with medicine and healthcare services and supplies, the increase in demand is typically already in line with consumption, so a shortage in supply or increase in demand can create a supply-demand gap that continues for a long time," keskinocak said. "medical supply chains are also very complex and fragile." 
 future vaccine distribution 
 in normal times, most supply chains work at a plodding pace, and when crisis strikes, it is tough to ramp them up due to expensive equipment, complex logistics, and strict regulations, particularly in health care. even temporary shortages of medicines and medical devices can have consequences for patients who need them. 
 "if shortages become serious, rationing - with a priority allocation to those most in need - can help balance demand and supply for critical items like medications." 
 once created and approved, the production of vaccines or antivirals for covid-19 will ramp up slowly and could be in short supply at first. decision-makers need plan investments now in the supply chains necessary for their effective distribution. 
 this will include painful, necessary decisions like prioritizing first doses for healthcare workers, people with pre-existing conditions, and the elderly. the current system of restocking vaccines in the u.s. after initial distribution 
 also has serious gaps that need fixing

-0.8983 STEM create dedicated pandemic clinics now to address covid-19 
 covid-19 needs pandemic clinics focused on treating it and keeping it away from non-covid patients. 
 pinar keskinocak, william w. george chair and professor; director of the center for health and humanitarian systems 
 mar 25, 2020 
 - atlanta, ga 
 covid-19 has caught pinar keskinocak well prepared. for years, she has studied how societies manage pandemics, and how outbreaks overtax the health care system and wrack supply chains to worsen pandemics. here she shares her insights. 
 empty classrooms and supermarket shelves marked the beginning of the covid-19 pandemic. but keskinocak expects more signs of the times to come - such as pop-up pandemic clinics and the shortage and rationing of medical supplies beyond masks and ventilators. 
 keskinocak is the 
 director of the center for health and humanitarian systems at the georgia institute of technology , which studies how government and private sectors can cooperate to handle health and humanitarian crises. and she is william w. george chair and professor in georgia tech's h. milton stewart school of industrial and systems engineering. 
 in previous research, keskinocak's team created a model that accurately ran the course of the 1918 spanish flu pandemic, and when covid-19 struck, her team was already in the middle of modeling how special clinics could significantly slow a pandemic. in the meantime, temporary clinics in wuhan, china, appear to have validated her model. 
 healthcare expansion now 
 the surge of covid-19 patients pushed italy's health care system into a very ugly crisis, and the u.s. needs to take measures now to handle similar patient surges. pandemics often strike in two waves or more, and the second is usually the worst, so measures need to be lasting, keskinocak said. 
 even without covid-19, the u.s. healthcare system has been under strain. emergency rooms are often overcrowded; it takes a long time to schedule an appointment, and there is a chronic shortage of nursing staff. 
 [ read keskinocak's guest op-ed in the new york daily news: covid clinics now ] 
 "we need to expand capacity and unleash creative flexibility in our healthcare systems. we should use more telemedicine and create self-service stations for testing. i would particularly like to see specialized covid-19 clinics established now," keskinocak said. 
 "special clinics could be separate spaces in existing facilities or standalone facilities. as covid-19 spreads, we expect a lot more people with cold- and flu-like symptoms to seek testing and care. the healthcare capacities are just not there for a business as usual approach, and taking it could harm patients by delaying care and increasing risk of infection." 
 gathering covid-19 patients in tight spaces like waiting rooms with other patients would increase the coronavirus' spread, and patients with preexisting conditions could face mortal threat. contagion could also spread into hospitals. 
 "dedicated pandemic clinics could implement targeted hygiene, air filtration, and specialized protective equipment beyond masks and gloves for healthcare workers. they can tailor workflows to test and care for patients quickly and effectively and keep them away from other patients and staff," keskinocak said. 
 payment needs to be easy, too, including financing the uninsured. in the middle of a public health emergency, it is vital to not get bogged down by restrictions meant for normal times. 
 potentially dangerous shortages 
 toilet paper will make a comeback in supermarkets, but in its place, life-saving medications could become perilously scarce. countries need to act now to prevent this from compounding the covid-19 crisis. 
 "dwindling availability of hospital beds, ventilators, and personal protective equipment like masks and gloves during a patient surge - those are the obvious things. but we could also see shortages of items like asthma medication or antidepressants. worst case, even food supplies could run low," keskinocak said. 
 [ read keskinocak's guest op-ed in the hill: medical supply chain dangers ] 
 here's how shortages work and can lead to price gouging and also rationing. the latter can have good effects. 
 "shortages are the result of supply-demand imbalance caused by either an unexpected increase in demand or unexpected decrease in supply or both. shortages are common in crises such as natural disasters or health emergencies. but given the worldwide slowdown of economic activity in pandemics, disruptions could get much worse this time," keskinocak said. 
 "supply chains are actually intricate webs of multiple parts that span the globe. pandemics damage many of those parts, and it can take time to recover. this creates a more serious and worrisome imbalance between supply and demand." 
 toilet paper will return because people fear-hoard it in a panic but consume it at normal rates. when the panic runs its course, demand slows back down to the actual rate of consumption and its normal supply chain, which is relatively simple, catches up. 
 "with medicine and healthcare services and supplies, the increase in demand is typically already in line with consumption, so a shortage in supply or increase in demand can create a supply-demand gap that continues for a long time," keskinocak said. "medical supply chains are also very complex and fragile." 
 future vaccine distribution 
 in normal times, most supply chains work at a plodding pace, and when crisis strikes, it is tough to ramp them up due to expensive equipment, complex logistics, and strict regulations, particularly in health care. even temporary shortages of medicines and medical devices can have consequences for patients who need them. 
 "if shortages become serious, rationing - with a priority allocation to those most in need - can help balance demand and supply for critical items like medications." 
 once created and approved, the production of vaccines or antivirals for covid-19 will ramp up slowly and could be in short supply at first. decision-makers need plan investments now in the supply chains necessary for their effective distribution. 
 this will include painful, necessary decisions like prioritizing first doses for healthcare workers, people with pre-existing conditions, and the elderly. the current system of restocking vaccines in the u.s. after initial distribution 
 also has serious gaps that need fixing 
 to save many more lives. 
 in the meantime, social distancing is one of the best ways to protect everyone and reduce the patient surge into clinics. do it if you or anyone in your household has any cold-like symptoms.

-0.9822 STEM critical infrastructure systems are vulnerable to a new kind of cyberattack 
 engineers and computer scientists show how bad actors can exploit browser-based control systems in industrial facilities with easy-to-deploy, difficult-to-detect malware. 
 instead of a dedicated terminal or control pad running custom software specific to the device, manufacturers for industrial and infrastructure systems have turned to web-based management. now, devices often have embedded web servers. the human-machine interfaces - think keypads or control panels like this - are actually mini web browsers rendering a web page with readouts of the current status and digital visualizations of the controls. this web-based architecture is opening the door to a new kind of malware attack that could give bad actors full control of critical infrastructure or other industrial systems. 
 feb 29, 2024 
 in recent years, browser and web-based technology has become a powerful tool for operators of infrastructure and industrial systems. but it also has opened a new pathway for bad actors to seize control of these systems, potentially endangering critical power, water, and other infrastructure. georgia tech researchers have found a way to hijack the computers that control these physical systems. called programmable logic controllers (plcs), they increasingly have embedded webservers and are accessed on site via web browsers. attackers can exploit this approach and gain full access to the system. that means they could spin motors out of control, shut off power relays or water pumps, disrupt internet or telephone communication, or steal critical information. they could even launch weapons - or stop the launch of weapons. "we think there is an entirely new class of plc malware that's just waiting to happen. we're calling it web-based plc malware. and it gives you full device and physical process control," said ryan pickren, a ph.d. student in the 
 school of electrical and computer engineering 
 (ece) and the lead author of a new study describing the malware and its implications. the research team will 
 present their findings feb. 29

-0.5647 STEM cutting emissions isn't enough. we need to scrub carbon directly from the air 
 new direct air capture center will leverage georgia tech's leadership in a burgeoning field.

 - atlanta, ga 
 in 2015, nearly 200 countries agreed: they would reduce their emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases to limit warming of the earth's atmosphere to well below 2 degrees celsius. 
 the paris agreement 
 actually aims for 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels to avoid 
 potential catastrophic changes to our climate . but it's become increasingly clear to climate scientists and policymakers that just reducing emissions is not enough. 
 "we now know that we probably should have stopped putting massive amounts of co 2 
 in the air 10, 20, 30 years ago to prevent the climate from getting above 2 degrees c," said 
 chris jones , a chemical engineer at georgia tech. "now we've waited so long to reduce our emissions that we need to develop technologies that are referred to as negative emissions technologies that remove co 2 
 from the atmosphere." 
 jones was one of a handful of scientists who co-authored a 
 landmark national academies report in 2018 that outlined a variety of approaches to negative emissions. 
 agricultural practices and forest management are options - essentially using nature's ability to grab carbon dioxide out of the air and lock it away in plants and soil. but jones said we'll need quicker and more direct approaches. 
 "we could plant billions of trees to do this, but there's not enough available land. and the trees don't grow fast enough for us to do this quickly enough to slow global warming at the rate required," said jones, john f. brock iii school chair in the 
 school of chemical and biomolecular engineering (chbe) . "that's where direct air capture comes in: it's a chemical engineering way of designing a process that takes co 2 
 out of the air."

-0.9951 STEM data detectives shift suspicions in alzheimer's from usual suspect to inside villain 
 it may be high time to refocus alzheimer's research, as a new study strongly points to a biochemical culprit traditionally less pursued. 
 the brain of an alzheimer's sufferer can dramatically lose mass and shrink. in particular, center structures of the brain usually diminish early on. one such region susceptible to early and severe damage is the hippocampus, which can lead to memory loss and disorientation. illustration credit: national institute on aging, national institutes of health 
 feb 19, 2018 
 - atlanta, ga 
 the mass pursuit of a conspicuous suspect in alzheimer's disease may have held back research success for decades. now, a 
 new data analysis 
 that has untangled evidence amassed in years of alzheimer's studies encourages researchers to refocus their investigations. 
 heaps of plaque formed from amyloid-beta that accumulate in afflicted brains are what stick out under the microscope in tissue samples from 
 alzheimer's 
 sufferers, and that eye-catching junk has long seemed an obvious culprit in the disease. but data analysis of the cumulative evidence doesn't support giving so much attention to that usual suspect, according to a 
 new study from the georgia institute of technology . 
 though the bad amyloid-beta protein does appear to be an accomplice in the disease, the study has pointed to a seemingly more likely red-handed offender, another protein-gone-bad called phosphorylated 
 tau 
 (p-tau). what's more, the georgia tech data analysis of multiple studies done on mice also turned up signs that multiple biochemical actors work together in alzheimer's to tear down neurons, the cells that the brain uses to do its work. 
 suspect line-up: p-tau implicated, plaque not so much 
 and the corrupted amyloid-beta that appeared more directly in cahoots with p-tau in the sabotage of brain function was not tied up in that plaque. in the line-up of the biochemical suspects examined, principal investigator 
 cassie mitchell, an assistant professor in the wallace h. coulter department of biomedical engineering 
 at georgia tech and emory university, said the data pointed to a pecking order of culpability. 
 "the most important one would be the level of phosphorylated tau present. it had the strongest connection with cognitive decline," mitchell said. "the correlation with 
 amyloid 
 plaque 
 was there but very weak; not nearly as strong as the correlation between p-tau and cognitive decline." 
 mitchell, a biomedical informaticist, and first author colin huber statistically analyzed data gleaned from 51 existing lab studies in mice genetically augmented with a human form of alzheimer's. they published their analysis 
 in the current edition of the 
 journal of alzheimer's disease . the research was funded by the national institutes of health. 
 the crime: eviscerating the brain 
 one look at an image of an alzheimer's afflicted brain is unflinching testimony to the disease's cruelty: it 
 destroys of up to 30 percent of a brain's mass , carving out ravines and depositing piles of molecular junk, most visibly amyloid plaque. 
 the plaque builds up outside of neurons, while inside neurons, p-tau forms similar junk known as 
 neurofibrillary tangles 
 that many researchers believe push the cells to their demise. but many biochemical machinations behind alzheimer's are still unknown, and the fight to uncover them has vexed researchers for decades. 
 since the 
 first patient was diagnosed by dr. aloysius alzheimer between 1901 and 1906 , little medical progress has been made. though some available medications may mitigate symptoms somewhat, none significantly slow disease progression, let alone stop it. 
 alzheimer's mostly strikes late in life. longer lifespans in industrialized countries have ballooned the caseload, advancing the disease to a major cause of death. 
 meet the syndicate: assassin, accomplices, stooges 
 even though p-tau showed the strongest correlation with cognitive decline, and amyloid-beta only a slight correlation, that doesn't mean that p-tau is committing the crime inside cells all by itself while amyloid loiters in spaces outside of cells in large gangs, creating a distraction. mitchell's data analysis has pointed to dynamics more enmeshed than that. 
 "though the study had clear trends, it also had a good bit of variance that would indicate multiple factors influencing outcomes," mitchell said. and a particular manifestation of amyloid-beta has piqued the researchers' ire. 
 little pieces are water soluble, that is, not tied up in clumps of plaque. the data has shown that these tiny amyloids may be up to no good. after p-tau levels, the study revealed that those of soluble amyloid-beta had the second-strongest correlation with cognitive decline. 
 "lumpy amyloid-beta, the stuff we see, ironically doesn't correlate as well with cognitive decline as the soluble amyloid," mitchell said. "the amyloid you don't see is like the sugar in your tea that dissolves and hits your taste buds versus the insoluble amyloid, which is more like the sugar that doesn't dissolve and stays at the bottom of the cup." 
 some alzheimer's researchers have cited evidence indicating that free-floating amyloid helps produce the corrupted p-tau via a chain of reactions that centers around 
 gsk3 
 (glycogen synthase kinase 3), an enzyme that arms tau with phosphorous, turning it into a potential biochemical assassin. 
 incidentally, mitchell's study also looked at un-phosphorylated tau and found its levels do not correlate with cognitive decline. "that makes sense," mitchell said. "regular tau is the backbone of our neurons, so it has to be there." 
 also, p-tau is a normal part of healthy cells, but in alzheimer's it is wildly overproduced. 
 massive dataset: 528 mice rat out p-tau 
 one advantage of 
 data mining 
 51 existing studies versus doing one new lab experiment, is that the cumulative analysis adds the sample sizes of so many studies together for a whopping grand total. mitchell's analysis encompassed results from past experiments carried out on, all totaled, 528 alzheimer's mice. 
 a previous study mitchell led had already indicated that amyloid-beta plaque levels may not be the most productive target for drug development. separate reports by other researchers on failed human trials of drugs that fought plaque would seem to corroborate this. 
 mitchell's prior analysis examined lab studies that used an alzheimer's lab mouse model that did not allow for the study of p-tau. mitchell's current analysis covered studies involving a different mouse model that did allow for the observation of p-tau. 
 mitchell's latest findings have corroborated the prior study's findings on amyloid, and also added p-tau as a key suspect in cognitive decline. 
 principal investigator: my take on possible treatments 
 to arrive at the 51 studies with data suitable for inclusion in their analysis, mitchell's research team sifted through hundreds of alzheimer's research papers, and over time, mitchell has examined a few thousand herself. she has gained some impressions of how biomedical research may need to tackle the disease's slippery biochemical labyrinth. 
 "when we see multifactorial diseases, we tend to think we'll need multifactorial treatments," mitchell said. "that seems to be working well with cancer, where they combine chemotherapy with things like immunotherapy." 
 also, alzheimer's diagnosticians might be wise to their adopt cancer colleagues' early detection stance, she said, as alzheimer's disease appears to start long before amyloid-beta plaque appears and cognitive decline sets in. 
 above all, basic research should cast a broader net. 
 "i think p-tau is going to have to be a big part," she said. "and it may be time to not latch onto amyloid-beta plaque so much like the field has for a few decades."

 the poverty summit is a two-day conference held each year in atlanta that is a collaboration between seven major metro atlanta organizations, including georgia tech. it is intended to spark a deeper awareness of poverty and to create long-lasting solutions for the poor in our communities. 
 dhongde presented her research on multi-dimensional deprivation in the united states during the great recession. according to her analysis, about 15 percent of the population experiences multidimensional deprivation, exceeding the prevalence of official income poverty. some of the dimensions in which americans were most deprived included lack of education, severe housing burdens, and lack of health insurance. 
 additional findings from dhongde's analysis can be found in her recently published article in the social indicators research journal.

-0.9845 STEM diversity may be key to reducing errors in quantum computing 
 in quantum computing, as in team building, a little diversity can help get the job done better, computer scientists have found. 
 in quantum computing, as in team building, a little diversity can help get the job done better, computer scientists have discovered. a new technique, known as ensemble of diverse mappings, depends on using different qubits to create diversity in errors to mitigate the errors. 
 oct 14, 2019 
 - atlanta, ga 
 in quantum computing, as in team building, a little diversity can help get the job done better, computer scientists have discovered. 
 unlike conventional computers, the processing in quantum-based machines is noisy, which produces error rates dramatically higher than those of silicon-based computers. so quantum operations are repeated thousands of times to make the correct answer stands out statistically from all the wrong ones. 
 but running the same operation over and over again on the same qubit set may just generate the same incorrect answers that can appear statistically to be the correct answer. the solution, according to researchers at the georgia institute of technology, is to repeat the operation on different qubit sets that have different error signatures - and therefore won't produce the same correlated errors. 
 "the idea here is to generate a diversity of errors so you are not seeing the same error again and again," said 
 moinuddin qureshi, 
 a professor in georgia tech's 
 school of electrical and computer engineering , who worked out the technique with his senior ph.d. student, swamit tannu. "different qubits tend to have different error signatures. when you combine the results from diverse sets, the right answer appears even though each of them individually did not get the right answer," said tannu. 
 tannu compares the technique, known as ensemble of diverse mappings (edm), to the game show who wants to be a millionaire. contestants who aren't sure of the answer to a multiple choice question can ask the studio audience for help. 
 "it's not necessary that the majority of the people in the audience know the right answer," qureshi said. "if even 20% know it, you can identify it. if the answers go equally in the four buckets from the people who don't know, the right answer will get 40% and you can select it even if only a relatively small number of people get it right." 
 experiments with an existing noisy intermediate scale quantum (nisq) computer showed that edm improves the inference quality by 2.3 times compared to state-of-the-art mapping algorithms. by combining the output probability distributions of the diverse ensemble, edm amplifies the correct answer by suppressing the incorrect ones. 
 the edm technique, tannu admits, is counterintuitive. qubits can be ranked according to their error rate on specific types of problems, and the most logical course of action might be to use the set that's most accurate. but even the best qubits produce errors, and those errors are likely to be the same when the operation is done thousands of times. 
 choosing qubits with different error rates - and therefore different types of error - guards against that by ensuring that the one correct answer will rise above the diversity of errors. 
 "the goal of the research is to create several different versions of the program, each of which can make a mistake, but they will not make identical mistakes," tannu explained. "as long as they make diverse mistakes, when you average things out, the mistakes get canceled out and the right answer emerges." 
 qureshi compares the edm technique to team-building techniques promoted by human resource consultants. 
 "if you form a team of experts with identical backgrounds, all of them may have the same blind spot," he said, adding a human dimension. "if you want to make a team resilient to blind spots, collect a group of people who have different blind spots. as a whole, the team will be guarded against specific blind spots." 
 error rates in conventional silicon-based computers are practically negligible, about one in a thousand-trillion operations, but today's nisq quantum computers produce an error in a mere 100 operations. 
 "these are really early-stage machines in which the devices have a lot of error," qureshi said. "that will likely improve over time, but because we are dependent on matter that has extremely low energy and lacks stability, we will never get the reliability we have come to expect with silicon. quantum states are inherently about a single particle, but with silicon you are packing a lot of molecules together and averaging their activity. 
 "if the hardware is inherently unreliable, we have to write software to make the most of it," he said. "we have to take the hardware characteristics into account to make these unique machines useful." 
 the notion of running a quantum operation thousands of times to get what's likely to be the right answer at first seems counterproductive. but quantum computing is so much faster than conventional computing that nobody would object to doing a few thousand duplicate runs. 
 "the objective with quantum computers is not to take a current program and run it faster," qureshi said. "using quantum, we can solve problems that are virtually impossible to solve with even the fastest supercomputers. with several hundred qubits, which is beyond the current state of the art, we could solve problems that would take a thousand years with the fastest supercomputer." 
 added qureshi: "you don't mind doing the computation a few thousand times to get an answer like that." 
 the quantum error mitigation scheme is scheduled to be presented on oct. 14 at the 52nd annual ieee / acm international symposium on microarchitecture. the work was supported by a gift from microsoft.

-0.9847 liberal arts ecohorror: learning from mutant monsters and killer plants 
 ecohorror has given modern audiences an imaginative way to grapple not only with our primal fear of nature - but also with our complicated feelings about humanity's impact on the environment. 
 oct 26, 2023 
 since godzilla crawled out of the ocean in 1954, a monstrous consequence of the atomic age, ecohorror has given modern audiences an imaginative way to grapple not only with our primal fear of nature - but also with our complicated feelings about humanity's impact on the environment. 
 this subgenre of horror, in which people face the wrath of nature and its emissaries, has never been more popular - driven in large measure by climate change anxiety and showcase titles such as the hit video game and hbo series  the last of us. 
 for many, ecohorror offers a safe outlet for our tangled and difficult feelings about climate change. the heroine of ecohorror comic  dark fang , for example, sets out to solve the fossil fuel problem - or at least avenge beaches blighted by an oil spill - by attacking oil company ceos, said  brianna anderson , a marion l. brittain postdoctoral fellow in the school of literature, media, and communication. 
 "ecohorror is great at expressing the rage and fear that people have about environmental issues, at the inadequacy of contemporary environmental movements," anderson said. "in the 1980s, we thought everything would be okay if we recycled, right? but now we know that's absurd, that it's not even close."

-0.9971 liberal arts economist's research reveals poverty should be measured by more than income 
 new research from georgia tech economist shatakshee dhongde shows there are multiple components of poverty that more accurately describes a household's economic condition.

 - atlanta, ga 
 since social scientists and economists began measuring poverty, the definition has never strayed far from a discussion of income. 
 new research from georgia tech economist shatakshee dhongde shows there are multiple components of poverty that more accurately describes a household's economic condition. dhongde looks at "deprivation" more than simply low income, and her work finds that almost 15 percent of americans are deprived in multiple dimensions. 
 "this study approaches poverty in a new way," said dhongde, who recently published "multi-dimensional deprivation in the u.s." in the journal "social indicators research." 
 "we tried to identify what is missing in the literature on poverty, and measure deprivation in six dimensions: health, education, standard of living, security, social connections, and housing quality. when you look at deprivation in these dimensions, you have a better picture of what is really going on with households, especially in developed countries like the united states." 
 co-authored with robert haveman of the university of wisconsin-madison, the study looks at deprivation in the u.s. since the onset of the great recession, roughly 2008 to 2013. the source data for the study came from the american community survey conducted by the u.s. census bureau. 
 dhongde's and haveman's analysis showed that while the official income-based poverty rate averaged 13.2 percent from 2008 to 2013, the multi-dimensional deprivation index averaged 14.9 percent. 
 "lack of education, severe housing burden and lack of health insurance were some of the dimensions in which americans were most deprived in," dhongde said. "even though deprivation did increase during the recession, it began to improve between 2010 and 2013." 
 when placed side-by-side, the multi-dimensional deprivation index was a better reflection of the people's economic state than income alone, and the index was able to detect a more nuanced view of what might be driving people's dissatisfaction. 
 interestingly, the study showed that there was not much overlap between individuals who were income poor and those who were multi-dimensionally deprived. only 6.6 percent of the income poor were also deprived in multiple dimensions. 
 "almost 30 percent of individuals with incomes s lightly above the poverty threshold experienced multiple deprivations," dhongde said. "our analysis underscores the need to look beyond income based poverty statistics in order to fully realize the impact of the recession on individual's well-being." 
 in order for a respondent to qualify as having multi-dimensional deprivation, he or she had to have more than one indicator of deprivation, such as lack of education and severe housing burden. 
 while research on deprivation has been growing in recent years in developing countries, this is the first time such an approach has been taken with poverty in the united states. in this country, the study found the greatest deprivation in education, housing and health insurance, and the greatest prevalence of deprivation was in the southern and western u.s. the study specifically cited asian and hispanic populations as experienced the the greatest prevalence of deprivation among ethnic groups. 
 "from our analysis there are several policy recommendations that can be made," dhongde said. "first, significant reduction of deprivation can be attained by implementing new policies related to health insurance coverage, such as through the affordable care act; improving high school completion rates, especially among hispanics; and constraining housing costs. by looking at a broader set of criteria than just income, policy decisions are clearer and solutions can be more easily identified."

-0.9971 liberal arts economist's research reveals poverty should be measured by more than income 
 new research from georgia tech economist shatakshee dhongde shows there are multiple components of poverty that more accurately describes a household's economic condition.

 since social scientists and economists began measuring poverty, the definition has never strayed far from a discussion of income. 
 new research from georgia tech economist shatakshee dhongde shows there are multiple components of poverty that more accurately describes a household's economic condition. dhongde looks at "deprivation" more than simply low income, and her work finds that almost 15 percent of americans are deprived in multiple dimensions. 
 "this study approaches poverty in a new way," said dhongde, who recently published "multi-dimensional deprivation in the u.s." in the journal "social indicators research." 
 "we tried to identify what is missing in the literature on poverty, and measure deprivation in six dimensions: health, education, standard of living, security, social connections, and housing quality. when you look at deprivation in these dimensions, you have a better picture of what is really going on with households, especially in developed countries like the united states." 
 co-authored with robert haveman of the university of wisconsin-madison, the study looks at deprivation in the u.s. since the onset of the great recession, roughly 2008 to 2013. the source data for the study came from the american community survey conducted by the u.s. census bureau. 
 dhongde's and haveman's analysis showed that while the official income-based poverty rate averaged 13.2 percent from 2008 to 2013, the multi-dimensional deprivation index averaged 14.9 percent. 
 "lack of education, severe housing burden and lack of health insurance were some of the dimensions in which americans were most deprived in," dhongde said. "even though deprivation did increase during the recession, it began to improve between 2010 and 2013." 
 when placed side-by-side, the multi-dimensional deprivation index was a better reflection of the people's economic state than income alone, and the index was able to detect a more nuanced view of what might be driving people's dissatisfaction. 
 interestingly, the study showed that there was not much overlap between individuals who were income poor and those who were multi-dimensionally deprived. only 6.6 percent of the income poor were also deprived in multiple dimensions. 
 "almost 30 percent of individuals with incomes s lightly above the poverty threshold experienced multiple deprivations," dhongde said. "our analysis underscores the need to look beyond income based poverty statistics in order to fully realize the impact of the recession on individual's well-being." 
 in order for a respondent to qualify as having multi-dimensional deprivation, he or she had to have more than one indicator of deprivation, such as lack of education and severe housing burden. 
 while research on deprivation has been growing in recent years in developing countries, this is the first time such an approach has been taken with poverty in the united states. in this country, the study found the greatest deprivation in education, housing and health insurance, and the greatest prevalence of deprivation was in the southern and western u.s. the study specifically cited asian and hispanic populations as experienced the the greatest prevalence of deprivation among ethnic groups.

 reset your router to avoid effects of russian malware. 
 georgia tech research scientist charles lever 
 jun 06, 2018 
 - atlanta, ga 
 it's not every day that the federal bureau of investigation gives you an order. 
 on may 25 the 
 fbi asked members of the public 
 to turn off and turn back on their routers because of the spread of malware called "vpnfilter" created and distributed by the russian hacker network sofacy. 
 georgia tech senior research scientist charles "chaz" lever explained the damage this malware can do: 
 "this malware will affect the average user by using one of the capabilities in the malware to passively collect traffic. this can be used to harvest banking credentials or other sensitive password information that is going over the home network. additionally, your home network could be hijacked to be part of an attack on a remote entity, masking the identity of the original user and potentially putting you in the crosshairs of law enforcement." 
 in addition to just a simple reboot, lever recommended following the manufacturer's instructions on resetting the software in the device, also known as "firmware."

-0.601 liberal arts fears, promises, and emerging tech 
 what can the history of telecom infrastructure teach us about ai? 
 apr 09, 2024 
 when gloria calhoun decided to pursue a ph.d. after a career in telecommunications, she initially planned to explore how the system of overhead telephone wires was moved underground. however, when she began studying how the overhead network was built in the first place, she was surprised to find little information on the topic. "you would almost think that all those wires and poles just appeared by magic," calhoun said. as a student in the school of history and sociology, calhoun researches how the emergence of telecommunications infrastructures shaped the wire and cable industries. while digging into the history of overhead wires, she was struck by the way people created narratives about the "fears" and "promises" of emerging telegraph and telephone infrastructures - and how much they resembled the competing narratives around artificial intelligence (ai) today.   fears, promises, and public discourse    "your viewpoints on the fears and promises of technology are often shaped by what you stand to gain or lose, so they vary from person to person and by time and place," calhoun said. "with telecom infrastructure, some people's wildest hopes were realized, while others' worst fears came true. some made lots of money from the networks, and others died building them."   the fears and promises around emerging technologies range from high expectations to deep skepticism. for example, telegraph technology promised to send messages quickly, annihilating time and space in communication, calhoun explained. but others worried about how the wires degraded urban environments and how people could use the telegraph to distort the free flow of market information. with ai, the discourse is similar. we hope the technology will eliminate mundane tasks or solve problems we haven't yet cracked. however, 
 concerns remain : can we prevent bias in ai algorithms? will job replacement disrupt the labor market?   technology doesn't appear in isolation   just like telegraph debates raged through newspapers in the 1800s, the release of openai's chatgpt language learning model in 2022 unleashed a blizzard of opinions in the media, with even some prominent ai researchers 
 changing their minds 
 about the technology. what factors cause this range of opinions? calhoun explains that the technology's use, its physical presence, its symbolic meanings, and its interactions with other technologies can all affect how we perceive it. new technology is unpredictable because people often co-opt it in ways their inventors didn't intend or anticipate. its physical presence also affects how we perceive it - even if it's invisible, "which can sometimes seem like a good thing, as for urban aesthetics, but can also make it feel more sinister," calhoun said. symbolic meanings also vary, with a typical example being railroads, calhoun explained. were they a symbol of progress or a machine in the garden, as the historian leo marx famously phrased it? and finally, just as technology is often used in unintended ways, it also interacts with other tech in surprising ways. for example, low-voltage telecommunications lines aren't hazardous alone but can be lethal if crossed with high-voltage power lines, calhoun said. in a nutshell, "there is no blank slate. technology doesn't appear in isolation or operate in a vacuum. we don't go overnight from inventing new technology to having it fully deployed and understood," calhoun said. "people's perceptions change as their wants, desires, and expectations change."     the regulatory challenge   and then what? fear and promises anticipate, but regulation reacts, calhoun said. and often, there is a lag between the two.  "no matter how obvious it might be that somebody needs to do something, it's often not at all obvious who that somebody is or what they need to do," she said. calhoun explained that the main challenge for regulators is balancing competing stakeholder interests and dealing with a technology that evolves as they try to regulate it. for example, city leaders in montreal tried to move the wires underground for 30 years. the overhead system was dangerous, with wires blocking firefighters from reaching burning buildings and deteriorating poles posing a safety hazard.   "and they hemmed and hawed and dithered, and finally, the fire insurance underwriters said, 'if you don't move these wires underground, we will no longer offer casualty insurance in the city center.' and that finally moved them to start doing something about it," calhoun said. "that's a long way of saying that when the consequences of doing nothing outweigh the consequences of change, even with all the uncertainties the change may bring, that's when it usually starts to happen."   kranzberg's law   mel kranzberg, the founder of the history and sociology of technology and science program at georgia tech, published 
 kranzberg's laws 
 in 1986. the first states, "technology is neither good nor bad, nor is it neutral." "that view was evolving then, and it's the same thing we're still discussing here," calhoun said. as narratives of fears and promises play out with ai, it's impossible to label the tech itself as good or evil "because the social component of it is not the technology but the use. technologies are human productions, and humans are neither all good nor all bad. so you have to focus on how we use it more than the technology itself."   from telegraphs and telephones to social media and artificial intelligence, deploying new technologies involves a learning process of trial and error. most people will use it for good - "or at least try to," calhoun said - and just like telegraph infrastructure, ai will be another lesson to look back on and dissect when the next society-changing creation comes along. but the history of technology has already taught us at least one thing, she said.   "new tech does not simply follow a predetermined path. it increases the range of possible paths but does not dictate which we follow or what will happen next. that's up to us."

-0.9969 STEM flu vaccine supply gaps can intensify flu seasons, make pandemics deadlier 
 a tweak to our flu vaccine resupply logistics could save thousands of lives

 jan 07, 2019 
 - atlanta, ga 
 more than 50 million people died in the  spanish flu  pandemic of 1918-19. its  100th anniversary  this flu season serves as a reminder to close flu vaccine supply gaps that may be costing hundred to thousands of lives now and could cost many more when  the next "big one" strikes , researchers say. 
 u.s. flu vaccine distribution logistics could use an update, according to pinar keskinocak. the researcher at the georgia institute of technology 
 co-led a recent study 
 that compared the current approach with a proposed allocation method calculated to save many more lives in a pandemic or similarly intense influenza outbreak that taxes vaccine supplies. 
 the study's recommendations, which apply to resupplying vaccine stocks during a running outbreak, boil down to this: to put a bigger dent in the spread of flu, replenish vaccine stocks in regions where they are being used up and don't replenish them in areas where vaccines are just sitting on shelves, because few people are getting flu shots there. 
 a simple tweak 
 the tweak in the supply chain could also save thousands of lives annually in regular flu seasons in the u.s., which can be plenty deadly. a flu season can take more lives than murders in the same time period. 
 "even seasonal flu 
 kills tens of thousands of people 
 each year, so we would benefit immediately," said keskinocak, who is  william w. george chair and professor in georgia tech's h. milton stewart school of industrial and systems engineering and director for the center of health and humanitarian systems . 
 "in a pandemic, nearly no one would have natural immunity, so the death toll could be significantly high if we don't improve vaccine coverage." 
 what makes a pandemic a pandemic? the flu virus represents a mutation that human immune systems have not had a chance to build prior resistance to, thus the lack of natural immunity. when the next one strikes, in addition to the many lives saved, the researchers' recommendations could massively prevent  flu infections, secondary infections like bronchitis, hospitalizations, and unnecessarily high medical costs . 
 keskinocak, co-principal investigator 
 julie swann 
 from north carolina state university, and first author zihao li of georgia tech  published their results in the journal  plos one   in october 2018, around the start of the 2018-19 flu season. the research was supported by the harold r. and mary anne nash junior faculty endowment fund. 
 a logic breakdown 
 when a pandemic hits, or a flu season that taxes the vaccine stocks, vaccine supply may become limited but then catch up over time. when that happens, the vaccine distributors commonly take what's called the population-based approach. 
 "areas with larger populations get more vaccine, proportional to the population. it's a straightforward approach that seems fair," swann said. 
 as more vaccine becomes available over time, restocking follows the same principle, and that is where distribution logic breaks down. in some regions, few people get vaccinated, but under population-based allocation, resupply stocks go there anyway and may go to waste. meanwhile, restocking may fall short of demand elsewhere, where people are lining up for inoculations. 
 a mathematical fix 
 as a result, in a pandemic, people eager for a vaccination might not get one despite adequate vaccine production, and the resulting additional unvaccinated people are more likely to get the flu and also spread it to others. that intensifies the outbreak for the entire population. 
 the wasted vaccine stocks also drain medical finances, and the new model would releave some of that strain even in regular flu seasons. 
 "production, storage, and delivery of vaccine are costly, and unused inventory can't just be thrown away. it costs money to dispose of," keskinocak said. 
 restocking doses where they are actually being used would benefit the entire population by boosting the total number of vaccinated individuals, who would then be less likely to get sick and to infect other people. that would tamp down the flu wave for everybody. 
 a data dearth 
 leftover inventory could be slashed to about 20 percent of current levels, saving considerable costs, and the data about which areas were not resupplied could be used to identify areas where more people need encouragement to get vaccinated. 
 "the data would tell you where you need continued education about the importance of vaccination, and some of the money saved from unnecessary resupplying could be invested in public health campaigns," said swann, who collaborated with the centers for disease control and prevention during the 
 2009-10 h1n1 swine flu pandemic. 
 but the needed data is missing at present in the u.s. vaccine distribution system. 
 "surprisingly few states have systems in place that tell them how much vaccine has been administered where and how much is still left in inventory at provider locations," swann said. 
 the next "big one" 
 the next "big one" flu pandemic will sneak up on humanity someday. 
 ultimately, the best way to cut its death toll by more than half and save possibly hundreds of thousands of lives will be for virtually everyone to get vaccinated against influenza annually. currently,  fewer than 50 percent  of americans do. 
 the 1918-19 outbreak, which may have consisted of multiple concurrent influenzas, killed 678,000 people in the u.s. other " big ones :" the 1957 "asian flu" killed 116,000 in the u.s.; the 1968 "hong kong flu" killed 100,000. the 2009 bird flu pandemic, which was a less contagious virus, killed 12,500 people in the u.s. and hospitalized some 275,000.

-0.9683 STEM georgia tech to dismantle pervasive cyberattacks in 10 seconds or less 
 georgia tech researchers have earned a darpa contract to determine ways of defeating low-volume denial of service attacks on websites. 
 georgia tech assistant professor taesoo kim and a team of researchers here recently earned a $2.9 million darpa contract to study ways of detecting and defending against low-volume distributed denial of service (ddos) attacks on websites. 
 may 03, 2016 
 - atlanta, ga 
 georgia tech researchers have been awarded a $2.9 million contract from the u.s. defense advanced research projects agency (darpa) to develop a cybersecurity method that will identify and defend against low-volume distributed denial of service (ddos) attacks. high-volume ddos attacks that overwhelm servers with large amounts of malicious traffic in order to shut down a particular website have received a significant amount of study. however, low-volume attacks have not. low-volume attacks-while generally receiving less attention from scholars and media outlets-account for a significant percentage of all ddos assaults. they can take down a website and be as damaging, but may use less bandwidth, are often shorter in duration, and may be designed to distract a security team from the aftershocks of follow-on attacks. in fact, according to neustar, inc., around 54 percent of ddos attacks were found to be relatively small at less than 5 gbps, yet 43 percent leave behind malware or viruses. neustar's 
 april 2016 
 report found that 82 percent of corporations were attacked repeatedly. "this has been a 25-year problem with no practical solution," says 
 taesoo kim , lead principal investigator for the study and assistant professor in georgia tech's school of computer science. "our goal is to create a precise and timely detection method that identifies attacks by how they subtly change the resource consumption of a machine. with little to no degradation of system performance, we believe we can mitigate the threat and write a new signature for it inside the hardware within approximately 10 seconds so a network interface card will recognize it again. this effectively puts an anti-virus patch into your hardware in real time." under the project name roki, kim and colleagues propose to first establish a baseline of resource consumption using three intel hardware features. next, they will develop continuous analysis algorithms to compare a packet's effect on system performance against historical consumption under similar scenarios. a new path-reconstruction engine will then produce a sequence of instructions to nullify an attack and encode the finding into the network interface card to stop current or future attack traffic. "roki has the potential to achieve both timeliness and precision," says 
 wenke lee , co-pi on the project and co-director of the 
 institute for information security & privacy 
 at georgia tech. "we don't need to know what an attack looks like, just that it deviates from the baseline. existing defenses against low-volume ddos attacks lack precision and they cannot create a response in a timely manner. this will." the research is part of darpa's 
 extreme ddos defense 
 (xd3) program (awarded under contract # hr0011-16-c-0059) and began in april. first deliverables are expected in approximately 18 months, beginning with a prototype to demonstrate the core idea. the project is expected to be complete in three years. field exercises to mitigate previously unknown ddos attacks will occur in 2019. about the researchers taesoo kim ,

-0.99 liberal arts georgia tech historian co-authors book on sports, war, and pandemic 
 georgia tech historian johnny smith writes about the influence of pandemic flu and war on sports in 1918. 
 in 1918, war and a flu pandemic upended the world of sports. while the war forced the world series between the chicago cubs and the boston red sox, pictured, to be moved from october to september, the event itself likely helped spread the disease throughout the city of boston, according to johnny smith, associate professor in the school of history and sociology. he has co-authored a new book on the era called "war fever" 
 mar 24, 2020 
 - atlanta, ga 
 by michael pearson 
 it's the last week of the 1918 baseball season. the boston red sox are on the cusp of winning the world series on the back of baseball legend-in-making babe ruth. world war i is still raging in europe. and a killer virus is stalking the streets of boston. 
 this is the backdrop for 
 war fever: boston, baseball, and america in the shadow of the great war,  the latest work by georgia institute of technology historian johnny smith -a story that resonates today amid the spread of the coronavirus and its impact on our lives. 
 "we are living in a moment where a global pandemic has disrupted everyday life in ways we have not seen since 1918," said 
 smith , the j.c. "bud" shaw professor of sports history in the school of history and sociology. 
 smith's book with his frequent collaborator, purdue university historian randy roberts, is only partially about the flu pandemic. the book is the interwoven tale of three figures - ruth, boston symphony orchestra conductor karl muck, and an army officer from the boston area named charles whittlesey, who led the "lost battalion" that held off german forces in the argonne forest. it examines the impact of anti-german xenophobia and the flu pandemic on boston in the fall of 1918. 
 the book tells how many of the patriotic rituals we expect at sporting events today - the playing of the national anthem and other patriotic tunes, honors for members of the military - stem from world war i. it also speaks to widespread anti-german sentiment, including sudden doubts about muck, one of many people of german descent whose loyalties were questioned during the war. 
 the effects of the flu also are an integral part of the tale smith and roberts weave, from ruth coming down with a case of the flu during the season and nearly dying from a treatments - presaging the coming epidemic - to the possible effects of the virus on attendance during the decisive sixth game of the series. 
 they also offer a new argument that the series helped further spread the flu throughout boston, which ultimately saw some 4,500 deaths. an estimated 675,000 people in the united states and 50 million people worldwide died as a result of the flu that emerged that year. 
 with all of this going on, the red sox victory "failed to generate celebrations in the streets of boston," smith says, as news from overseas and the flu epidemic stole all the headlines. 
 war and illness led to the biggest disruption in sports until now, smith notes, with hundreds of contests, football games, boxing matches, and other events canceled or postponed. 
 similar cancellations swept through the sports industry a few weeks ago, with every major sports league suspending operations, leaving millions of suddenly homebound americans with no sports to entertain them. of course, the world is different now than it was a hundred years ago. streaming video will help fill the gap left by sports in a way that the early 20 th 
 century communications tools could not, smith said. 
 but he predicts that once the virus' grip on society has eased, sports will return to its place as a unifying diversion, a role it has long filled. 
 "it happened in the ‘20s because the culture shifted to looking for an escape from the war and the flu," smith said. "it happened after 9 / 11. it's as if the stadium serves as a cathedral of normalcy. and there will come a time when we will fill the arenas again and celebrate this return to normalcy. and it will be a very moving moment."

-0.7914 STEM georgia tech professor chairs aaas panel on pandemic emergency response 
 a professor at georgia tech has designed software that combines biological data on the pandemic with demographic data of the at-risk population so that health officials can develop a game plan to limit the pandemic's spread.

 when a pandemic spreads, health officials must quickly formulate a strategy to limit infections and deaths. that requires sifting through massive amounts of data in a short amount of time and organizing medical personnel who may have little information on the pandemic. to help coordinate a rapid response to pandemics, a professor at the georgia institute of technology in atlanta has designed software that combines biological data on the pandemic with demographic data of the at-risk population so that health officials can develop a game plan to limit the pandemic's spread. the software also combs social media sites for real-time information on the pandemic and activities of the population. eva lee, director of the center for operations research in medicine and healthcare at the h. milton stewart school of industrial and systems engineering at the georgia institute of technology in atlanta, talked about her emergency response software at the 2014 aaas annual meeting in chicago. 
 "we have developed a real-time system that will gather the demographics of the region that is being affected, and also pick up on-the-ground-data about who is available and doing what, and about movement of the affected population," lee said. "our work is the first to take demographic information and real-time population behavior and interlace it with the biological information to come up with a decision that health officials can actually use." lee chaired the panel titled "emergency response and community resilience via engineering and computational advances."  lee shared her experience helping federal officials respond to the h1n1 flu in 2009, as well as her experience planning an emergency response to a potential anthrax outbreak. lee was also involved in coordinating a response to the 2010 earthquake in haiti, and the decontamination and health screening effort in japan after the 2011 fukushima radiological disaster. 
 other speakers on the panel include ronald eguchi of imagecat inc. in long beach, calif, who talked about inventory data capture tools to assess risk from natural disasters. yasuaki sakamoto, of stevens institute of technology in hoboken, n.j., spoke about improving social media for disaster response. emergency responders to a pandemic must quickly gather information on the biological agent to assess the characteristics of the pandemic and decide which treatment would be most effective. they also collect data on the risk factors of the individuals in the pandemic, such as the severity of patient's sickness, and if children or pregnant women are infected. 
 "the big challenge in a pandemic is how do you use all of this information to determine the best strategy that will give you the minimum number of total infections and mortality rate," lee said. 
 information from lee's systems approach allows health official to determine where to allocate medical resources and personnel in the best way so that operations will be most successful. through the software developed in her lab at georgia tech, officials can determine, for example, how much vaccine to give at-risk populations and how much to give to the general populations to limit the spread of infection and mortality. officials can also map where to set up medical sites to avoid traffic gridlock and worsening the pandemic as infected patients converge on treatment sites. "we can do a real-time optimization to tell you exactly what are the sites that you should set up and who should be going where," lee said. research news georgia institute of technology 177 north avenue atlanta, georgia 30332-0181 usa @gtresearchnews media relations contacts:

-0.9979 STEM georgia tech researchers identify novel gene networks associated with aggressive type of breast cancer 
 the team used a computational math theory to identify gene-gene interactions that may be good targets for treating basal-like cancers that are resistant to traditional hormone therapies. 
 apr 23, 2024 
 breast cancer is the 
 second-most common cancer diagnosis for u.s. women , and the 
 second-leading cause of female cancer deaths . in recent years, breast cancer treatments have improved significantly, thanks to targeted gene therapy and immunotherapy. however, for the small group of patients diagnosed with the most aggressive basal-like type of breast cancer, such approaches are less successful. 
 recently, scientists in the  georgia tech integrated cancer research center (icrc)  have found that this particular breast cancer displays a unique interactive gene network structure. using a type of mathematics called "graph theory," which models relationships between a pair of objects, the researchers computationally detected changes in gene-gene interactions as 
 this breast 
 cancer occurs and develops. 
 "the discovery of novel gene networks associated with basal-like breast cancers has helped us identify potential new gene targets to treat this very aggressive type of breast cancer," said 
 john mcdonald , icrc founding director, professor emeritus in the 
 school of biological sciences , and the study's corresponding author. "we would not have discovered these possible treatments through analyses of gene expression alone." 
 while causing just 10-20% of breast cancer diagnoses, basal-like breast cancer is much more aggressive than other subtypes - and if not identified early, when it can be treated by surgery and / or radiation therapy, effective anti-cancer drug treatment can be challenging. the basal-like subtype does not respond to traditional hormonal therapies. 
 one theory 
 as 
 to why, advocated by many cancer researchers, is that individual genes do not function autonomously; as such, changes in how genes interact with one another in cancer may be as important as the cancer-driving genes themselves. 
 "the components of any complex system, like the human genome, are certainly important," said mcdonald. "the way in which these independent components interact with one another is also critical." 
 for this study, the researchers analyzed three major subtypes of breast cancer, with particular emphasis on the most aggressive basal-like subtype. 
 the researchers found that gene-gene interactive networks are quite different in the aggressive basal-like subtype, compared to the more prevalent luminal a and luminal b subtypes. 
 many of the genes comprising these unique networks were found to be involved in functions not previously associated with breast cancer. 
 stephen housley , a neurobiology researcher in the school of biological sciences and a co-author on the paper, noted that "an unexpected and intriguing result from our study is that neural processes appear to play a prominent role in distinguishing the highly aggressive basal-like tumors from the less aggressive luminal a and luminal b subtypes." 
 in total, the researchers examined more than 300 million pairs of genes, comparing healthy women to those with breast cancer. study co-author 
 zainab ashard , a computational biologist who recently worked in mcdonald's lab, 
 explained, "differences in the gene network structure between healthy individuals and breast cancer patients allowed us to identify changes in patterns of gene-gene interactions within breast cancer development." [s1] 
 the team's results are detailed in a new paper, " changes in gene network interactions in breast cancer onset and development ," which appeared 
 in the april 2024 issue of 
 gen biotechnology . based on the results of this study and their 
 previously published analyses of eight other types of cancer , the researchers believe they have established the usefulness of network analysis in identifying potential new candidates for the diagnosis of and targeted gene therapy treatment for breast and other types of cancers. 
 in addition to mcdonald, housley, and ashard, 
 kara keun lee , a former bioinformatics ph.d. student who worked in mcdonald's lab, is also a co-author on the paper. 
 the results shown here are in whole or in part based on data generated by the

-0.6428 STEM how insects evolved to ultrafast flight (and back) 
 many insects fly synchronously, matching the nervous system pulses to wing movement. but smaller insects don't have the mechanics for this and must flap their wings harder, which works only up to a certain point. that's where asynchronous flight comes in. 
 researchers found that hawkmoth flight muscles exhibit delayed stretch activation, a hallmark of asynchronous flight. 
 oct 06, 2023 
 mosquitoes are some of the fastest-flying insects. flapping their wings more than 800 times a second, they achieve their speed because the muscles in their wings can flap faster than their nervous system can tell them to beat. 
 this asynchronous beating comes from how the flight muscles interact with the physics of the insect's springy exoskeleton. this decoupling of neural commands and muscle contractions is common in only four distinct insect groups. 
 for years, scientists assumed these four groups evolved these ultrafast wingbeats separately, but research from the georgia institute of technology and the university of california, san diego (uc san diego) shows that they evolved from a single common ancestor. this discovery demonstrates evolution has repeatedly turned on and off this particular mode of flight. the researchers developed physics models and robotics to test how these transitions could occur.

-0.5995 STEM hydrogel offers double punch against orthopedic bone infections 
 researchers have a developed a hydrogel that both attacks bacteria and encourages bone regrowth.

 jun 21, 2019 
 - atlanta, ga 
 surgery prompted by automobile accidents, combat wounds, cancer treatment and other conditions can lead to bone infections that are difficult to treat and can delay healing until they are resolved. now, researchers have a developed a double-duty hydrogel that both attacks the bacteria and encourages bone regrowth with a single application containing two active components. 
 the injectable hydrogel, which is a network of cross-linked polymer chains, contains the enzyme lysostaphin and the bone-regenerating protein bmp-2. in a new study using a small animal model, researchers at the georgia institute of technology showed significant reduction in an infection caused by 
 staphylococcus aureus 
 - a common infection in orthopedic surgery - along with regeneration within large bone defects. 
 "treatment for bone infections now often requires two surgeries to both eliminate the infection and heal the injured bone," said 
 andrés j. garcía , executive director of the 
 parker h. petit institute for bioengineering & bioscience 
 at the georgia institute of technology. "our idea was to develop a bifunctional material that does both things in a single step. that would be better for the patient, cost less and reduce hospitalization time. we have shown that we can engineer the hydrogel to control the delivery and release of both the antimicrobial enzyme and the regenerative protein." 
 the hydrogel-based therapy could be used to treat established bone infections, and as a prophylactic during surgery to prevent infection. the study, funded by the national institutes of health, was reported may 17 in the journal 
 science advances . 
 bone infections today are often treated with systemic antibiotics and surgery to clean the injury. if the infection occurs with implants, they often must be removed. once the infection is gone, additional surgery may be required to implant proteins that stimulate bone regrowth and restore the implant. and the dead bacteria can prompt a harmful inflammatory reaction. 
 garcía and his collaborators - including first author christopher johnson - chose lysostaphin, an enzyme that kills the bacteria by cleaving cell walls without generating inflammation. the enzyme keeps working within the hydrogel after it polymerizes. 
 "with this strategy, we can get rid of the bacteria in such a way that the body re-establishes a normal inflammatory environment that allows the bone to heal," garcía said. "use of lysostaphin has been limited by poor stability inside the body, but in the gel, it can maintain stability for at least two weeks. that allows for controlled release over a longer period of time, which is sufficient for what we are trying to do." 
 beyond treating infections, the new technique might be used to prevent infection during surgery. for instance, if a screw was being inserted to repair an injury, the hydrogel might be applied to the screw threads. the soft gel would not affect the repair. 
 the next step in the research would be to repeat the study in large animals, after which clinical trials could be considered if the material proves promising. 
 "the mechanisms used to fight off infection depends on the species," garcia noted. "that's why it's so important to repeat the studies in a large animal after testing in mice or rats. showing efficacy in a large animal model would be a key step toward human trials." 
 the hydrogel material has been used in the human body before, and is designed to quickly leave the treatment site. "the hydrogel breaks down into small building blocks that are excreted in the urine," garcia said. "after several weeks, there is no synthetic material left in the body and it is replaced by normal healing tissue." 
 in addition to those already named, co-authors on the paper included mary caitlin p. sok, karen e. martin, pranav p. kalelkar, jeremy d. caplin, and edward a. botchwey.

-0.3431 liberal arts iran nuclear deal withdrawal "terribly misguided," says sam nunn school of international affairs scholar 
 rachel whitlock, an assistant professor who specializes in lobal nuclear politics and international security , says the decision to pull out gives iran all the leverage 
 rachel whitlark 
 may 09, 2018 
 - atlanta, ga 
 the decision by u.s. president donald trump to withdraw from the iran nuclear deal "is terribly misguided and cedes all the leverage to iran," said rachel whitlark, an expert in global nuclear politics and international security at the georgia institute of technology. 
 "the belief that iran will now be willing to renegotiate a mythical ‘better deal' seems untenable, especially since the united states' european, chinese, and russian partners were opposed to a brand new deal or scrapping the current one," said  whitlark , who specializes in international security and foreign policy decision-making, including nuclear proliferation, counter-proliferation, and military intervention. 
 trump announced tuesday, may 8, 2018, that the united states would pull out of the joint comprehensive plan of action, or jcpoa,  the 2015 culmination of a fevered international effort to halt tehran's progress toward a nuclear weapon. 
 supporters of trump's decision argue it will give the united states more leverage to negotiate a better deal with iran that would permanently end the threat of the country gaining nuclear weapons. whitlark said she doubts this scenario, in part because the united states lacks the political capital to convince international partners to restore sanctions against iran. 
 although the united states could restore secondary sanctions on international entities that do business with iran, those measures would fall well short of the far-reaching global effort that brought iran to the negotiating table in the first place, whitlark said. 
 "reimposing the sanctions regime is going to be incredibly difficult, especially on the scale that it was prior to the jcpoa's negotiation," she said. 
 whitlark also said trump's decision will give iran ammunition to further isolate the united states from its allies, and likely will severely damage u.s. credibility as a negotiating partner ahead of critical upcoming talks with north korea over its nuclear program. 
 "the point of the jcpoa was to take the nuclear issue off the table, to then allow for discussion on the other relevant issues, such as terrorism, regional turbulence, and iran's ballistic missile program," whitlark said. 
 "scrapping the deal makes that all but impossible, given that this action will fuel hardliners in iran, drive a wedge between the u.s. and key international partners, and make the united states look untrustworthy," said whitlark. 
 "this is a lesson to any other current or future proliferant - be incredibly wary of negotiating with the u.s. or freezing or halting your nuclear program," she said. 
 while iran's next steps remain unclear - perhaps attempting to salvage some remnants of the jcpoa with the remaining participants or possibly even resurrecting its nuclear weapons program - the implications for the global non-proliferation regime are alarming, whitlark said. 
 "denuclearizing north korea is already a herculean challenge," she said. "simultaneously combatting an iranian nuclear weapons program and middle east arms race add dizzying nuclear complications." 
 whitlark is an assistant professor in the sam nunn school of international affairs. the school is a unit of the  ivan allen college of liberal arts .

 new research has found almost 25% of people surveyed experienced some form of deprivation due to the coronavirus pandemic. 
 the coronavirus pandemic has triggered an unprecedented economic crisis in the u.s. 
 dec 16, 2020 
 - atlanta, ga 
 new research has found that almost 25% of u.s. respondents experienced two of four types of deprivation due to the coronavirus pandemic. 
 shatakshee dhongde, associate professor of economics in the ivan allen college of liberal arts, analyzed results of the federal reserve board's survey of household economics and decision-making to determine the multiple economic deprivations experienced by respondents. her work was recently published in the open-access journal 
 plos one . dhongde found that significant proportions of u.s. respondents were experiencing economic hardships even early in the covid-19 pandemic, with hispanic citizens being particularly affected. 
 "the paper highlights the plight of americans during the early months of the economic crisis set in motion amid the coronavirus pandemic," dhongde said. "it sheds light on how economic disparities deepened along racial and ethnic lines." 
 the pandemic triggered an unprecedented economic crisis in the u.s. data from the centers for disease control and prevention shows more than 374,000 confirmed u.s. covid-19 cases between april 3 and april 6. the federal reserve board surveyed 1,030 u.s. respondents about their households. the survey compiled data on four indicators of economic deprivation: overall financial condition, loss of employment, reduction in income, and inability to pay bills in full. 
 dhongde found significant deprivation among respondents, with almost 25% reporting hardships in at least two of the four indicators. one quarter of respondents saw their incomes fall compared to the previous month, and 13% were unable to pay their monthly bills. young adults and those without a college education experienced a disproportionate loss of economic well-being. 
 she also found that hispanic respondents were experiencing significantly higher deprivation: over 37% of these respondents faced hardships in at least two of the four indicators, and 8% reported hardships in all four areas. 
 "going forward, it is urgent that we prioritize economic aid to vulnerable populations," dhongde added. "these individuals are experiencing multiple hardships, and, without immediate aid, they will not be able to sustain the economic shock of the pandemic."

-0.1027 STEM a journey to the origins of multicellular life: long-term experimental evolution in the lab 
 over 3,000 generations of laboratory evolution, georgia tech researchers watched as their model organism, "snowflake yeast," began to adapt as multicellular individuals. 
 macroscopic snowflake yeast with elongated cells fracture into modules, retaining the same underlying branched growth form of their microscopic ancestor. 
 may 10, 2023 
 the world would look very different without multicellular organisms - take away the plants, animals, fungi, and seaweed, and earth starts to look like a wetter, greener version of mars. but precisely how multicellular organisms evolved from single-celled ancestors remains poorly understood. the transition happened hundreds of millions of years ago, and early multicellular species are largely lost to extinction. 
 to investigate how multicellular life evolves from scratch, researchers from the georgia institute of technology decided to take evolution into their own hands. led by  william ratcliff , associate professor in the  school of biological sciences  and director of the  interdisciplinary graduate program in quantitative biosciences , a team of researchers has initiated the first long-term evolution experiment aimed at evolving new kinds of multicellular organisms from single-celled ancestors in the lab.

 science , the researchers describe a chaotic scene of ammonia, cyclones and bands of storms that extend far deeper beneath the planet's clouds than previously thought. 
 juno has been circling jupiter since entering its orbit on july 4, 2016, and has completed six passes of the planet so far. the paper outlines findings from juno's first pole-to-pole orbit on august 27, when the basketball court-sized spacecraft skimmed within nearly 2,000 miles of jupiter's equatorial cloud tops. read the full story.

-0.9993 liberal arts marking two years of war in ukraine. what does the future hold in store? 
 ivan allen college of liberal arts experts assess the state of the ukraine war on its second anniversary. 
 ivan allen college of liberal arts experts assess the state of the ukraine war on its second anniversary. 
 feb 21, 2024 
 saturday, feb. 24, marks two years since russian forces invaded ukraine. ivan allen college of liberal arts experts have closely tracked the conflict from the frontlines to potential fault lines in western support for ukraine, as well as the potential impact on the global economy. we asked some of these scholars to offer their insights into how the way the war  has evolved in the past year, and what to look out for going forward. 
 our experts: 
 gen. philip breedlove , former nato supreme commander and distinguished professor of the practice in the sam nunn school of international affairs 
 robert bell , former senior civilian representative of the u.s. secretary of defense in europe and the defense advisor to the u.s. ambassador to nato; also a distinguished professor of the practice in the sam nunn school of international affairs 
 dina khapaeva , professor of russian, school of modern languages 
 nikolay koposov , distinguished professor of the practice, school of history and sociology 
 how has russia responded to developments in the last year? 
 breedlove : i probably said last year that they were failing and that they were not adaptive , 
 and they were rather rigid, and they were. they have had bad planning, bad logistics, bad general officership, bad decisions, and brought the wrong people to the battlefield. it's just been horrible. but that now is changing. mr. putin is having to face up to the fact that he can't keep doing that. he's going into an election. support for what even people in russia are now calling a war is beginning to fall. as we say in america, we're running out of money, now we have to think. well, mr. putin is running out of troops, so now he has to think. and we're now starting to see some adaptations in the use of air power and some better tactics more suited to small-unit warfare. 
 what has ukraine done well? 
 breedlove : ukraine has just absolutely rearranged russia in the black sea. they have essentially made the northern 20% of the black sea untenable for russia, and russia has had to relocate major assets to the south and east. and whenever they're trying to move in and out of crimea, especially, ukraine is making them pay and making them pay dearly. they've adapted small, commercial, over-the-counter drones and made them into a very lethal flighting fleet: russia is still losing tanks to $270 drones. and their surface and under-surface naval drone capability is in the middle of defeating the northern part of the black sea fleet. that is beyond astounding. they are really leading the world in that way, and we are learning from them. 
 what military aid does ukraine most need from the west? 
 breedlove : victory is not about any one bright shiny object. what ukraine needs is what the united states would take to this fight if we were involved militarily. they need air superiority to enable modern maneuver warfare, and they need the sensor capabilities to discriminate targets from friends and to command and control. then we can talk about the thing everybody wants to talk about: the ability to shoot, whether it's a 
 patriot , a 
 thaad , or an f-16. you throw a bunch of f-16s out there in the middle of the battlefield, they'd do some pretty good work, but they would do amazing work if they were hooked to a capability to sense, discern, target, shoot. 
 bell : the two most critically needed enhancements in ukraine's military inventory are modern air superiority fighter aircraft (e.g., the f-16s now being delivered, but in larger numbers) and long-range "deep strike" fires such as the u.s. 
 atacms 
 system already provided, but in the longer-range missile version, as well as the german-made 
 taurus 
 long-range missile. these systems could alter the course of the war in ukraine's favor, especially if their use were to be concentrated on a deliberate strategy of denying russia any military presence on or access to crimea. 
 were that goal to be achieved, it would constitute a "strategic defeat" for putin since russian ambitions have for centuries prioritized control of crimea. that might increase the admittedly long odds that putin might see value in negotiating an acceptable outcome to this conflict. 
 what's the outlook for continued western aid? 
 bell: 
 the eu has just renewed its support for ukraine's economy with a 
 € 54 billion package . whether the u.s. congress can pass the pending supplemental appropriations request from president biden for 
 $60 billion 
 in further military assistance remains to be seen. the domestic argument over securing the u.s. southern border is the primary holdup there. however, u.s. support could also be put at risk if kyiv fails to adequately attack domestic corruption or president zelenskyy begins to rule in an unacceptably autocratic fashion. also, priorities could shift if the u.s. military involvement in the middle east conflicts escalates, or if china were to attempt to reintegrate taiwan by force. 
 koposov : 
 western fatigue is obvious and understandable, but the key thing is that western opinion has not yet appreciated the importance of the problems at stake. we still very much live in a state of post-cold war triumphalism and do not understand that the world has dramatically changed since communism collapsed and that the new challenges to democracy are no less serious than those it had to face in the   20th 
 century. almost all domestic problems should now be postponed, and the west should mobilize all its resources to get rid of putin once and forever. 
 are there any less-often-discussed underlying structural weaknesses in the russian military-industrial complex that could significantly limit its ability to continue fighting? 
 bell : president putin is clearly worried about possible civil disobedience and public resistance were he to order a general mobilization. this is why he has relied on mercenaries, generous pay, and bonus offers to recruits from distant corners of russia, and pardon offers to convicts. nonetheless, if putin must choose between a wider conscription or conceding defeat to ukraine, he will most likely choose the former and amplify his already strong public messaging that suffering and sacrifice for russia are patriotic and good for one's soul. 
 hence no "tipping point" is yet in sight. 
 khapaeva : russian volunteers recruited from the most socially and economically disadvantaged groups can expect to receive a payment for their military service that amounts to a lifetime of earnings. the moment putin's administration is cut off from its oil and gas profits, russians may become much less willing to serve as cannon fodder, creating conditions for changing the general political atmosphere in the country. 
 are sanctions having any impact on russia's war effort or domestic morale? 
 khapaeva : the historical memory of the conditions under which generations lived in this country must be taken into consideration. russian history is one of regular famines, starvation, food shortages, and an economy of deficit, all which are alive in the collective memory. living standards in russia remain far below those of its western neighbors, but current sanctions cannot even approach that historical level of poverty. moreover, many russians consider their memories of misery as testifying to national resilience. this goes well with putin's propaganda, which has been successful in presenting state terror as a matter of national pride and heritage. 
 what role can diplomacy play in bringing an end to the conflict? 
 bell : a western diplomatic effort to persuade china and key global south nations to pressure russia might persuade moscow to swiftly end its pursuit of total victory in ukraine, but such a scenario is unlikely. however, some other avenues do exist to hinder russia's war effort. 
 for instance, the u.s. could work with fellow permanent un security council members france and the uk and incoming members japan and south korea on a "name and shame" campaign to expose and condemn russia's blatant violation of un security council resolutions that imposed strict sanctions on north korea's military exports and imports related to its illegal and dangerous nuclear and ballistic missile programs. that could help isolate russia and delegitimize its actions. 
 koposov : i do not think there is, or should be, any room for diplomacy at this point. do we need another munich? 
 what are the most concerning "wildcard" scenarios you can envision? 
 bell : the assassination of zelenskyy by the russian fsb or his death in a missile strike, or a collapse of morale within the ukrainian military. 
 khapaeva : if the "vertical of power" cracks, leaders of the estimated 30 private armies in russia may start acting as independent warlords, fighting for power and resources inside russia. this could eventually lead to the collapse of the russian federation into several states, helping ukraine and the west to win the war. the decentralization of the federation was avoided in 1991 - not without western help - out of fear that nuclear arms would proliferate into the hands of even smaller and less controllable states. judging from today, that looks like shortsighted politics. 
 breedlove : the big wild card is that mr. putin understands how to yank our chain, and if ukraine started winning, the first thing you'd probably hear are new threats around the nuclear power plant in zaporizhia. we told russia before the war what we were afraid of: we are afraid of nukes and we're afraid of the war widening. mr. putin uses those tools constantly to keep us deterred. but if russia ends up killing a bunch of nato people, that's a big wild card and one that is frankly really unsavory to talk about. 
 how will this all turn out? 
 bell : if president biden is re-elected and congress agrees to continue the delivery of u.s. military weaponry at roughly the same level and in the same categories and types as before, we can expect that neither of the two contesting parties will achieve a decisive breakthrough for the foreseeable future. if president trump is elected in november, we can expect some sort of dramatic u.s. proposal for an immediate halt to the fighting.  assuming that is rejected outright by ukraine and trump cuts off all u.s. military assistance in response, then ukraine's ability to continue to prosecute the war for more than a few more months would be at risk, and its incentives, however unwilling, to seek a negotiated settlement would be increased. 
 breedlove : it is my belief that this war will end exactly how western policy leaders decide it's going to end. if we give ukraine what they need to win, and we are not doing that now, they will win. if we stop supporting ukraine, they will lose. and if that happens the fact of the matter is that russia will again subjugate ukraine, and many tens of thousands of ukrainian soldiers and civilians will die in a guerrilla conflict the likes of which russia has never seen. 
 what are the potential long-term geopolitical ramifications of the war? 
 koposov : if putin wins the war, he will most likely continue with other aggressions, and u.s. leadership in the world will be significantly undermined. china will most likely learn the lesson and imitate him, at least to some extent. and the so-called global south will become even more anti-american than it is now. 
 bell : nato's own security is inextricably intertwined in the outcome of this conflict. 
 as the leaders of the alliance themselves agreed at their summit in madrid in 2022, russia's willingness to prosecute this aggression means that it cannot be excluded that it might also decide to commit aggression against a nato ally, nato's article 5 collective security commitments notwithstanding. 
 khapaeva : if putin wins, the war will not end russia's aggression and put to rest its ambitions to restore the russian empire / ussr. an attack on an eastern european or baltic nato state is already avidly discussed by kremlin propagandists. the west showed a feeble and inconsistent response to russia's war against georgia in 2008 and the 2014 annexation of crimea. after russia invaded ukraine, made-up fear of crossing "putin's red lines" led to rationing the arms to ukraine and enabled russia to buy time and fortify the front line on the occupied territories. it's going to be hard to persuade the russians that they now must obey the international norms they have been violating for the past two decades. hence, putin will seek to compromise nato. if, at that moment, the u.s. decides to instead focus on its "domestic agenda," nato's collapse will become imminent.

-0.9907 STEM this matrix delivers healing stem cells to injured elderly muscles 
 elderly accident victims and duchene muscular dystrophy sufferers could someday benefit from this stem cell hydrogel successfully tested in mice. 
 hydrogel delivered stem cells called muscle satellite cells integrate to form new muscle strands, in green, along with existing muscle tissue, in red. yellow strands may descend from existing muscle cells and from delivered muscs. 
 aug 15, 2018 
 - atlanta, ga 
 a car accident leaves an aging patient with severe muscle injuries that won't heal. treatment with muscle stem cells from a donor might restore damaged tissue, but doctors are unable to deliver them effectively. 
 a new method  may help change this. 
 researchers at the georgia institute of technology engineered a molecular matrix, a hydrogel, to deliver muscle stem cells called muscle satellite cells (muscs) directly to injured muscle tissue in patients whose muscles don't regenerate well. in lab experiments on mice, the hydrogel successfully delivered muscs to injured, aged muscle tissue to boost the healing process while protecting the stem cells from harsh immune reactions. 
 the method was also successful in mice with a muscle tissue deficiency that emulated duchene muscular dystrophy, and if research progresses, the new hydrogel therapy could one day save the lives of people suffering from the disease. 
 inflammatory war zone 
 simply injecting additional muscle satellite cells into damaged, inflamed tissue has proven inefficient, in part because the stem cells encounter an immune system on the warpath. 
 "any muscle injury is going to attract immune cells. typically, this would help muscle stem cells repair damage. but in aged or dystrophic muscles, immune cells lead to the release a lot of toxic chemicals like cytokines and free radicals that kill the new stem cells," said young jang, an  assistant professor in georgia tech's school of biological sciences  and one of the study's principal investigators. 
 only between 1 and 20 percent of injected muscs make it to damaged tissue, and those that do, arrive there weakened. also, some tissue damage makes any injection unfeasible, thus the need for new delivery strategies. 
 "our new hydrogel protects the stem cells, which multiply and thrive inside the matrix. the gel is applied to injured muscle, and the cells engraft onto the tissues and help them heal," said woojin han, a postdoctoral researcher in georgia tech's school of mechanical engineering and the paper's first author. 
 han, jang and andres garcia, the study's other principal investigator, 
 published their results on august 15, 2018, in the journal  science advances . the national institute of arthritis and musculoskeletal and skin diseases of the national institutes of health funded the research. 
 hydrogel: watery nets 
 hydrogels often start out as water-based solutions of molecular components that resemble crosses, and other components that make the ends of the crosses attach to each other. when the components come together, they fuse into molecular nets suspended in water, resulting in a material with the consistency of a gel. 
 if stem cells or a drug are mixed into the solution, when the net, or matrix, forms, it ensnares the treatment for delivery and protects the payload from death or dissipation in the body. researchers can easily and reliably synthesize hydrogels and also custom-engineer them by tweaking their components, as the georgia tech researchers did in this hydrogel. 
 "it physically traps the muscle satellite cells in a net, but the cells also grab onto chemical latches we engineered into the net," han said. 
 this hydrogel's added latches, which bond with proteins protruding from stem cells' membranes, not only increase the cells' adhesion to the net but also hinder them from committing suicide. stem cells tend to kill themselves when they're detached and free-floating. 
 the chemical components and the cells are mixed in solution then applied to the injured muscle, where the mixture sets to a matrix-gel patch that glues the stem cells in place. the gel is biocompatible and biodegradable. 
 "the stem cells keep multiplying and thriving in the gel after it is applied," jang said. "then the hydrogel degrades and leaves behind the cells engrafted onto muscle tissue the way natural stem cells usually would be." 
 stem cell breakdown 
 in younger, healthier patients, muscle satellite cells are part of the natural healing mechanism. 
 "muscle satellite cells are resident stem cells in your skeletal muscles. they live on muscle strands like specks, and they're key players in making new muscle tissue," han said. 
 "as we age, we lose muscle mass, and the number of satellite cells also decreases. the ones that are left get weaker. it's a double whammy," jang said. "at a very advanced age, a patient stops regenerating muscle altogether." 
 "with this system we engineered, we think we can introduce donor cells to enhance the repair mechanism in injured older patients," han said. "we also want to get this to work in patients with duchene muscular dystrophy." 
 "duchene muscular dystrophy is surprisingly frequent," jang said. "about 1 in 3,500 boys get it. they eventually get respiratory defects that lead to death, so we hope to be able to use this to rebuild their diaphragm muscles." 
 if the method goes to clinical trials, researchers will likely have to work around the potential for donor cell rejection in human patients.

-0.9955 liberal arts medicaid ‘unwinding' could lead to eviction crisis, new school of public policy research suggests 
 the study examined tennessee's 23005 trimming of its medicaid rolls and the impact on evictions. 
 evictions substantially rose in tennessee compared to other southern states after the 2005 removal of 190,000 people from medicaid there, school of public policy assistant professor ashley c. bradford found in a new study published in 
 health affairs . the study offers insights into what might happen after current efforts to return to normal medicaid operations nationally following the covid-19 public health emergency. 
 feb 16, 2024 
 the united states may be in for a significant wave of evictions in a year or so, the unintended consequence of work to trim medicaid rolls expanded during the covid-19 public health emergency, according to new research from georgia tech's 
 school of public policy . 
 the 
 study , 
 authored 
 by assistant professor ashley c. bradford and recently published in 
 health affairs, 
 found that evictions in tennessee rose 24.5 percent between 2005 and 2009 relative to other southern states following the state's 2005 decision to remove approximately 190,000 people from its medicaid rolls. 
 more than 
 16.4 million people 
 nationwide - 86 times the tennessee figure from 2005 - have already been taken off medicaid as states react to a federal law requiring them to return to normal operations after years of expanded eligibility meant to blunt the impact of the pandemic, according to 
 kff health news. 
 as many as 24 million people could eventually lose access to medicaid, according to the outlet. 
 however, 
 bradford 
 warns that many aspects of health care administration and the housing market have changed since 2005, so it's hard to say whether that 24.5% figure in her paper will cleanly translate to the economic and policy environment of 2025. the populations involved in tennessee's downsizing and the 
 current national rollbacks 
 are also different, adding more uncertainty. 
 "i think it's safe to say that we will see disruptions in housing, but we are not going to be able to see exactly how large those disruptions will be for a few years," bradford said. 
 https: / / youtu.be / v7ykdwvwgza?si=fwpklp24paa6i4_a 
 t ransformed health care and housing landscapes may shift impact 
 among other things, where tennessee's 2005 medicaid changes primarily affected working-age childless adults, the researchers say that the current medicaid rollback is expected to disproportionately affect immigrants and people with disabilities - populations whose budgets are often more sensitive to economic shocks like the loss of health insurance. 
 on the other hand, according to the researchers, the affordable care act could also reduce financial shocks and evictions for some families. the program first offered health insurance plans - including low- and zero-premium options - in 2013, well after the period bradford 
 and her co-authors 
 studied in tennessee. 
 another group expected to be affected, older adults, may be somewhat sheltered from evictions due to savings or social security income, according to bradford and her co-authors, mir m. ali of the university of maryland, college park and johanna catherin maclean of george mason university. 
 the link between medicaid loss and evictions 
 so, what precisely is the connection between loss of medicaid and eviction? 
 in the tennessee case, the loss of health coverage - which persisted for most families removed from medicaid in tennessee in 2005 - would likely have added more financial stress to already strapped budgets. it also may have led to a higher incidence of preventable health issues or the undertreatment of existing chronic health conditions that could have made it harder for people to keep working, according to the researchers. either situation could be financially devastating, potentially resulting in eventual eviction. 
 evictions, in turn, often force people into housing located in areas with fewer employment opportunities and higher crime, further elevating the financial stress on vulnerable populations, leading to a cycle that can lock people - especially those affected by health issues or substance misuse - into nearly inescapable poverty, according to the study authors. 
 "we know evictions are extraordinarily damaging to families and individuals and can cause generational impacts. so we really need to be able to intervene and help vulnerable people before they get into a cycle where they cannot get out of it on their own," bradford said. 
 bradford said one policy that could help would be a strong, temporary eviction moratorium similar to the one imposed nationally by the u.s. centers for disease control and prevention in response to the covid-19 pandemic in 2021. policymakers could also consider financial assistance to those being removed from the medicaid rolls to help them stay on their feet during the transition, she said. 
 methodology and limitations 
 to reach their conclusions in the recent paper, bradford and her co-authors used data from the eviction lab at princeton university. they examined county-level eviction data from tennessee and compared it to those of alabama, florida, georgia, kentucky, louisiana, maryland, mississippi, north carolina, oklahoma, south carolina, texas, virginia, washington, d.c., and west virginia. 
 after controlling for variables such as whether political factors could have led to weakened rental protection laws, they found that the average annual eviction filings per tennessee county increased by 27.6% as compared to counties in the other states in the u.s. census bureau's south region. eventual evictions increased by the slightly smaller 24.5% figure. 
 that works out to about 1,000 more annual evictions per tennessee county than in other southern states during the same period. 
 the study does have some limitations in addition to how much has changed since 2005, bradford notes. she said the database has some gaps, lacks individual-level data, and does not track eviction notices or evictions overturned on appeal, although the latter is believed to be rare. 
 probing impact of substance abuse, psychiatric care access, on evictions 
 bradford's earlier research has examined the impact of evictions from other angles. in a 
 2019 paper 
 published in 
 health services research , she also found that a 1% increase in the eviction rate is associated with an up to 0.596% chance of substance-related deaths for the average u.s. county. 
 in a 
 2023 study 
 published in the 
 journal of policy analysis and management 
 with co-author johanna catherin maclean, bradford found that having ten additional psychiatric treatment centers in a county was associated with 2.1% fewer evictions. 
 the researchers hypothesized that increased access to psychiatric care improved the management of mental health disorders, which can lead to higher rates of employment and lower rates of activities likely to lead to eviction - such as nuisance behaviors or criminal activity. 
 it was one of the first papers to make a plausible link explaining the relationship between mental health treatment access and eviction, according to the researchers. 
 bradford's most recent paper, "tenncare disenrollment led to increased eviction filings and evictions in tennessee relative to other southern states," was published on feb. 5, 2024, in 
 health affairs . it is available at

-0.9968 STEM metabolic profiles distinguish early stage ovarian cancer with unprecedented accuracy 
 a new study has produced a set of biomarkers that may enable development of an accurate ovarian cancer screening test. 
 georgia tech research scientist david gaul places samples into an ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (uplc-ms) instrument for testing. the uplc-ms technique was used to help identify 16 metabolites associated with early-stage ovarian cancer. the work, utilizing serum samples, could lead to an accurate screening test for the disease. 
 nov 17, 2015 
 - atlanta, ga 
 studying blood serum compounds of different molecular weights has led scientists to a set of biomarkers that may enable development of a highly accurate screening test for early-stage ovarian cancer. using advanced liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry techniques coupled with machine learning computer algorithms, researchers have identified 16 metabolite compounds that provided unprecedented accuracy in distinguishing 46 women with early-stage ovarian cancer from a control group of 49 women who did not have the disease. blood samples for the study were collected from a broad geographic area - canada, philadelphia and atlanta. while the set of biomarkers reported in this study are the most accurate reported thus far for early-stage ovarian cancer, more extensive testing across a larger population will be needed to determine if the high diagnostic accuracy will be maintained across a larger group of women representing a diversity of ethnic and racial groups. the research was reported november 17 in the journal 
 scientific reports , an open access journal from the publishers of 
 nature . "this work provides a proof of concept that using an integrated approach combining analytical chemistry and learning algorithms may be a way to identify optimal diagnostic features," said 
 john mcdonald , a professor in the 
 school of biolog y at the georgia institute of technology and director of its integrated cancer research center. "we think our results show great promise and we plan to further validate our findings across much larger samples." ovarian cancer has been difficult to treat because it typically is not diagnosed until after it has metastasized to other areas of the body. researchers have been seeking a routine screening test that could diagnose the disease in stage one or stage two - when the cancer is confined to the ovaries. working with three cancer treatment centers in the u.s. and canada, the georgia tech researchers obtained blood samples from women with stage one and stage two ovarian cancer. they separated out the serum, which contains proteins and metabolites - molecules produced by enzymatic reactions in the body. the serum samples were analyzed by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (uplc-ms), which is two instruments joined together to better separate samples into their individual components. heavier molecules are separated from lighter molecules, and the molecular signatures are determined with enough accuracy to identify the specific compounds. the georgia tech researchers decided to look only at the metabolites in their research. "people have been looking at proteins for diagnosis of ovarian cancer for a couple of decades, and the results have not been very impressive," said 
 facundo fernández , a professor in georgia tech's 
 school of chemistry and biochemistry 
 who led the analytical chemistry part of the research. "we decided to look in a different place for molecules that could potentially provide diagnostic capabilities. it's one of the places that people had really not studied before." samples from each of the 46 cancer patients were divided so they could be analyzed in duplicate. the researchers also looked at serum samples from 49 women who did not have cancer. the work required eliminating unrelated compounds such as caffeine, and molecules that were not present in all the cancer patients. "we used really high resolution equipment and instrumentation to be able to separate most of the components of the samples," fernández explained. "otherwise, detection of early-stage ovarian cancer is very difficult because you have a lot of confounding factors." the chemical work identified about a thousand candidate compounds. that number was reduced to about 255 through the work of research scientist david gaul, who removed duplicates and unrelated molecules from the collection. these 255 compounds were then analyzed by a learning algorithm which evaluated the predictive value of each one. molecules that did not contribute to the predictive accuracy of the screening were eliminated. ultimately, the algorithm produced a list of 16 molecules that together differentiated cancer patients with extremely high accuracy - greater than 90 percent. "the algorithm looks at the metabolic features and correlates them with whether the samples were from cancer or control patients," mcdonald explained. "the algorithm has no idea what these compounds are. it is simply looking for the combination of molecules that provides the optimal predictive accuracy. what is encouraging is that many of the diagnostic features identified are metabolites that have been previously implicated in ovarian cancer." as a next step, mcdonald and fernández would like to study samples from a larger population that includes significant numbers of different ethnic and racial groups. those individuals may have different metabolites that could serve as biomarkers for ovarian cancer. though sophisticated laboratory equipment was required to identify the 16 molecules, a screening test would not require the same level of sophistication, fernández said. "once you know what these molecules are, the next step would be to set up a clinical assay," he said. "mass spectrometry is a common tool in this field. we could use a clinical mass spectrometer to look at only the molecules we are interested in. moving this to a clinical assay would take work, but i don't see any technical barriers to doing it." the fernández and mcdonald groups have used a similar approach with prostate cancer and plan to explore its utility for detecting other types of cancer. the research was supported by grants from the laura crandall brown ovarian cancer foundation, the ovarian cancer research fund, the ovarian cancer institute, northside hospital (atlanta), the robinson family fund, and the deborah nash endowment fund. citation : david a. gaul, et al., "highly-accurate metabolomics detection of early-stage ovarian cancer," (scientific reports, 2015).

 researchers at the georgia tech research institute (gtri) are developing a micro gas chromatograph (gc) for early detection of diseases in crops. about the size of a 9-volt battery, the technology's portability could give farmers just the tool they need to quickly evaluate the health of their crops and address any possible threats immediately, potentially increasing yield by reducing crop losses. "it's estimated that each year u.s. farmers lose 12 percent of their crops to pests and another 12 percent to diseases," said gary mcmurray, division chief of gtri's food processing technology division. to identify potential threats to crop health, farmers typically look for physical symptoms of disease, such as discolored or wilting leaves. however, in many cases, by the time these symptoms are visible, the plant is already dead or dying. and the culprit pathogen may have already spread to nearby plants, threatening the health of the entire crop. "the key is to give farmers the ability to get early diagnostic results, which allows them to take action before it's too late," said mcmurray. gtri's micro gas chromatograph is a gc-on-chip device. its separation column, where the gas interacts with the polymer coated on the interior walls, is about the size of a quarter, and the thermal conductive detector is about half the size of a penny. when the two are combined, the device itself is about the size of a 9-volt battery. mcmurray said the goal is to be able to fit dozens of micro gcs on a ground robot that a farmer could then use in crop fields to take samples from plant to plant and get results in minutes. "the idea is to have the robot be a mobile chemical laboratory that provides real-time data to the farmer. the robot provides a simple way to collect the data in an unstructured environment like a farm," said mcmurray. because all plants and pathogens emit volatile organic compounds (vocs), these emissions can be used as chemical markers for rapid detection. building the micro gc was the easy part, said jie xu, gtri senior research scientist. the challenge now, she explained, is correlating the vocs emitted from plants to their health status. "it's relatively easy to detect vocs, but we still have a long way to go to interpret changes in plant voc mixtures," said xu. the difficulty lies in understanding how plants react to local environmental conditions. for example, changes in temperature, humidity, and soil moisture and nutrient levels, all have an effect on voc emissions. to determine if the emissions are due to a pathogen, a chemical signature has to be established by studying vocs released under these different environmental conditions. researchers plan to conduct field tests using a benchtop model of the micro gc in summer 2014. working with colleagues at the usda's agricultural research service, they will test peach trees for peachtree root rot disease at the southeastern fruit and tree nut research laboratory in byron, ga. the goal is to collect air and soil samples that can be analyzed to identify the disease's chemical signature. mcmurray said a portion of the collected samples will be retained for additional laboratory tests with a traditional gc-ms to confirm the effectiveness of the micro gc. the team will then pursue efforts to integrate it into an autonomous robotic platform for crop field sampling and voc data analysis. "real-time data from sensing technologies like the micro gc, when used in conjunction with other data collected on the farm, could revolutionize the ability of farmers to identify sick plants before any physical symptoms appear," added mcmurray. earlier detection also means earlier intervention, which could ultimately translate into a boon for america's farmers. "if we could cut in half the 12 percent of crop losses due to diseases, farmers could potentially realize billions of dollars more in revenue each year," said mcmurray. in addition to agricultural applications, the micro gc could potentially be used for homeland security monitoring to detect chemical threats, such as gases in subways and dangerous explosives in vehicles. the micro gc project is being conducted in collaboration with researchers at gtri, georgia tech's george w. woodruff school of mechanical engineering and the parker h. petit institute for bioengineering and bioscience, the department of plant pathology in the university of georgia's college of agricultural and environmental sciences, and the usda's agricultural research service.

 cancer spreads via circulating tumor cells (ctcs) that travel through the blood to other organs, and they are nearly impossible to track. now, researchers at the georgia institute of technology have found a detection method that could revolutionize cancer treatment by showing how cancers metastasize and what stage they are. this could lead to earlier and more targeted treatment, beginning with a simple blood test. 
 when a tumor starts metastasizing, it sheds its cell into the blood. an individual cell often doesn't survive the bloodstream on its own, but clusters of cells are much more robust and can travel to other organs, effectively pushing the cancer to a metastatic state. 
 ctcs have proven difficult to study, let alone treat. blood contains billions of cells per milliliter, and only a handful of those cells would be ctcs in a patient with metastatic cancer. such intense filtration has been inaccessible using conventional lab methods. most traditional filtration is too aggressive and would break the cluster back into single cells and ruin the ability to study the effect of a cluster. 
 "that's what got engineers like me interested in this because we are really good at creating sensors, or small devices that actually do sensitive analysis," said 
 school of electrical and computer engineering 
 associate professor 
 fatih sarioglu . "we started developing technologies to catch these precious cells to help manage cancer better." 
 sarioglu presented the research in " high throughput, label-free isolation of circulating tumor cell clusters in meshed microwells ," recently published in 
 nature 
 co mmunications. 
 creating the cluster-well 
 sarioglu's lab invented a new type of chip called the cluster-well, combining the precision of microfluidic chips with the efficiency of membrane filtration to find ctc clusters. using micron-sized features, microfluidic chips can precisely locate each cell in a blood sample and determine if it's cancerous. 
 "microfluidic chips give you more control as a designer to actually ask whatever question that you want to ask those cells," sarioglu said. "it increases the precision and sensitivity, which is what you need for an application like this because you want to find that single cell out of many blood cells." 
 to rapidly process a clinically relevant volume of blood, the researchers relied on membrane filtration to make the chip operation more scalable. in effect, the chip looks like a standard membrane filter, but under an electron microscope the microfluidic chip reveals its delicate structure used to capture clusters while letting other blood cells pass through. 
 practicality was just as important as functionality to the researchers. although the chip is initially fabricated with silicon just like a central processing unit in a computer, it is later transferred to polymers to make it accessible, affordable, and single-use, while still retaining its delicacy and precision. 
 "we really created only the traps that we need to have for recognizing the clusters with the microfluidic chip, and the rest is just a standard filter holder," sarioglu said. "compared to a conventional microfluidic chip, you will get a much more practical assay with orders of magnitude improvement in throughput and a higher sensitivity." 
 analyzing patient tumor cell clusters 
 the researchers used the chip to screen blood samples from patients with ovarian or prostate cancers through a partnership with the emory and northside hospitals. they isolated ctc clusters ranging from two to 100 or more cells from prostate and ovarian cancer patients and used rna sequencing to analyze a subset. 
 the chip's unique design means ctc clusters are filtered in microwells and can later be accessed for further analysis. even a single ctc can contain a significant amount of data on the patient and their specific cancer, which can be critical for managing the disease. for example, the researchers noted hundreds of ctcs in clusters in the blood of ovarian cancer patients, some still alive, a finding that could be consequential to the spread of the disease. 
 also, by sequencing the rna in prostate ctc clusters isolated by the chip, the researchers identified specific genes expressed by these metastasizing cells. importantly, ctc clusters from different patients were shown to express different genes, which can be potentially utilized to develop personalized, targeted therapies. sarioglu envisions cluster-wells as being a routine part of the treatment process to determine what stage the cancer is at from a simple blood draw. 
 "finding these clusters was very elusive," sarioglu said. "but this is a technology that allows these precious circulating tumor cell clusters virtually in any cancer to be accessed with precision and practicality that has not been possible before."

-0.7386 STEM new device captures metastasis-associated circulating tumor cell clusters 
 a new microfluidic device for capturing rare circulating tumor cells (ctcs) is the first designed specifically to capture clusters of two or more cells.

 the latest version of a microfluidic device for capturing rare circulating tumor cells (ctcs) is the first designed specifically to capture clusters of two or more cells, rather than single cells. the new device, called the cluster-chip, was developed by the same massachusetts general hospital (mgh) research team that created previous microchip-based devices. recent studies by mgh investigators and others have suggested that ctc clusters are significantly more likely to cause metastases than single circulating tumor cells. the device is described in a 
 nature methods 
 paper that was published online may 18. among the members of the research team is 
 fatih sarioglu , now an assistant professor in the 
 school of electrical and computer engineering 
 at georgia tech. "early theories of cancer metastasis were based on clumps of tumor cells traveling through the bloodstream, but given that ctc clusters are even rarer in the blood than single ctcs, they have attracted minimal attention for several decades," explained mehmet toner, phd, director of the biomicroelectromechanical systems resource center in the mgh center for engineering in medicine, the paper's senior author. "the ability to isolate intact clusters will enable is to investigate carefully their role in the metastatic process, and understanding metastasis really is the ‘holy grail' of cancer research." ctcs are living solid tumor cells found in the bloodstream at extremely low levels - about one in a billion cells. starting in 2007, mgh researchers have developed three microchip-based devices that capture ctcs in ways that preserve molecular information that can help guide clinical treatment. the first two versions used antibodies directed at specific proteins on the surface of tumor cells, which limited the ability to capture cells that may have lost those marker proteins during the process of metastasis. the third version, developed in 2013, uses antigen-independent methods of isolating ctcs, which is also the case for the cluster-chip. "cancer is an extremely heterogeneous disease, and even within the same tumor you can find cells with different surface antigens," said sarioglu, co-lead author of the 
 nature methods 
 paper. "since we are capturing clusters because of their physical properties, this chip is directly applicable to all types of cancer." sarioglu explained that the strategy behind the design of the chip is based on the physical properties of clusters of cells. the 3- by 1 ½-inch plastic chip through which a blood sample is passed consists of rows of triangular microposts arranged in such a way that clusters passing between two posts will become trapped on the apex of a third central post and held in place by the balanced flow of fluid on either side. single ctcs and blood cells will pass right through without being captured. in addition, passing the sample through the device at a slow rate minimizes the possibility that clusters will be broken, distorted or escape. initial testing of the cluster-chip with blood samples to which artificially formed tumor cell clusters had been introduced helped to determine the optimal flow rate to capture the most clusters in the least time. the researchers then compared the new device to the second-generation hbctc-chip, which relies on known cell-surface markers and was the first to isolate ctc clusters. the cluster-chip proved to be 40 to 50 percent better at finding clusters of cells expressing targeted markers and 100 percent better at capturing cells without target antigens. while initial attempts to release captured clusters from the device by simply reversing the fluid flow had limited success, the investigators found that reducing the temperature of the device itself to 4 degrees celsius (39 f) not only released 80 percent of clusters, but also improved the purity of the captured material by reducing the undesired capture of white blood cells. use of the cluster-clip to test blood samples from 60 patients with either breast cancer, melanoma or prostate cancer successfully captured ctc clusters in from 30 to 40 percent of samples. analysis of captured clusters revealed they consisted of cells with significant molecular differences, some actively proliferating and other relatively quiescent, and were often accompanied by immune cells, an observation that could have important implications with the increased attention to immune-system-based cancer therapies. "testing of patient blood samples also revealed that there were significantly more ctc clusters in the blood than was previously believed," said toner. "we now are looking at ways to improve further the release of captured clusters, but we are only at the beginning of our quest to understand the role and biology of ctc clusters. eventually we could develop ways to target clusters therapeutically as well as using them as a source of diagnostic information." toner is the the benedict professor of surgery at harvard medical school. "this new isolation device will be particularly useful in isolating clusters of ctcs, which seem to be the most malignant and metastasis-prone types of cancer cells in the blood," said daniel haber, md, director of the mgh cancer center and a co-author of the nature methods paper. "i'm particularly excited by the way in which the device was created - starting from a clinical and biological observation about the importance of these ctc clusters and then designing a specific microfluidic device to capture these cells, which will make it possible to study them in greater detail." nicola aceto, phd, of the mgh cancer center is co-lead author of the nature methods paper. support for the current study includes grants from the national institutes of health, the national institute of biomedical imaging and bioengineering, a "dream team" grant from stand up to cancer, the howard hughes medical institute, the prostate cancer foundation, the charles evans foundation, and johnson and johnson. the mgh has filed a patent application for the cluster-chip. the

-0.9805 STEM new georgia tech research may help combat abusive online comments 
 researchers at georgia tech have found a more cost-effective way for internet communities to moderate abusive content. 
 may 09, 2017 
 - atlanta, ga 
 researchers at the georgia institute of technology's 
 school of interactive computing 
 have come up with a novel computational approach that could provide a more cost- and resource-effective way for internet communities to moderate abusive content. 
 they call it the 
 bag of communities 
 (boc), a technique that leverages large-scale, preexisting data from other internet communities to train an algorithm to identify abusive behavior within a separate target community. 
 specifically, they identified nine different communities. five, such as the free-for-all of internet communities 4chan, are rife with abusive behavior from commenters; four, like the heavily moderated metafilter, are helpful, positive, and supportive. 
 using linguistic characteristics from these two types of communities, researchers built an algorithm that can learn from the comments and, when a new post is generated within a target community, it can make a prediction of whether or not it is abusive. 
 "metafilter is known around the internet as a good, helpful, supportive community," said 
 eric gilbert , an associate professor in the school of interactive computing and a member of the team of researchers on the project. "that's an example of how, if your post is closer to that, it's more likely that it should stay on the site. conversely, if your post is closer to 4chan, then maybe it should come off." 
 the researchers provide two algorithms. one is a static model, off the shelf with no training examples from the target community, and can achieve roughly 75 percent accuracy. in other words, with access only to posts from the other nine communities, the algorithm can accurately predict abusive posts in the target community roughly three quarters of the time. 
 "a new community that does not have enough resources to actually build automated algorithms to detect abusive content could use the static model," said georgia tech doctoral student 
 eshwar chandrasekharan , who led the team. 
 a dynamic model, one that mimics scenarios in which newly moderated data arrives in batches, learns over time and can achieve 91.18 percent accuracy after seeing 100,000 human-moderated posts. 
 "over time, as new moderator labels come in, when it has seen examples of things that have been moderated from the site, it can learn more site-specific information," chandrasekharan said. "it can learn the type of comments that get moderated, and if there is a level of tolerance that is different from what you see in the static model, it could learn that over time." 
 both the static and dynamic models outperformed a solely in-domain model from a major internet community. 
 anyone who has managed an online community has encountered problems with abusive content from users. from social media to message boards to comments sections in online news publications, regulating what is and isn't allowed has become overly costly and taxing on existing human moderators. 
 founders at social media startup yik yak spent months of their early time removing hate speech, and twitter has stated publicly that dealing with abusive behavior remains its most pressing challenge. a number of major news agencies are buried under the demands of strict moderation, and many have shut down comments sections altogether. 
 prior research into abuse detection and online content moderation has focused on in-domain methods - using data collected from within your own community - but those face challenges in obtaining enough data to build and evaluate algorithms. in a boc-based method, algorithms would leverage out-of-domain data from other existing online communities. 
 gilbert said that the applications from such a model could be widespread. 
 "this is a core internet problem," he said. "so many places struggle with this, and many are shutting comments off because they just don't want to deal with the trouble they cause." 
 this research is presented in a paper ( the bag of communities: identifying abusive behavior online with preexisting internet data ) at the 
 association for computing machinery chi conference on human factors in computing systems 2017 .

-0.9887 STEM new grant award supports research on early detection of ovarian cancer 
 research on the early detection of ovarian cancer will get a boost from a new award from the prevent cancer foundation. 
 the prevent cancer foundation has made a significant grant award to georgia tech to advance research on detecting ovarian cancer. the work is led by john mcdonald, a professor in the school of biological sciences. (credit: rob felt, georgia tech) 
 feb 26, 2019 
 - atlanta, ga 
 promising research toward what could become the first simple and accurate test for the early detection of ovarian cancer could be validated - and expanded - thanks to a significant grant from the prevent cancer foundation. 
 if validated, the general technique for the work could also have a variety of other applications. "in my dream world, a single blood test could be used to screen for multiple diseases," said 
 john mcdonald , the leader of the research and a professor in the 
 school of biological sciences 
 at the georgia institute of technology. 
 ovarian cancer is especially dangerous because women often don't show symptoms until the disease is in an advanced stage and difficult to treat. in contrast, when caught early "about 94 percent of patients live longer than five years after diagnosis," according to the american cancer society. 
 the problem is that there is no good test for detecting the disease at an early stage. 
 about seven years ago mcdonald and colleagues decided to see if they could change that by merging the disparate disciplines of biology, analytical chemistry and computer science. "bringing the computer into it was novel at the time," said mcdonald, who is also director of georgia tech's integrated cancer research center. 
 his georgia tech collaborators on the initial work were professor facundo fernández, the vasser woolley foundation chair in bioanalytical chemistry, and alex gray, an assistant professor of computer science (gray has since left georgia tech to become vp for artificial intelligence science at ibm). they were joined by clinical consultant dr. benedict benigno, a gynecological oncologist and ceo of the ovarian cancer institute in atlanta. 
 promising results 
 the researchers initially analyzed blood samples from 49 healthy women and 46 with early-stage ovarian cancer. they specifically focused on metabolites in those samples. metabolites are molecules like fatty acids that our cells produce through enzymatic reactions. 
 in the molecular equivalent of finding needles in a haystack, they proceeded to analyze some 40,000 metabolites to see if there were any associated with the cancer patients that differed from those in samples from the healthy women. these could be biomarkers for the disease; molecules to screen for in an annual test. 
 through a variety of techniques, the team first pared down the original thousands of metabolites to a collection of 255 candidate biomarkers. they then applied machine learning to that set, asking the computer to find any metabolites that were over- or under-expressed in the cancer samples. 
 "that's what machine learning is all about," mcdonald said. "the computer is simply looking for correlations in very large data sets, then it comes back to you with what it has found." 
 in 2015 the team reported in the journal scientific reports the discovery of 16 metabolites that could distinguish women with ovarian cancer from those without the disease with 100 percent accuracy. "basically we modeled the face of cancer at the metabolic level," mcdonald said. 
 moving forward 
 with the new $100,000 grant, the researchers hope to validate their earlier work with samples from some 1,000 women, as compared to the roughly 100 they originally studied. the new study will also include samples from a much more diverse set of women (the original samples were from caucasian women). 
 they also aim to expand the work to look for biomarkers associated with different types of ovarian cancer. "we want to be able to distinguish between a type ii cancer with high malignant potential - one that's highly likely to spread outside the ovary - and a type i with low malignant potential. a cancer with high malignant potential you'd want to treat right away, while a cancer with low malignant potential might not require immediate surgery," mcdonald said. 
 in conclusion, mcdonald said, "it's exciting because the initial results look like [our approach] might work."

-0.9746 STEM new research gives users another reason to hate unwanted ads 
 cybersecurity researchers show how attackers can see your online ads knowing only your email address 
 nov 10, 2022 
 - atlanta, ga 
 new research released this week reveals the process used by third party advertisers to target online users can be viewed or manipulated by online adversaries using only their target's email address. 
 a four-person team of researchers from the georgia institute of technology, university of illinois chicago (uic), and new york university (nyu) presented their findings wednesday at the acm conference on computer and communications security (ccs), a premier security venue. 
 today, much of the advertising that appears online is specifically tailored to individuals based on their browsing history, location, and a variety of other factors that have been collected by third party advertising networks. 
 this data is collected by tracking cookies, which are sent out by third party ad networks and correlated with unique identifiers like email addresses. these cookies allow advertisers to create extensive profiles of internet users, however as the researchers found, this system can be influenced by bad actors. 
 once an attacker knows a user's email address, they can tap into the information being collected by any third-party advertiser observing a specific user's targeted ad stream. this could allow bad actors insight into to an individual's detailed browsing history, such as online retailers and travel websites. 
 "third party ad networks have no direct relationship with users. thus, if they want to track user activity across devices, they must rely on identity information, such as email addresses, given to them from other various websites," said 
 paul pearce , assistant professor in the 
 school of cybersecurity and privacy 
 (scp) at georgia tech. "our work shows the way that information is passed to the ad networks is both insecure and hard to verify. if an attacker knows a victim's email address, they can lie to the ad network pretending to be a user, leading to very real privacy problems." 
 the researchers describe this susceptibility as advertising identity entanglement and it happens when attackers confuse ad networks into correlating the attacker's tracking cookies with a targeted person's email address, looping them into the data being gathered by third parties. as pearce and his colleagues state in their paper, adversaries can also leverage the process to send ads of any kind to their targets. 
 "when i use the internet on my own private device, like a phone or a laptop, i don't expect that anyone who knows my personal email could manipulate what i see," said 
 chris kanich , associate professor at uic. "this attack is particularly disturbing, and i am relieved that i use ad and tracking blockers in my web browsers." 
 to test the scale of this problem, researchers created an artificial users and profile for their experiment, at no time was a real person targeted. by knowing only, the experimental user's email address, the team was able to identify specific items and websites the victim interacted with. 
 along with shopping habits, the test also showed retargeted advertisements can contain sensitive location information. for example, if a victim interacted with some hotel and travel websites, the attacker could then receive retargeted ads for the specific hotel the victim viewed. 
 "an ad network potentially leaking travel plans to anyone with a target's email address is a significant privacy threat and potentially dangerous to people being stalked," said 
 damon mccoy , associate professor at nyu. 
 the researchers indicate that combatting this problem without the support of ad networks is challenging, but ad blockers provide a reasonable initial option to limit exposing a user's private data. mitigation of this threat shouldn't just fall on the users, however. the team also suggests that if third party ad networks encrypted the process of exchanging identity information and ensured the data was verified and correct it would help mitigate the threat. 
 the research was presented at acm ccs'22. the paper, 
 cart-ology: intercepting targeted advertising via ad network identity entanglement , is co-authored by scp ph.d. student 
 changseok oh , kanich, mccoy, and pearce. in accordance with ethical research guidelines, the threat was disclosed to criteo, one of the largest third-party ad networks on the market, as well as yahoo.

-0.9304 STEM new resource for domestic abuse survivors combines ai, cybersecurity, and psychology 
 cybersecurity master's student sneha talwalkar and gtri principal research scientist courtney crooks are working to build the framework of an ai tool with the goal of providing support and protection to domestic abuse survivors. 
 cybersecurity master's student& sneha talwalkar (left)& and& gtri principal research scientist& courtney crooks& (right) are working to bring relief to survivors of domestic abuse by building on developments recently made in cognitive security.& (photos by kevin beasley / college of computing) 
 sep 27, 2023 
 georgia tech researchers are working to create a new software tool powered by artificial intelligence (ai) to address the under-researched area of digital security and domestic abuse. 
 these areas frequently overlap with abusers often using the internet and mobile technology to extend the reach of their abuse. however, the smaller scale of these online attacks has resulted in less attention from security researchers. 
 by building on developments recently made in cognitive security, principal research scientist  courtney crooks  and graduate student  sneha talwalkar  are working to bring relief to survivors of domestic abuse. 
 the impact of domestic abuse, otherwise called intimate partner violence (ipv), on public health is something that crooks has been studying for several years through research and practice in her role as a licensed psychologist and researcher. 
 after seeing how new technology opened new methods of abuse online, crooks realized she could help fill in the gaps in this research space using her experience working with the georgia tech research institute, the  school of cybersecurity and privacy  (scp) at georgia tech, and the  emory university school of medicine . 
 to get what they want, abusers try to change their victim's state of mind through cognitive manipulation and use different tactics to do so. crooks decided to explore ways to help ipv survivors counteract these enhanced technology-enabled cognitive security risks as they progressed through their recovery. 
 the software crooks and talwalkar are working to develop would alert survivors to these potential or observed abuses by leveraging well-known, developmentally appropriate, psychologically based learning strategies. the tool will focus solely on the unique risks faced by ipv survivors. applying human-centered design principles and ethical standards to the ai design will be a top priority for the team. 
 the team is working to develop ai-assisted interventions that are psychologically informed and made specifically to focus on the unique risks faced by survivors. these interventions will be designed to take place alongside traditional methods of support, such as mental health and community resources. 
 "it's important to understand that abusive relationships are complicated. while some people can escape them, many can't," said crooks. "or they may physically escape, but resources like their phones, online accounts, or finances may still be vulnerable to their abusers. survivors may also need to continue to communicate with their abuser, like in instances in which they share children." 
 regardless of circumstances, it is often difficult for survivors to stop communicating with their abusers once they escape the relationship. this inability to disconnect is because of the psychological connections reinforced while they were with their former partner. 
 the ai technologies crooks and talwalkar propose will not act like a chatgpt chatbot. instead, it will act like a coach, learning from abusive behavior tactics and potential survivor responses. 
 the tool will then make suggestions based on each user's specific recovery progress and goals while factoring in potential risks. to improve its coaching performance and general knowledge base, the ai will continue to learn from the outcome of each incident survivors face. 
 "the model provides the necessary intervention to assist in the recovery of an ipv survivor," said talwalkar. "we want to use artificial intelligence for good, and this project is a step in that direction." 
 the classes in the scp master's program played a pivotal role in shaping talwalkar's research in this area. while exploring internet censorship and language models, she recognized the emerging challenges posed by ai in security. after an insightful conversation with scp professor peter swire, talwalkar gained the confidence to shift her focus towards investigating malicious intent in immersive environments. with crooks' guidance, she began exploring the socio-technical environment of ipv. 
 designing user-centered artificial intelligence to assist in recovery from domestic abuse  was accepted as an extended abstract and presented to the 2023 world congress computer science, computer engineering, and applied computing event this summer. proceedings of the ieee is publishing the work in an upcoming issue. 
 in may, crooks, talwalkar, and others from their research team presented their findings at the health sciences research day hosted on the emory university campus by the emory school of medicine. crooks presented her study of the lived experience of coercive control in domestic abuse, from which this current research is derived, at the february 2023 national meeting of the american psychoanalytic association.

 buliding and maintaining robots, let alone at entire robotics lab, is unaffordable or impractical for many researchers around the world. that's why georgia tech is opening a new lab that allows greater access to everyone. 
 the robotarium , a $2.5 million lab funded by the national science foundation (nsf) and office of naval research, contains nearly 100 rolling and flying swarm robots. researchers can write their own computer programs, upload them, then get the results as the georgia tech machines carry out the commands. they also receive video evidence and data of the experiment. 
 the project is a vision of magnus egerstedt, the julian t. hightower chair in systems and controls and a professor in the school of electrical and computer engineering. the road to this month's ribbon cutting was filled with 
 technological problem-solving, a few near disasters and k-12 theft .

-0.9578 liberal arts new study reveals racial, ethnic disparities in use of increasingly popular prostate cancer test 
 the study found that black men were at least 23.6% less likely than their white counterparts to receive an mri exam following an elevated prostate-specific antigen blood test. 
 nov 08, 2021 
 - atlanta, ga 
 black, hispanic, and asian men whose results on a common prostate cancer screening test indicated a need for additional testing were less likely than their white counterparts to receive an increasingly used follow-up test that can eliminate the need for an invasive biopsy, according to researchers in the 
 health economics and analytics lab 
 (heal) at georgia tech's school of economics. 
 their 
 study , published nov. 8, 2021, in 
 jama network open, 
 found that black men were at least 23.6% less likely than their white counterparts to receive an mri exam following a prostate-specific antigen (psa) blood test, a common initial screening for men between the ages of 55 and 69. the study also found that hispanic and asian men with elevated psa results were significantly less likely to be referred for mri evaluation. 
 while biopsies have long been the next treatment step for some men with elevated psa results, prostate mris are increasingly being used to reduce the need for that invasive procedure. 
 while the reason for the disparities is beyond the scope of the paper, the results are nevertheless concerning, particularly in light of previous research that has shown disparities in how physicians treat patients of color when compared to their white patients, said 
 danny hughes , professor in the ivan allen college of liberal arts 
 school of economics . 
 "we can't say definitively if the reason black, hispanic, and asian men did not receive this particular test is that physicians did not refer them for it, or if the patients opted themselves out of further testing," hughes said. "regardless, these disparities do highlight the need to understand what is happening and how to ensure patients of all races and ethnicities receive the best possible care." 
 the findings are particularly troubling in light of the 
 elevated risk 
 black men face from prostate cancer - previous studies have found black men are 
 more likely 
 to get prostate cancer, often get the disease earlier in life, and are more likely to die from it. 
 black, asian, hispanic men from 23.6% to 67.6% less likely to receive mris 
 the study was conducted as part of a long-term heal research collaboration between hughes and dr. richard duszak, a professor at emory university's school of medicine. former heal postdoctoral researcher nino abashidze, now of the university of wyoming, chad stecher of arizona state university, and dr. andrew b. rosenkrantz of the nyu langone medical center also collaborated on the project. 
 hughes' lab, heal, uses big-data analytics to reveal emerging patterns in healthcare utilization with the aim of benefitting patients and providers. such work is an increasing emphasis in the 
 ivan allen college of liberal arts , of which the 
 school of economics i s a unit. 
 for the study, the authors examined anonymous health insurance claims data covering 50 u.s. states looking for men who took psa blood tests. they identified 794,809 psa tests that had laboratory results available. they then looked for matching records indicating whether or not the men received a follow-on mri based on varying levels of psa identified in each man's blood. higher levels are associated with potential cancer. 
 although medical standards for the use of prostate mris continue to emerge, studies have revealed thresholds that warrant further investigation, and those are the levels the heal study examined. they are 4 ng / ml, historically considered the threshold for recommending prostate biopsy; 2.5 ng / ml, a more recently recognized threshold for the early detection of prostate cancer; and 10 ng / ml, a level that has been associated with higher rates of biopsies and cancer diagnoses. 
 the researchers found that: 
 black patients between the ages of 40 and 54 with a psa above 4 ng / ml were 39.8% less likely to get a prostate mri than white patients. black men between 65 and 74 whose psa results were above 4 ng / ml were 23.6% less likely to get a follow-up mri. those above 10 ng / ml were 43.9% less likely. 
 black men between the ages of 65 and 74 with results above the 4 ng / ml threshold were 23.6% less likely to get an mri when compared to white patients. men in this age group with scores above 10 ng / ml were 43.9% less likely to get the mri exam. 
 asian patients between 55 and 64 with results above 2.5 ng / ml were 57.3 percent less likely to receive a prostate mri as compared to white patients. asian men with scores above 4 ng / ml were 62.9% less likely. 
 hispanic men from 55 to 64 with psa results above 10ng / ml - the level most closely associated with biopsies and cancer diagnoses - were 67.6% less likely to get the mri test. 
 understanding the cause of the disparities 
 hughes and his colleagues are now turning their attention to understanding the cause of the disparities. the data used in the study do not reveal the reasons men did, or did not, receive referrals for mris. 
 it could be that patients who did not get the mris opted out of the tests, including some who may have instead been referred to receive the invasive biopsy test, despite the problems that can be associated with those tests. or, hughes said, the results may be further confirmation of previous studies that have shown significant biases among physicians in how they care for black, hispanic, and asian patients compared to their white patients. 
 previous studies have shown, for instance, that doctors are less likely to discuss treatment options and side effects with black patients when compared to their white counterparts. 
 "we need to understand more about the role of decision-making biases in physicians, as well as other potential factors in the health care system that could account for the disparities we are seeing in this study," hughes said. 
 the study, "racial / ethnic disparities in the use of prostate mri following an elevated prostate-specific antigen test," was published nov. 8, 2021. it is available at http: / / doi.org / 10.1001 / jamanetworkopen.2021.32388.

-0.4767 STEM niaid supports transplant imaging research at georgia tech and emory 
 researchers are exploring non-invasive imaging for the detection of immune rejection. 
 with kidney and liver transplant patients in mind, emory and georgia tech researchers are exploring non-invasive imaging for the detection of immune rejection. with "immunopet," they can see particular types of immune cells infiltrating a transplanted organ. 
 aug 03, 2017 
 - atlanta, ga 
 the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases has awarded emory and georgia tech investigators a $2.4 million, five-year grant to study non-invasive imaging to detect immune rejection of transplanted organs. 
 when transplant recipients see their doctors, they undergo tests to check whether their immune system is damaging their new organs. these are usually blood tests that check for kidney or liver function, at least to begin with. but to diagnose immune rejection, a biopsy is required. 
 andrew adams, md, phd, assistant professor of surgery at emory university school of medicine, and phil santangelo, phd, associate professor in the wallace h. coulter department of biomedical engineering at georgia tech and emory, are proposing to use pet (positron emission tomography) instead. 
 pet is already used to diagnose heart disease and monitor cancer. using a variant called "immunopet," the researchers can see particular types of immune cells infiltrating the transplanted organ. the grant is for work with mice and non-human primates, but adams envisions benefits for transplant medicine: earlier detection of rejection and reduction of risk associated with biopsies. 
 "patients often require multiple biopsies to assess response to treatment, thus putting them at risk of complications each time they undergo a separate procedure," adams says. "in addition, a biopsy only samples a small part of the transplanted organ." 
 santangelo, in collaboration with tab ansari, phd at emory, francois villinger, dvm / phd at the univerity of louisiana at lafayette and researchers from the nih, has used a similar approach to study the persistence of siv infection in non-human primates, which could guide efforts to suppress hiv infection for long periods without antiretroviral drugs. the research also builds upon work by adams on improved post-transplant drug regimens. 
 "immunopet clearly has the potential to characterize immune cell dynamics in the face of allograft rejection.  this work could also open the door to the use of pet in fields such as cancer immunotherapy," santangelo says. written by quinn eastman, emory university

-0.9865 STEM once overlooked, uninitialized-use ‘bugs' may provide portal for hacker attacks 
 new georgia tech research has determined that simple memory errors in linux can be reliably exploited by hackers. 
 mar 01, 2017 
 - atlanta, ga 
 popular with programmers the world over for its stability, flexibility and security, linux now appears to be vulnerable to hackers. 
 according to new georgia institute of technology research, uninitialized variables ­- largely overlooked bugs mostly regarded as insignificant memory errors - are actually a critical attack vector that can be reliably exploited by hackers to launch privilege escalation attacks in the linux kernel. 
 when successful, these intrusions give attackers increasing levels of access to a network's resources. 
 "while other kernel bugs and vulnerabilities have been examined and remedied, uninitialized-use bugs are not well studied, and to date, no practical defense mechanisms have been developed to protect against these attacks," said georgia tech ph.d. student 
 kangjie lu , lead researcher on the project. 
 in fact, despite potentially dangerous consequences, uninitialized-use bugs are seldom even classified as security vulnerabilities. 
 to prove that these bugs do present a security risk, researchers developed a novel approach, known as targeted stack spraying, to attack the operating system (os) kernel. 
 along with a technique that occupies large portions of the memory to control the stack, the automated attack probes the stack to find weaknesses that user-mode programs can exploit to direct kernel code paths and leave attacker-controlled data on the kernel stack. ultimately, the goal of this attack is to reliably control the value of a specific uninitialized variable in the kernel space of a running program. 
 the research findings confirm that hackers using this method can automatically prepare a malicious pointer in the uninitialized variable. when the malicious pointer is used, a privilege escalation attack targeting the linux kernel may occur. 
 "our research shows that utilizing the targeted stack-spraying approach allows attackers to reliably control more than 91 percent of the linux kernel stack, which, in combination with uninitialized-use vulnerabilities, suffices for a privilege escalation attack," said lu. 
 not content to merely identify the vulnerability, lu and his fellow researchers also developed a potential solution to the problem. 
 "our mitigation approach leverages the fact that uninitialized-use attacks usually control an uninitialized pointer to achieve arbitrary read / write / execution," explained lu. "by zero-initializing pointer-type fields that the compiler cannot prove are properly initialized before they are used, we can prevent an adversary from controlling these pointers." 
 to limit any unnecessary performance overhead related to zero-initializing pointer-type fields, the team developed an intra-procedural program analysis that checks whether a pointer field is properly initialized when it is used. only uninitialized pointer fields require zero initialization. 
 a paper titled 
 unleashing use-before-initialization vulnerabilities in the linux kernel using targeted stack spraying 
 is being presented this week at the 
 network and distributed system security symposium 
 being held in san diego, calif.

 a new decision support tool could help clinicians choose the right chemotherapy drugs.

 - atlanta, ga 
 the selection of a first-line chemotherapy drug to treat many types of cancer is often a clear-cut decision governed by standard-of-care protocols, but what drug should be used next if the first one fails? 
 that's where georgia institute of technology researchers believe their new open source decision support tool could come in. using machine learning to analyze rna expression tied to information about patient outcomes with specific drugs, the open source tool could help clinicians chose the chemotherapy drug most likely to attack the disease in individual patients. 
 in a study using rna analysis data from 152 patient records, the system predicted the chemotherapy drug that had provided the best outcome 80 percent of the time. the researchers believe the system's accuracy could further improve with inclusion of additional patient records along with information such as family history and demographics. 
 "by looking at rna expression in tumors, we believe we can predict with high accuracy which patients are likely to respond to a particular drug," said 
 john mcdonald , a professor in the georgia tech 
 school of biological sciences 
 and director of its 
 integrated cancer research center . "this information could be used, along with other factors, to support the decisions clinicians must make regarding chemotherapy treatment." 
 the research, which could add another component to precision medicine for cancer treatment, was reported november 6 in the journal 
 scientific reports . the work was supported in part by the atlanta-based ovarian cancer institute, the georgia research alliance, and a national institutes of health fellowship. 
 as with other machine learning decision support tools, the researchers first "trained" their system using one part of a data set, then tested its operation on the remaining records. in developing the system, the researchers obtained records of rna from tumors, along with with the outcome of treatment with specific drugs. with only about 152 such records available, they first used data from 114 records to train the system. they then used the remaining 38 records to test the system's ability to predict, based on the rna sequence, which chemotherapy drugs would have been the most likely to be useful in shrinking tumors. 
 the research began with ovarian cancer, but to expand the data set, the research team decided to include data from other cancer types - lung, breast, liver and pancreatic cancers - that use the same chemotherapy drugs and for which the rna data was available. "our model is predicting based on the drug and looking across all the patients who were treated with that drug regardless of cancer type," mcdonald said. 
 the system produces a chart comparing the likelihood that each drug will have an effect on a patient's specific cancer. if the system were to be used in a clinical setting, mcdonald believes doctors would use the predictions along with other critical patient information. 
 because it measures the expression levels for genes, analysis of rna could have an advantage over sequencing of dna, though both types of information could be useful in choosing a drug therapy, he said. the cost of rna analysis is declining and could soon cost less than a mammogram, mcdonald said. 
 the system will be made available as open source software, and mcdonald's team hopes hospitals and cancer centers will try it out. ultimately, the tool's accuracy should improve as more patient data is analyzed by the algorithm. he and his collaborators believe the open source approach offers the best path to moving the algorithm into clinical use. 
 "to really get this into clinical practice, we think we've got to open it up so that other people can try it, modify if they want to, and demonstrate its value in real-world situations," mcdonald said. "we are trying to create a different paradigm for cancer therapy using the kind of open source strategy used in internet technology." 
 open source coding allows many experts across multiple fields to review the software, identify faults and recommend improvements, said 
 fredrik vannberg , an assistant professor in the georgia tech 
 school of biological sciences . "most importantly, that means the software is no longer a black box where you can't see inside. the code is openly shared for anybody to improve and check for potential issues." 
 vannberg envisions using the decision-support tool to create "virtual tumor boards" that would bring together broad expertise to examine rna data from patients worldwide. 
 "the hope would be to provide this kind of analysis for any new cancer patient who has this kind of rna analysis done," he added. "we could have a consensus of dozens of the smartest people in oncology and make them available for each patient's unique situation." 
 the tool is available on the open source github repository for download and use. hospitals and cancer clinics may install the software and use it without sharing their results, but the researchers hope organizations using the software will help the system improve. 
 "the accuracy of machine learning will improve not only as the amount of training data increases, but also as the diversity within that data increases," said evan clayton, a ph.d. student in the georgia tech school of biological sciences. "there's potential for improvement by including dna data, demographic information and patient histories. the model will incorporate any information if it helps predict the success of specific drugs." 
 in addition to those already mentioned, the research team included cai huang, lilya matyunina, and deette mcdonald from the georgia tech school of biological sciences, and benedict benigno from the georgia tech integrated cancer research center and the ovarian cancer institute. 
 support for the project came from the ovarian cancer institute, and equipment used was provided by the georgia research alliance. in addition, the national institutes of health supported a graduate fellowship.

-0.9965 STEM ovarian cancer cells are more aggressive on soft tissues 
 a new study has found that ovarian cancer cells are more aggressive on soft tissues due to the mechanical properties of this environment. 
 professor michelle dawson and graduate student daniel mcgrail used traction force microscopy to measure the forces exerted by cancer cells on soft and stiff surfaces. rob felt, georgia institute of technology 
 may 08, 2014 
 - atlanta, ga 
 when ovarian cancer spreads from the ovaries it almost always does so to a layer of fatty tissue that lines the gut. a new study has found that ovarian cancer cells are more aggressive on these soft tissues due to the mechanical properties of this environment. the finding is contrary to what is seen with other malignant cancer cells that seem to prefer stiffer tissues. 
 "what we found is that there are some cancer cells that respond to softness as opposed to stiffness," said 
 michelle dawson , an assistant professor in the school of chemical and biomolecular engineering at the georgia institute of technology. "ovarian cancer cells that are highly metastatic respond to soft environments by becoming more aggressive." ovarian cancer cells spread, or metastasize, by a different method than other cancer cells. breast cancer cells, for example, break off from a solid tumor and flow through the blood until they arrest in small blood vessels. the cancer cells then penetrate the vessel surface to form a tumor. because ovarian tumors are in the abdomen, these cancer cells are shed into the surrounding fluid and not distributed through the blood. they must be able to adhere directly to the fatty tissue that lines the gut, called the omentum, to begin forming a tumor. the new study discovered details about how ovarian cancer cells seem to prefer the mechanical properties of this soft tissue. the study was published in a recent advance online edition of the 
 journal of cell science 
 and was sponsored by the national science foundation and the georgia tech and emory center for regenerative medicine. 
 the research team, led by daniel mcgrail, a graduate student in the dawson lab, found that ovarian cancer cells in vitro were more adherent to a layer of soft fat cells than a layer of stiffer bone cells, and that this behavior was also repeated using gels of similar rigidities. 
 "all the behaviors that we associate with breast cancer cells on these more rigid environments are flipped for ovarian cancer cells," dawson said. after adhering to these soft surfaces, metastatic ovarian cancer cells became more aggressive. their proliferation increased and they were less responsive to chemotherapeutics. the ovarian cancer cells were also more motile on soft surfaces, moving nearly twice as fast as on rigid surfaces. the team also found that less aggressive cells that do not metastasize do not exhibit any of these changes. 
 the researchers used techniques that haven't been traditionally used in the study of ovarian cancer. they measured the force exerted by the cells by tracking the displacement of beads in the environment around the cells. the researchers found that the metastatic cells increased their traction forces - used to generate motion - by three-fold on soft surfaces, but no such change was present in the less aggressive cells. 
 "we think the behavior that metastatic ovarian cancer cells exert on these soft surfaces is representative of the mechanical tropism that they have for these softer tissues in the gut," dawson said. in future work, the researchers will investigate whether ovarian cancer cells have some natural inclination towards this uniquely more aggressive behavior in softer environments. 
 "we're trying to find out whether there is some internal programming that leads to this aggressive behavior," dawson said. this research is supported by the national science foundation under award number 1032527, and the georgia tech and emory center for regenerative medicine under award number 1411304. any conclusions or opinions are those of the authors and do not necessarily represent the official views of the sponsoring agencies. citation : daniel j. mcgrail, et al., "the malignancy of metastatic ovarian cancer cells is increased on soft matrices through a mechanosensitive rho-rock pathway."

-0.9987 STEM personalized medicine best way to treat cancer, study argues 
 a new study found evidence that assessing the route to cancer on a case-by-case basis might make more sense than basing a patient's cancer treatment on commonly disrupted genes and pathways.

 if a driver is traveling to new york city, i-95 might be their route of choice. but they could also take i-78, i-87 or any number of alternate routes. most cancers begin similarly, with many possible routes to the same disease. a new study found evidence that assessing the route to cancer on a case-by-case basis might make more sense than basing a patient's cancer treatment on commonly disrupted genes and pathways.  the study found little or no overlap in the most prominent genetic malfunction associated with each individual patient's disease compared to malfunctions shared among the group of cancer patients as a whole. 
 "this paper argues for the importance of personalized medicine, where we treat each person by looking for the etiology of the disease in patients individually," said 
 john mcdonald , a professor in the school of biology at the georgia institute of technology in atlanta. "the findings have ramifications on how we might best optimize cancer treatments as we enter the era of targeted gene therapy." the research was published february 11 online in the journal 
 pancreas 
 and was funded by the georgia tech foundation and the st. joseph's mercy foundation. in the study, researchers collected cancer and normal tissue samples from four patients with pancreatic cancer and also analyzed data from eight other pancreatic cancer patients that had been previously reported in the scientific literature by a separate research group. 
 mcdonald's team compiled a list of the most aberrantly expressed genes in the cancer tissues isolated from these patients relative to adjacent normal pancreatic tissue. 
 the study found that collectively 287 genes displayed significant differences in expression in the cancers vs normal tissues. twenty-two cellular pathways were enriched in cancer samples, with more than half related to the body's immune response. the researchers ran statistical analyses to determine if the genes most significantly abnormally expressed on an individual patient basis were the same as those identified as most abnormally expressed across the entire group of patients. 
 the researchers found that the molecular profile of each individual cancer patient was unique in terms of the most significantly disrupted genes and pathways. 
 "if you're dealing with a disease like cancer that can be arrived at by multiple pathways, it makes sense that you're not going to find that each patient has taken the same path," mcdonald said. 
 although the researchers found that some genes that were commonly disrupted in all or most of the patients examined, these genes were not among the most significantly disrupted in any individual patient. 
 "by and large, there appears to be a lot of individuality in terms of the molecular basis of pancreatic cancer," said mcdonald, who also serves as the director of the integrated cancer research center and as the chief scientific officer of the ovarian cancer institute. though the study is small, it raises questions about the validity of pinpointing the most important gene or pathway underlying a disease by pooling data from multiple patients, mcdonald said. he favors individual profiling as the preferred method for initiating treatment. the cost of a molecular profiling analysis to transcribe the dna sequences of exons - the parts of the genome that carry instructions for proteins - is about $2,000 (exons account for about two percent of a cell's total dna). that's about half the cost of this analysis five years ago, mcdonald said, and a $1,000 molecular profiling analysis might not be far off. 
 "as costs continue to come down, personalized molecular profiling will be carried out on more cancer patients," mcdonald said. yet cost isn't the only limiting factor, mcdonald said. scientists and doctors have to shift their paradigm on how they use molecular profiling to treat cancer. 
 "are you going to believe what you see for one patient or are you going to say, ‘i can't interpret that data until i group it together with 100 other patients and find what's in common among them,'" mcdonald said. "for any given individual patient there may be mutant genes or aberrant expression patterns that are vitally important for that person's cancer that aren't present in other patients' cancers." future work in mcdonald's lab will see if this pattern of individuality is repeated in larger studies and in patients with different cancers. the group is currently working on a genomic profiling analysis of patients with ovarian and lung cancers. 
 "if there are multiple paths, then maybe individual patients are getting cancer from alternative routes," mcdonald said.

-0.9829 liberal arts poor and disadvantaged people sit in the dark longer after a storm outage 
 the research shows that people in lower socioeconomic tiers wait nearly three hours longer on average for their power to be restored. 
 dec 14, 2023 
 hurricanes and other extreme weather events often affect disadvantaged communities more severely, and extended power outages are some of the most harmful effects. concerns over the intensification of hurricanes has led to new environmental justice policies that aim to mitigate the unequal impacts of major storms. now, policy experts and engineers are directing their attention toward illuminating the causes. 
 researchers at the georgia institute of technology sought to investigate whether socioeconomically vulnerable households experienced longer power outage durations after extreme weather events. the team analyzed data from the top eight major atlantic hurricanes between 2017 and 2020 that knocked out power for over 15 million customers in nine states across the southeastern u.s. the team found that people in lower socioeconomic tiers wait significantly longer to have power restored after a major storm - nearly three hours longer on average. 
 the interdisciplinary research team consists of 
 chuanyi ji , an associate professor in the 
 school of electrical and computer engineering ; scott ganz, a policy researcher at georgetown university and a former georgia tech faculty member; and chenghao duan, a ph.d. student in ji's lab. 
 their research paper, titled " socioeconomic vulnerability and differential impact of severe weather-induced power outages ," was published in the journal 
 pnas nexus . 
 "not only do extreme weather events impact disadvantaged communities more harshly, but power disruption can be dangerous and even life-threatening in certain contexts," ji said.  "those with fewer resources are limited in their ability to evacuate from severe weather situations, and for individuals with electric medical equipment, an extended power outage can be disastrous." 
 ji, who specializes in large-scale data analytics for power grid resilience, has done previous work on power restoration procedures involving infrastructure and utility services, but wanted to expand the work into the realm of communities. the team hypothesized that disadvantaged communities likely wait longer for power to be restored, but to get a realistic picture of the mechanisms at play, the team needed to analyze troves of data. 
 they obtained weather data for eight major hurricanes between 2017 and 2020 from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration and additional flood databases. they also examined power failure data for 15 million customers for the same time period, which spanned nine states, 588 counties, and 108 utility service regions in the southeast. 
 the team used spatial data analytics to model weather impact across regions. they then measured customers' socioeconomic status by using the social vulnerability index, a tool produced by the centers for disease control that considers indicators related to poverty, housing costs, education, health insurance, and other factors to determine socioeconomic status. duan and ji designed the models and estimates, and then analyzed the results to reveal the underlying relationship between customers' socioeconomic status and their power outage durations. 
 their results show that, when comparing affluent communities and poor communities given the same kind of impact from weather events, poor communities experienced power outages that average 170 minutes longer. specifically, they found that a one-decile drop in socioeconomic status is associated with a 6.1% longer outage duration. their results indicate that there is a statistically significant relationship between socioeconomic vulnerability and the duration of time that elapses before power is restored. 
 "our study also tries to rule out some possible explanations for why socioeconomically disadvantaged people take longer to get their power back on," ganz said. "for example, our study controls for population density in a county and the peak number of outages in that county, and we still observe that socioeconomically disadvantaged communities experience longer outages." 
 he theorized that the "primary cause is that poorer communities are also likely to be more distant from critical infrastructure or require more significant repairs to power lines, but these are important questions for future research." 
 the results can have important implications for policymakers, pointing to the necessity of reexamining post-storm recovery and resource allocation policies. service and utility providers approach power recovery by adhering to procedures and regulations that are policy-driven. current research shows that the standard procedures for restoring power following big storms, while procedurally fair, may contribute to unequal outcomes. a greater focus on communities could help to correct the issue. 
 "power grid resilience is not just about the infrastructure and utility companies - it's also about the people they serve," ji said. "success in achieving policy goals depends on our ability to identify the features that contribute most to these unequal impacts, which can in turn help us design appropriate interventions to improve outcomes."

-0.7193 STEM portable uv disinfection chambers could help address ppe shortage 
 portable disinfection chambers that use ultraviolet (uv) light to inactivate virus particles could allow ppe to be quickly disinfected.

 - atlanta, ga 
 portable disinfection chambers that use ultraviolet (uv) light to inactivate virus particles could allow emergency medical technicians, police officers, healthcare workers, pharmacy technicians, and others to quickly disinfect their personal protective equipment (ppe) as they need it. 
 researchers at the 
 georgia tech research institute 
 (gtri) have built two prototype chambers to evaluate ppe disinfection using different sources of uv-c light: mercury vapor lamps and light-emitting diodes (leds). they used the prototypes to evaluate different power levels and disinfection times with a variety of face shields and face masks used to protect workers from the coronavirus. 
 "there are tradeoffs in terms of cost, lifetime, and potential heat generated," said t. robert harris, a gtri research engineer. "we wanted to evaluate these issues so that when others use uv-c for disinfecting ppe, they will have information to make good choices." 
 the goal was to provide disinfection chambers as small as possible to allow portability. the chambers were built to accommodate face masks and at least one face shield - a curved sheet of clear plastic that covers the entire face and protects against large droplets that could contain coronavirus. the portability of the chambers could allow them to be used anywhere ppe disinfection is needed. 
 "we wanted a box that would fit on an ambulance or in a police car so that public service staff who are coming into contact with a lot of people on a regular basis would be able to disinfect their ppe," harris said. "this method offers an advantage over chemical disinfection because it doesn't require drying time or risk of chemical absorption." 
 originally, the project aimed at disinfecting ppe while it was being worn by having healthcare workers walk past an ultraviolet source while going from one hospital room to another. that idea was dropped because the wavelengths needed to inactivate the virus - 280 nanometers - can cause skin and eye damage in humans. 
 for that reason, the prototype portable disinfection chambers include a safety interlock to prevent the door from being opened while the uv light is on. disinfection takes about eight minutes, depending on the intensity of uv emissions, which vary by the lighting source. the chambers are designed to be cleaned between uses. 
 "healthcare workers would put their face masks and face shields into the box, close the lid, and set the timer," harris explained. "they would swap out one set of ppe while the other set was being disinfected." 
 ultraviolet light can damage plastic items, but harris and his colleagues didn't attempt to evaluate how many disinfection cycles the ppe could withstand. "you would expect uv to ultimately degrade ppe materials in the same way that sunlight slowly degrades polymer materials," he said. 
 the research team designed the chambers to provide the level of uv exposure that earlier studies had shown would inactivate the closely related sars-cov virus by damaging its outer shell and rna. the researchers did not attempt to evaluate the ability of the uv light to inactivate the sars-cov-2 virus that causes covid-19. 
 other engineering considerations included the need for cooling the uv sources, providing consistent exposure of the ppe to uv light using reflective walls in the chambers, and protecting the mercury vapor lamps from damage during use. 
 ultraviolet light is now used in water and wastewater sanitation, food disinfection, killing pathogens in hvac systems, and other purposes. because of the growing number of applications, finding enough mercury vapor lamps and led sources was a challenge for the research program, which was funded by gtri's independent research and development program. 
 harris hopes the project will encourage others to further develop uv-based portable disinfection systems to supplement other methods for protecting people who encounter the coronavirus. 
 "this work is part of a realization that multiple tools - including handwashing, surface disinfection, face masks, uv disinfection, social distancing, and other steps - are important and much more powerful when done together," he said. "we should all use every tool we have at our disposal to combat this virus and really think about things carefully to break every link in the chain of contagious transmission." 
 beyond harris, the research team included roger campbell, ashton hattori, eric brown, christopher hollis, max schureck, howard atchley, john stone, michael grady, and benjamin yang.

-0.9977 STEM predictive model could help guide choices for breast cancer therapies 
 a new technique could give women and their oncologists more personalized information for choosing breast cancer treatment options.

 oct 05, 2015 
 - atlanta, ga 
 biomedical engineers have demonstrated a proof-of-principle technique that could give women and their oncologists more personalized information to help them choose options for treating breast cancer. thanks to diagnostic tests, clinicians and patients can already know the type of breast cancer they're up against, but one big question remains: how likely is it that the cancer will invade other parts of the body? answering that question could help guide the choice of treatment options, from aggressive and difficult therapies to more conservative ones. by studying chemical signals from specific cells that are involved in helping cancer invade other tissues in each woman's body, researchers have developed a predictive model that could provide an invasiveness index for each patient. "we want women to have more information to make a personal decision beyond the averages calculated for an entire population," said 
 manu platt , an associate professor in the 
 department of biomedical engineering at georgia tech and emory university . "we are using our systems biology tools and predictive medicine approaches to look at potential markers we could use to help us understand the risk each woman has. this would provide information for a more educated discussion of treatment options." the research, sponsored with funds from the georgia research alliance and the giglio family donation to the department of biomedical engineering, was reported september 9 in the journal scientific reports. beyond breast cancer, the technique could offer similar decision-making assistance for men with prostate cancer, where treatment also requires making difficult choices about the risk of metastasis. platt's research team is examining chemical signals produced by the macrophages that can help aggressive tumors invade new tissues. macrophages normally clean up foreign particles and harmful microorganisms in the body, but aggressive tumors can enlist macrophages in helping them metastasize. tumor associated macrophages contribute significantly to tumor invasion, with cysteine cathepsin proteases - enzymes that break down proteins in the body - important contributors. to develop their predictive index, platt's research team used variability in macrophage expression of four types of cathepsin, the cathepsin inhibitor cystatin c, and kinase activation levels. the model, which has been under development for two years, was produced by studying macrophages from a population of women who didn't have breast cancer. platt and colleagues keon-young park and gande li co-cultured a standard breast cancer cell line (mcf-7) with macrophages produced from monocytes donated by these cancer-free women. next, they measured the level of invasiveness facilitated by macrophages from each individual donor, exposing the cancer cells and macrophages to a collagen gel designed to simulate breast tissue and measuring how many cells invaded it. while the breast is composed of many other tissues, collagen makes up the largest proportion and provided a good measure of how aggressively the cells would invade, platt said. platt's team correlated the level of invasion through the gel to the chemical signals being expressed by the macrophages. the researchers were surprised at the large amount of patient-to-patient variability in macrophage activity - variability that could account for the outcome differences in the patients receiving similar cancer treatments. the signaling levels and related invasion measurements were used to train a computational model developed by platt's team. the researchers next obtained blood samples containing monocytes from nine patients being treated for breast cancer at dekalb medical center, a major atlanta-area hospital. they measured signals from these macrophages and used their model - which had been trained on macrophage signaling and resulting invasiveness - to predict which of the cancer patients would be expected to have more invasive types of cancer. they compared their predications to what the clinician - dr. john kennedy - provided as their initial diagnosis. "based on the cells we got from the clinic, the ones that had been predicted to have the greatest potential for invasion were the ones that had produced the most invasive form of breast cancer in the patients," platt said. while the study could not account for possible differences in the length of time the cancers had been growing, they did correlate well with observations. in future research, platt hopes to follow the women for five years to determine if the model's predictions are related to cancer recurrence. he also plans to expand the model with additional macrophage data, and test it against additional blood samples. "the more information you give the model, the closer you get to the prediction," he said. "we think this is a very big start." the strength of this technique, platt believes, is that it measures what's happening at the level where cancer is metastasizing. "we are measuring at the level of activity of these intracellular enzymes and the ultimate activity of the proteases they produce that are not only the biomarkers of the tumor, but also help the tumor grow," he said. "everything about us is different. our genetics are different and our lifestyles are different, so clinicians have to make decisions in all that variability. all of those differences can be measured and captured in this output." platt believes the technique could one day lead to a simple blood test that would provide information useful in making therapy recommendations. the test might also help determine which women should be monitored more closely to detect the beginnings of a cancer. "together, this establishes proof-of-principle that personalized information acquired from minimally invasive blood draws may provide useful information to inform oncologists and patients of invasive / metastatic risk, helping to make decisions regard radical mastectomy or milder, conservative treatments to save patients from hardship and surgical recovery," he wrote in the paper. citation : keon-young park, gande li and manu o. platt, "monocyte-derived macrophage assisted breasat cancer cell invasion as a personalized, predictive metric to score metastatic risk," (scientific reports 2015).

 - atlanta, ga 
 in the fight against cancer, doctors dish out combination-blows of surgery, chemotherapy and other drugs to beat back a merciless foe. now, scientists have taken early steps toward adding a stinging punch to clinicians' repertoire. 
 with a novel targeted therapy researchers at the georgia institute of technology have purged ovarian tumors in limited,  in vivo  tests in mice. "the dramatic effect we see is the massive reduction or complete eradication of the tumor, when the ‘nanohydrogel' treatment is given in combination with existing chemotherapy," said chief researcher john mcdonald. 
 that nanohydrogel, a type of nanoparticle, is a minute gel pellet that honed in on malignant cells with a payload of an rna strand. the rna entered the cell, where it knocked down a protein gone awry that is involved in many forms of cancer. 
 in trials on mice, it put the brakes on ovarian cancer growth and broke down resistance to chemotherapy. that allowed a common chemotherapy drug, cisplatin, to drastically reduce or eliminate large carcinomas, with very similar speed and manner. the successful results treating four mice with the combination of sirna and cisplatin showed little variance. 
 chink in the armor 
 the therapeutic short interfering rna (sirna) developed by mcdonald and georgia tech researchers minati satpathy and roman mezencev, thwarted cancer-causing overproduction of cell structures called epidermal growth factor receptors (egfrs), which extend out of the wall of certain cell types. egfr overproduction is associated with aggressive cancers. 
 the researchers from  georgia tech's school of biological sciences  published their results on monday, november 7, 2016,  in the journal 
 scientific reports . research was funded by the national institutes of health's imat program, the ovarian cancer institute, the deborah nash endowment fund, the curci foundation and the markel foundation. 
 the new treatment has not been tested on humans, and research  would be required by science and by law  to demonstrate consistent results - efficacy - among other things, before preliminary human trials could become possible. 
 the current  in vivo  success strengthens the idea that knocking out egfr at the rna level may be a worthy goal to explore in the fight against  carcinomas  in general. the same 
 patented nanohydrogel packed with other types of therapeutic rna is currently being tested 
 for the treatment of other types cancers. 
 helper turned killer 
 egfrs are receptors found in epithelial cells, which line organs throughout the body: lungs, mouth, throat, intestines and others. in women, it also lines reproductive organs: ovaries, uterus and cervix. 
 they are long proteins that poke through the cell membrane, connecting the cell's interior with the outside. they look like squiggly worms with tiny mouths on the outside that take up a  messenger protein . 
 in a healthy cell, those messenger molecules cause egfrs to trigger long chains of biochemical reactions that lead to the activation of genes involved in a variety of cellular functions. in carcinoma cells, the number of egfrs present typically skyrockets. 
 "in many cancers, egfr is overexpressed," said mcdonald, who 
 heads georgia tech's integrated cancer research center . "the problem is that because of this overexpression, many cellular functions, including cell replication and resistance to certain chemotherapy drugs, are dramatically cranked up." 
 the cell goes haywire, metabolizes too much sugar, divides too much, and resists chemotherapy. the cancer grows into a tumor and can spread through the body. 
 an overabundance of egfrs found in a biopsy is usually a sign that cancer patient prognosis is poor. "in 70 percent of ovarian cancer patients, egfr is overexpressed at very high levels," mcdonald said. 
 cell suicide: apoptosis 
 egfr overexpression also makes cancer cells resistant to chemotherapy by thwarting a natural defense mechanism. 
 "the platinum-based chemotherapies used to treat ovarian cancers cause dna damage, which switches on apoptosis," mcdonald said. apoptosis is cell suicide. when cells can't repair dna damage, they're programmed to kill themselves to keep the damaged cells from spreading. 
 the primary chemotherapy used to treat ovarian cancer works by coaxing cancer cells to trigger the suicide program, but having too many epidermal growth factor receptors gets in the way. 
 "egfr overexpression hinders apoptosis; they won't die. by knocking down egfr, we make the cell hypersensitive to the drug. apoptosis is reactivated," mcdonald said. 
 existing egfr targeted drugs called tyrosine-kinase inhibitors disrupt an egfr function, but their success in treating ovarian cancer has been limited. "clinicians have tried egfr inhibitors to treat ovarian cancers for some years, and they only get about 20% of patients responding to it," mcdonald said. "apparently, the particular egfr function inhibited by these drugs is not critical to ovarian cancer." 
 guided brass knuckles 
 the short interfering (si) rna designed by the georgia tech researchers attacks the cancer much closer to its root. 
 to make the protein for egfr, rna has to transfer its genetic code from dna. the researchers' sirna binds to the cell's rna and stops it from working. 
 "we're knocking down egfr at the rna level," he said. "since egfr is multi-functional, it's not exactly clear which malfunctions contribute to ovarian cancer growth. by completely knocking out its production in ovarian cancer cells, all egfr functions are blocked." 
 the nanohydrogel that delivers the sirna to the cancer cells is a colloid ball of a common, compact organic molecule and about 98 percent water. another molecule is added to the surface of the nanohydrogel as a guide. it makes the pellets adhere to the cancer cells like sticky cluster bombs. 
 cancerous tissue may also be aiding the nanohydrogel in targeting it. "when you get into a tumor, there are a lot of blood vessels, and many are broken," mcdonald said. "this may help the nanoparticles get passively trapped in the neighborhood of tumorous tissues." 
 in the  in vivo  trials, the sirna, which contained a fluorescent tag, allowed researchers to observe nanoparticles successfully honing in on the cancer cells. fortuitous victory 
 "we originally selected to target the egfr gene because its activity is easily measured, and we wanted to use it simply as an indicator that our nanoparticle sirna delivery system was working," mcdonald said. "the fact that the egfr knockdown so dramatically sensitized the cells to standard chemotherapy came as a bit of a surprise." 
 at first, his team observed how the tumors responded to chemotherapy alone. then they combined it with the nanoparticle treatment. 
 "when we gave the chemotherapy alone, the response was moderate, but with the addition of the nanoparticles, the tumor was either significantly reduced or completely gone," mcdonald said. 
 but he tempered enthusiasm with caution. "further work will be required to see if the treatment completely destroyed every trace of cancer cells in the tumors that disappeared, or if future recurrence is possible." 
 if the researchers' continuing studies further prove to be consistent, the combination of the nanohydrogel with other therapeutic rnas could represent a significant advancement in the treatment of a wide spectrum of cancers.

-0.9594 STEM ransomware threat highlighted during cyber security summit 
 georgia tech experts detail the threat presented by ransomware. 
 sep 29, 2016 
 - atlanta, ga 
 as part of the 14 th 
 annual 
 georgia tech cyber security summit 
 held wednesday, college of computing ph.d. student 
 evan downing , alongside gtri cyber technology and information security lab division chief 
 chris smoak , presented a seminar on ransomware. 
 in a presentation titled, "ransomware: how to respond," the two speakers discussed distinctions between ransomware and typical malware, the goal of those producing ransomware, and how to prevent it and respond to it. 
 ransomware is essentially just malware that holds data for ransom, demanding money in exchange for decrypting critical files. it can affect both individuals and larger networks utilized by entire companies. 
 many individuals opt to pay the ransom, but both smoak and downing recommend the opposite. paying, they said, encourages more of this type of malware and, in addition, the user may not get their files back. 
 "ransomware authors want to give their victims incentive to pay. this is their business model," said downing, who is in his third year pursuing his ph.d. in computer science. 
 "they want to be able to be reliable and trustworthy to decrypt their victims' files so that word will spread to other victims that they should just simply pay the ransom to get their data back. if the ransomware actors did not do this, then they wouldn't be giving their victims any incentive to pay the ransom. the victims would just simply wipe their hard drives, reinstall their operating systems, and continue about their day." 
 downing, a self-described "unrealistic conservative" when it comes to the safety of online networks, said the decision whether to pay or not all comes down to a personal cost-benefit analysis. 
 "you want to decide what you're willing to pay for, literally and figuratively," he said. "what data can your business stand to lose? how quickly can your business recover from losing this data? how much money will an attack cost your company from the lack of the service your company provides? is this all worth the risk of paying the ransom and possibly not getting your data back?" 
 downing warns that regardless of your personal decision, it is never wise to pay the ransom. 
 "either you get your data back and you've aided a criminal financially, encouraging them to continue attacking others, or worse, you don't get your data back at all and you've still financially aided the criminal," downing said. "there's an obvious common denominator here." 
 both smoak and downing recommended a few things to prevent against such an attack in the future. aside from an extreme solution (simply utilizing old, unconnected technology), they advised frequent backups of data and avoiding continual connection of backup volumes, training users on use of email and visiting websites, and classifying data according to its importance (giving backup priority to the most vital information).

-0.9208 STEM reframing antarctica's meltwater pond dangers to ice shelves and sea level 
 there's a speed limit on the damage surface ponds can do to ice shelves, but that doesn't mean the ponds aren't dangerous. 
 before its sudden shattering, numerous meltwater ponds riddled antarctic ice shelf larsen b. they are seen in this 2002 satellite image as a matrix of aquamarine spots. scientists believe that the ponds hydrofractured the kilometer-thick ice shelf, causing its swift destruction. credit: nasa earth observatory 
 oct 29, 2019 
 - atlanta, ga 
 dangers to ancient antarctic ice portend a future of rapidly rising seas, but  a new study  may relieve one nagging fear: that ponds of meltwater fracturing the ice below them could cause protracted chain reactions that unexpectedly collapse floating ice shelves. though pooled meltwater does fracture ice, ensuing chain reactions appear short-ranged. 
 still, massive increases in surface melting due to unusually warm weather can trigger catastrophic ice shelf collapses like that of the  iconic shelf "larsen b," which shattered in 2002 . now, a study led by a researcher at the georgia institute of technology has modeled fracture chain reactions and how much water it would take for a repeat of that rare, epic collapse. 
 larsen b's disintegration was preceded by an atypical heatwave that riddled it with meltwater ponds, focusing researchers' attention on pond fracturing, also called hydrofracturing. they discovered that a melt pond hydrofracturing the ice shelf can prompt neighboring ponds to do the same. concerns grew of possible extensive chain reactions, which the new study addressed. 
 too much meltwater 
 "the chain reactions will not spread that far on the ice shelf," said alex robel,  an assistant professor in georgia tech's school of earth and atmospheric sciences . "normally, it would take many years for the chain reactions to have an effect on the integrity of the ice shelves. but there's a caveat. ponds that are close together and growing rapidly deeper could destroy the ice's integrity." 
 "there is a speed limit in the study that shows that an ice shelf can't collapse ridiculously fast," said co-author alison banwell, a  glaciology researcher at the university of colorado boulder . "however, if it becomes as covered in meltwater ponds very quickly like larsen b was, it can collapse in a similar way." she added, "multiple hydrofracture chains originating in different areas of an ice shelf could also lead to a larger-scale ice shelf breakup." 
 the researchers  published their results in the journal  geophysical research letters  on october 24, 2019. the research was funded by the national science foundation and the cooperative institute for research in environmental sciences at cu boulder. an unrelated,  recent study  reported a record number of meltwater ponds on antarctica. 
 "currently there are not nearly enough ponds on any ice shelf for a repeat of larsen b, but much meltwater is weighing on ice shelves and contributing damage to them," said banwell, who helped pioneer hydrofracture research on ice shelves. 
 q&a 
 broken ice shelves themselves don't add much to sea level. so, why care? 
 ice shelves float in the ocean, where they already contribute to sea level, so when they break up or melt, they don't add much more to it. but many ice shelves push back against glaciers on land that do drive up sea level when they enter the ocean. 
 with the shelf gone, the speed of glacial flow can jump four- to tenfold. glaciologists were not aware of this until larsen b, which was a kilometer (0.62 miles) thick with a surface of 3,250 square km (1,250 square miles), splintered within weeks, and glacial flow behind it surged. 
 "our research field thought ice shelves weren't too important, then larsen b showed us that was incorrect. buttressing by ice shelves really is the thing that stabilizes the glaciers. few issues are more significant than those that this study addresses," said brent minchew, an  assistant professor of geophysics at the massachusetts institute of technology . 
 minchew was not involved in the study but recently co-published another study that relates to it. the mit study rules out one absolutely nightmarish scenario of rapid glacier fracture due to the disappearance of ice shelves. but he and the other researchers reiterated that glacial flow nonetheless speeds up strikingly when ice shelves disappear. 
 also, most antarctic ice shelves probably formed in the last ice age, and it could take another ice age to replace them. 
 [ready for graduate school?  here's how to apply to georgia tech. ] 
 how does hydrofracturing work, and how did the study model its effects? 
 when meltwater ponds on top of cracks in the ice grow heavy, they can hydrofracture the ice. 
 "the water pressure concentrates down to a point called a crack tip. it tries to push the crack apart and make it deeper, and the ice pushes back. when the water gets deep enough, it can win out and propagate the crack to the bottom of the ice shelf," robel said. 
 the water drains down the crack, into the ocean, then the ice hops back up, making new cracks that can trigger neighboring ponds to hydrofracture, too. the study showed that this would encompass only small numbers of ponds. 
 conveniently for robel, who explores ice dynamics with math, physics, and computer science, as ice shelves form, regimented matrices of surface dents appear in them, and that's where the ponds collect. 
 robel could apply computer science modeling called  cellular automata  - known from pixelated matrix-like  video games  - to model hydrofracture chain reactions. the model even outputs animations that the researchers named "minesweeper plots" after the  classic 1990s computer game . 
 does the study mean there is less danger than before of glacial flow accelerating? 
 no, the study simply adds to scientific knowledge, and actually, the flow of some glaciers on antarctica has already sped up a lot. 
 "maybe this mechanism is not something we have to worry as much about. but we shouldn't breathe a sigh of relief because there are plenty of other ways of getting a whole lot of ice out of west antarctica quickly," minchew said. 
 perhaps the greatest potential for glacier loss is instability where glaciers rest on the ground next to seawater. a  study robel published in july  projected that instability to be extremely likely to accelerate sea level rise. 
 how does this study help advance glacier research? 
 it makes it easier to look for harbingers of ice shelf damage. 
 "looking at the volume of water on the surface of the ice is much easier than looking for stress failures within the ice," said banwell, who will visit antarctica in november to study melt ponds on the george iv ice shelf.

-0.8 STEM remote-control shoots laser at nano-gold to turn on cancer-killing immune cells 
 a near-infrared light, similar to that of a tv remote, combines with gold nano-particles to flip a gene switch in t-cells to hyper-activate them inside of tumors.

 a remote command could one day send immune cells on a rampage against a malignant tumor. the ability to mobilize, from outside the body, targeted cancer immunotherapy inside the body has taken a step closer to becoming reality. 
 bioengineers at the georgia institute of technology have installed a heat-sensitive switch into 
 t-cells 
 that can activate the t-cells when heat turns the switch on. the method, tested in mice and 
 published in a new study , is locally targeted and could someday help turn immunotherapy into a precision instrument in the fight against cancer. 
 immunotherapy 
 has made headlines with startling high-profile successes like saving  former u.s. president jimmy carter  from brain cancer. but the treatment, which activates the body's own immune system against cancer and other diseases, 
 has also, unfortunately, proved to be hit-or-miss . 
 "in patients where radiation and traditional chemotherapies have failed, this is where t-cell therapies have shined, but the therapy is still new," said principal investigator gabe kwong. "this study is a step toward making it even more effective." 
 cancer is notoriously wily, and when t-cells crawl into a tumor, the tumor tends to switch off the t-cells' cancer-killing abilities. researchers have been working to switch them back on. 
 laser, gold, and t-cells 
 kwong's remote control has done this in the lab, while also boosting t-cell activity. 
 in 
 the study , kwong's team successfully put their remote-control method through initial tests in mice with implanted tumors (so-called tumor phantoms, specially designed for certain experiments). the remote works via three basic components. 
 first, the researchers modified t-cells, a type of white blood cell, to include a genetic switch that, when switched on, increased the cells' expression of specific proteins by more than 200 times. that ability could be used to guide t-cells' cancer-fighting activities. 
 the t-cells, with the switch off, were introduced into the tumor phantom which was placed into the mice. the tumor phantom also included 
 gold nanorods , just dozens of atoms in size. the researchers shone pulses of a gentle laser in the near-infrared (nir) range from outside the mouse's body onto the spot where the tumor was located. 
 the nanorods receiving the light waves turned them into useful, localized mild heat, allowing the researchers to precisely warm the tumor. the elevated heat turned on the t-cells' engineered switch. 
 hyper-activated t-cells 
 this study honed the method and confirmed that its components worked in living animals. it was not the intention of the study to treat cancer yet, although undertaking that is the next step, which is already on its way. 
 "in upcoming experiments, we are implementing this approach to treat aggressive tumors and establish cancer-fighting effectiveness," said kwong, who is an 
 assistant professor in the wallace h. coulter department of biomedical engineering at georgia tech and emory university . 
 the researchers published their results 
 in the current edition of the journal acs synthetic biology . the study's first author was graduate research assistant ian miller. the research was funded by the national institutes of health, the national science foundation, the burroughs wellcome fund, and the shurl and kay curci foundation. 
 better immunotherapy 
 bioengineers have been able to do a lot with t-cells already when they're outside of the body. 
 "right now, we're adept at harvesting a patient's own t-cells, modifying to target cancer, growing them outside the body until there are hundreds of millions of them," kwong said. "but as soon as we inject them back into a patient, we lose control over the t-cells' activity inside the body." 
 the on-switch changes that. 
 t-cell toxicities 
 having an off-switch is also important. if t-cells were engineered to be always-on and hyper-activated, as they moved through the body, they could damage healthy tissue. 
 "there would be off-target toxicities, so you really want to pinpoint their activation," kwong said. "our long-term goal for them is to activate site-specifically, so t-cells can overcome immunosuppression by the tumor and become better killers there." 
 when the heat remote is turned off, so are kwong's engineered t-cells, because customary body temperatures are not high enough to activate their switch. 
 heat-shock switch 
 the switch is a natural safety mechanism in human cells that has evolved to protect against heat shock and turns on when tissue temperatures rise above the body's normal operating range, which centers on 37 degrees celsius (98.6 f). but the researchers re-fitted t-cells with the switch to make it turn on other functions, and it could be used to hyper-activate the cells. 
 the georgia tech bioengineers found that the switch worked in a range of 40 to 42 degrees celsius (104 - 107.6 f), high enough to not react to the majority of high fevers and low enough to not damage healthy tissue nor the engineered t-cells. 
 "when the local temperature is raised to 45 degrees (113 f), some cells in our body don't like it," kwong said. "but if heating is precisely controlled in a 40 to 42 degrees window with short pulses of the nir light, then it turns on the t-cells' switch, and body cells are still very comfortable." 
 immuno-goals and dreams 
 the researchers want to combine the switch with some additional cancer-fighting weapons they envision engineering into t-cells. 
 for example, secreted molecules called cytokines can boost immune cells' ability to kill cancer, but cytokines, unfortunately, can also be toxic. "our long-term goal is to engineer t-cells to make and release powerful immune system stimulants like cytokines on command locally and sparingly," kwong said. 
 in other studies, 
 gently heated gold nanorods have been shown to kill tumors or hinder metastasis . but t-cell treatments could be even more thorough and, in addition, hopefully, one day give patients treated with them a long-lasting memory immune response to any recurrence of their cancer.

-0.9853 STEM researchers develop wireless monitoring to detect sleep apnea at home 
 georgia tech researchers have created a wearable device to accurately measure obstructive sleep apnea - when the body repeatedly stops and restarts breathing for a period - as well as the quality of sleep people get when they are at rest. 
 georgia tech associate professor w. hong yeo is shown sleeping with the wearable sleep apnea detection and sleep quality monitoring device he and a team of researchers and clinicians created.

 may 24, 2023 
 georgia tech researchers have created a wearable device to accurately measure obstructive sleep apnea - when the body repeatedly stops and restarts breathing for a period - as well as the quality of sleep people get when they are at rest. 
 under conventional methods, people who are suspected of having some sleep issue or disorder must go to a medical facility, where they are monitored overnight and tethered to a series of wired probes that record brain, eye, and muscle activity. 
 the wearable sleep monitor patch developed by a team of researchers and clinicians, led by 
 w. hong yeo , an associate professor and woodruff faculty fellow in tech's 
 george w. woodruff school of mechanical engineering , is made of silicone and fits over the forehead, with a second, smaller silicone attachment that molds to the chin. 
 "a lot of people have this disorder, but they don't know it because it's very hard to diagnose right now," yeo said. "current smartphone apps don't capture the specific data doctors and clinicians study to determine if a patient has apnea, rendering them useless." 
 conventional existing sleep testing is occurring in sleep labs because of device limitations. this at-home wearable device could be the alternative to the more expensive medical procedures at sleep labs. 
 yeo and his team, which included researchers from across georgia tech, emory university school of medicine, the university of texas at austin, the icahn school of medicine at mount sinai in new york, the korea institute of materials science, and the korea advanced institute of science and technology, 
 reported their findings 
 in science advances in may. 
 rising prevalence 
 while there are two additional types of sleep apnea - central and complex - obstructive sleep apnea is the most common, yeo said, explaining that in addition to snoring and arrested breathing episodes, it's generally characterized by waking up suddenly, gasping for air or choking, and high blood pressure. 
 lack of quality sleep can exacerbate other health issues in people with existing illnesses such as heart disease or diabetes, yeo said. but even those who don't have other health ailments can have serious complications from sleep apnea because the longer it goes undetected and untreated, the more it will affect their hearts and brains over time. 
 seeing the toll sleep apnea was taking on the u.s. population, yeo set out to apply his wearable device research to the industry with a wireless sleep monitoring patch system. 
 the patches - which have an accuracy rate of 88.5% for sleep apnea detection - have the thickness of an adhesive bandage. three embedded electronic sensors send signals wirelessly via bluetooth to record brain, eye, and muscle activity. that data is relayed to an app on a smart device such as a phone or tablet for further study and evaluation. 
 the device can be used at home, negating the need to go to a sleep center or medical facility for overnight monitoring. 
 "a lot of people have this type of sleep disorder; they just don't know it," said yeo, whose research is centered primarily in advancing healthcare through the development of biosensors and bioelectronics. "in the u.s., more than 18 million people have this type of sleep apnea. that's basically one out of every 15 americans, and those numbers are increasing over time." 
 underlying health issues are partly behind the increase, he said, but key drivers are the types of food and portion sizes of the modern american diet as well as stress. 
 there's also an economic toll on the country. poor sleep cost the u.s. economy $411 billion in lost productivity in 2015. that figure is projected to exceed $467 billion by 2030. 
 predicting sleep apnea 
 using artificial intelligence and machine learning, the technology behind the wearable device records the data to give a sleep score that determines if the patient has sleep apnea or if they are getting enough quality sleep. 
 in the study, when measured against a controlled group of eight sleep apnea patients whose issues were detected under conventional testing means, yeo's wireless patch detected sleep apnea with an accuracy rate of 88.5%. for comparison, an existing headband device on the market had an accuracy rate of about 71% and cannot measure muscle activities. 
 what's more, the technology yeo and his team developed, and the machine learning algorithms used, can predict the likelihood that a person who doesn't show any symptoms of sleep apnea will develop it at some point. 
 "by looking at the data, we can say that, if you don't change something right now - whether it's diet or sleeping behavior or anything like that - you're likely to develop sleep apnea because your numbers are bad," he said. 
 solving a problem 
 the wireless patch solves a multipronged challenge to conventional testing methodology by addressing current patient issues with comfort, time, access, and cost. 
 the current process - called a psg or polysomnography test - proves uncomfortable for some patients. that's because they must sleep in a fixed position for fear of detaching any one of the 15 wired probes from their skin. having any of those sensors detach from their bodies risks not capturing enough data for proper assessments. 
 it's also time consuming because the patient must go to a sleep center and spend the night being monitored by medical personnel. there can also be a lag to even get tested. patients who don't have severe symptoms or other high-risk, underlying factors such as heart disease or hypertension, often must wait after getting a referral from a doctor to be slotted for a bed at a sleep center, pending availability. finally, the current detection method is costly to patients and insurance systems, tallying roughly $8,000 per person, per night. 
 "so that testing barrier is really high for regular people unless you are already sick, then they will screen you to avoid any severe conditions," yeo said. "but for people who don't show symptoms, you won't know whether you have the sleep disorder until it gets severe. we want to stop sleep apnea before it starts."

-0.9947 STEM researchers hijack cancer migration mechanism to "move" brain tumors 
 researchers are fighting brain cancer by hijacking the mechanism the tumors normally use to spread.

 - atlanta, ga 
 one factor that makes glioblastoma cancers so difficult to treat is that malignant cells from the tumors spread throughout the brain by following nerve fibers and blood vessels to invade new locations. now, researchers have learned to hijack this migratory mechanism, turning it against the cancer by using a film of nanofibers thinner than human hair to lure tumor cells away. instead of invading new areas, the migrating cells latch onto the specially-designed nanofibers and follow them to a location - potentially outside the brain - where they can be captured and killed. using this technique, researchers can partially move tumors from inoperable locations to more accessible ones. though it won't eliminate the cancer, the new technique reduced the size of brain tumors in animal models, suggesting that this form of brain cancer might one day be treated more like a chronic disease. "we have designed a polymer thin film nanofiber that mimics the structure of nerves and blood vessels that brain tumor cells normally use to invade other parts of the brain," explained 
 ravi bellamkonda , lead investigator and chair of the 
 wallace h. coulter department of biomedical engineering at georgia tech and emory university . "the cancer cells normally latch onto these natural structures and ride them like a monorail to other parts of the brain. by providing an attractive alternative fiber, we can efficiently move the tumors along a different path to a destination that we choose." details of the technique were reported february 16 in the journal 
 nature materials . the research was supported by the national cancer institute (nci), part of the national institutes of health; by atlanta-based ian's friends foundation, and by the georgia research alliance. in addition to the coulter department of biomedical engineering, the research team included children's healthcare of atlanta and emory university. treating the glioblastoma multiforme cancer, also known as gbm, is difficult because the aggressive and invasive cancer often develops in parts of the brain where surgeons are reluctant to operate. even if the primary tumor can be removed, however, it has often spread to other locations before being diagnosed. new drugs are being developed to attack gbm, but the atlanta-based researchers decided to take a more engineering approach. anjana jain, who is the first author of this gbm study, is now an assistant professor in the department of biomedical engineering at worcester polytechnic institute in massachusetts. as a georgia tech graduate student, jain worked on biomaterials for spinal cord regeneration. then, as a postdoctoral fellow in the bellamkonda lab, she saw the opportunity to apply her graduate work to develop potential new treatment modalities for gbm. "the signaling pathways we were trying to activate to repair the spinal cord were the same pathways researchers would like to inactivate for glioblastomas," said jain. "moving into cancer applications was a natural progression, one that held great interest because of the human toll of the disease." tumor cells typically invade healthy tissue by secreting enzymes that allow the invasion to take place, she explained. that activity requires a significant amount of energy from the cancer cells. "our idea was to give the tumor cells a path of least resistance, one that resembles the natural structures in the brain, but is attractive because it does not require the cancer cells to expend any more energy," she explained. experimentally, the researchers created fibers made from polycaprolactone (pcl) polymer surrounded by a polyurethane carrier. the fibers, whose surface simulates the contours of nerves and blood vessels that the cancer cells normally follow, were implanted into the brains of rats in which a human gbm tumor was growing. the fibers, just half the diameter of a human hair, served as tumor guides, leading the migrating cells to a "tumor collector" gel containing the drug cyclopamine, which is toxic to cancer cells. for comparison, the researchers also implanted fibers containing no pcl or an untextured pcl film in other rat brains, and left some rats untreated. the tumor collector gel was located physically outside the brain. after 18 days, the researchers found that compared to other rats, tumor sizes were substantially reduced in animals that had received the pcl nanofiber implants near the tumors. tumor cells had moved the entire length of all fibers into the collector gel outside the brain. while eradicating a cancer would always be the ideal treatment, bellamkonda said, the new technique might be able to control the growth of inoperable cancers, allowing patients to live normal lives despite the disease. "if we can provide cancer an escape valve of these fibers, that may provide a way of maintaining slow-growing tumors such that, while they may be inoperable, people could live with the cancers because they are not growing," he said. "perhaps with ideas like this, we may be able to live with cancer just as we live with diabetes or high blood pressure." before the technique can be used in humans, however, it will have to undergo extensive testing and be approved by the fda - a process that can take as much as ten years. among the next steps are to evaluate the technique with other forms of brain cancer, and other types of cancer that can be difficult to remove. treating brain cancer with nanofibers could be preferable to existing drug and radiation techniques, bellamkonda said. "one attraction about the approach is that it is purely a device," he explained. "there are no drugs entering the blood stream and circulating in the brain to harm healthy cells. treating these cancers with minimally-invasive films could be a lot less dangerous than deploying pharmaceutical chemicals." seed funding for early research to verify the potential for the technique was sponsored by ian's friends foundation, an atlanta-based organization that supports research into childhood brain cancers. "we couldn't be more thrilled with the progress that georgia tech and professor bellamkonda's lab have made in helping find a solution for children with both inoperable brain tumors and for those suffering with tumors in more invasive areas," said phil yagoda, one of the organization's founders. "with this research team's dedication and vision, this exciting and exceptional work is now closer to reality. by enabling the movement of an inoperable tumor to an operable spot, this work could give hope to all the children and parents of those children fighting their greatest fight, the battle for their lives."   in addition to those already mentioned, the research team included barunashish brahma from the department of neurosurgery at children's healthcare of atlanta; tobey macdonald from the department of pediatrics at emory university school of medicine, and martha betancur, gaurangkuma patel, chandra valmikinathan, vivek mukhatyar, ajit vakharia and s. balakrishna pai from the wallace h. coulter department of biomedical engineering at georgia tech and emory university. this research was supported by the national cancer institute of the national institutes of health (nih) through eureka award number r01-ca153229. any conclusions or opinions are those of the authors and do not necessarily represent the official views of the nih. citation : anjana jain, et al., "guiding intracortical brain tumour cells to an extracortical cytotoxic hydrogel using aligned polymeric nanofibres," (nature materials, 2014).

-0.9993 STEM researchers leverage ai to develop early diagnostic test for ovarian cancer 
 the georgia tech integrated cancer research center has combined machine learning with information on blood metabolites to develop a new early diagnostic test that detects ovarian cancer with 93 percent accuracy.

 jan 29, 2024 
 for over three decades, a highly accurate early diagnostic test for ovarian cancer has eluded physicians. now, scientists in the 
 georgia tech integrated cancer research center (icrc) 
 have combined machine learning with information on blood metabolites to develop a new test able to detect ovarian cancer with 93 percent accuracy among samples from the team's study group. 
 john mcdonald , professor emeritus in the 
 school of biological sciences , founding director of the icrc, and the study's corresponding author, explains that the new test's accuracy is better in detecting ovarian cancer than existing tests for women clinically classified as normal, with a particular improvement in detecting early-stage ovarian disease in that cohort. 
 the team's results and methodologies are detailed in a new paper, 
 "a personalized probabilistic approach to ovarian cancer diagnostics," 
 published in the march 2024 online issue of the medical journal 
 gynecologic oncology . based on their computer models, the researchers have developed what they believe will be a more clinically useful approach to ovarian cancer diagnosis - whereby a patient's individual metabolic profile can be used to assign a more accurate probability of the presence or absence of the disease. 
 "this personalized, probabilistic approach to cancer diagnostics is more clinically informative and accurate than traditional binary (yes / no) tests," mcdonald says. "it represents a promising new direction in the early detection of ovarian cancer, and perhaps other cancers as well." 
 the study co-authors also include 
 dongjo ban , a bioinformatics ph.d. student in mcdonald's lab; research scientists 
 stephen n. housley , 
 lilya v. matyunina , and 
 l.deette (walker) mcdonald ; regents' professor 
 jeffrey skolnick , who also serves as mary and maisie gibson chair in the school of biological sciences and georgia research alliance eminent scholar in computational systems biology; and two collaborating physicians: university of north carolina professor 
 victoria l. bae-jump 
 and ovarian cancer institute of atlanta founder and chief executive officer 
 benedict b. benigno . members of the research team are forming a startup to transfer and commercialize the technology, and plan to seek requisite trials and fda approval for the test. 
 silent killer 
 ovarian cancer is often referred to as the silent killer because the disease is typically asymptomatic when it first arises - and is usually not detected until later stages of development, when it is difficult to treat. 
 mcdonald explains that while the average five-year survival rate for late-stage ovarian cancer patients, even after treatment, is around 31 percent - but that if ovarian cancer is detected and treated early, the average five-year survival rate is more than 90 percent. 
 "clearly, there is a tremendous need for an accurate early diagnostic test for this insidious disease," mcdonald says. 
 and although development of an early detection test for ovarian cancer has been vigorously pursued for more than three decades, the development of early, accurate diagnostic tests has proven elusive. because cancer begins on the molecular level, mcdonald explains, there are multiple possible pathways capable of leading to even the same cancer type. 
 "because of this high-level molecular heterogeneity among patients, the identification of a single universal diagnostic biomarker of ovarian cancer has not been possible," mcdonald says. "for this reason, we opted to use a branch of artificial intelligence - machine learning - to develop an alternative probabilistic approach to the challenge of ovarian cancer diagnostics." 
 metabolic profiles 
 georgia tech co-author dongjo ban, whose thesis research contributed to the study, explains that "because end-point changes on the metabolic level are known to be reflective of underlying changes operating collectively on multiple molecular levels, we chose metabolic profiles as the backbone of our analysis." 
 "the set of human metabolites is a collective measure of the health of cells," adds coauthor jeffrey skolnick, "and by not arbitrarily choosing any subset in advance, one lets the artificial intelligence figure out which are the key players for a given individual." 
 mass spectrometry can identify the presence of metabolites in the blood by detecting their mass and charge signatures. however, ban says, the precise chemical makeup of a metabolite requires much more extensive characterization. 
 ban explains that because the precise chemical composition of less than seven percent of the metabolites circulating in human blood have, thus far, been chemically characterized, it is currently impossible to accurately pinpoint the specific molecular processes contributing to an individual's metabolic profile. 
 however, the research team recognized that, even without knowing the precise chemical make-up of each individual metabolite, the mere presence of different metabolites in the blood of different individuals, as detected by mass spectrometry, can be incorporated as features in the building of accurate machine learning-based predictive models (similar to the use of individual facial features in the building of facial pattern recognition algorithms). 
 "thousands of metabolites are known to be circulating in the human bloodstream, and they can be readily and accurately detected by mass spectrometry and combined with machine learning to establish an accurate ovarian cancer diagnostic," ban says. 
 a new probabilistic approach 
 the researchers developed their integrative approach by combining metabolomic profiles and machine learning-based classifiers to establish a diagnostic test with 93 percent accuracy when tested on 564 women from georgia, north carolina, philadelphia and western canada. 431 of the study participants were active ovarian cancer patients, and while the remaining 133 women in the study did not have ovarian cancer. 
 further studies have been initiated to study the possibility that the test is able to detect very early-stage disease in women displaying no clinical symptoms, mcdonald says. 
 mcdonald anticipates a clinical future where a person with a metabolic profile that falls within a score range that makes cancer highly unlikely would only require yearly monitoring. but someone with a metabolic score that lies in a range where a majority (say, 90%) have previously been diagnosed with ovarian cancer would likely be monitored more frequently - or perhaps immediately referred for advanced screening.

-0.9778 STEM restoring power during severe storms 
 researchers studied how recovery, guided by common policies from fema and industry, varies with respect to the severity of disruptive events. 
 power lines 
 sep 22, 2021 
 - atlanta, ga 
 with severe weather and natural disasters becoming more intense in a changing climate, a group of georgia tech researchers studied how recovery, guided by common policies from fema and industry, varies with respect to the severity of disruptive events. the study, a collaboration with national grid, used large-scale data analytics to look at nine years of power failure data to gain insight on how quickly energy grids come back online for customers. 
 the study found that 90 percent of customers experience 10 percent of a disruptive event's total downtime during moderate to extreme storms. however, recovery degrades with the severity of the disruptions. large failures that cannot recover rapidly increase by 30% from the moderate to extreme events, while prolonged small failures dominate entire recovery processes. 
 the study from georgia tech's college of engineering looked at 169 weather-induced power failures at two service regions in the states of new york and massachusetts. the failures were induced by a wide range of disruptive events from hurricanes, nor'easters, and thunder and winter storms from 2011-2019, affecting nearly 12 million people. 
 a feature article, " large-scale data analytics for resilient recovery services from power failures ," is published in joule: cell press. 
 "our goal was to use large-scale data from the operational energy grid to better understand resiliency," said lead author amir hossein afsharinejad, a ph.d. student in georgia tech's school of 
 electrical and computer engineering  (ece). "by using such a large dataset that covers nearly a decade, we sought to learn how recoveries respond to the severity of a wide range of weather-induced failure events." 
 the georgia tech analysis finds that the behavior of restoration services follows a "recovery scaling law." this law restores service for the majority of affected customers at the cost of a small fraction of the total interruption time. this prioritization policy, however, becomes less efficient, shown by large power failures that can't be prioritized. this results in customer interruption times that are 47 times longer from moderate to extreme failure events. 
 the study found that the prioritization recovery doesn't optimize restoration of small failures, which dominate delayed recovery during an entire evolution of an extreme event. 
 "these findings tell us that the typical services governed by the prioritized recovery policy is at the cost of the disparity, and the cost is significant when failure events become severe and extreme," said study co-author chuanyi ji, a georgia tech ece associate professor and afsharinejad's thesis advisor. "our analysis shows both the capability and fundamental limitation of recovery under the prioritization policy, where rapid restoration does not sustain to severe and extreme failure events." 
 the research team also explored if other approaches would be more beneficial to speed up recovery from failures. one included distributed generation and storage. their initial study found the approach scales well, as expediting restoration of a small fraction of the large failures in the non-prioritized category can reverse the degraded recovery from the moderate to extreme events. 
 the data used in the study are commonly available to most distribution grid operators in the u.s. and other parts of the world. the researchers hope their work, which took more than four years to analyze, demonstrates that energy service providers have the ability to adopt data science and turn their own data into new knowledge to improve both recovery and infrastructure enhancement. 
 "we are moving in a direction where severe storms are becoming more costly," said robert wilcox, a principal engineer from national grid who co-authored the paper. 
 the team is enthusiastic about the future direction. "this is also an historic time as more consumers need data and machine learning to help enhance energy services and smart infrastructure," wilcox added. "hopefully our study will motivate the industry to use data to better understand the problems we face today and in the decades to come."

-0.9153 STEM ribose-seq identifies and locates ribonucleotides in genomic dna 
 researchers have developed and tested a new technique that allows them to determine the full profile of ribonucleotides -- rna fragments -- embedded in genomic dna.

 ribonucleotides, units of rna, can become embedded in genomic dna during processes such as dna replication and repair, affecting the stability of the genome by contributing to dna fragility and mutability. scientists have known about the presence of ribonucleotides in dna, but until now had not been able to determine exactly what they are and where they are located in the dna sequences. now, researchers have developed and tested a new technique known as ribose-seq that allows them to determine the full profile of ribonucleotides embedded in genomic dna. using ribose-seq, they have found widespread but not random incorporation and "hotspots" where the rna insertions accumulate in the nuclear and mitochondrial dna of a commonly-studied species of budding yeast. ribose-seq could be used to locate ribonucleotides in the dna of a wide range of other organisms, including that of humans. "ribonucleotides are the most abundant non-standard nucleotides that can be found in dna, but until now there has not been a system to determine where they are located in the dna, or to identify specifically which type they are," said francesca storici, an associate professor in the school of biology at the georgia institute of technology. "because they change the way that dna works, in both its structure and function, it is important to know their identity and their sites of genomic incorporation." a description of the ribose-seq method and what it discovered in the dna of the budding yeast species 
 saccharomyces cerevisiae 
 were reported january 26 in the journal 
 nature methods . the findings resulted from collaboration between researchers in storici's laboratory at georgia tech - with graduate students kyung duk koh and sathya balachander - and at the university of colorado anschutz medical school with assistant professor jay hesselberth. the research was supported by the national science foundation, the georgia research alliance, the american cancer society, the damon runyon cancer research foundation, and the university of colorado golfers against cancer. because of the extra hydroxyl (oh) group in the ribonucleotides, their presence distorts the dna and creates sensitive sites where reactions with other molecules can take place. of particular interest are reactions between the oh and alkaline solutions, which can make the dna more susceptible to cleavage. ribose-seq takes advantage of this reaction with the hydroxyl group to launch the process of identifying the genomic spectrum of ribonucleotide (rnmp) incorporation. researchers first cleave the dna samples at the ribonucleotides, then take the resulting fragments through a specialized process that concludes with generation of a library of dna sequences that contain the sites of ribonucleotide incorporation and their upstream sequence. high-throughput sequencing of the library and alignment of sequencing reads to a reference genome identifies the profile of rnmp incorporation events. "ribose-seq is specific to directly capturing ribonucleotides embedded in dna and does not capture rna primers or okazaki fragments formed during dna replication, breaks or abasic sites in dna," storici noted. "for this reason, ribose-seq has application for rnmp mapping in any genomic dna, from large nuclear genomes to small genomic molecules such as plasmids and mitochondrial dna, with no need of standardization procedures," she said. "it also allows mapping rnmps even in conditions in which the dna is exposed to environmental stressors that damage the dna by generating breaks and / or abasic sites." the extra hydroxyl group found in the ribonucleotides is key to the ribose-seq technique, said koh, the paper's first author. "the oh group is specific to the ribonucleotides," he explained. "that allowed us to build a new tool for recognizing specifically where the ribonucleotides are located." the high-throughput sequencing and initial data analysis were done in the hesselberth laboratory in the department of biochemistry and molecular genetics at the university of colorado anschutz medical school. to validate their method, the researchers tested ribose-seq on the much-studied yeast species. the analyses revealed a strong preference for the cytidine and guanosine bases at the ribonucleotide sites. "the ribonucleotides are not randomly distributed, and there is some preference for specific base sequences and specific base composition of the ribonucleotide itself," said koh. "by looking at the non-random distribution, we found several hotspots in which the ribonucleotides are incorporated into the genome." knowledge of where the ribonucleotides cluster could help identify areas of greatest potential for genome instability and lead to a better understanding of how they affect the properties and activities of dna. "the fact that we see biases in the base compositions of the ribonucleotides allows us to tell which base is more likely to be incorporated into the dna," koh explained. "if there are specific signatures of genomic instability that are caused by the ribonucleotides, this will allow us to narrow down the locations and know where they are more likely to be found." a next step will be to test ribose-seq on other dna, koh said. "our technique could potentially be applied to any genome of any cell type from any organism as long as genomic dna can be extracted from it," he added. "it is independent of specific organisms." beyond repair and replication processes, ribonucleotides can also be created in dna as a result of damage caused by drugs, environmental stressors and other factors. the ribose-seq method could also allow scientists to study the impact of these processes. "ribose-seq should allow us to better understand the impact of ribonucleotides on the structure and function of dna," said storici. "identifying specific signatures of ribonucleotide incorporation in dna may represent novel biomarkers for human diseases such as cancer, and other degenerative disorders." this material is based upon work supported by the national science foundation (nsf) under grant number mcb-1021763, by the georgia research alliance under award number r9028, by the american cancer society, by the damon runyon cancer research foundation and by the university of colorado golfers against cancer. any opinions, findings, and conclusions or recommendations expressed in this material are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the views of the sponsoring agencies. citation : kyung duk koh, sathya balachander, jay hesselberth and francesca storici, "ribose-seq: global mapping of ribonucleotides embedded in genomic dna," (nature methods, 2015).

-0.978 STEM robotic submarine snaps first-ever images at foundation of notorious antarctic glacier 
 these are the first-ever images taken at the foundations of the glacier that inspires more fear of sea-level rise than any other - thwaites glacier. 
 thwaites glacier's outer edge. as the glacier flows into the ocean, it becomes sea ice and drives up sea-level. thwaites glacier's ice is flowing particularly fast, and some researchers believe it may have already tipped into instability or be near that point, though this has not yet been established. credit: nasa / james yungel

 - atlanta, ga 
 during an unprecedented scientific campaign on an antarctic glacier notorious for contributions to sea-level, researchers took first-ever images at the glacier's foundations on the ocean floor. the area is key to thwaites glacier's potential to become more dangerous, and in the coming months, the research team hopes to give the world a clearer picture of its condition. 
 the images, taken by a robotic underwater vehicle, were part of a broad set of data collected in a variety of experiments by an international team. the  international thwaites glacier collaboration  (itgc)  announced the completion of this first-ever major research venture  on the glacier coincident with the 200-year anniversary of the discovery of antarctica in 1820. 
 already, thwaites accounts for about four percent of global sea-level rise. researchers have had concerns that a tipping point in the stability at its foundations could result in a run-away collapse of the glacier and boost sea levels by as much as 25 inches. by studying multiple aspects of thwaites, the itgc wants to understand more about the likelihood that the glacier the size of florida may reach such instability in the coming decades. 
 line of concern 
 the area of concern that the underwater vehicle visited is called the grounding line, and it is important to the stability of thwaites glacier's footing. it is the line between where the glacier rests on the ocean bed and where it floats over water. the farther back the grounding line recedes, the faster the ice can flow into the sea, pushing up sea-level. 
 "visiting the grounding line is one of the reasons work like this is important because we can drive right up to it and actually measure where it is," said britney schmidt, an itgc co-investigator from the georgia institute of technology. "it's the first time anyone has done that or has ever even seen the grounding zone of a major glacier under the water, and that's the place where the greatest degree of melting and destabilization can occur." 
 the underwater robot,  icefin, was engineered by schmidt's georgia tech lab . the georgia tech team was part of a greater collaboration between researchers from the u.s. and the british antarctic survey (bas), who lived and worked on thwaites in december and january. a bas hot water drill melted a hole 590 meters deep (1,935 feet) to access the ocean cavity for icefin. 
 "icefin swam over 15 km (9.3 miles) round trip during five missions. this included two passes up to the grounding zone, including one where we got as close as we physically could to the place where the seafloor meets the ice," said schmidt, who is  an associate professor in georgia tech's school of earth and atmospheric sciences . "we saw amazing ice interactions driven by sediments at the line and from the rapid melting from warm ocean water." 
 [ready for graduate school?  here's how to apply to georgia tech. ] 
 historic research venture 
 in the coming months and years, the itgc team made up of researchers from multiple universities and research institutions in the u.s. and the uk will publish studies with thorough findings based on the unprecedented data collected during the field campaign. 
 the array of research the scientists carried out research included seismic and radar measurements and using hot water drills to make holes between 300 and 700 meters (985 and 2,300 feet) deep down to the ocean and glacier bed below thwaites' ice. researchers also took cores of sediment from the seafloor and under parts of the glacier grounded on the bed to examine the quality of the foothold that it offers thwaites. 
 "we know that warmer ocean waters are eroding many of west antarctica's glaciers, but we're particularly concerned about thwaites. this new data will provide a new perspective of the processes taking place, so we can predict future change with more certainty," said keith nicholls, an oceanographer from the british antarctic survey. 
 nicholls is a co-principal investigator on the project that involved schmidt along with david holland of new york university. the research is funded by the national science foundation, the uk natural environment research council, the u.s. antarctic program, and the british antarctic survey. 
 antarctica sea-level background 
 over the past 30 years, the amount of ice flowing to the sea from thwaites and its neighboring glaciers has nearly doubled. 
 "while greenland's contribution to sea level has already reached an alarming rate, antarctica is just now picking up its contributions to sea level," schmidt said. "it has the largest body of ice on earth and will contribute more and more of sea-level rise over the next 100 years and beyond. it's a massive source of uncertainty in the climate system."

 it's called mental imbalance for a reason. sanity hangs, in part, in the gentle balance of chemicals strung together within regions of the brain in an intricate matrix. in schizophrenia, the matrix is sharply jarred, debilitating the mind and triggering hallucinations. now, researchers at the georgia institute of technology have created an interactive model of that matrix to fast-track research and treatment of the tormenting disorder. working memory disruptions paralyze the mental coherence of schizophrenia sufferers, yet there is a stark lack of medical treatment for it. researchers zhen qi and eberhard voit hope their new, very accurate computational simulator built around this symptom will help change that to curb anquish for many patients. learn more about the simulator , which puts this brain dysfunction into a virtual setting.

 people with weakened immune systems are at constant risk of infection.  pseudomonas aeruginosa , a common environmental bacterium, can colonize different body parts, such as the lungs, leading to persistent, chronic infections that can last a lifetime - a common occurrence for people with cystic fibrosis. 
 but the bacteria can sometimes change their behavior and enter the bloodstream, causing chronic localized infections to become acute and potentially fatal. despite decades of studying the transition in lab environments, how and why the switch happens in humans has remained unknown.

-0.9924 STEM scientists work to engineer an injectable therapy for rotator cuff injuries 
 researchers are attempting to engineer an injectable therapy for the shoulder's supraspinatus tendon, a rotator cuff tendon that is commonly torn in sports. 
 johnna temenoff, an associate professor in the wallace h. coulter department of biomedical engineering at georgia tech and emory university, has been awarded a $1 million grant to develop an injectable therapy for rotator cuff injuries. credit: rob felt.

 for a baseball pitcher, a rotator cuff injury often means an extended stay on the disabled list for surgery and rehabilitation of the damaged tendons. but a new technology under development may stop this shoulder injury from becoming so severe that surgery is required.  a research team is attempting to engineer an injectable therapy for the shoulder's supraspinatus tendon, a rotator cuff tendon that is commonly torn in sports. when the tendon is damaged, the body makes things worse by activating enzymes that further break down the tendon. the scientists hope to develop an injectable compound that would deliver an inhibitor capable of blocking these enzymes, thereby reducing the severity of the injury or even healing the tissue. "normally people focus on treating tendon injuries after the tear has occurred, but we're focusing on a much earlier stage in the disease," said johnna temenoff, an associate professor in the wallace h. coulter department of biomedical engineering at georgia tech and emory university. "this is the first time that an injectable therapy specifically designed to interact with tissue at an early disease state has been attempted for this particular tendon injury." temenoff's work is supported by a $1 million grant from the 
 national institute of arthritis and musculoskeletal and skin diseases (niams) 
 for five years of research, which began in september 2013. collaborating on the research is manu platt, an assistant professor in the same department. temenoff's previous work on tendon injuries, which focused on quarterbacks in football, was sponsored by the nfl charities. shoulder tendon injuries are common overuse injuries for athletes and also for industrial workers whose repetitive overhead motion put them at risk. the rotator cuff is a collation of four tendons, and the tendons are made of collagen. overuse of the tendons damages the collagen, and people feel stiff and sore in their shoulders as the area becomes weaker. once a tendon is damaged, the body accelerates the damage by activating enzymes that eat at the tendon, worsening the condition over time. "the interesting thing about this disease is that we don't know exactly what causes it," temenoff said. "we're studying enzymes that are known to chew up the collagen, and we're looking at then delivering inhibitors to those enzymes in a local injection in the tendon to try to stop the degradation." in their research, the team will use an animal model to characterize when these collagen-destroying enzymes are the most active. this will give researchers a good idea of when to inject inhibitors. so that patients won't need multiple shots, the scientists are working on a drug delivery material that will release the inhibitors over time once inside the body. one idea is to control the interactions between the inhibitors and small amounts of the blood thinner heparin. the team will also study the histology and mechanics of the tendons after healing. temenoff said that the injectable therapy could, in theory, work on other kinds of tendon injuries, not just in the shoulder. "we're studying the disease in the shoulder, but it's the same disease that causes tennis elbow, achilles injuries, and jumper's knee," temenoff said. "it's the same process, just in different tendons in the body." this research is supported by the national institute of arthritis and musculoskeletal and skin diseases (niams) under award1r01ar063692-01a1 .

-0.8768 STEM in search of the goldilocks of black holes 
 analysis of gravitational waves data by hundreds of scientists so far reveals no collisions from mid-sized black holes. 
 may 22, 2017 
 - atlanta 
 black holes can be divided into three classes according to mass. on the low end are those with masses 10 times that of the sun. examples are the two black holes whose merger generated the 
 first gravitational wave to be detected , by 
 the ligo scientific collaboration 
 (lsc), an international team including researchers in the school of physics' 
 center for relativistic astrophysics 
 (cra). ligo stands for laser interferometer gravitational-wave observatory, a facility based in the u.s. 
 on the high end are black holes that are a million times as massive as the sun. 
 evidence for them comes from nasa images . 
 for the goldilocks black holes, with masses in between, no hard proof exists to date. 
 indirect evidence 
 has been offered, but nothing unambiguous so far. a single detection can transform our understanding of the first stars in the universe. 
 as it happens, ligo has been designed to detect gravitational waves arising from collisions of midsize black holes. a 
 recent study 
 suggests that the goldilocks of black holes may be uncommon. analysis of ligo data collected from september 2015 through january 2016 found no evidence for midsize black holes. however, the work enables scientists to estimate more accurately than ever before the abundance of such black holes. 
 the paper reports a "survey of the universe for midsize-black-hole collisions up to 5 billion light years ago," says 
 karan jani , a former georgia tech ph.d. physics student who participated in the study. that volume of space contains about 100 million galaxies the size of the milky way. nowhere in that space did the study find a collision of midsize black holes. 
 "clearly they are much, much rarer than low-mass black holes, three collisions of which ligo has detected so far," jani says. nevertheless, should a gravitational wave from two goldilocks black holes colliding ever gets detected, jani adds, "we have all the tools to dissect the signal." 
 the study was undertaken by hundreds of scientists worldwide belonging to lsc and 
 the virgo collaboration , another international team observing gravitational waves from a facility in italy. georgia tech scientists worked on 
 the paper 
 in close collaboration with colleagues from the 
 albert einstein institute hannover , in germany; hillsdale college; kenyon college;  massachusetts institute of technology; pennsylvania state university; 
 radboud university , in the netherlands; 
 université paris diderot , in france; and the 
 university of birmingham , in england. 
 jani received a 
 ph.d. in spring 2017 . he worked with cra director 
 deirdre shoemaker , 
 lsc deputy spokesperson laura cadonati , and cra colleagues 
 juan calderon bustillo , 
 james clark , 
 claudia lazzaro , and 
 pablo laguna . all of them participated in the first detection of a gravitational wave, on sept. 14, 2015.

-0.7068 STEM seise tool uses semantic gaps to detect website promotional attacks 
 researchers have developed a new technique for identifying promotional infections of websites operated by government and educational organizations.

 - atlanta, ga 
 by detecting semantic inconsistencies in content, researchers have developed a new technique for identifying promotional infections of websites operated by government and educational organizations. such attacks use code embedded in highly-ranked sites to drive traffic to sketchy websites selling fake drugs, counterfeit handbags and plagiarized term papers - or installing drive-by malware. the new technique, known as semantic inconsistency search (seise), uses natural language processing to spot the differences between a compromised site's expected content and the malicious advertising and promotional code. using seise, the researchers found 11,000 infected sites among non-commercial top-level sponsored .edu, .gov and .mil domains worldwide, and are working to extend the method to other domains. the research was supported by the u.s. national science foundation and natural science foundation of china. it will be described in a presentation may 25, 2016 at the ieee symposium on security and privacy in san jose. seise was developed by researchers from the georgia institute of technology, indiana university and tsinghua university in china. "the basic idea behind promotional infection is to attack websites that are highly-ranked and to leverage their importance to promote various things, most of them illegal," explained 
 raheem beyah , who is the motorola foundation professor in georgia tech's 
 school of electrical and computer engineering . "the bad content is nested into the prominent site to leverage the traffic of that domain. that gives the attackers a doorway to whatever they are promoting." essentially, said beyah, the attackers are stealing the site's good name, even if they don't install malware or otherwise inflict harm on web visitors. "the attackers essentially become part of the prominent website's brand and share in the ranking they have," he added. "it's like setting up operations inside a well-known coffee shop chain. the attacker leverages the brand by becoming co-located with it." the promotional attacks can be difficult to detect, especially if they don't contain malicious computer code. but the semantic differences between the host site and the attacker's code can tip off the seise algorithm. once it has characterized the content expected on a website - educational information on an .edu page, for example - the pitches for gambling or inexpensive prescription drugs become obvious. "if you are visiting the website for a prestigious university, you don't expect to see information promoting casino gambling," said beyah. "if we expect one thing from the website and see something significantly different, there is a huge semantic gap that we can detect." seise doesn't have to review an entire site to determine what should be there; it can sample the pages to learn context that makes attacker terms stand out. because their domain purposes are clear and well established, the researchers began with education and government websites. they now hope to extend the automated approach to commercial and other domains whose intended purposes may be less consistent. "we are trying to figure out how to get the context right for these domains so we can help companies detect these infections," beyah said. "there's no reason to believe that the commercial domains are any less attractive to attackers than the non-commercial ones." beyah and georgia tech ph.d. student xiaojing liao began the work by using google searches to find sites with known "bad words" denoting illicit products. they then utilized natural language processing to find terms associated with these known bad words, which were then used to train the seise before it was sent out to analyze 100,000 domains for the presence of the illicit terms. the approach identified 11,000 infected sites with a false detection rate of just 1.5 percent and coverage of more than 90 percent. seise found promotional infections on the websites of top u.s. universities and government agencies, though the problem was truly worldwide, with three percent of .edu and .gov sites infected. of the infected websites noted, 15 percent were in china and six percent were in the united states. sites are infected using proven attack techniques such as sql injection, url redirection and phishing to compromise the credentials of users, beyah said. though central websites of the organizations may be secure, pages of individual users and units may be more vulnerable - and still provide the prestige of the overall domain. existing techniques for detecting promotional infections rely on examining redirects and following links, or observing how sites change over time. but those techniques aren't scalable and can't be automated in the same way as the new semantic gap approach, beyah said. the researchers want to share their technique with the larger security community, and are discussing how best to make the algorithm available. "our study shows that by effective detection of infected sponsored top-level domains (stlds), the bar to promotion infections can be substantially raised," the authors wrote in their paper. about those 11,000 compromised webpages? the researchers are attempting to contact the operators of all 11,000 of them to share the bad news. "we have spent a lot of time contacting those folks and letting them know what we have found," beyah said. "we're still in the process of doing that because there are so many." this work was supported by the national science foundation through grants cns-1223477, cns-1223495 and cns-1527141 and by the natural science foundation of china through grant 61472215. any opinions, findings, and conclusions or recommendations expressed in this material are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of the sponsors. research news georgia institute of technology 177 north avenue atlanta, georgia 30332-0181 usa media relations contact s: john toon ( jtoon@gatech.edu ) (404-894-6986) or ben brumfield ( ben.brumfield@comm.gatech.edu ) (404-385-1933). writer : john toon

 "hairy" nanoparticles made with light-sensitive materials that assemble themselves could one day become "nano-carriers" providing doctors a new way to simultaneously introduce both therapeutic drugs and cancer-fighting heat into tumors. that's one potential application for a new technology that combines water-repelling yet light-sensitive and water-absorbing materials into polymeric nano-reactors for creating photo-responsive gold nanoparticles. 
 light of specific wavelengths causes the nanoparticles to assemble and disassemble on demand, allowing the dynamic organization of the nanoparticles for smart in vitro drug release. by including chemotherapy molecules in the nanoparticle structures when they are assembled, the molecules could be drawn into tumors - and then released with the application of a light at a shorter wavelength that triggers disassembly through photo-cleavage. 
 in addition to such a dynamic self-assembly and disassembly, the encapsulation and release of chemotherapy molecules could also be achieved by reversible covalent bonding of anticancer drugs to the polymeric "hairs" situated on the surface of nanoparticles. and by absorbing the same light that triggers the drug release, the gold nanoparticles could also heat the cancer cells, providing a double punch. 
 in a broad range of other applications, the nanoparticle self-assembly process could also be triggered by environmental factors including temperature, ph or solvent polarity by rationally designing the polymeric hairs. in this study, gold nanoparticles were used, but the process could also make self-assembled nanoparticles from a variety of metals and metal oxides. by tailoring the surface of nanoparticles with water-absorbing polymers containing near-infrared responsive components, the drug release could be performed 
 in vivo . 
 the spherical gold nanoparticles can be replaced with more complex shaped nanomaterials - such as hollow nanoparticles, nanorods, or nanotubes - to render a better absorption of near-infrared light to penetrate biological tissues. no testing of these nanoparticles has been done so far in living cells or organisms. 
 the research was supported by the air force office of scientific research and the national science foundation, and was reported january 31 in the early edition of the journal 
 proceedings of the national academy of sciences . materials scientists from the georgia institute of technology and south china university of technology co-authored the paper. 
 "we envision that these photo-responsive polymer-capped gold nanoparticles could one day serve as nano-carriers for drug delivery into the body using our robust and reversible process for assembly and disassembly," said 
 zhiqun lin , a professor in the georgia tech 
 school of materials science and engineering . "used in cancer therapy, this process could increase the impact of a treatment by heating the cancer cells while introducing the drug compound into the tumor." 
 under light, the assemblies of photo-sensitive nanoparticles separate over a period of hours at a rate that can be controlled by the intensity and wavelength of the light. "because the disassembly can be turned on and off at will, we could provide a timed release of the drug by controlling the short-wavelength light exposure," lin added. 
 the hairy nanoparticles are fabricated around a tiny core of beta-cyclodextrin from which polymer chains of poly(acrylicacid)-block-poly(7-methylacryloyloxy-4-methylcoumarin) (paa-b-pmamc) are grown. that material attracts water-soluble metal precursors, which use the space within the polymer hairs as nano-reactors to form gold nanoparticles. 
 to these inner structures - which are hydrophilic paa polymers - the researchers add hairs made from the hydrophobic monomer mamc. these materials are sensitive to light, and cause the nanoparticles to self-assemble through a photo-dimerization process - crosslinking - when subjected to light at a wavelength of 365 nanometers. 
 the assembly process can be reliably reversed on demand using a shorter wavelength at 254 nanometers. 
 "once the polymer chains from adjacent gold nanoparticles begin to photo-crosslink, they bring nanoparticles together via a self-assembly process to generate large assemblies of nanoparticles," said lin. "this process is completely reversible and can be repeated in many cycles." 
 the research team incorporated dye molecules into the self-assembled nanoparticles to simulate what might be done to incorporate and then release chemotherapy agents. a magnetic oxide material incorporated into the nanoparticles could allow the assemblies to be directed to a tumor site by an external magnet, and could also support diagnostic imaging. 
 beyond the activity of the drugs, the plasmonic effects of the gold nanoparticles could heat the nanoparticles when they are subjected to light, attacking the cancer cells through a second route. 
 in addition to the potential medical uses, the self-assembly technique could have applications in optics, optoelectronics, magnetic technologies, sensing materials and devices, catalysis and nanotechnology. the technique could also lead to new basic research in crystallization kinetics, using the self-assembly process to create "artificial crystals" held together by polymer chains. 
 lin's lab has worked on the amphiphilic star-shaped block polymers for several years, adding new features and exploring new capabilities for the nanoparticle systems. 
 "our work provides a design strategy that allows the manipulation of both the outer block and the inner block of a star-shaped block co-polymer," he said. "our fundamental contribution in this work is to judiciously prepare a star-shaped block co-polymer in which the inner block has the capability to coordinate with metal precursors while the outer block allows photo-responsive materials to interact, which in turn renders the crafting of photo-responsive gold nanoparticles for light-enabled reversible and reliable self-assembly." 
 the research team included yihuang chen, associated with both georgia tech and the south china university of technology; zewei wang, yanjie he, young jun yoon, and jaehan jung, associated with georgia tech, and guangzhao zhang from south china university of technology.

-0.0516 STEM sensor fabric, big data could help end pressure injuries for wheelchair users 
 mse researchers are using a catalyst award from the national academy of medicine to develop a pressure-relieving sensor system that could also be used in hospital beds.

 nov 29, 2023 
 at least half of veterans with spinal cord injuries will develop sores on their skin from the unrelieved pressure of sitting for long periods of time in a wheelchair. it's a constant worry, because these skin ulcers can greatly limit patients' mobility. 
 "pressure injuries directly impact the veteran's quality of life, because the medical provider will order the veteran to bed rest for weeks and potentially months," said kim house, a physician and medical director of the spinal cord injury clinic at the atlanta veterans administration healthcare system. "at every clinic visit, i provide education for pressure injury prevention." 
 house could one day have a new tool to offer her patients, thanks to researchers in the georgia tech college of engineering, and wheelchair-bound veterans are just the beginning. 
 materials engineers are developing new fabric sensors and a customized wheelchair system that assesses and automatically eases pressure at contact points to prevent injuries from developing in the first place. 
 "we have three key issues happening: first, continuous pressure. second, moisture, because when you're sitting in the same spot, you tend to sweat and generate moisture. and third is shear. when you try to move somebody, the skin shears. that perfect combination is what causes pressure injuries," said 
 sundaresan jayaraman , professor in the 
 school of materials science and engineering 
 (mse). "we believe we have a solution to the perfect storm of pressure, moisture and shear, which means the user's quality of life is going to get better."

-0.9854 STEM simulated ransomware attack shows vulnerability of industrial controls 
 cybersecurity researchers have developed a new form of ransomware that was able to take over control of a simulated water treatment plant. 
 georgia tech researchers have developed a new form of ransomware that can take over control of a simulated water treatment plant. the simulated attack was designed to highlight vulnerabilities in the control systems used to operate industrial facilities. shown are (left) raheem beyah, associate chair in the georgia tech school of electrical and computer engineering, and david formby, a georgia tech ph.d. student.

 cybersecurity researchers at the georgia institute of technology have developed a new form of ransomware that was able to take over control of a simulated water treatment plant. after gaining access, the researchers were able to command programmable logic controllers (plcs) to shut valves, increase the amount of chlorine added to water, and display false readings. 
 the simulated attack was designed to highlight vulnerabilities in the control systems used to operate industrial facilities such as manufacturing plants, water and wastewater treatment facilities, and building management systems for controlling escalators, elevators and hvac systems. believed to be the first to demonstrate ransomware compromise of real plcs, the research is scheduled to be presented february 13 at the rsa conference in san francisco. 
 though no real ransomware attacks have been publicly reported on the process control components of industrial control systems, the attacks have become a significant problem for patient data in hospitals and customer data in businesses. attackers gain access to these systems and encrypt the data, demanding a ransom to provide the encryption key that allows the data to be used again. 
 ransomware generated an estimated $200 million for attackers during the first quarter of 2016, and the researchers believe it's only a matter of time before critical industrial systems are compromised and held for ransom. 
 "we are expecting ransomware to go one step farther, beyond the customer data to compromise the control systems themselves," said david formby, a ph.d. student in the georgia tech school of electrical and computer engineering. "that could allow attackers to hold hostage critical systems such as water treatment plants and manufacturing facilities. compromising the programmable logic controllers (plcs) in these systems is a next logical step for these attackers." 
 many industrial control systems lack strong security protocols, said 
 raheem beyah , the motorola foundation professor and associate chair in the 
 school of electrical and computer engineering 
 and formby's faculty advisor. that's likely because these systems haven't been targeted by ransomware so far, and because their vulnerabilities may not be well understood by their operators. 
 formby and beyah used a specialized search program to locate 1,400 plcs of a single type that were directly accessible across the internet. but most such devices are located behind business systems that provide some level of protection - until they are compromised. once attackers get into a business system, they could pivot to enter control systems if they are not properly walled off. 
 "many control systems assume that once you have access to the network, that you are authorized to make changes to the control systems," formby said. "they may have very weak password policies and security policies that could let intruders take control of pumps, valves and other key components of the industrial control system." 
 in the past, control systems weren't designed for connection to the internet, and many users of the systems assume they aren't on the public network and therefore not susceptible to attack. control systems may also have connections that are unknown to operators, including access points installed to allow maintenance, troubleshooting and updates. 
 "there are common misconceptions about what is connected to the internet," said formby. "operators may believe their systems are air-gapped and that there's no way to access the controllers, but these systems are often connected in some way." 
 to launch the research, the researchers identified several common plcs in use at industrial facilities. they obtained three different devices and tested their security setup, including password protection and susceptibility to settings changes. the devices were then combined with pumps, tubes and tanks to create a simulated water treatment facility. in the place of chlorine normally used to disinfect water, the researchers used iodine. they also added starch to their water supply, which turned bright blue when a simulated attack added iodine to it. 
 "we were able to simulate a hacker who had gained access to this part of the system and is holding it hostage by threatening to dump large amounts of chlorine into the water unless the operator pays a ransom," formby said. "in the right amount, chlorine disinfects the water and makes it safe to drink. but too much chlorine can create a bad reaction that would make the water unsafe." 
 vulnerabilities in control systems have been known for more than a decade, but until the growth of ransomware, attackers had not been able to benefit financially from compromising the systems. as other ransomware targets become more difficult, beyah believes attackers may turn to easier targets in the industrial control systems. 
 "it's quite likely that nation-state operators are already familiar with this and have attacks that they could use for political purposes, but ordinary attackers have had no interest in these systems," he said. "what we hope to do is bring attention to this issue. if we can successfully attack these control systems, others with a bad intention can also do it." 
 in addition to improving password security and limiting connections, beyah says operators of these devices need to install intrusion monitoring systems to alert them if attackers are in the process control networks. beyah and formby have launched a company to make their strategies for protecting systems broadly available to control system operators.

 john edgar browning owes his love of dracula - and much of his scholarly career - to his family's vcr. growing up in tennessee during the 1980s, he watched the movies his family taped off television. horror was his favorite. he was likely one of the few kindergarten students familiar with the oeuvre of freddy krueger and jason from "friday the 13 th ." today browning is a marion l. brittain postdoctoral fellow in the school of literature, media and communication who is an internationally recognized vampire and horror scholar. he has published nearly a dozen books and his latest, "the vampire in europe: a critical edition," comes out this month. this semester browning teaches "fashioning monsters, preserving normalcy," which examines the way we construct monsters and otherness in literature, film and society. for example, his class discussed why leatherface from "texas chainsaw massacre" became more horrifying after putting on lipstick. "monsters tell us a lot about society," browning said. "in a way, monsters are just like politicians. they show us who is powerful, who should have power and who is powerless." of all the monsters out there, dracula captured browning's fascination. he watched the 1979 movie starring frank langella over and over again. but it was the 1992 version directed by francis ford coppola that made a lasting impact. "i stopped thinking of dracula as this fictional thing," browning said. "he was 
 vlad 
 dracula, a person who had a real history. the movie turned some switch on, and i really honed in on vampires and dracula." he sometimes wears a replica of the silver ring dracula wore in the movies in the 1940s. the center of the ring is a blood cornelian stone about the size of a half dollar. on top of the stone sits a crest containing a crown, a bat and the letter "d." the 34-year-old cuts an imposing figure at 6'4", but his soft-spoken nature and quick smile reveal an easygoing, scholarly side.  a film theory course during his junior year at florida state university showed he could have an academic career because of his love of dracula. for part of his doctoral dissertation, browning conducted ethnographic studies of people who identify themselves as real-life vampires. for his book 
 dracula in visual media , browning documented more than 700 dracula films, television programs, documentaries, animations and video games. next semester he'll teach "vampires and zombies across history and culture." "i was always someone who liked to ask questions and notice changes," he said. "you can see culture evolve by looking at dracula." when society goes through economic crises movie studios turn to horror, especially vampires, so villains can get their comeuppance. "what's strange now is that we want our vampires to 
 live ," he said. "we're rooting for the monsters, while it's normalcy or the people who created the monsters who are being killed off."

 [note to researchers: mrna-protein level disparities found in metastatic ovarian cancer in more than 60% of measurements across 4,436 genes; evidence of micro rna regulation] 
 headlines, of late, have touted the successes of targeted gene-based cancer therapies, such as immunotherapies, but, unfortunately, also  their failures . 
 broad inadequacies in a widespread biological concept that affects cancer research could be significantly deflecting the aim of such targeted drugs,  according to a new study . a team exploring genetic mechanisms in cancer at the georgia institute of technology has found evidence that a prevailing concept about how cells produce protein molecules, particularly when applied to cancer, could be erroneous as much as two-thirds of the time. 
 prior studies by other researchers have also critiqued this concept about the pathway leading from genetic code to proteins, but this new study,  led by cancer researcher john mcdonald , has employed rare analytical technology to explore it in unparalleled detail. the study also turned up novel evidence for regulating mechanisms that could account for the prevailing concept's apparent shortcomings. 
 rna concept incomplete 
 the concept stems from common knowledge about the assembly line inside cells that produces protein molecules. it starts with code in dna, which is transcribed to messenger rna, then translated into protein molecules, the cell's building blocks. 
 that model seems to have left the impression that cellular protein production works analogously to an old-style factory production line: that the amount of a messenger rna encoded by dna on the front end translates directly into the amount of a corresponding protein produced on the back end. that idea is at the core of how gene-based cancer drug developers choose their targets. 
 to put that assumed congruence between rna production and protein production to the test, the researchers examined -- in ovarian cancer cells donated by a patient -- 4,436 genes, their subsequently transcribed messenger rna, and the resulting proteins. the assumption, that proverbial factory orders passed down the dna-rna line determine in a straightforward manner the amount of a protein being produced, proved incorrect 62 percent of the time. 
 rna skews drug cues 
 "the messenger rna-protein connection is important because proteins are usually the targets of  gene-based cancer therapies ," mcdonald said. "and drug developers typically measure messenger rna levels thinking they will tell them what the protein levels are." but the significant variations in ratios of messenger rna to protein that the researchers found make the common method of targeting proteins via rna seem much less than optimal. 
 mcdonald,  mengnan zhang  and ronghu wu published their results  on august 15, 2017 in the journal  scientific reports . the work was funded by the ovarian cancer institute, the deborah nash endowment, atlanta's northside hospital and the national science foundation. the spectrophotometric technology needed to closely identify a high number of proteins is not widespread and is quite costly but is  available in wu's lab at georgia tech . 
 whereas many studies look at normal tissue versus cancerous tissue, this new study focused on cancer progression, or  metastasis, which is what usually makes cancer deadly . the researchers looked at primary tumor tissue and also metastatic tissue. 
 hiding drug targets 
 "the idea that any change in rna level in cancerous development flows all the way up to the protein level could be leading to drug targeting errors," said  mcdonald, who heads georgia tech's integrated cancer research center . drug developers often look for oddly high messenger rna levels in a cancer then go after what they believe must be the resulting oddly high levels of a corresponding protein. 
 taking messenger rna as a protein level indicator could actually work some of the time. in the mcdonald team's latest experiment, in 38 percent of the cases, the rise of rna levels in cancerous cells did indeed reflect a comparable rise of protein levels. but in the rest of cases, they did not. 
 "so, there are going to be many instances where if you're predicting what to give therapeutically to a patient based on rna, your prescription could easily be incorrect," mcdonald said. "drug developers could be aiming at targets that aren't there and also not shooting for targets that are there." 
 rna muted or magnified 
 the analogy of a factory producing building materials can help illustrate what goes wrong in a cancerous cell, and also help describe the study's new insights into protein production. to complete the metaphor: the materials produced are used in the construction of the factory's own building, that is, the cell's own structures. 
 in cancer cells, a mutation makes protein production go awry usually not by deforming proteins but by overproducing them. "a lot of mutations in cancer are mutations in production levels. the proteins are being overexpressed," said mcdonald, who is also a  professor in georgia tech's school of biological sciences . 
 a bad factory order can lead to the production of too much of a good material and then force it into the structures of the cell, distorting it. the question is: where in the production line do bad factory orders appear? 
 according to the new study, the answer is less straightforward than previously thought. 
 micro rna managing 
 the orders don't all appear on the front end of the assembly line with dna over-transcribing messenger rna. additionally, some mutations that do over-transcribe messenger rna on the front end are tamped down or canceled by regulating mechanisms further down the line, and may never end up boosting protein levels on the back end. 
 regulating mechanisms also appear to be making other messenger rna, transcribed in normal amounts, unexpectedly crank out inordinate levels of proteins. 
 at the heart of those regulating systems, another rna called micro rna may be micromanaging how much, or little, of a protein is actually produced in the end. 
 "we have evidence that micro rnas may be responsible for the non-correlation between the proteins and the rna, and that's completely novel," mcdonald said. "it's an emerging area of research." 
 micro rna, or  mirna , is an extremely short strand of rna. 
 no one at fault 
 mcdonald would like to see tissues from more cancer patients undergo similar testing. "right now, with just one patient, the data is limited, but i also really think it shows that the phenomenon is real," mcdonald said. 
 "many past studies have looked at one particular protein and a particular gene, or a particular handful. we looked at more than 4,000," mcdonald said. "what that brings up is that the phenomenon is probably not isolated but instead genome-wide." 
 the study's authors would also like to see currently less accessible, advanced protein detecting technology become more widely available to biomolecular researchers, especially in the field of cancer drug development. "targeted gene therapy is a good idea, but you need the full knowledge of whether it's affecting the protein level," mcdonald said. 
 he pointed out that no one is at fault for the possible incompleteness of commonly held concepts about protein production. 
 as science progresses, it naturally illuminates new details, and formerly useful ideas need updating. with the existence of new technologies, it may be time to flesh out this particular concept for the sake of cancer research progress.

 the research was supported by grants from the ovarian cancer institute, the deborah nash endowment fund, northside hospital (atlanta), and the national science foundation (che-452 1454501). cancer tissues from ovary and omental sites were collected from a cancer patient at northside hospital with informed consent under georgia institute of technology institutional review board protocols (h14337). any opinions, findings, and conclusions or recommendations expressed in this material are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of those agencies.

-0.9284 STEM smartphone apps may connect to vulnerable backend cloud servers 
 cybersecurity researchers have discovered vulnerabilities in the backend systems that feed content and advertising to smartphone applications. 
 a portion of the four-phase process used by skywalker to vet backend systems that support mobile apps. 
 aug 12, 2019 
 - atlanta, ga 
 cybersecurity researchers have discovered vulnerabilities in the backend systems that feed content and advertising to smartphone applications through a network of cloud-based servers that most users probably don't even know exists. 
 in research to be reported august 15 at the 2019 usenix security symposium, researchers from the georgia institute of technology and the ohio state university identified more than 1,600 vulnerabilities in the support ecosystem behind the top 5,000 free apps available in the google play store. the vulnerabilities, affecting multiple app categories, could allow hackers to break into databases that include personal information - and perhaps into users' mobile devices. 
 to help developers improve the security of their mobile apps, the researchers have created an automated system called skywalker to vet the cloud servers and software library systems. skywalker can examine the security of the servers supporting mobile applications, which are often operated by cloud hosting services rather than individual app developers. 
 "a lot of people might be surprised to learn that their phone apps are communicating with not just one, but likely tens or even hundreds of servers in the cloud," said 
 brendan saltaformaggio, 
 an assistant professor in georgia tech's 
 school of electrical and computer engineering . "users don't know they are communicating with these servers because only the apps interact with them and they do so in the background. until now, that has been a blind spot where nobody was looking for vulnerabilities." 
 the air force office of scientific research and the national science foundation supported the research. 
 in their study, the researchers discovered 983 instances of known vulnerabilities and another 655 instances of zero-day vulnerabilities spanning across the software layers - operating systems, software services, communications modules and web apps - of the cloud-based systems supporting the apps. the researchers are still investigating whether attackers could get into individual mobile devices connected to vulnerable servers. 
 "these vulnerabilities affect the servers that are in the cloud, and once an attacker gets on the server, there are many ways they can attack," saltaformaggio said. "it's a whole new question whether or not they can jump from the server to a user's device, but our preliminary research on that is very concerning." 
 the researchers identified three types of attack that could be made on the backend servers: sql injection, xml external entity and cross-site scripting, explained omar alrawi, a georgia tech graduate research assistant and co-first author with chaoshun zuo at ohio state. by taking control of these machines in the cloud, attackers could gain access to personal data, delete or alter information or even redirect financial transactions to deposit funds in their own accounts. 
 to study the system, alrawi and zuo ran applications in a controlled environment on a mobile device that connected to backend servers. they then watched the communications between the device and servers, and repeated the process for all of the applications studied. 
 "we found that a lot of applications don't encrypt the communications between the mobile app and the cloud service, so an attacker that is between the two points or on the same network as the mobile could get information about the user - their location and user name - and potentially execute password resets," alrawi said. 
 the vulnerabilities were not easy to spot. "you have to understand the context through which the app communicates with the cloud server," he said. "these are very deep bugs that cannot be identified by simply scanning and using traditional tools that are used for web application security." 
 the operators of vulnerable systems were notified of the findings. concerns about who is responsible for securing those backend servers is one of the issues to come out of the study. 
 "it's actually a significant problem because of how many different software developers may have their hands in building these cloud servers," saltaformaggio said. "it's not always clear who is responsible for doing the patching and who is responsible for the vulnerabilities. it's tough to track down these vulnerabilities, but it's also tough to get them patched." 
 to save app developers from having to do the security research they did, the researchers are offering skywalker, an analysis pipeline to study mobile backends. developers will be able to submit their apps to skywalker at 
 https: / / mobilebackend.vet 
 and get a report on what it finds. 
 "skywalker will watch how the application communicates with those cloud servers, and then it will try to communicate with the servers to find vulnerabilities," said alrawi. "this information can give an app developer a heads-up about potential problems before they make their application public." 
 the researchers studied only applications in the google play store. but applications designed for ios may share the same backend systems. 
 "these servers provide backend services for mobile apps that any device could use," alrawi said. "these cloud services are essential components of modern mobile apps. they are part of the always-connected world." 
 for the future, the researchers hope to study how the vulnerabilities could affect smartphone users, and to check on whether the problems they identified have been addressed. 
 "we are going to keep doing these sorts of studies and will revisit them later to see how the attack landscape has improved," said saltaformaggio. "we will keep looking for more blind spots that need to be studied. in the new world of smartphones and mobile applications, there are unique problems that need to be rooted out." 
 in addition to those already mentioned, the research team included ruian duan and ranjita pai kasturi from georgia tech and zhiqiang lin from ohio state.

-0.9417 liberal arts the social media profile of the black lives matter movement 
 study examines 29 million tweets surrounding four recent black lives matter events. 
 jun 07, 2016 
 - atlanta, ga 
 researchers at the georgia institute of technology looked at nearly 29 million tweets surrounding four recent black lives matter (blm) events to identify the social media patterns of its activists. they found that the community is unlike many other social movements because of its ability to bond over the course of many months. more than a third of those who participated via social media for the first time continued their participation during the next blm event. the study also found being from a state with historically high rates of black victimization due to police violence, especially in the south and midwest, was linked to peoples' response on social media even if the state wasn't the scene of the current blm event. the researchers also found a change in tone on twitter the day before protests sprung up around the nation. the georgia tech study is among the first to examine the online language of the blm movement. it collected tweets surrounding four major events: the shooting of michael brown in ferguson, missouri (august 2014); the decision not to indict ferguson police officer darren wilson (november 2014); protests and the shooting deaths of two new york city police officers (december 2014); and the death of freddie gray while in custody of baltimore police officers (april 2015). the team also plugged in data of more than 10,000 deaths due to police shootings since 2000. from that, it outlined which states, based on their african-american population, had the highest rates of deaths. missouri, kansas, oklahoma and new mexico were among the highest in the mainland united states. "these were the same states where we found very negative language on twitter during black lives matter events," said munmun de choudhury, the georgia tech assistant professor who led the study. "other areas, especially in the south and midwest, used words about death to express their feelings. potentially, twitter users in states with historically higher rates of fatal police shootings of blacks tend to interact with others to seek and provide psychosocial support around issues of racial inequality." however, much of that negativity disappeared on the immediate eve of protests. language changed. the researchers noticed that tweets about death, anger and first person singular nouns transformed into more posts about family, friends and first person plural pronouns. "we saw more sadness but lower anger and anxiety the day before protests," said benjamin sugar, a georgia tech master's student who co-authored the study. "it doesn't mean they weren't angry or anxious. but in 140 characters, people showed thoughts of moving forward and making a difference." blm was born on facebook in 2013 following the acquittal of george zimmerman in the shooting death of florida's trayvon martin. during each subsequent event, the movement has contradicted typical twitter stereotypes. the study found that on average 36 percent of first-time blm users participated again. "other hashtag movements have helped spread awareness about important issues, but many of them quickly lose their momentum," said shagun jhaver, a georgia tech ph.d. student and co-author. "the black lives matter movement realizes it's part of a long-term social transformation and shows continual engagement. and it continues despite having no formal hierarchal structure."   the research, " social media participation in an activist movement for racial equality ,"  won best paper when it was presented last month at the international aaai conference on web and social media in germany. it was funded, in part, by the national institutes of health ( # 1r01gm11269701). any opinions, findings, and conclusions or recommendations expressed in this material are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of the national institutes of health.

-0.8564 liberal arts social media study identifies mental health culture at top-ranked campuses 
 using social media, researchers create a mental health index for country's top-ranked colleges. 
 munmun de choudhury is an assistant professor in the school of interactive computing. 
 jun 01, 2017 
 - atlanta, ga 
 using information gleaned from social media, researchers from the georgia institute of technology have created a mental health index for the nation's highest-ranked colleges and universities. their study looked at five years of data on reddit, scanning it for comments about issues that included depression, financial and academic anxiety and thoughts of suicide. schools were given a score based on the frequency of those threads and robustness of the conversations. 
 the research found that students at higher-ranked schools have better mental health than those at lower-ranked colleges. the well-being index is also better at universities with higher tuition. it's lower at large public schools with a majority of female students. 
 the study doesn't identify schools individually for privacy reasons. 
 "online conversations about mental health issues are definitely increasing," said munmun de choudhury, georgia tech's assistant professor, from the school of interactive computing, who led the study. "we saw it rise 16 percent from 2011 to 2015, even after we took into account that reddit has become more popular in recent years." 
 the study focused on the top 150 universities as ranked by 
 u.s. news & world report , gathering data from the 109 of them with active reddit accounts. 
 de choudhury suggests that the reason there are less posts about tuition anxiety at more expensive colleges is because their students tend to be more affluent than the average public school attendee. therefore, the stresses of paying for college or going into debt aren't as great. de choudhury also thinks that the wider variety of backgrounds at large public schools likely lends itself to a more robust sharing of stress and anxiety issues. 
 "as for more posts about mental health at universities with more females, i don't think it's necessarily because women have more anxiety," de choudhury said. "research has traditionally shown that females are more likely to express their emotions and feelings whether in an offline setting or social media. it's not that they have poorer mental health - it's that they're more likely to talk about their troubles while online." 
 the study also found an overall increase in mental health posts as the academic year progressed. it peaked in the fall in november and was even higher in may. it gradually decreased each summer. 
 the georgia tech team used a method called transfer learning to mine the data. first, they created a model to scan subreddit threads about depression, bipolar disorder and other issues to learn patterns of what is written when people discuss mental health. then the model was used on the higher education subreddit communities. 
 the algorithm scanned the five years of discussions, day by day, looking for clues. once it found keywords and phrases, it measured the breadth of the conversations. the more frequent the posts and depths of the discussions, the lower the respective mental health indexes. 
 overall, three percent of the threads on the 109 sites were about mental health topics. 
 de choudhury has previously done similar social media research to help identify expressions of 
 eating disorders , 
 postpartum depression 
 and 
 suicide . 
 "i've always wondered if there are things about college students and mental health that we could learn by using these same social media research tactics," de choudhury said. "we wanted to see if we could do something more collectively at the campus level before digging deeper to understand the challenges individuals might be facing. perhaps this data can be used to help campus administrators as they create policies in real-time to benefit student bodies dealing with stress and anxieties." 
 the paper, " a social media-based index of mental well-being in college campuses ," was presented this month at the 2017 acm conference on human factors in computing systems (chi 2017) in denver. 
 the study is partially supported by the national institutes of health (grant number 
 1r01gm11269701). any opinions, findings and conclusions or recommendations expressed in this material are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of the sponsor.

-0.7556 STEM sticking to the schedule was difficult for apollo astronauts 
 new report finds that apollo astronauts often fell behind schedule while on the moon. 
 jan 18, 2018 
 - atlanta, ga 
 no one plans like nasa, and when it came to exploring the moon, the apollo program was no different. however, even despite their best efforts, the astronauts consistently demonstrated the challenges of keeping to schedule. 
 georgia tech researchers analyzed the archived mission reports from the apollo moonwalks to see how well moonwalkers were able to stick to their expected timelines. 
 on almost every walk or drive on the lunar surface, astronauts fell behind - sometimes as much as an hour, forcing them to drop specific tasks from the schedule. 
 the report could held guide officials as they plan for crewed missions to mars.

-0.9894 STEM study finds "lurking malice" in cloud hosting services 
 a study of 20 major cloud hosting services has found that as many as 10 percent of the repositories hosted by them had been compromised.

 oct 19, 2016 
 - atlanta, ga 
 a study of 20 major cloud hosting services has found that as many as 10 percent of the repositories hosted by them had been compromised - with several hundred of the "buckets" actively providing malware. such bad content could be challenging to find, however, because it can be rapidly assembled from stored components that individually may not appear to be malicious. 
 to identify the bad content, researchers created a scanning tool that looks for features unique to the bad repositories, known as "bars." the features included certain types of redirection schemes and "gatekeeper" elements designed to protect the malware from scanners. researchers from the georgia institute of technology, indiana university bloomington and the university of california santa barbara conducted the study. 
 believed to be the first systematic study of cloud-based malicious activity, the research will be presented october 24 at the acm conference on computer and communications security in vienna, austria.  the work was supported in part by the national science foundation. 
 "bad actors have migrated to the cloud along with everybody else," said 
 raheem beyah , a professor in georgia tech's 
 school of electrical and computer engineering . "the bad guys are using the cloud to deliver malware and other nefarious things while remaining undetected. the resources they use are compromised in a variety of ways, from traditional exploits to simply taking advantage of poor configurations." 
 beyah and graduate student xiaojing liao found that the bad actors could hide their activities by keeping components of their malware in separate repositories that by themselves didn't trigger traditional scanners. only when they were needed to launch an attack were the different parts of this malware assembled. 
 "some exploits appear to be benign until they are assembled in a certain way," explained beyah, who is the motorola foundation professor and associate chair for strategic initiatives and innovation in the school of electrical and computer engineering. "when you scan the components in a piecemeal kind of way, you only see part of the malware, and the part you see may not be malicious." 
 in the cloud, malicious actors take advantage of how difficult it can be to scan so much storage. operators of cloud hosting services may not have the resources to do the deep scans that may be necessary to find the bars - and their monitoring of repositories may be limited by service-level agreements. 
 while splitting the malicious software up helped hide it, the strategy also created a technique for finding the "bad buckets" hosting it, beyah said. many of the bad actors had redundant repositories connected by specific kinds of redirection schemes that allowed attacks to continue if one bucket were lost. the bad buckets also usually had "gatekeepers" designed to keep scanners out of the repositories, and where webpages were served, they had simple structures that were easy to propagate. 
 "we observed that there is an inherent structure associated with how these attackers have set things up," he explained. "for instance, the bad guys all had bodyguards at the door. that's not normal for cloud storage, and we used that structure to detect them." 
 the researchers began by studying a small number of known bad repositories to understand how they were being used. based on what they learned, they created "barfinder," a scanner tool that automatically searches for and detects features common to the bad repositories. 
 overall, the researchers scanned more than 140,000 sites on 20 cloud hosting sites and found about 700 active repositories for malicious content. in total, about 10 percent of cloud repositories the team studied had been compromised in some way. the researchers notified the cloud hosting companies of their findings before publication of the study. 
 "it's pervasive in the cloud," said beyah. "we found problems in every last one of the hosting services we studied. we believe this is a significant problem for the cloud hosting industry." 
 in some cases, the bad actors simply opened an inexpensive account and began hosting their software. in other cases, the malicious content was hidden in the cloud-based domains of well-known brands. intermingling the bad content with good content in the brand domains protected the malware from blacklisting of the domain. 
 beyah and liao saw a wide range of attacks in the cloud hosted repositories, ranging from phishing and common drive-by downloads to fake antivirus and computer update sites. "they can attack you directly from these buckets, or they can redirect you to other malicious buckets or a series of malicious buckets," he said. "it can be difficult to see where the code is redirecting you." 
 to protect cloud-based repositories from these attacks, beyah recommends the usual defenses, including patching of systems and proper configuration settings. 
 looking ahead, the researchers hope to make barfinder available to a broader audience. that could include licensing the technology to a security company, or making it available as an open-source tool. 
 "attackers are very clever, and as we secure things and make the cloud infrastructure more challenging for them to attack, they will move onto something else," he said. "in the meantime, every system that we can secure makes the internet just a little bit safer."

-0.9872 STEM study shows cellular rna can template dna repair in yeast 
 scientists have shown that rna from within cells of a common yeast can serve as a template for repairing dna. 
 the growth of the budding yeast colonies in the four patches at the bottom of the petri dish indicates that dna has been repaired by using transcript rna from within the cells. (georgia tech photo: rob felt) 
 sep 03, 2014 
 - atlanta, ga 
 the ability to accurately repair dna damaged by spontaneous errors, oxidation or mutagens is crucial to the survival of cells. this repair is normally accomplished by using an identical or homologous intact sequence of dna, but scientists have now shown that rna produced within cells of a common budding yeast can serve as a template for repairing the most devastating dna damage - a break in both strands of a dna helix. earlier research had shown that synthetic rna oligonucleotides introduced into cells could help repair dna breaks, but the new study is believed to be the first to show that a cell's own rna could be used for dna recombination and repair. the finding provides a better understanding of how cells maintain genomic stability, and if the phenomenon extends to human cells, could potentially lead to new therapeutic or prevention strategies for genetic-based disease. the research was supported by the national science foundation, the national institutes of health and the georgia research alliance. the results were reported september 3, 2014, in the journal 
 nature . "we have found that genetic information can flow from rna to dna in a homology-driven manner, from cellular rna to a homologous dna sequence," said francesca storici, an associate professor in the school of biology at the georgia institute of technology and senior author of the paper. "this process is moving the genetic information in the opposite direction from which it normally flows. we have shown that when an endogenous rna molecule can anneal to broken homologous dna without being removed, the rna can repair the damaged dna. this finding reveals the existence of a novel mechanism of genetic recombination." most newly-transcribed rna is quickly exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm of cells to perform its many essential roles in gene coding and expression, and in regulation of cell operations. generally, rna is kept away from - or removed from - nuclear dna. in fact, it is known that annealing of rna with complementary chromosomal dna is dangerous for cells because it may impair transcription elongation and dna replication, promoting genome instability. this new study reveals that under conditions of genotoxic stress, such as a break in dna, the role of rna paired with complementary dna may be different, and beneficial, for a cell. "we discovered a mechanism in which transcript rna anneals with complementary broken dna and serves as a template for recombination and dna repair, and thus has a role in both modifying and stabilizing the genome," storici explained. dna damage can arise from a variety of causes both inside and outside the cell. because the dna consists of two complementary strands, one strand can normally be used to repair damage to the other. however, if the cell sustains breakage in both strands - known as a double-strand break - the repair options are more limited. simply rejoining the broken ends carries a high risk of unwanted mutations or chromosome rearrangement, which can cause undesirable effects including cancer. without successful repair, however, the cell may die or be unable to carry out important functions. beginning in 2007, storici's research team showed that synthetic rna introduced into cells - including human cells - could repair dna damage, but the process was inefficient and there were questions about whether the process could occur naturally. to find out whether cells could use endogenous rna transcripts to repair dna damage, she and graduate students havva keskin and ying shen - who are first and second authors on the paper - devised experiments using the yeast 
 saccharomyces cerevisiae , which is widely used in the lab for genetics and genome engineering. the researchers developed a strategy for distinguishing repair by endogenous rna from repair by the normal dna-based mechanisms in the budding yeast cells, including using mutants that lacked the ability to convert the rna into a dna copy. they then induced a dna double-strand break in the yeast genome and observed whether the organism could survive and grow by repairing the damage using only transcript rna within the cells. the dna region that generates the transcript was constructed to contain a marker gene interrupted by an intron, which is a sequence that is removed only from the rna during the process of transcription, explained keskin. following intron removal, the transcript rna sequence has no intron, while the dna region that generates the transcript retains the intron; thus they are distinguishable. only the repair templated by the transcript devoid of the intron can restore the function of a homologous marker gene in which the dna double-strand break is induced, she added. the researchers measured success by counting the number of yeast colonies growing on a petri dish, indicating that the repair had been made by endogenous rna. testing was done on two types of breaks, one in the dna from which the rna transcript had been made, and the other in a homologous sequence from a different location in the dna. the research team, which also included scientists from drexel university, found that proximity of the rna to the broken dna increased the efficiency of the repair and that the repair occurred via a homologous recombination process. storici believes that the repair mechanism may operate in cells beyond yeast, and that many types of rna can be used. "we are showing that the flow of genetic information from rna to dna is not restricted to retro-elements and telomeres, but occurs with a generic cellular transcript, making it more of a general phenomenon than had been anticipated," she explained. "potentially, any rna in the cell could have this function." for the future, storici hopes to learn more about the mechanism, including what regulates it. she also wants to learn whether it takes place in human cells. if so, that could have implications for treating or preventing diseases that are caused by genetic damage. "cells synthesize lots of rna transcripts during their life spans; therefore, rna may have an unanticipated impact on genomic stability and plasticity," said storici, who is also a georgia research alliance distinguished cancer scientist. "we need to understand in which situations cells would activate rna-dna recombination. better understanding this molecular process could also help us manipulate mechanisms for therapy, allowing us to treat a disease or prevent it altogether." in addition to storici, the paper's authors include alexander mazin, a professor in the department of biochemistry and molecular biology at drexel university; postdoctoral fellow fei huang and graduate student mikir patel, also from drexel; havva keskin, a georgia tech graduate student; ying shen, a ph.d. graduate from georgia tech who is now a postdoctoral fellow at boston university school of medicine; and graduate student taehwan yang and undergraduate student katie ashley from school of biology at georgia tech. this research is supported by the national science foundation under award number mcb-1021763, by the national institutes of health under award numbers ca100839 and p30ca056036, and by the georgia research alliance under award number r9028. any conclusions or opinions are those of the authors and do not necessarily represent the official views of the sponsoring agencies. citation : havva keskin, et al., "transcript-rna-templated dna recombination and repair," nature 2014.

 the georgia institute of technology is at the forefront of developing technologies and solutions related to cancer detection and treatment, thanks to support from the 
 advanced research projects agency for health 
 (arpa-h). 
 president joe biden's cancer moonshot initiative aims to cut the cancer death rate by half in 25 years. three projects connected to georgia tech, which have collectively received $119 million from arpa-h, are doing just that. 
 with a grant worth up to $50 million, georgia tech will lead development of a new generation of cancer tests capable of detecting multiple types of tumors earlier than ever. led by biomedical engineer 
 gabe kwong , the project will map the unique cellular profiles of cancer cells and leverage that knowledge to build new bioengineered sensors to detect those profiles. the goal is to create a new kind of multi-cancer early detection test that would allow oncologists to start treating the tumors sooner, when they're still small and most responsive. 
 the project is the third with ties to georgia tech received in recent weeks. professor philip santangelo, professor in the wallace h. coulter department of biomedical engineering at georgia tech and emory university, 
 received the first tranche of funding from the agency 
 - $24 million - for a project building a toolbox of mrna drugs to activate or shut off specific genes to help the immune system fight cancer and other disorders.

 "your cancer has metastasized. i'm sorry," is something no one wants to hear a doctor say. 
 cancer cells 
 kill most often 
 by crawling away from their original tumors to later re-root in vital parts of the body in a process called 
 metastasis . now, a research team led by the georgia institute of technology 
 has developed a new treatment 
 to thwart cancer's spread through the body by, in a sense, breaking cancer cells' legs. 
 cancer cells often cover themselves with bristly leg-like protrusions that enable them to creep. the researchers have used minuscule gold rods heated gently by a laser to mangle the protrusions, 
 according to a new study . the treatment prevented cell migration, a key mechanism in metastasis, in experiments on common laboratory cultures ( in vitro ) of cancerous human cells. 
 the method could potentially, in the future, offer clinicians going after individual tumors a weapon to combat cancer's deadly spread at the same time. the medical field is currently less than well-equipped to stop metastasis. 
 "if cancer stays in a tumor in one place, you can get to it, and it's not so likely to kill the patient, but when it spreads around the body, that's what really makes it deadly," said lead researcher 
 mostafa el-sayed, julius brown chair and regents professor 
 at georgia tech's 
 school of chemistry and biochemistry. 
 the treatment can also easily kill cancer cells, but in this experiment, it was vital to specifically show that it greatly slowed cell migration. the method is not scheduled for human testing. 
 halting cancer softly 
 the experimental treatment also spared healthy cells, in these and in prior experiments, making the method potentially much less 
 taxing on patients than commonly used chemotherapy . in past tests in animal models, the researchers have uncovered no toxic side effects from the gold used in the treatment, and have found no observable damage to healthy tissue from the low-energy laser. 
 and they did not see recurrence of the treated cancer. 
 "the method appears to be very effective as a locally administered treatment that also protects the body from cancer's spread away from the treated tumors, and it is also very mild, so it can be applied many times over if needed," el-sayed said. 
 el-sayed, 
 co-lead author ronghu wu , and first authors yue wu and moustafa ali published the results of their current 
 in vitro 
 experiments, a new development in 
 photothermal gold nanorod therapy , on june 26, 2017, in the 
 proceedings of the national academy of sciences. 
 the research was funded by the national science foundation and the national institutes of health. 
 how it works: icky legs 
 to understand how the treatment works, let's take a close-up look at a cell and some things that happen to it in malignant cancer. 
 many people think of cells as watery balloons -- fluid encased in a membrane sheath with organelles floating around inside. but that picture is incomplete. cells have support grids called 
 cytoskeletons 
 that give them form and that have functions. 
 the cytoskeletons also form bristly 
 protrusions called filopodia, which extend out from a weave of fibers called lamellipodia 
 that are on the cell's fringes. the protrusions normally help healthy cells shift their location in the tissue that they are part of. 
 but in malignant cancer, normally healthy cell functions often lunge into destructive overdrive. lamellipodia and filopodia are wildly overproduced. 
 "all these lamellipodia and filopodia give the cancer cells legs," said yue wu, a graduate student in bioanalytical chemistry. "the metastasis requires those protrusions, so the cells can travel." 
 how it works: sticky rods 
 the 
 gold nanorods 
 thwart the protrusions in two ways. the rods are comprised of a small collection of gold atoms - nano refers to something being just billionths of meters (or feet) in size. 
 first, el-sayed's nanorods are introduced locally, where they encumber the leggy protrusions on cancerous cells. the rods are coated with molecules ( rgd-peptide s) that make them stick specifically to a type of cell protein called 
 integrin . 
 "the targeted nanorods tied up the integrin and blocked its functions, so it could not keep guiding the cytoskeleton to overproduce lamellipodia and filopodia," said yan tang, a postdoctoral assistant in computational biology who worked on the study. the binding of the integrin alone slowed down the migration of malignant cells. 
 but healthy cells were not targeted. "there are certain, specific integrins that are overproduced in cancerous cells," said moustafa ali, one of the study's first authors. "and you don't find them so much in healthy cells." 
 how it works: gentle laser heating 
 in the second phase, researchers hit the gold nanoparticles with a low-energy laser of near-infrared (nir) light. it brought the migration of the cancer cells to an observable halt. 
 "the light was not absorbed by the cells, but the gold nanorods absorbed it, and as a result, they heated up and partially melted cancer cells they are connected with, mangling lamellipodia and filopodia," ali said. "it didn't kill all the cells, not in this experiment. if we killed them, we would not have been able to observe whether we stopped them from migrating or not." 
 if desired, the treatment can also be adjusted to kill the cells. 
 early experiments in animal models 
 in vivo 
 with hotter lasers didn't work as well.  "that caused inflammation, which made it possible to heat one time only," ali said. "as a result, that high temperature would wipe out many cancer cells, but not all of them. some hidden ones might have survived, and also still been able to migrate." 
 "this gentle laser didn't burn the skin or damage tissue, so it could be dosed multiple times and more thoroughly stop the cancer cells from being able to travel," said researcher ronghu wu. 
 medical possibilities 
 the researchers presently envision treating head, neck, breast, and skin cancers with direct, local nanorod injections combined with the low-power near-infrared laser, which can hit the gold nanorods 2-3 centimeters (a bit under or over an inch) deep inside tissue. "but it could go as deep as 4-5 centimeters," ali said. 
 deeper tumors could conceivably be treated with deeper injections of nanorods. "then you'd need to go in with a fiber optic or endoscopic laser," el-sayed said. injecting the nanorods directly into the bloodstream as a broad treatment would not currently be a viable option. 
 el-sayed's group has previously published 
 in vivo  experiments in mice 
 in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences together with emory university school of medicine . that study showed no observable toxicity from the gold in mice 15 months after treatment. 
 "a lot of it ended up in the liver and spleen," el-sayed said. "but the functions of these organs appeared intact upon examination, and treated mice were alive and healthy over a year later." 
 presidential honors 
 mostafa el-sayed is one of the world's most highly decorated and cited living chemists, and a pioneer of nanoscience and technology. among his many recognitions are 
 the president's national medal of science, awarded by president george w. bush , and the 
 priestley medal , the american chemical society's highest honor. 
 president barack h. obama appointed el-sayed to the president's national medal of science committee . el-sayed also participated in the nomination of chemistry 
 nobel laureate ahmed zewail. 
 el-sayed is known throughout physical chemistry for " el-sayed's rule ," which handles complexities of electron spin orbits, and which has found a lasting place in photochemistry textbooks. after losing his wife to cancer in 2005, el-sayed dedicated his knowledge and research to ending the scourge.

-0.9789 STEM understanding what's happening inside liquid droplets 
 georgia tech researchers are studying how unstable toroidal droplets evolve.

 - atlanta, ga 
 for most people, the drip, drip, drip of a leaking faucet would be an annoyance. but for georgia institute of technology ph.d. candidate alexandros fragkopoulos, what happens inside droplets is the stuff of serious science. 
 in the laboratory of 
 alberto fernandez-nieves 
 in georgia tech's 
 school of physics , fragkopoulos is studying how toroidal droplets - which initially take the shape of a donut - evolve into spherical droplets by collapsing into themselves or breaking up into smaller droplets. 
 work with droplets has implications for the life sciences, where biological materials, including cells, undergo shape changes reminiscent of droplet behavior. and the findings could improve industrial processes ranging from fuel injectors to chemical processes that depend on droplet formation. in the work, researchers in the fernandez-nieves lab have developed a new understanding of the processes that control the evolution of unstable, donut-shaped droplets, helping them clarify the complex interplay of forces relevant to the problem. 
 "surface tension drives the evolution of the droplets," said fragkopoulos. "fluids tend to minimize their surface area for a given volume because that minimizes the energy required to have an interface between different fluids. spherical shapes minimize that energy, and as a result, toroidal droplets want to evolve to become spherical. we're studying how that transition occurs." 
 using a sheet of laser light to observe the scattering from polystyrene particles placed into droplets formed within thick silicone oil, the researchers have observed in detail how droplets change shape - and which factors set the droplets on the path to either collapse or breakup. the research, which was supported by the national science foundation, was reported march 1 in the journal 
 proceedings of the national academy of sciences . 
 "the viscous forcing as the torus collapses exerts stress on the interface, which causes it to both have a circulation inside the torus and deform its surface," said fragkopoulos. "we need to take into account these stresses to completely understand the evolution of the droplets." 
 the impetus for the experimental work was inconsistencies between theoretical predictions and computer simulation of toroidal droplet transitions. what the georgia tech researchers found tends to back up the simulation results. "however, the earlier theoretical work was essential in guiding the theory efforts and in illustrating what the problem was in order to correctly describe the experimental results," said fernandez-nieves. 
 "parameters such as the aspect ratio - the overall dimension of the torus divided by the dimensions of the tube - determine whether the toroidal droplet can break up, or if it will simply collapse into itself," said fragkopoulos. "we found that the toroidal droplet deforms a lot from the donut shape as it collapses. it flattens as it develops, which was initially unexpected. we had expected the torus to be symmetrical and nicely circular, which is not what we found." 
 the breakup or collapse of ordinary raindrops is known to involve the formation of a donut-like rim. however, the process is rather uncontrolled and takes place quickly, so quickly that only high-speed cameras could see it. to allow detailed study of the transition and imaging the flow field within the drops, fragkopoulos dramatically slowed down the evolution by creating droplets within a type of silicone oil that is six times more viscous than honey. instead of ordinary water, he used distilled water into which polyethylene glycol has been mixed to further slow the dynamics. 
 the water is introduced into a rotating bath of the silicone oil using a tiny needle injector. by controlling the pumping rate and where the needle inserts the water, the researchers can control the geometrical parameters of the toroidal droplets, specifically the thickness of the ring and the relative size of the hole inside it. the droplets they study range in size up to about a centimeter in diameter. "this simple strategy affords exquisite control," said fernandez-nieves. 
 polystyrene beads in the water allow the researchers to use particle image velocimetry (piv) to see the flow fields within the droplets, showing how the cross section deviates from circular over time. 
 "we are using the difference in viscosity to generate the torus," fragkopoulos explained. "we are using viscous forces to generate the droplets, because it's important to slow down the dynamics of the torus collapse so we can have enough time and resolution to see the flow fields developing inside it." 
 research into droplet formation has tended to be applications-focused. now fragkopoulos and fernandez-nieves are using their experimental and theoretical work to address other science problems. 
 "we are now using the methods for creating toroidal objects made from different materials to study problems in condensed matter and bioengineering," said fernandez-nieves. "we started working on toroidal droplets with the idea of studying how topology and geometry affected how ordered materials are affected by these aspects, and later to address how curvature affects cell behavior. we wanted to make nontrivial geometries so we could study how this affects behavior," added fragkopoulos. 
 the next step in the work is to study electrically-charged droplets, which are widely used industrially. the electrical charges add a new wrinkle to the flow fields and change how the toroidal droplets transform. in addition to those already mentioned, the research included former graduate and undergraduate students in the fernandez-nieves lab, ekapop pairam and eric berger, and prof. phil segre at oxford college, georgia. 
 the research was supported by the national science foundation. any opinions, findings, and conclusions or recommendations expressed in this material are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of the national science foundation.

-0.9929 STEM unique bacterial chemist in the war on potatoes 
 a bacterial warrior the only one of its kind? this enzyme is "wacko" in the ways it breaks down a poison related to tnt. 
 a bacterial warrior the only one of its kind? this enzyme is "wacko" in many ways in its breakdown of a poison related to tnt. on top of that, 5naa-a is known so far only to exist in a single living organism on earth. could it be the lone master of a rare bacterial enzymatic kung fu, in the war on potatoes? or does a genomic clue point to its existence in one other solitary case? 
 oct 03, 2016 
 - atlanta, ga 
 in fertile farm soils where potatoes grow, 
 streptomyces scabies 
 bacteria wage war using chemicals related to explosives and pesticides. 
 but a microbial spoiler defuses one of 
 s. scabies ' poisons. researchers at the georgia institute of technology have gained new insights into a one-of-a-kind mechanism it employs, which could someday contribute to the development of new agents to degrade tough pollutants and help rescue crops. 
 when 
 s. scabies 
 infects potatoes, it spews poisons called thaxtomins, which riddle potatoes with familiar dark scabs. perhaps a trifle to the potato connoisseur excising them with a paring knife, on a global scale, the blemishes add up to a slash in agricultural production. 
 unprecedented moves 
 scientists investigating potato soil found that bacteria of the species 
 bradyrhizobium sp. js329 
 run interference. though their tough enzymes don't break down thaxtomins, they do render innocuous another 
 s. scabies 
 toxic secretion called 
 5-nitroanthranilic acid 
 (5-naa). 
 still, understanding how it is broken down could prove useful to agriculture. "the 5naa molecule is similar enough to thaxtomin that studying its degradation might inspire future work to engineer an enzyme or bacterium, or even the plant itself, to detoxify thaxtomin," lieberman said. 
 one enzyme in particular uses seemingly unprecedented and spectacular chemical tricks to tear apart 5-naa's otherwise ironclad chemical structure. 
 researchers uncovered them and published the results in the 
 journal nature chemical biology on monday, october 3, 2016 . the research was funded by the national science foundation, pew charitable trusts, georgia internship for teachers, and the u.s. department of energy. 
 chemical warfare 
 s. scabies 
 bacteria are masters of chemical warfare, and not just against potatoes. 
 "this family of bacteria is known for the ability to synthesize lots of different molecules, including ones that humans use as antibiotics," said senior researcher 
 raquel lieberman, an associate professor 
 at georgia tech's 
 school of chemistry and biochemistry . 
 "they're good at killing other organisms," she said. though the thaxtomins they secrete are well-known for marring potatoes, little is known about toxin 5naa. 
 enzymatic kung fu 
 5naa has met its match in bacterium bradyrhizobium sp. js329, which we'll call "brady" for short. 
 "brady" produces enzymes that can combat 5naa, the first of which is called 5naa-a. the added "a" after the dash stands for "aminohydrolase," a term that means it uses water to alter part of toxin 5naa. 
 the "substitution reaction" that enzyme 5naa-a carries out is common in organic synthesis, but extremely rare in living things. "there's only one other known enzyme confirmed to utilize this particular chemical mechanism," lieberman said. 
 lieberman's team, which specializes in making protein crystals of enzymes like 5naa-a, observed the moment of the ensuing reaction.  "we were able to capture the critical step (hydrolysis) in the crystal for this paper," she said. 
 "it does this wacko chemical reaction," lieberman said. 5naa-a helps destroy toxin 5naa in two ways that are like outlandish kung fu moves. 
 breaking the wrong arm 
 toxin 5naa enters the "brady" bacterium with a deadly weapon. a nitro group, or no2, is part of its structure, which makes 5naa a nitroaromatic compound. 
 "basically, all these nitroaromatics are either explosive or toxic," lieberman said. " tnt 
 is not that different from this compound." 
 plenty of bacteria have evolved enzymes to tackle synthetic nitroaromatics -- pollutants like dyes, pesticides or explosives that have been dumped in our environment. the enzymes tend to use the same strategy. "the nitro groups are typically the first target of any degrading enzyme, because they are so toxic," lieberman said. 
 not so for enzyme 5naa-a. 
 it goes after another group on the toxic molecule, the amine, which is innocuous. it's like a kung fu master breaking the arm opposite of the one with the weapon. but it works. 
 by hydrolyzing the amine, enzyme 5naa-a sets up toxin 5naa for destruction by other enzymes.  "the fact that it does it without removing the nitro is the weird part. it's an unexpected move," lieberman said. 
 kryptonite suicide 
 then there's the weirdness around metal. 
 5naa-a is a metalloprotease, an enzyme that needs a metal ion to do its work.  but unlike other metalloproteases, it doesn't have one embedded in it.  it can operate with one of four different metals, but 5naa-a can't seem to find the metal on its own. 
 "it relies on 5naa to bring it to the party," lieberman said. 
 in other words, poison 5naa seems to tow a metal ion up to enzyme 5naa-a, which then takes it away and uses it to destroy the poison. it's like superman handing off kryptonite to an arch enemy. 
 "at least that's very much what we think is happening," lieberman said.  "we're going to investigate the details further." 
 solitary master 
 the sum of 5naa-a's weird ways led lieberman's team to check an enormous genome database for matches of the gene sequence that can produce an enzyme like 5naa-a.  they found only one single known other example on earth. 
 "that enzyme gene sequence comes from sediment in yellowstone national park," lieberman said. it is not yet confirmed that bacteria housing it actually detoxify 5naa, though it's likely. 
 even if it does, enzyme 5naa-a remains uncommonly rare, given the myriad microbes on earth producing an even higher number of enzymes. "the fact that there may just be one other is mind-boggling," lieberman said. 
 high school researchers 
 in another rarity, a high school science teacher is one of the authors on the research paper. 
 casey bethel , who was named 
 georgia teacher of the year for 2017 , helped the other researchers break through a barrier that was holding up progress. 
 "we use so-called tags to identify the enzyme we're interested in when we go to harvest it. we suspected the tags were interfering in the crystallization process," bethel said. so, he cloned the proteins with removable tags, which significantly helped the project move forward. 
 bethel participates in georgia tech's 
 main k-12 outreach, ceismc , which, among other things, boosts stem education among underserved populations in georgia public schools. and for three years, ceismc has helped him improve his teaching skills. 
 bethel has also 
 brought high school students to work in lieberman's lab with him . he's thrilled that he -- and they -- could be a part of the study. "fantastical! unimaginable! who'd think that a high school teacher would be published in a nature journal?" bethel said. 
 since starting with georgia tech's outreach, bethel has seen at least 60 of his former students choose stem studies and careers. "whereas before, the number was close to zero," he said. "it's indescribable. it's momentous, magnificent and impactful. i'll never be able to measure the impact."

-0.9984 STEM urine test detects organ transplant rejection, could replace needle biopsies 
 new nanoparticle makes urine glow as soon as t cells initiate an attack on transplanted organs 
 a t cell, here in purple, makes contact with a transplant organ cell, here in reddish brown. the t cell secretes the enzyme granzyme b, here in gray, which attacks the organ cell. but granzyme b also severs fluorescent signal molecules, in green, from the rejection detecting nanoparticle, in light pink. the signal molecules make their way into the urine, where they give off a fluorescent cue. georgia tech  / ellamaru studio (work for hire, all rights gt, free for distribution). 
 feb 19, 2019 
 - atlanta, ga 
 too often, it's only after a transplanted organ is seriously damaged that a biopsy reveals the organ is in rejection. a new screening method using sensor particles and a urine test could catch rejection much earlier, more comprehensively, and without a biopsy needle. 
 when the body's immune system has just begun attacking cells of a transplanted organ, the new method's particles send a fluorescent signal into the urine. in a  new study , researchers at the georgia institute of technology and emory university validated the method in a mouse model, and they have engineered the sensor with highly biocompatible components, which could make the path to potential future trials easier. 
 a patient may feel fine, and a biopsy may look deceptively clean when t cells have already begun attacking a transplanted organ. the sensor particle, a  nanoparticle , detects a t cell weapon, an enzyme called granzyme b, that pushes a transplanted organ's cells into the self-destruction process called  apoptosis . 
 earliest detection 
 "before any organ damage can happen, t cells have to produce  granzyme b , which is why this is an early detection method," said gabe kwong, a co-principal investigator in the study and an  assistant professor in the wallace h. coulter department of biomedical engineering at georgia tech and emory university . 
 "this is sensitive enough to possibly detect budding rejection before you see significant injury to the transplanted organ and that could help clinicians treat early to prevent damage," said dr. andrew adams, co-principal investigator and  an associate professor of surgery at emory university school  of medicine. "right now, most tests are aimed at organ dysfunction, and sometimes they don't signal there is a problem until organ function is below 50 percent." 
 kwong and adams published the study's results  in the journal  nature biomedical engineering  on february 18, 2019 . the research was funded by the national institutes of health, the national science foundation and the burroughs wellcome fund. 
 bristly nanoball 
 the nanoparticles are put together with iron oxide in the middle like a ball. it is double-coated with  dextran , a sugar, and  polyethylene glycol , a common ingredient in laxatives, to keep the body from disposing of it too quickly. 
 bristles made of amino acids stick out from the iron ball with fluorescent "reporter" molecules attached to their tips. 
 the particles are injected intravenously. they are too big to accumulate in native tissue or to pass through the kidneys and out of the body but small enough to accumulate in the tissue of struggling transplanted organs, where they keep a lookout for rejection. 
 exploiting rejection 
 once t cells start secreting granzyme b, it severs amino acid strands in the transplanted organ's cells, triggering the cells to unravel and die. 
 "the nanoparticles' bristles mimic granzyme's  amino acid targets  in the cells, so the enzyme cuts the bristles on the nanoparticle at the same time," said kwong who directs the laboratory for synthetic immunity in the coulter department. "that releases the reporter molecules, which are so small that they easily make it through the kidney's filtration and go into the urine." 
 in the experiment, the animals' urine glowed and could be seen in their bladders in near-infrared images. 
 [ready for graduate school? 
 here's how to apply to georgia tech. ] 
 comprehensive method 
 the researchers plan to augment their new sensor to detect the other major cause of transplant rejection,  attacks by antibodies , which are not living cells but proteins the body creates to neutralize foreign entities. 
 "antibodies kill their target cells through similar types of enzymes. in the future, we envision a single sensor to detect both types of rejection," kwong said. but there is even more potential. 
 "this method could be adapted to tease out multiple problems like rejection, infection or injury to the transplanted organ," adams said. "the treatments for all of those are different, so we could select the proper treatment or combination of treatments and also use the test to measure how effective treatment is." 
 outdoing biopsies 
 biopsies are currently the gold standard in detection but they can go wrong, and the wide, long  needle  can damage tissue. 
 "the biggest risk of a biopsy is bleeding and injury to the transplanted organ," adams said. "then there's the possibility of infection. you're also just taking a tiny fraction of the transplanted organ to determine what's going on with the whole organ, and you may miss rejection or misdiagnose it because the needle didn't hit the right spot. " 
 the urine test gets a more global reading on the whole organ, and it has other advantages over biopsies. 
 "the biopsy is not predictive. it's a static snapshot. it's like looking at a photo of people in mid-jump. you don't know if they're on their way up or on their way down. with a biopsy, you don't know whether rejection is progressing or regressing," kwong said. 
 "our method measures biological activity rates, and that tells us where things are going." 
 immunosuppressant medications 
 that could also allow clinicians to carefully dose powerful  immunosuppressant medications  that the vast majority of transplant patients receive. 
 "adjusting the dose is very difficult but very important because heavy immunosuppression increases occurrence of infections and patients who receive it also get cancer more often," kwong said. 
 for this experiment, the researchers used small skin grafts on mice and got a very clear, timely signal from the nanoparticle sensor. since organ transplants represent a lot more tissue, the researchers believe that any occurrence of organ rejection would trigger a much larger signal from the sensor.

 new immunotherapies can dramatically defeat cancer. but more often, cancer evades them, and doctors need to know quickly when that happens, so they can adjust treatment. an experimental urine test to detect immunotherapy effectiveness very early has received a major funding boost. 
 the national institutes of health has granted $1.8 million to a research project at the georgia institute of technology, where 
 the lab of gabe kwong 
 has already established a platform to detect complex disease and immune activity. kwong will use the new funding from the nih's national cancer institute to advance the platform to evaluate immunotherapy progress. 
 the platform uses an intravenous injection of "activity sensors," nanoparticles that detect early enzyme activity of immune cells attacking cancer. the sensor confirms the attack with a fluorescent signal in the urine. 
 shifty resistance 
 cancer's defenses are crafty and can thwart treatment from the start or disrupt initially successful treatment later on, so progress must be continually monitored, which kwong's lab is engineering the particle to do. early resistance to therapy looks very different from later resistance. 
 "we need to be able to classify different forms of resistance, so we can combat them better," said kwong, an  assistant professor in the wallace h. coulter department of biomedical engineering at georgia tech and emory university . 
 he plans to adapt the sensing technology to profile those subtleties. it is already engineered to have advantages over other tests that have recently entered the market, which look for signals that come later, such as dead cancer cells shedding their dna into the bloodstream. 
 "these tests can be quite effective, but some issues limit them, particularly in early detection: you have five liters of blood. whatever the cells shed gets diluted significantly in your bloodstream," kwong said. 
 that makes these signals harder to detect in blood tests. 
 enriched signals 
 "our sensors' signals get concentrated in the urine, so, not only are they not diluted in the blood, but we usually see a hundred- to thousandfold signal enrichment." 
 kwong's lab has already developed the sensors, which are biocompatible nanoparticles, refined them as a reliable platform, and engineered variations that experimentally sense blood clots, liver fibrosis, 
 organ transplant rejection , and cancer. kwong has 
 published multiple papers 
 on activity sensor urine test successes. 
 kwong's endgame ambitions: "in five to ten years, we want to expand the platform to detect most all major complex diseases and progress in treating them." 
 q & a 
 what is the activity sensor and how does the urine test work? 
 the sensors are nanoscale balls with bristles made of short amino acid strands that have fluorescent "reporter" molecules attached to their tips. the sensors tend to accumulate in compromised tissue like cancer. 
 when immunotherapy -- which can be engineered t cells or the body's own t cells aided by medication -- attack cancer cells, the t cells secrete an enzyme called granzyme that severs 
 target amino acid strands 
 in the cancer cells, triggering their death. the activity sensor's bristles mimic those strands, so granzymes cut the bristles at the same time. 
 "that releases the reporter molecules, which are so small that they easily make it through the kidney's filtration and go into the urine," said kwong who directs the laboratory for synthetic immunity in the coulter department. 
 then the urine turns a fluorescent color that can be analyzed to determine the intensity of the immunotherapy's attack on cancer. 
 [thinking about grad school?  here's how to apply to georgia tech. ] 
 is there a need for this kind of test? 
 "many patients, especially those with solid tumors, are not responding to this treatment," kwong said. "the non-responders need to be detected very quickly." 
 there are also diagnostic pitfalls the experimental sensor is devised to overcome: for example, a current measure of treatment success is tumor shrinkage, but when t cells initially cram into a tumor, it can swell. that sometimes leads doctors to believe that a therapy that is actually very effective is not working, and they may discontinue it. 
 "this test does not measure size; it measures activity," kwong. "if those swelling tumors are very high in granzyme activity, that's a great sign, and we will be able to pick that up." 
 how is the dream of detecting most known complex diseases even feasible? 
 quite conveniently, the human genome produces "only" 550 proteases, a particular type of enzyme relevant to detecting and combating disease. kwong believes researchers can adapt this platform to detect any of them and that there's a need for that. 
 "granzymes are also activated by other things like an infection, so detecting granzyme alone risks getting interference when you're looking at cancer treatment effectiveness. we're developing a panel of sensors that gives us the specificity of t cell activity in tumors over the possible activity of t cells fighting, say, a cold," kwong said. 
 "we want to build 550 different protease-detecting probes, and depending on what disease you have, they would expose a profile of the proteases in varying ratios." 
 the probes could be combined into a cocktail to detect budding cancer, immunotherapy effectiveness or infections, and machine learning would analyze their respective fingerprints in the urine signals.

-0.9706 liberal arts voice team expands on-call services with rainn 
 georgia tech voice is expanding their services by partnering with rainn, a national sexual assult hotline service with trained staff that will provide additional service to the georgia tech community. 
 apr 13, 2022 
 - atlanta, ga 
 voice , georgia tech's sexual violence prevention and victim-survivor support program, has been available 24 / 7 for several years. they are now expanding their services by partnering with rainn, a national sexual assault hotline service with trained staff that will provide additional service to the georgia tech community. this expansion centralizes the support service to a single phone number (404.894.9000) instead of calling one number during the day and the georgia tech police department (gtpd) after hours. 
 "victims and survivors of sexual violence come from a diverse range of backgrounds, experiences, and identities. in order to effectively support them, we have to offer an array of options for them to reach out for assistance and support at georgia tech. this partnership with rainn helps us expand beyond gtpd and other existing avenues for seeking help," said luoluo hong, vice president for student engagement and well-being, who is herself a campus rape survivor. 
 rainn has a national reputation for its 24 / 7 / 365 hotline that is used by peer institutions as a university-branded service. rainn volunteers responding to calls will identify themselves as representatives of the voice hotline. they receive extensive training in the areas of sexual violence, trauma, and crisis intervention. they also receive training about georgia tech and atlanta-specific resources. if students need to access additional services such as transportation to a rape crisis center or police department, assistance with a time-sensitive academic accommodation, or resolution of safety concerns, rainn will convey those needs to the voice advocate. 
 as part of georgia tech health initiatives, 
 voice 
 is a confidential resource, independent from law enforcement or the title ix office. during the summer of 2020, voice moved to enhance its system so that all students would feel safer and more comfortable accessing voice services. 
 voice will continue to provide the same services to students who experience any form of sexual violence, including sexual assault, sexual harassment, intimate partner violence, or stalking. classmates, friends, family members, and others who support survivors can also reach out for services and information on how to help. 
 voice commemorates sexual assault awarness month (saam) in april with teal ribbon day today, april 14. all yellow jackets are invited to pick up a teal ribbon on tech green and wear it on april 14 in honor of all sexual violence victims and survivors.

-0.9933 STEM while promoting diseases like cancer, these enzymes also cannibalize each other 
 finding a drug to inhibit cathepsins could treat a litany of diseases. this study is a new beginning to understanding them.

 like motley bandits, certain enzymes implicated in cancer and other diseases also annihilate each other. a new study reveals details of their mutual foils in the hopes that these behaviors can be leveraged to fight the enzymes' disease potential. 
 the bandits are cathepsins, enzymes that normally dispose of unneeded protein in our cells. but in unhealthy scenarios, cathepsins can promote illnesses like cancer, atherosclerosis, and sickle cell disease. many experimental drugs that inhibit them, while effective, have failed due to side effects that could not be well explained, so researchers at the georgia institute of technology abandoned the common focus on single cathepsins to model three key cathepsins as a system. 
 the researchers found that the cathepsins, denoted by the letters k, l, and s, not only degrade extracellular structures - proteins outside of cells that support cells - but also cannibalize, distract, and deactivate each other. cathepsins are proteases, enzymes that degrade proteins, and since the cathepsins are themselves proteins, they can degrade each other, too. 
 cathepsin  three stooges 
 "auto-digestion is my personal favorite. think about it: you take a group of cathepsin ks, and they eat each other. why? because they're just closer to each other than to what they would otherwise eat," said the study's principal investigator manu platt,  an associate professor in the wallace h. coulter department of biomedical engineering at georgia tech and emory university . 
 in disease, cathepsins appear to be like  the   three stooges  in a porcelain shop, tearing the shop down while they torment each other. as a result, early on, when the georgia tech researchers tried to influence a single cathepsin in the group, outcomes were puzzling, and the researchers felt they might be onto something relevant to past mysterious drug failures. 
 through lab experiments and mathematical calculations, they arrived at a computational model that showed how single influences ripple through the system. they published the  model as a tool online  that other researchers can use to jigger the three cathepsins in group settings, their levels of available targets, and inhibitor chemicals. the tool contrasts cathepsin bungling with cathepsin effectiveness. 
 the researchers publish their research results in the journal the  proceedings of the national academy of sciences  in the week of january 20, 2020. the research, which took a systems biology approach, was funded by the national science foundation and the national institutes of health. 
 q&a 
 how do cathepsins go wrong? 
 the three cathepsins in this study are best known for their activity in cell organelles called lysosomes under healthy conditions, where they work like molecular woodchippers to cut protein down to amino acids. 
 "they also serve functions in specific cell types, such as  cathepsin s  helping the immune system to recognize what to attack and what not to," platt said. 
 "problems happen when cathepsins get overexpressed and end up in the wrong places. they're crazy powerful and degrade the structural proteins elastin and collagen that make up arteries, tendons, the endometrium, and many tissue structures." 
 "in healthy settings,  cathepsin k  breaks down old bone to recycle calcium. but when breast cancer comes, those cancerous cells make cathepsin k to destroy collagen around the tumor. and that allows the cells to escape and metastasize to the bone," platt said. 
 [ready for graduate school?  here's how to apply to georgia tech. ] 
 how is this research relevant to drug development? 
 "i study cathepsins in illnesses like tendinopathy, endometriosis, atherosclerosis, cancer, and sickle cell disease," platt said. "so, having a drug on the market to handle cathepsins would be a big deal." 
 "many cathepsin inhibitor drugs that have failed clinical trials were very finely targeted but caused big side effects, and some of those cathepsin inhibitor drugs did not even cross-react with other cathepsins they were not targeting - which is usually a good thing - so the cause of the side effects was a mystery," platt said. "by modeling a system of cathepsins, we think we have a good start toward uncovering that mystery." 
 "if we don't know how these cathepsins are working with and against each other in complex systems, similar to how they exist in our bodies, then we are going to have a hard time getting anything into the medicine cabinet to inhibit them." 
 the study floats ideas on new approaches to drug research. for example, cathepsin s could be strategically boosted in situations where it is not the culprit to break down cathepsins k and l. 
 what can other researchers expect from the online model? 
 "they can set up their own experiments and make predictions, including what inhibitors will do, so they can test inhibitors at varying strengths in this system," platt said. "they can ask questions that they can't answer yet experimentally then test the model's predictions in the lab." 
 the model processes varying inputs into resulting changes in cathepsin levels and outcomes of degradation and indicates whether they have been deactivated or demolished. scenarios can be exported as a report and a data spreadsheet.

-0.9977 STEM 3d-printed device finds ‘needle in a haystack' cancer cells by removing the hay 
 a new approach enabled by 3d printing could help isolate tumor cells circulating in the bloodstream.

 oct 29, 2019 
 - atlanta, ga 
 finding a handful of cancer cells hiding among billions of blood cells in a patient sample can be like finding a needle in a haystack. in a new approach enabled by 3d-printed cell traps, researchers are removing the hay to expose the cancer cells. 
 trapping the white blood cells - which are about the size of cancer cells - and filtering out smaller red blood cells leaves behind the tumor cells, which could then be used to diagnose the disease, potentially provide early warning of recurrence and enable research into the cancer metastasis process. the work, led by researchers at the georgia institute of technology, could advance the goal of personalized cancer treatment by allowing rapid and low-cost separation of tumor cells circulating in the bloodstream. 
 "isolating circulating tumor cells from whole blood samples has been a challenge because we are looking for a handful of cancer cells mixed with billions of normal red and white blood cells," said 
 a. fatih sarioglu , an assistant professor in georgia tech's 
 school of electrical and computer engineering 
 (ece). "with this device, we can process a clinically-relevant volume of blood by capturing nearly all of the white blood cells and then filtering out the red blood cells by size. that leaves us with undamaged tumor cells that can be sequenced to determine the specific cancer type and the unique characteristics of each patient's tumor." 
 the research was reported september 20 in the journal 
 lab on a chip , and was supported by a seed grant from the integrated cancer research center at georgia tech. 
 other attempts to capture circulating tumor cells have attempted to extract them from the blood using microfluidic technology that recognizes specific surface markers on the cancer cells. but because the cancer can change over time, the malignant cells can't be recognized with certainty. and even if they can be captured, the tumor cells must be removed from circuitous channels in the device and separated from the antigen without causing damage. 
 sarioglu and collaborators, including ece graduate student and first author chia-heng chu, decided to take a different approach, building 3d-printed traps lined with antigens to capture the white blood cells in a sample. the 3d printed traps allowed the researchers to greatly expand the surface area for capturing the white blood cells as they pass by in blood samples. zig-zagging fluid channels, some as much as half a meter long, increase the likelihood that every white blood cell would come into contact with a channel wall. 
 "usual microfluidic devices have just a single layer with channel heights of 50 to 100 microns," sarioglu said. "they are thick, but most of it just empty plastic. using 3d printing liberates us from the single channel and allows us to create many channels in three dimensions that better utilize the space." 
 while the 3d printing allowed an increase in channel density, that came with a significant challenge. earlier microfluidic devices could be designed with etched channels to carry the blood. but with 3d printing processes that are fabricated layer-by-layer, channels had to be filled with wax to allow more channels to be built atop them. the torturous channel structure, designed to maximize cell-wall interaction, made it virtually impossible to get the wax out after fabrication. 
 the solution was to design cell traps that fit into standard centrifuges designed to spin samples for separation. the traps were heated in the centrifuge and then spun to allow the melted wax to escape. after removing the liquid wax, the channels received the antigen coating. 
 after the white blood cells are removed, the smaller red blood cells pass through a simple commercial filter that traps the cancer cells and any remaining white blood cells. the tumor cells can then be removed from the filter, which is integrated into the 3d printed device. 
 minimal processing of blood samples is a goal for the project to make the process available to clinics and hospitals without requiring specialized technician skills. less processing also reduces the risk of damage to the tumor cells and minimizes other cellular changes that could skew the evaluation. 
 as part of the proof of principle testing, the researchers coated the white blood cells with biotin to accelerate testing. future cell traps will use antigens designed to attract the cells to the channel walls without the biotin processing step. 
 the researchers tested their approach by adding cancer cells to blood taken from healthy people. because they knew how many cells were added, they could tell how many they should extract, and the experiment showed the trap could capture around 90 percent of the tumor cells. later testing of blood samples from prostate cancer patients isolated tumor cells from a 10-milliliter whole blood sample. 
 testing included cells from prostate, breast and ovarian cancer, but sarioglu believes that the device will capture circulating tumor cells from any type of cancer because the removal mechanism targets blood cells rather than cancer cells. 
 next steps will be to narrow the channels in the device, test white blood cell removal without the use of biotin, boost the percentage of white cell extraction and connect cell traps to increase trapping capacity. 
 "we expect that this will really be an enabling tool for clinicians," sarioglu said. "in our lab, the mindset is always toward translating our research by making the device simple enough to be used in hospitals, clinics and other facilities that will help diagnose disease in patients."

-0.9692 STEM 3d structure solved for vulnerable region of glaucoma-causing protein 
 scientists have determined the three-dimensional structure of a key part of a protein that is associated with glaucoma and identified regions of this domain that correlate with severe forms of the disease.

 apr 21, 2015 
 - atlanta, ga 
 scientists have determined the three-dimensional structure of a key part of a protein that is associated with glaucoma and identified regions of this domain that correlate with severe forms of the disease. the new crystal structure is of the olfactomedin (olf) domain in myocilin, a protein implicated in glaucoma. many proteins have olf domains, but mutations in the olf domain of myocilin are linked to early-onset glaucoma. despite decades of research, scientists don't completely understand what biological role myocilin plays nor how these mutations create forms of myocilin that build up in the eye, which causes glaucoma. "now that we have the 3d visual picture, we can map the mutations and understand why they can be bad for the protein," said 
 raquel lieberman , an associate professor in the school of chemistry and biochemistry at the georgia institute of technology. the study was sponsored by the american health assistance foundation, the glaucoma research foundation, and the national institutes of health (nih). the study was featured as the cover story in the april 15 issue of the 
 journal 
 human molecular genetics . glaucoma, the second leading cause of blindness worldwide, is a group of diseases that damage the eye's optic nerve and cause vision loss. elevated eye pressure is the main risk factor for optic nerve damage. researchers have implicated mutant forms of myocilin as a root cause of this increased eye pressure. mutant myocilin is toxic to cells in the part of the eye that regulates pressure. these genetically inherited variants of myocilin are toxic because they clump together in the front of the eye, preventing fluid flow out of the eye, which then raises eye pressure. this cascade of events leads to early-onset glaucoma, which is estimated to affect up to a million people from childhood to age 35. olf domain-containing proteins play roles in fundamental cellular processes and have been implicated in not just glaucoma, but also cancers, inflammatory bowel disorder, attention deficit disorder and childhood obesity. this study reports the first olf domain structure. nearly 100 different mutations in the 230 amino acid olf domain of myocilin are linked to glaucoma. in most protein domains of this size, mutating one amino acid won't cause toxic misfolding; the cell will be able to remove the protein efficiently before it causes a problem. that's not the case with myocilin. "mutating any one of these 100 or so amino acids causes the protein to aggregate," lieberman said. "myocilin is exquisitely sensitive to aggregation and the cell cannot handle it." after determining the olf domain structure, the researchers mapped and categorized the locations of mutations linked to early-onset glaucoma. they identified three different locations on olf where mutations are most likely to trigger protein aggregation. "we were able to provide new information on whether mutations reported among glaucoma cases in the general population are pathogenic or not," lieberman said.   further analysis of the myocilin olf domain in the context of the broader olf family found that olf domains have unique surface features. therefore, a high priority for further research is to develop new reagents to selectively target these specific regions and tease apart the domain's function in a variety of biological and disease contexts. "we're going to be able to figure out what the olf domain does in a more detailed way by having better reagents. the structure enables that new knowledge," lieberman said. this research is supported by grants from the american health assistance foundation, glaucoma research foundation, and the national institutes of health (r01ey021205). any conclusions or opinions are those of the authors and do not necessarily represent the official views of the sponsoring agencies. citation : rebecca k. donegan, et al.

 the book, which was co-authored with david rosen (trinity college), looks at the conflict between surveillance and privacy rights over the last four centuries - and at how this conflict has shaped modern liberalism. while santesso and rosen examine how much of this history has played out in literature (shakespeare, swift, dickens, poe, conan doyle, among others), their work has also taken them very much into real world problems of surveillance, of the sort that has been all over the news recently. the book reflects, for example, their extensive conversations with officers at scotland yard and homeland security, a former agent of the fbi and numerous individuals working in casino surveillance.

 al vivian, a national diversity and inclusion facilitator and son of civil rights leader c.t. vivian, was the keynote speaker for the race at georgia tech: a call to action conversation on thursday, jan. 21. the virtual discussion was the second in a series of campus discussions on race. 
 "talking about issues of race and racism is hard," said vice president for institute diversity, equity, and inclusion archie ervin during the conversation. "over the past year, in the wake of last summer's national racial turmoil, marked by the sensless killings of george floyd, breonna taylor, ahmaud arbery and others, and more recently, the events in our nation's capitol earlier this month, have made these converrsations even more difficult as concerns about racism and its impact have intensified and continues to bubble to the surface of our national discourse." 
 vivian heads basic diversity inc., a national full-service cultural diversity training and consulting firm best known for its race awareness workshop. his father, a confidant of martin luther king jr., founded the organization more than 45 years ago. the firm has worked with a diverse range of clients and organizations including corporations, nonprofits and, government agencies. 
 "i'll start off with a statement that is just outright true: racism in america is nothing new; it's our original sin. it's been with us from the beginning," vivian said, beginning his presentation. "if you don't understand race, your future success will be limited."

-0.494 liberal arts angela davis talks activism and reform at 2021 black history month lecture 
 activist, author, and educator angela davis delivered a virtual keynote address at georgia tech's 2021 black history month lecture on feb. 10. 
 angela davis gave a keynote speech at the 2021 georgia tech black history month lecture 
 feb 11, 2021 
 - atlanta, ga 
 esteemed activist, author, and educator angela davis delivered a virtual keynote address at georgia tech's 2021 black history month lecture on feb. 10. a pioneer in international civil rights and black feminist movements, davis has been a prominent figure for decades, working as an academic and authoring more than 10 books on race, class, gender, prison abolition, and the criminalization of marginalized communities. 
 the lecture was seen by more than 1,700 unique viewers. 
 "we are thankful to carter g. woodson for initiating the observance in 1926 of what was then called negro history week," she opened, referring to the historian and one of the first scholars to study african american history. woodson became known as the "father of black history." "this week is precisely the week we would be celebrating [negro history week] in those days." 
 decades later, black history month became, in davis' words, "the 28 days that are allocated to us to reflect not only on the contributions of black people, but on the meaning of the phenomenal collective struggle for freedom that stretches back to the days when the first africans were forcefully brought to the americas." 
 she was born in birmingham, alabama, in 1944, growing up in the infamous "dynamite hill" neighborhood, which gained its name from frequent bombings to drive out middle-class black residents in the 1950s and 1960s, including the 16 th 
 street baptist church bombing that killed four girls in 1963. davis attended segregated schools but reflected on the resilience her early upbringing and surroundings afforded her, saying, "even as we boldly challenged racial segregation, i later came to understand what a gift it was to be able to grow up in a community that realized that resistance was at the core of our visions of new futures. we learned how to resist not so much as a choice, not as an extracurricular activity, but rather as a condition of life - as a condition of our collective conviction that we would someday be free." 
 after completing high school in new york (via a program that placed black students from the south into integrated schools in the north), she would go on to study at brandeis university in boston; the sorbonne in paris; the university of frankfurt in germany; and the university of california, san diego. in 1969, she received a doctorate in philosophy from humboldt university in what was then east berlin. 
 davis noted the critical role that black women have played in advancing civil rights in the u.s., beginning with early suffrage movements. "especially because i am speaking virtually here at georgia tech in atlanta, i want to pay tribute to stacey abrams," the 2018 georgia democratic nominee for governor and the first black woman of a major political party to win a gubernatorial nomination. through her voting rights advocacy, abrams is largely credited with helping president joseph biden jr. win the state of georgia in the 2020 presidential election and for delivering two democratic georgia senate seats in january. "there's been a long history of black women not only saving the black community but saving the country." 
 the lecture, sponsored by institute diversity, equity, and inclusion and the georgia tech african american student union (aasu), included a question-and-answer session moderated by aasu members shelbe johnson and kemuel russell. 
 viewers asked davis several questions on criminal justice reform. a common theme throughout much of her scholarly work has been the social issues associated with incarceration and the criminalization of communities hardest hit by poverty and racism. she rose to national prominence in 1970 for her arrest - and subsequent acquittal - in a high-profile criminal case for which she spent 18 months in jail and on trial after being placed on the fbi's ten most wanted fugitives list. in 1997, she helped found critical resistance, which aims to dismantle prison systems worldwide. 
 her teaching career has taken her to san francisco state university and the university of california, berkeley. she also has taught at the university of california, los angeles (ucla), vassar college, syracuse university, and stanford university. most recently she spent 15 years at the university of california santa cruz, where she is now a distinguished professor emerita of history of consciousness and of feminist studies. 
 "i was hired to teach at ucla in 1969," she said, but before she could teach, she was fired for being a member of the communist party. "when i think back on the campaign to save my job, i had an enormous amount of support, including from white students and white faculty. what i attempted to do was to develop what we might call an intersectional approach. i was at the same time involved in campaigns to free political prisoners - campaigns against racism against prisoners," davis continued, while describing herself as a prison abolitionist rather than a prison reformer. "i took the position that people who supported me and my right to teach at ucla should also support people in prisons who were facing far worse forms of oppression because of their political beliefs." 
 davis will return to teach at ucla this spring, but noted her slight disdain for the fanfare her return has already brought to the campus. "i don't want to be accepted. i still want to make trouble - i like john lewis' notion of ‘good trouble,'" a nod to the late civil rights giant and georgia congressman. "so whereas i am going to be teaching at ucla again, i will continue to critique the institution, call out the racism, point to the heteropatriarchy, and point to their support of capitalist systems." 
 davis paused when asked a final question about how black people can best handle racial trauma. 
 "for so long, we haven't acknowledged racial trauma. i think what is exciting about this current era is that so many people are taking holistic approaches, teaching us how to make sense of these issues. it's important how you incorporate acknowledgment of people's trauma into the very work of organizing against racism. 
 "since this is the last question, i just want to point out that we can't let up. we can't stop. we should recognize that this is the time that the real work is getting done."

-0.9979 STEM assessing the role of negative citations in science 
 a new study examines the role of negative citations in academic publishing. 
 oct 26, 2015 
 - atlanta, ga 
 the number of times academic articles are cited by subsequent publications is among the time-honored measures used to assess scholarly standing and evaluate academic productivity. but not all of these citations are positive ones, and a paper published this week in the journal 
 proceedings of the national academy of science s finds that as many as one in 50 citations in a top immunology journal were critical in nature. these negative citations may point out limitations, inconsistences or flaws in previous work. the study found that these negative citations were more likely to criticize highly-read papers, and that the criticisms focused on specific sections of the papers. negative citations tended to originate from scholars who were close to the authors of the original articles in academic discipline and social distance - but at least 150 miles away geographically. the research, by authors at the georgia institute of technology, university of toronto and massachusetts institute of technology, may be the first to systematically quantify and examine these negative citations. the authors hope to expand their study to other disciplines, and believe their work could ultimately lead to a re-examination of how citations are used in academia. "given that we rely so heavily on these citation metrics as measures of quality, it's important to note that the intent of these citations isn't homogeneous," said alexander oettl, an assistant professor in georgia tech's 
 scheller college of business 
 and one of the study's three co-authors. "criticism is really the cornerstone of the scientific enterprise, yet it's difficult to get accurate measures of the extent to which criticism of academic papers truly occurs. the negative citations really are different from objective citations." the researchers, who also include nicola lacetera from the university of toronto and christian catalini from mit, began with 15,731 full-text articles that had been published in the 
 journal of immunology , the top academic journal in that field. from those articles, they extracted 762,355 citations, which referred to 146,891 unique published papers. beginning with a manual process, they created a set of citations that was used to train a natural language processing program which classified the remainder of the citations as either objective or negative. the process identified 18,304 negative citations, about 2.4 percent of the total citations studied. "the majority of these negative citations appear to take issue with the ‘results' and ‘discussion' sections of the papers, so they are really not attempting to overturn theory," said oettl. "they can be attempting to constrain results, note inconsistencies with other research, point out statistical flaws or correct other issues." in their study, the authors point out the relative rarity of these negative citations, and speculate that they could either demonstrate a "limited, uninfluential role" for criticism in science - or show a hesitancy to criticize. "making these negative citations isn't without cost," oettl noted. "there could be reputational harm from making these negative citations, and if your criticism turns out to be false, this could heavily impact your reputation within the field. without this cost, perhaps we might see more overt criticism appearing in the journals." the researchers found that while negative citations tended to come from scientists close to the narrow academic topic, the criticism was more likely to involve geographic distance. "we see that the probability of making a negative citation is much, much lower if you are co-located with the scientist whose work is being critiqued," oettl said. "that potentially speaks to the social component, the social cost of criticism - you don't want to criticize someone you may run into on campus. another possible interpretation is that these issues may be aired face-to-face among scientists who are located near each other geographically." in the study, frequently-cited papers were more likely than less-read papers to get negative citations, which stands to reason, oettl said. "these are typically more influential papers, so this may have more to do with more people reading them and more of an incentive for scholars to take issue with important papers," he explained. "furthermore, less important papers may receive less scrutiny, as pointing out limitations and shortcomings of trivial work will not drastically shift the scientific frontier." replication of previous work helps ensure the accuracy of research, and criticism of published studies can lead to correction that makes science more robust. but does the current scientific publishing system encourage enough discussion? "the pessimistic view is that only one in 50 citations is negative in nature, so possibly there isn't as much debate as we would want for a healthy discussion," oettl said. "but on the other hand, by the time a major manuscript makes it into print, it has undergone a tremendous amount of criticism. we now have some evidence of the extent to which criticism, in the form of negative citations, occurs within scientific manuscripts." the researchers chose immunology because they had access to the papers, which were consistent in format. they found similar numbers of negative citations in a small set of mathematics-related papers, but hope to expand their work to determine if their findings apply to other disciplines. ultimately, they hope the work could change the way citations are used in science. "we wanted to put forward a methodology to help future scholars think about how we can possibly expand this classification infrastructure and attract additional metadata to the citations that we make," oettl said. "our paper is very descriptive, but it identifies something that nobody has really demonstrated before: that these negative citations behave very differently from others." though the current study focused on a single discipline, immunology, "we would really like to see this work and methodology expanded to other disciplines," oettl said. "ultimately, though, we care about what role these negative citations play in aiding scientific debate and in the advancement of the scientific frontier." the paper was published october 26 in the journal's early edition. citation : christian catalini, nicola lacetera, alexander oettl, "beyond citation counts: exploring negative citations in science," (proceedings of the national academy of sciences, 2015).

 evil armies of internet-connected appliances could be hijacked to slightly manipulate energy demand, potentially driving price swings. 
 a study presented at black hat usa 2020 suggests that botnets made up of high-wattage devices such as ovens and air conditioners could be used to manipulate electric energy markets. (credit: john toon, georgia tech) 
 aug 04, 2020 
 - atlanta, ga 
 evil armies of internet-connected ev chargers, ovens, hot-water heaters, air-conditioners, and other high-wattage appliances could be hijacked to slightly manipulate energy demand, potentially driving price swings and creating financial damage to deregulated energy markets, warns a new report scheduled to be presented aug. 5 at the black hat usa 2020 conference. 
 by turning the compromised equipment on or off to artificially increase or decrease power demand, botnets made up of these energy-consuming devices might help an unscrupulous energy supplier or retailer (electric utility) alter prices to create a business advantage, or give a nation-state a way to remotely harm the economy of another country by causing financial damage to its electricity market. if done within the bounds of normal power demand variation, such an attack would be difficult to detect, the researchers said. 
 "if an attacker can slightly affect electricity market prices in their favor, it would be like knowing today what's going to happen in tomorrow's stock market," said tohid shekari, a graduate research assistant in the 
 school of electrical and computer engineering 
 at the georgia institute of technology. "if the manipulation stays within a certain range, it would be stealthy and difficult to differentiate from a typical load forecasting error." 
 believed to be the first proposed energy market manipulation cyberattack, the operation would depend on botnets composed of thousands of appliances that could be controlled centrally by attackers who had taken over their internet of things (iot) controllers. malicious actors have already demonstrated iot botnet attacks such as mirai, which used a network of compromised internet-connected cameras and routers to launch attacks on key internet infrastructure. 
 the attack, dubbed "iot skimmer," would be made possible by the deregulation of energy markets, which has created a system to efficiently supply electrical power. to meet the demand for electrical energy, utility companies must predict future demand and purchase power from the day-ahead wholesale energy market at competitive prices. if the predictions turn out to be wrong, the utilities may have to pay more or less for the energy they need to meet the demands of their customers by participating in the real-time market, which has more volatile prices in general. creating erroneous demand data to manipulate forecasts could be profitable to the suppliers selling energy to meet the unexpected demand, or the retailers or utilities buying cheaper energy from the real-time market. 
 the researchers weren't able to determine whether such an attack might have already taken place because iot devices - beyond being insecure - also lack the kind of monitoring that would be necessary to detect such hijacking. but they used real data sets from two of the largest u.s. energy markets - new york and california - to evaluate the feasibility of their proposed attack. 
 "we did a lot of simulation and mathematical analysis to show that this kind of transfer could occur," said 
 raheem beyah , the motorola foundation professor in the school of electrical and computer engineering who is also georgia tech's vice president for interdisciplinary research and co-founder of the company fortiphyd logic. "we also did a feasibility analysis of the supporting areas to show that this would be possible from various perspectives." 
 the researchers assume that such botnets already exist, and that attackers could simply rent their use on the dark web. more than 20 million smart thermostats already exist in the north american market, and they are connected to at least one high-wattage device - a heating and air-conditioning system that could be controlled by attackers on an intermittent basis. 
 "if you consider all of the smart thermostats and internet-connected electric ovens, water heaters, and electric vehicle chargers that are already in use, there are plenty of devices to be compromised," shekari said. "homeowners would likely never notice if the ev charger turns on when electricity demand is highest, or if the air conditioning cools a little more than they expected when they are not home." 
 to counter the potential attack, researchers suggest both detection and prevention steps. through integrated monitoring of the normal power use of high-wattage iot-connected devices, unexpected peaks or valleys in power consumption triggered by an attacker could be detected. and access to data on expected energy demand - which is now made available publicly - could be restricted to those who actually need it. 
 the primary factor that makes this attack possible is the detailed online data sharing of electricity market information, which is usually updated every five minutes. 
 "this energy demand information is really a data privacy issue, and we need to think long and hard about the balance between transparency and security," beyah said. "there's always a tension there, but limiting the amount of detail could make it more difficult for attackers who want to hide their manipulations to know what the normal variations are." 
 the potential attack highlights the need for considering cybersecurity threats in technology areas where they had perhaps never been possible before. 
 "this is an interesting intersection between the iot security world and energy markets," said beyah. "right now, it seems that there is a large gap between the two worlds. our point is that there are implications for combining iot technology and high-wattage devices that can compromise markets in ways we would never have thought of before." 
 the presentation, "iot skimmer: energy market manipulation through high-wattage iot botnets," will be presented on wednesday, aug. 5, at 2:30 p.m. as part of the black hat usa 2020 conference.

-0.9479 STEM a bipartisan approach to cyber 
 rep. tom graves, rep. kyrsten sinema hold panel discussion at georgia tech to talk about cybersecurity policy and technical challenges. 
 rep. tom graves (r-ga 14) and rep. kyrsten sinema (d-ariz. 9) hold a panel discussion at georgia tech to talk about cybersecurity policy and technical challenges. peter swire, a professor in the scheller college of business, was also on the panel. 
 may 01, 2017 
 - atlanta, ga 
 as the threat of cyberattacks continues to grow, government officials are asking what can individuals and businesses do to protect themselves. 
 "we are starting this conversation of when it is time to go on the offensive as it relates to cybersecurity," said rep. tom graves (r-ga 14). "this creates a lot of policy, ethics and privacy questions." 
 graves and rep. kyrsten sinema (d-ariz. 9) heard some answers to those questions during a panel discussion they held at georgia tech monday. the bipartisan event examined how public policy can help people and companies go on the offense to defeat and unmask cyber attackers. 
 in march, graves put forth a 
 discussion draft of a bill 
 to allow the use of limited defensive measures to identify and stop attackers. while cyber policy discussions are taking place in washington, graves said they wanted to hear from others. 
 "quite frankly we're not satisfied with the direction of where policy has gone as it relates to cybersecurity," he said. 
 monday's panel allowed for a robust discussion on cybersecurity from a policy perspective, an academic perspective and the private sector perspective. 
 in addition to graves and sinema, the other panelists were: 
 john lens, a vice president for the network and security business unit at vmware. 
 stephen pair, co-founder and ceo of bitpay. 
 peter swire, the huang professor of law and ethics in the scheller college of business. 
 candace worley, chief technical strategist for mcafee. 
 georgia tech is a place "where government, industry and universities can come together to talk about some very, very challenging problems in the world," said stephen e. cross, the institute's executive vice president for research. 
 the institute has been developing cybersecurity solutions for more than 20 years. tech houses nearly a dozen labs and centers dedicated to cybersecurity, and has more than 450 scientists, faculty and students involved with this research. 
 georgia tech is also home to the 
 advanced technology development center 
 (atdc), the state's technology incubator. atdc is currently incubating seven companies in the cybersecurity space and assisting 33 entrepreneurs and early-stage startups statewide with entrepreneurial education in cybersecurity.

-0.4567 liberal arts a break in the baby formula supply chain 
 georgia tech experts explain how we got here and how long this shortage could last 
 a national shortage has parents and families across the country struggling to feed newborns as store shelves have been left bare of baby formula products - including many brands critical to young children with specific vulnerabilities. 
 may 27, 2022 
 - atlanta, ga 
 a national shortage has parents and families across the country struggling to feed newborns as store shelves have been left bare of baby formula products - including many brands critical to young children with specific vulnerabilities. retailers are having to ration their supplies, some parents have resorted to shipping in formula from overseas, and social media sites have been used to crowdsource goods to be shipped to parents nervous about where their children's next meal might come from. 
 georgia tech economics expert tibor besedes says it has been a perfect storm of issues to create this stress-inducing situation. 
 "like many other industries, the formula producers have faced supply chain issues with respect to ingredients and containers. waves of covid-19 infections have affected their workforce and how much formula they can produce," explained besedes. 
 the final straw that may have led to this nationwide shortage: an abbott production shutdown in february 2022 after several babies were sickened and two died from bacterial infections connected to consuming baby formula from the sturgis, michigan facility. a recall followed, and that facility is believed to make at least 20% of all formula bought by consumers nationwide. 
 "it is one of a few plants in the u.s. producing formula," said besedes. "that fact itself is a bottleneck as those few plants operating in the u.s. produce 98% of all formula sold in the u.s." 
 "the formula market has been highly concentrated for a long time," explained lindsay rose bullinger, georgia tech assistant professor of public policy. "now we're dealing with a crisis and it's hard to be proactive." 
 the overwhelming majority of those formula products are only made by four different companies, explains wendy white, a nationally known food safety expert. 
 "because infant formula is the sole source of nutrition and targeted at such a vulnerable population, it has extra regulations in the infant formula act of 1980," explains white. 
 this includes mandatory registration for any infant formula manufacturers and requirements for all formulation, processing details, and ingredient lists to be filed with the fda. 
 the regulations are critical, according to bullinger. 
 "we're trying to make a product comparable to breast milk. newborn children can't digest many of the proteins in cow's milk," she explained. 
 formula is developed by scientists in highly regulated environments for infants that are incredibly susceptible to sickness as their immune and digestive systems have just begun adapting to nourishment outside of the womb. 
 diluted or homemade options do not provide the right balance of nutrients that infants need at the most critical time of their lives. manufactured formulas are made in highly sterile environments to avoid harmful additions from getting into these mixtures. 
 "it's incredibly hard to get that right in a home environment without introducing bacteria," bullinger said. 
 those strict regulations also mean that possible scenarios to help alleviate this formula shortage have been complicated. just shipping some in from another country? not so fast. 
 "foreign manufacturers need to obtain fda approvals to begin exporting to the u.s. to make up the shortage," said besedes. "the fda is now looking at manufacturers based in countries with similar regulations to expedite their approvals and increase shipments to the u.s." 
 the first relief came from overseas within the past week - a shipment of about 70,000 pounds of formula. more foreign shipments are expected in the coming days, but the supply may only last for about a week as issues continue to compound. 
 "once there was a recall and parents heard, they started stockpiling formula," said white. the result is taking already short supplies and stretching them even thinner. 
 "the supply chain has to also deal with the unneeded bullwhip effect due to shortage gaming and hoarding behavior, making the situation even worse than what it should be," says operations management associate professor morvarid rahmani. 
 white also says that 50% of the infant formula in america is purchased through government subsidies. 
 states who provide this assistance often sign exclusive contracts with one of these four formula manufacturers. abbott carries the contract in nearly two-thirds of u.s. states - complicating the purchases for families with infants in those locations. 
 "families in communities that are economically disenfranchised may be disproportionately affected," explained bullinger. "but even if you have the money, if you cannot buy formula how else are you supposed to feed an infant." 
 families who rely on supplemental nutrition assistance program (snap, also commonly known as food stamps) or supplemental nutrition for women, infants, and children (wic) may not be able to choose which brand of formula they can receive. they can only get the formula their state has a contract with. if it is out, they may just be out of luck. 
 some of the most hard-to-find infant formulas are the specialized products developed for newborns with milk allergies or other digestive issues. there's a special emphasis on sourcing those products for parents in need. 
 so how much longer could this shortage impact american consumers? at least a few weeks, georgia tech's experts say. 
 "abbott is estimating that it'll take about two weeks to get production to resume but another 6-8 weeks to get formula back on supermarket shelves," says white. 
 that means the closed facility should be open in late may with production back up to full speed sometime in august. limited diversity in the market has left parents in a bind. 
 "a shortage could be alleviated by increasing output of other plants and manufacturers, which is being done, but it is difficult to replace an entire plant," explained besedes. 
 "ramping up production has been difficult because of shortages in labor and ingredients as well as production scheduling challenges," explained rahmani. 
 some desperate parents have had to resort to extreme measures. but pediatricians have said infants should only be fed formula or breast milk. anything else is likely deficient. using alternative feeding methods could lead to long-term problems. 
 "there is a risk that a shortage will mean babies will not be getting the nutrition they need to develop. that could lead to a range of health problems affecting their physical growth and brain development," explained senior research engineer maureen linden from georgia tech's center for inclusive design and innovation. 
 "consumers should listen to their pediatricians and other experts and follow their advice. pediatricians may have available samples they can give out," said besedes. 
 they can also offer advice for alternative baby formula (to the one in shortage) which is available. medical experts are strongly advising against diluting formula or trying to recreate it at home which could cause long-lasting damage. 
 "we may see a rise in the rate of developmental disabilities in the age group that is presently reliant on formula - those presently six months or less," says linden. 
 nutrition is the most important thing in an infant's life. it's the number one priority - making sure we are feeding them and they are developing," explained bullinger. 
 that's why infants often get so many checkups - to make sure they are growing and gaining weight. proper nutrition is critical for that to happen. 
 in the meantime, consumers can take their own action. white says it's worth trying to buy online or shopping around at different stores. 
 the federal government has relaxed regulations for snap and wic recipients to be able to get products with increased flexibility. 
 the white house has also invoked the defense production act which is aimed to help manufacturers ramp up output quickly. 
 "those companies will have first dibs at materials and ingredients that are needed to make formula," said bullinger. 
 "this shortage should be temporary, as demand settles, and supply is replenished from the reopened abbott plant and fda-approved imports," says white. 
 regardless, georgia tech experts have said we should have seen this coming and could have been better prepared and quicker to act - particularly for the sake of the youngest among us. 
 "the fda, biden's administration, and baby formula manufacturers have been slow in taking actions during the past few months to prevent that. this crisis could have been prevented by timely actions," said rahmani. 
 "infants always get the short end of the stick. they can't speak for themselves," said bullinger.

 cancer drops sparse chemical hints of its presence early on, but unfortunately, many of them are in a class of biochemicals that could not be detected thoroughly, until now. 
 researchers at the georgia institute of technology have 
 engineered a chemical trap 
 that exhaustively catches what are called glycoproteins, including minuscule traces that have previously escaped detection. 
 glycoproteins are protein molecules bonded with sugar molecules, and they're very common in all living things. glycoproteins come in myriad varieties and sizes and make up important cell structures like cell receptors. they also wander around our bodies in secretions like 
 mucus 
 or  hormones . 
 but some glycoproteins are very, very rare and can serve as an early signal, or 
 biomarker , indicating there's something wrong in the body - like cancer. existing methods to reel in glycoproteins for laboratory examination are relatively new and have had big holes in their nets, so many of these molecules, especially those very rare ones produced by cancer, have tended to slip by. 
 cancerous traces 
 "these tiny traces are critically important for early disease detection," said principal investigator ronghu wu, 
 a professor in georgia tech's school of chemistry and biochemistry . "when cancer is just getting started, aberrant glycoproteins are produced and secreted into body fluids such as blood and urine. often their abundances are extremely low, but catching them is urgent." 
 this new chemical trap, which took georgia tech 
 chemists several years to develop 
 and is based on a 
 boronic acid , has proven extremely effective in lab tests including on cultured human cells and mouse tissue samples. 
 "this method is very universal," said first author haopeng xiao, a graduate research assistant. "we get over 1,000 glycoproteins in a really small lab sample." 
 in comparison tests with existing methods, the chemical trap, a complex molecular construction reminiscent of an octopus, captured exponentially more glycoproteins, especially more of those trace glycoproteins. 
 wu, xiao and weixuan chen, a former georgia tech postdoctoral researcher, who was also first author of the study alongside xiao, 
 published their results in the journal 
 nature communications . 
 the research was funded by the national science foundation and the national institutes of health. 
 boronic bungles 
 for chemistry whizzes, here's a short summary of 
 how the researchers made the octopus . they took a good thing and doubled then tripled down on it. 
 those who recall high school chemistry class may still know what boric acid is, as do people who use it to kill roaches. its chemical structure is an atom of boron bonded with three hydroxyl groups (h 3 bo 3 ). 
 boronic acids are a family of organic compounds that build on boric acid. there are many members of the 
 boronic acid 
 family, and they tend to bond well with glycoproteins, but their bonds can be less reliable than needed. 
 "most boronic acids let too many low-abundance glycoproteins get away," wu said. "they can catch glycoproteins that are in high abundance but not those in low abundance, the ones that tell us more valuable things about cell development or about human disease." 
 benzoboroxole octopus 
 but the georgia tech chemists were able to leverage the strengths of boronic acids to develop a glycoprotein capturing method that works exceptionally well. 
 first, they tested several boronic acid derivatives and found that one called 
 benzoboroxole 
 strongly bound with each sugar component on the glycopeptide. (" peptide " refers to the basic chemical composition of a protein.) 
 then they stitched many benzoboroxole molecules together with other components to form a " dendrimer," which refers to the resulting branch- or tentacle-like structure . the finished large molecule resembled an octopus ready to go after those sugar components. 
 in its middle, similarly positioned to an octopus's head, was a magnetic bead, which acted as a kind of handle. once the dendrimer caught a glycoprotein, the researchers used a magnet to grab the bead and pull out their chemical octopus along with its ensnared glycopeptides (e.g. glycoproteins). 
 "then we washed the dendrimer off with a low ph solution, and we had the glycoproteins analyzed with things like mass spectrometry," wu said. 
 cancer treatments? 
 the researchers have some ideas about how medical laboratory researchers could make practical use of the new georgia tech method to detect odd biomolecules emitted by cancer, such as 
 antigens . for example, the chemical octopus could improve detection of 
 prostate-specific antigens (psa) 
 in prostate cancer screenings. 
 "psa is a glycoprotein. right now, if the level is very high, we know that the patient may have cancer, and if it's very low, we know cancer is not likely," wu said. "but there is a gray area in between, and this method could lead to much more detailed information in that gray area." 
 the researchers also believe that developers could leverage the chemical invention to produce targeted cancer treatments. immune cells could be trained to recognize the aberrant glycoproteins, track down their source cancer cells in the body and kill them. 
 the research's potential for science goes far beyond its possible future medical applications. 
 the fields of 
 genomics 
 and 
 proteomics 
 have made great strides. following in their footsteps, this new molecular trap could advance the study of the rising field of 
 glycoscience .

-0.8815 STEM cholera bacteria stab and poison enemies so predictably 
 the actions of bacteria locked in battle are nearly as calculable as a chemical reaction. 
 physicist peter yunker applies mathematical equations to enemy colonies of dueling cholera bacteria to accurately predict the speed dynamics of their phase separation into divided territories, a process similar to the separation of oil and water. the equations were originally used to describe phase separate in materials, namely mixed metals (model a equations). credit: georgia tech / rob felt

 the enemies were thrown together, so the killing began. 
 brandishing harpoon-like appendages covered in poison, two armies of cholera bacteria stabbed each other, rupturing victims like water balloons. scientists at the georgia institute of technology tracked the battle over sustenance and turf mathematically to gain insights that could, someday, lead to new, targeted therapies to fight infections. 
 but dueling bacteria would not be the infectors in that scenario; they'd be the remedy. 
 conceivably, specially engineered assassin bacteria friendly to humans could kill harmful bacteria while sparing hordes of microbes that keep people healthy. by contrast, the antibiotics we use today vanquish harmful and helpful bacteria alike. 
 "if you could target harmful bacteria in the human gut, you could use engineered bacteria as a living antibiotic," said brian hammer, an 
 associate professor at georgia tech's school of biological sciences . he cautioned, "we're not anywhere near that right now." 
 calculating bacteria 
 but to harness bacteria for use in medicine or industry, or just to better understand how they thrive and spread, it's helpful to determine the consistency of their actions over time. that's where the math comes in. 
 georgia tech researchers applied to the bacteria existing physics equations developed to precisely describe the interactions of atoms and molecules. they found that those calculations could also precisely predict that two cholera armies would separate from each other into phases, like oil and water, when they met on the battlefield. 
 "the models predicted pretty much exactly when the phase separation would occur, and then we observed it happening just like the math said it would," hammer said. the predictive models were based what's called a "model a" equation. 
 "empirically, it's been used to describe metals that undergo phase separation," hammer said. "the type of curve we observed describing our results had never been used to describe living systems before." 
 hammer and georgia tech biologists 
 will ratcliff, an assistant professor , and 
 samuel brown, an associate professor , teamed up with peter yunker, an 
 assistant professor in georgia tech's school of physics 
 for the research. they published their results in 
 the journal nature communications 
 on monday, february 6, 2017. 
 first authors were hammer's former graduate student 
 biologist eryn bernardy , and brown's former postdoctoral assistant 
 luke mcnally . their research was funded by the national science foundation, the nasa exobiology program, the gordon and betty moore foundation, the wellcome trust and the human frontier science program. 
 rotting crab shells 
 cholera bacteria are commonly found in water attached with other microbes to the shells of crabs and tiny krill, and 
 people who drink that water can die 
 within hours due to the severe vomiting and diarrhea the germs cause. the impetus for doing math on dueling cholera came from how they wage turf war on crab shells, which contain a material called chitin that switches on the harpoon function in 
 vibrio cholerae . no chitin, no stabbing. 
 "i was studying this amazing biological system," hammer said, "and i was looking for a way to visualize it." ratcliff and yunker had been applying microscopy and mathematics to study the dynamics of yeast evolution and suggested hammer give the method a try. 
 but before getting to the math itself, it's important to understand a few things about 
 vibrio cholerae . first of all, most microbiologists think cholera bacteria use the harpoons to kill competing bacteria and not to destroy human cells. 
 the poisonous weapon is called a type vi secretion system (t6ss), and is common. "this harpoon system is in about one quarter of gram-negative bacteria," hammer said. "so, this bacterial dueling is going on all around you." 
 gram-negative bacteria have thinner walls, which can be punctured more easily. gram-positive bacteria have thicker walls less susceptible to the harpoons, and human cells may be even more difficult to penetrate. 
 and the stabbing mechanism is not limited to pathogens like cholera. many harmless bacteria use it, too. but more is known about the mechanism in pathogens, because harmful bacteria are more often the focus of scientific study than harmless bacteria, hammer said. 
 armed and generous 
 harpooning cholera stab randomly at all bacteria they come into contact with, including each other, but 
 vibrio cholerae 
 of the same strain are immune to each other's stabs. so, they kill their enemies but not their own kind. 
 the killing also appears to go hand in hand with cooperative social behavior. the researchers found that bacteria that are good at killing together are also good at sharing with each other and building a community. 
 it starts with creating a common pool of food. "bacteria do a lot of their digestion outside their cells," hammer said. but having all that food lying around is risky. 
 "you need a strategy for ensuring that all the effort of chewing up and digesting food benefits you and your relatives, and not someone else who comes and plunders it." when a strain of bacteria kills invaders, it preserves the fruits of its labor, and multiplies, passing on its genes. 
 brown's postdoctoral researcher luke mcnally examined the genomes of many types of bacteria (in addition to cholera) that use poison harpoons. some strains had six or seven harpoons, and some harpoons had multiple poisons. and there appeared to be a correlation between weapons and cooperation. 
 "we found that the more weaponry a bacteria strain had in its genome, the more it looked like it was apt to share," hammer said. 
 purple, red, blue 
 under the microscope, the battling bacteria strains actually did look a little like beads of oil and water separating out on a flat surface. they were stained two different colors like red and blue, so they could be told apart. 
 "we start with two strains well mixed," hammer said. "we jokingly call this the salad dressing model, because you shake oil and water, and they're well mixed, and you let it sit, and they phase separate." 
 when they're well mixed, the two strains of cholera appear as one purple mass, but as they kill each other and conquer separate territories, they divide into red blotches and blue blotches. 
 there are significant differences between how chemical and living systems operate. for example, the bacteria also reproduce and multiply; molecules don't. but the basic math that worked for materials also worked for the bacteria. 
 future applications? 
 "in your gut, a lot of useful bacteria are gram-positive," hammer said. "but there might be a small number of gram-negative bacteria messing up your gut community, and perhaps engineered bacteria with spears could get rid of just those gram-negative." 
 also, an external material like chitin, which switches the harpoon function on in cholera bacteria, could be given along with assassin bacteria to trigger their weaponry, and then deactivate it when the chitin is gone.

-0.8023 STEM colliding privacy, democracy and technology? 
 the institute for information security and privacy at georgia tech examines emerging cyber threats for 2017. 
 sep 28, 2016 
 - atlanta, ga 
 georgia tech's 2017 
 emerging cyber threats, trends and technologies 
 report highlights concerns about global manipulation of information, health care fraud, data encryption and other issues likely to affect society in the year ahead. the report, produced annually, is an expert-driven review of recent cybersecurity trends, developing research and threat considerations. 
 among the findings: 
 global information manipulation by nation-states is now widespread, causing western nations to curtail free speech and news consumers to view information cautiously. 
 health care fraud is taking off in the absence of good defenses, as the value of personal data far surpasses that of stolen credit cards. 
 cultural differences and unresolved approaches to data encryption continue to mire companies and business leaders with uncertainty and risk in north america and europe. 
 crowdsourced and open-source solutions hold promise for addressing insecure, aging electronic voting systems. 
 public proof of who is behind cyberattacks remains elusive. 
 interest is growing in computer science education, suggesting a changing tide in the nation's shortfall of information technology workers. 
 "cyberattacks today are flourishing because almost every organization conducts some portion of its business online - putting even digitally cautious consumers at risk when it is not sufficiently protected," said wenke lee, co-director of the institute for information security and privacy (iisp) and professor of computer science at georgia tech. "there is widespread reluctance to share threat information, and there's a lack of public attribution about who is responsible, making it nearly impossible for the public to defend themselves." 
 georgia tech's broad understanding of cybersecurity issues can be used to develop strategies to address a range of threats, noted bo rotoloni, co-director of iisp. 
 "under this unique combination, georgia tech can help foretell how the ‘white hats' should prepare because we continually witness how the ‘black hats' adapt," said rotoloni, director of the information and cyber sciences directorate at the georgia tech research institute, the university's applied research arm. 
 georgia tech issues the threat report each fall in conjunction with its annual 
 cyber security summit , which is taking place today in tech square. the summit brings together government, industry and academia for objective conversation about the challenges of securing information and cyber-connected systems.

-0.9938 STEM "combosquatting" attack hides in plain sight to trick computer users 
 attackers are tricking computer users with urls that are similar to those of real companies. 
 chart shows the number of combosquatted domains identified in each domain group studied. 
 oct 30, 2017 
 - atlanta, ga 
 to guard against unknowingly visiting malicious websites, computer users have been taught to double-check website urls before they click on a link. but attackers are now taking advantage of that practice to trick users into visiting website domains that contain familiar trademarks - but with additional words that change the destination to an attack site. 
 for example, attackers might register www.familiarbankname-security[.]com or www.security-familiarbankname[.]com. unwary users see the familiar bank name in the url, but the additional hyphenated word means the destination is very different from what was expected. the result could be counterfeit merchandise, stolen credentials, a malware infection - or another computer conscripted into a botnet attack. 
 the attack strategy, known as combosquatting, is a growing threat, with millions of such domains set up for malicious purposes, according to a new study scheduled to be presented october 31 at the 2017 acm conference on computer and communications security (ccs). 
 "this is a tactic that the adversaries are using more and more because they have seen that it works," said 
 manos antonakakis , an assistant professor in the 
 school of electrical and computer engineering 
 at the georgia institute of technology. "this attack is hiding in plain sight, but many people aren't computer-savvy enough to notice the difference in the urls containing familiar trademarked names." 
 researchers from georgia tech and stony brook university conducted the study, which is believed to be the first large-scale, empirical study of combosquatting. the work was supported by u.s. department of defense agencies, the national science foundation and the u.s. department of commerce. 
 combosquatting differs from its better-known relative, typosquatting, in which adversaries register variations of urls that users are likely to type incorrectly. combosquatting domains don't depend on victims making typing errors, but instead provide malicious links embedded in emails, web advertising or the results of web searches. combosquatting attackers often combine the trademarked name with a term designed to convey a sense of urgency to encourage victims to click on what appears at first glance to be a legitimate link. 
 "we have seen combosquatting used in virtually every kind of cyberattack that we know of, from drive-by downloads to phishing attacks by nation-states," said panagiotis kintis, a georgia tech graduate research assistant who is the first author of the study. "these attacks can even fool security people who may be looking at network traffic for malicious activity. when they see a familiar trademark, they may feel a false sense of comfort with it." 
 for their study, the researchers began with the 500 most popular trademarked domain names in the united states, and excluded certain combinations made up of common words. they separated the domains into 20 categories, then added two additional domains: one for for politics - the study was done before the 2016 election - and another for energy. 
 with the resulting 268 trademark-containing urls, they set out to find domain names that incorporated the trademarked name with additional words added at the start or end. they searched through six years of active and passive domain name system (dns) requests - more than 468 billion records - provided by one of the largest internet service providers in north america. 
 "the result was mind-blowing," said kintis. "we found orders of magnitude more combosquatting domains than typosquatting domains, for instance. the space for combosquatting is almost infinite because attackers can register as many domains as they want with any variation that they want. in some cases, registering a domain can cost less than a dollar." 
 in the six-year data set, the researchers found 2.7 million combosquatting domains for the 268 popular trademarks alone, and the combosquatting domains were 100 times more prevalent than typosquatting domains. the combosquatting attacks appear to be challenging to combat, with nearly 60 percent of the abusive domains in operation for more than 1,000 days - almost three years. and the number of combosquatting domains registered grew every year between 2011 and 2016. 
 among the malicious domains, the researchers discovered some that had previously been registered by legitimate companies which had combined words with their trademarks. for some reason, those companies permitted the registrations to lapse, allowing the trademark-containing domain names - which once led to legitimate sites - to be taken over by combosquatting attackers. 
 in many cases, malicious domains were re-registered multiple times after they had expired, suggesting an improvement in "internet hygiene" may be needed to address this threat. 
 "imagine what happens in a city when the garbage isn't picked up regularly," antonakakis said. "the garbage builds up and you have diseases develop. nobody collects the garbage domains on the internet, because it's nobody's job. but there should be an organization that would collect these malicious domains so they cannot be reused to infect people." 
 more stringent anti-fraud screening of persons registering domains would also help, he added. "we don't want to prevent legitimate users from getting onto the internet, but there are warning signs of potential fraud that registrars could detect." 
 what can be done by ordinary computer users and the organizations where they work? 
 "users unfortunately have to be better educated than they are now," antonakakis said. "organizations can provide training in the on-boarding process that takes place for new employees, and they can protect their network perimeters to prevent users from being exposed to known combosquatting domains. more needs to be done to address this growing cybersecurity problem." 
 in addition to those already mentioned, the research included najmeh miramirkhani and nick nikiforakis from stony brook university; charles lever, yizheng chen and rosa romero-gómez from georgia tech, and nikolaos pitropakis from london south bank university.

-0.8517 STEM common nanoparticle has subtle effects on oxidative stress genes 
 a nanoparticle commonly used in food and other products can have subtle effects on the activity of genes expressing enzymes that address oxidative stress inside two types of cells. 
 may 10, 2016 
 - atlanta, ga 
 a nanoparticle commonly used in food, cosmetics, sunscreen and other products can have subtle effects on the activity of genes expressing enzymes that address oxidative stress inside two types of cells. while the titanium dioxide (tio 2 ) nanoparticles are considered non-toxic because they don't kill cells at low concentrations, these cellular effects could add to concerns about long-term exposure to the nanomaterial. researchers at the georgia institute of technology used high-throughput screening techniques to study the effects of titanium dioxide nanoparticles on the expression of 84 genes related to cellular oxidative stress. their work found that six genes, four of them from a single gene family, were affected by a 24-hour exposure to the nanoparticles. the effect was seen in two different kinds of cells exposed to the nanoparticles: human hela cancer cells commonly used in research, and a line of monkey kidney cells. polystyrene nanoparticles similar in size and surface electrical charge to the titanium dioxide nanoparticles did not produce a similar effect on gene expression. "this is important because every standard measure of cell health shows that cells are not affected by these titanium dioxide nanoparticles," said christine payne, an associate professor in georgia tech's school of chemistry and biochemistry. "our results show that there is a more subtle change in oxidative stress that could be damaging to cells or lead to long-term changes. this suggests that other nanoparticles should be screened for similar low-level effects." the research was reported online may 6 in the 
 journal of physical chemistry c . the work was supported by the national institutes of health (nih) through the hercules center at emory university, and by a vasser woolley fellowship. titanium dioxide nanoparticles help make powdered donuts white, protect skin from the sun's rays and reflect light in painted surfaces. in concentrations commonly used, they are considered non-toxic, though several other studies have raised concern about potential effects on gene expression that may not directly impact the short-term health of cells. to determine whether the nanoparticles could affect genes involved in managing oxidative stress in cells, payne and colleague melissa kemp - an associate professor in the wallace h. coulter department of biomedical engineering at georgia tech and emory university - designed a study to broadly evaluate the nanoparticle's impact on the two cell lines. working with graduate students sabiha runa and dipesh khanal, they separately incubated hela cells and monkey kidney cells with titanium oxide at levels 100 times less than the minimum concentration known to initiate effects on cell health. after incubating the cells for 24 hours with the tio 2 , the cells were lysed and their contents analyzed using both pcr and western blot techniques to study the expression of 84 genes associated with the cells' ability to address oxidative processes. payne and kemp were surprised to find changes in the expression of six genes, including four from the peroxiredoxin family of enzymes that helps cells degrade hydrogen peroxide, a byproduct of cellular oxidation processes. too much hydrogen peroxide can create oxidative stress which can damage dna and other molecules. the effect measured was significant - changes of about 50 percent in enzyme expression compared to cells that had not been incubated with nanoparticles. the tests were conducted in triplicate and produced similar results each time. "one thing that was really surprising was that this whole family of proteins was affected, though some were up-regulated and some were down-regulated," kemp said. "these were all related proteins, so the question is why they would respond differently to the presence of the nanoparticles." the researchers aren't sure how the nanoparticles bind with the cells, but they suspect it may involve the protein corona that surrounds the particles. the corona is made up of serum proteins that normally serve as food for the cells, but adsorb to the nanoparticles in the culture medium. the corona proteins have a protective effect on the cells, but may also serve as a way for the nanoparticles to bind to cell receptors. titanium dioxide is well known for its photo-catalytic effects under ultraviolet light, but the researchers don't think that's in play here because their culturing was done in ambient light - or in the dark. the individual nanoparticles had diameters of about 21 nanometers, but in cell culture formed much larger aggregates. in future work, payne and kemp hope to learn more about the interaction, including where the enzyme-producing proteins are located in the cells. for that, they may use hyper-tau, a reporter protein they developed to track the location of hydrogen peroxide within cells. the research suggests a re-evaluation may be necessary for other nanoparticles that could create subtle effects even though they've been deemed safe. "earlier work had suggested that nanoparticles can lead to oxidative stress, but nobody had really looked at this level and at so many different proteins at the same time," payne said. "our research looked at such low concentrations that it does raise questions about what else might be affected. we looked specifically at oxidative stress, but there may be other genes that are affected, too." those subtle differences may matter when they're added to other factors. "oxidative stress is implicated in all kinds of inflammatory and immune responses," kemp noted. "while the titanium dioxide alone may just be modulating the expression levels of this family of proteins, if that is happening at the same time you have other types of oxidative stress for different reasons, then you may have a cumulative effect." seed funding for the research came from the hercules: exposome research center (niehs: p30 es019776) at the rollins school of public health, emory university, nih grant dp2od006483-01 and a vasser woolley faculty fellowship. the content is solely the responsibility of the authors and does not necessarily represent the official views of the national institutes of health. citation : sabiha runa, dipesh khanal, melissa l. kemp, christine k. payne, "tio2 nanoparticles alter the expression of peroxiredoxin anti-oxidant genes," (journal of physical chemistry c, 2016).

-0.9736 STEM computer simulations shed light on the milky way's missing red giants 
 simulations provide test of why the center of the milky way has no visible older stars. 
 a sequence of snap shots based on a simulation of a red giant entering and exiting a clump in a fragmenting accretion disk. in this case, it takes 4 days for the star to travel through the clump (each .1 unit of time is approximately 1 hour). 
 jun 07, 2016 
 - atlanta, ga 
 new computer simulations from the georgia institute of technology provide a conclusive test for a hypothesis of why the center of the milky way appears to be filled with young stars but has very few old ones. according to the theory, the remnants of older, red giant stars are still there - they just aren't bright enough to be detected with telescopes. the 
 georgia tech simulations 
 investigate the possibility that these red giants were dimmed after they were stripped of 10s of percent of their mass millions of years ago during repeated collisions with an accretion disk at the galactic center. the very existence of the young stars, seen in astronomical observations today, is an indication that such a gaseous accretion disk was present in the galactic center because the young stars are thought to have formed from it as recently as a few million years ago. the study is published in the june edition of 
 the astrophysical journal . it is the first to run computer simulations on the theory, which was introduced in 2014. astrophysicists in georgia tech's college of sciences created models of red giants similar to those that are supposedly missing from the galactic center - stars that are more than a billion years old and 10s of times larger in size than the sun. they put them through a computerized version of a wind tunnel to simulate collisions with the gaseous disk that once occupied much of the space within .5 parsecs of the galactic center. they varied orbital velocities and the disk's density to find the conditions required to cause significant damage to the red giant stars. "red giants could have lost a significant portion of their mass only if the disk was very massive and dense," said tamara bogdanovic, the georgia tech assistant professor who co-led the study. "so dense, that gravity would have already fragmented the disk on its own, helping to form massive clumps that became the building blocks of a new generation of stars." the simulations suggest that each of the red giant stars orbited its way into and through the disk as many as dozens of times, sometimes taking as long as days to weeks to complete a single pass-through. mass was stripped away with each collision as the star blistered the fragmenting disk's surface. according to former georgia tech undergraduate student thomas forrest kieffer, the first author on the paper, it's a process that would have taken place 4 to 8 million years ago, which is the same age as the young stars seen in the center of the milky way today. "the only way for this scenario to take place within that relatively short time frame," kieffer said, "was if, back then, the disk that fragmented had a much larger mass than all the young stars that eventually formed from it - at least 100 to 1,000 times more mass." the impacts also likely lowered the kinetic energy of the red giant stars by at least 20 to 30 percent, shrinking their orbits and pulling them closer to the milky way's black hole. at the same time, the collisions may have torqued the surface and spun up the red giants, which are otherwise known to rotate relatively slowly in isolation. "we don't know very much about the conditions that led to the most recent episode of star formation in the galactic center or whether this region of the galaxy could have contained so much gas," bogdanovic said. "if it did, we expect that it would presently house under-luminous red giants with smaller orbits, spinning more rapidly than expected. if such population of red giants is observed, among a small number that are still above the detection threshold, it would provide direct support for the star-disk collision hypothesis and allow us to learn more about the origins of the milky way." the paper, " can star-disk collisions explain the missing red giants problem in the galactic center ," was published on june 1. this research was funded, in part, by the alfred p. sloan foundation (grant # br2013-016) and the national science foundation (ast-1333360).

-0.9956 STEM coskun gets $50,000 pilot grant from spore to study cell signaling in lung cancer 
 petit institute researcher collaborating with emory clinicians to enable personalized precision medicine 
 cell signaling in action.   - photo provided by ahmet coskun

 ahmet coskun is trying to solve a molecular mystery: he wants to know why some patients don't respond to a lung cancer drug that has shown otherwise promising results. he hopes understanding why will help his team develop tools that will enable personalized precision therapies in the future. 
 "most patients are responding to this drug very well, but it fails in some patients, and why it fails is a mystery," said coskun, an assistant professor in the wallace h. coulter department of biomedical engineering at georgia tech and emory university and a researcher in the petit institute for bioengineering and bioscience at georgia tech. 
 coskun aims to take a detailed look at cellular communication and decision-making, to closely visualize cell signaling and develop a new metric to define how cells respond to drugs for lung cancer therapy. to help him get started, the emory lung cancer spore group is awarding him $50,000 over the next year. 
 "our research will result in a molecular screening platform for imaging signaling proteins of human cell cultures and tissues," said coskun, who plans to decipher the role of cellular signals and explain how different cells coordinate signaling to achieve healthy or abnormal results, specifically in patients with non-small cell lung cancer. 
 this year, about 200,000 adults in the united states will be diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer, the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the world. about 15 percent of those people have an epidermal growth factor receptor mutation in their cancer. 
 epidermal growth factor receptor, or egfr, is a protein involved in cell signaling. when it works correctly, it helps control cell division. but when it becomes mutated, as it does in some lung cancer cells, it causes rapid cell growth, helping the cancer spread. 
 for lung cancer patients with the egfr mutation, there is a measure of hope thanks to a drug developed by emory university several years ago. in a 2017 clinical study led by emory researcher suresh ramalingam, patients experienced substantial improvement when treated with an egfr inhibitor called osimertinib, compared to those who received the standard of care. 
 the drug is designed to inhibit egfr's haywire signaling activity in cancer. as coskun noted, though, it doesn't work well for every patient. it's because no two patient tumors are exactly alike - each tumor microenvironment is unique. there are multiple biomarkers and multiple potential targets for cancer drugs to attack. so, inhibiting one protein like egfr won't always make a difference, coskun said. 
 "the standard clinical techniques are limited to focusing on a single marker," said coskun, who is using multiplex cellular imaging, a technology that allows detection of multiple markers. "recent advances in these systems allow visualization of a larger number of markers - up to 30 unique targets. we intend to develop automated, multiplexed platforms to detect numerous markers and to feed the information into an algorithm to diagnose patients and predict their response to therapies." 
 clearly identifying other markers could pave the way for combination therapies with other inhibitor drugs to block other cancer signaling pathways - together, they're a more comprehensive approach to attacking the disease. the ability to look at 30 different proteins or markers - potential drug targets - at one time, in a single cell, wasn't possible before because the technology didn't exist. 
 "the emerging technology that we have developed here at georgia tech and emory allow rapid and high-content signaling network studies in cells and tissues," coskun said. 
 essentially, researchers combine technologies to create a complete molecular profile of a patient's cancer at the single cell level. coskun's team uses microfluidic instruments to acquire microscopic images and then super computers are used to process and visualize complex cellular maps. 
 "these maps will enable personalized precision therapies," coskun said. "that is our goal." 
 coskun and his team will work under the mentorship of ramalingam, executive director of the winship cancer institute at emory and co-lead of the lung cancer spore, a specialized program of research excellence created in 2019 with a $9.7 million national cancer institute grant. it's one of four spore grants in the u.s. focused on lung cancer.

-0.9938 STEM crab shell signaling helps control the many faces of cholera, study shows 
 a new study shows the diversity and resourcefulness of vibrio cholerae, the organism behind the disease cholera.

 apr 06, 2016 
 - atlanta, ga 
 in humans, cholera is among the world's most deadly diseases, killing as many as 140,000 persons a year, according to world health organization statistics. but in aquatic environments far away from humans, the same bacterium attacks neighboring microbes with a toxic spear - and often steals dna from other microorganisms to expand its own capabilities. a new study of more than 50 samples of 
 vibrio cholerae 
 isolated from both patients and the environment demonstrates the diversity and resourcefulness of the organism. in the environment, the cholera bacterium is commonly found attached to chitin, a complex sugar used by aquatic creatures such as crabs and zooplankton to form protective shells. in the wild, most strains of cholera can degrade the shells for use as food, and the new study showed how the presence of chitin can signal the bacteria - which have receptors for the material - to produce behaviors very different from those seen in human disease. among the cholera strains studied, less than a quarter were able to take up dna from other sources. almost all of the samples taken from the environment were able to kill other bacteria - a phenomenon called "bacterial dueling" - but just 14 percent of the bacterial pathogen strains isolated from humans had that capability. "it's a dog-eat-dog world out there even for bacteria," said brian hammer, an associate professor in the school of biology at the georgia institute of technology. "bacteria such as 
 vibrio cholerae 
 sense and respond to their surroundings, and they use that information to turn on and off the genes that benefit them in the specific environments in which they find themselves." the research, supported by the national science foundation and the gordon and betty moore foundation, provides information that could lead to development of better therapeutic agents against the disease, which is found in densely-populated areas with limited sanitation and clean water. the research was done with assistance from the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc), and was reported online march 4 in the journal 
 applied and environmental microbiology . in humans, the cholera bacteria produce a diarrheal disease that can kill untreated patients in just a few hours. the deadly effects of the disease, however, are actually caused by a virus that infects the 
 vibrio cholerae 
 strains found in humans. the toxin carried by the virus helps spread the disease among humans, but cholera strains quickly lose the virus and adapt other competitive mechanisms in the environment. to study how cholera regulates these adaptations, georgia tech graduate student eryn bernardy obtained nearly 100 samples of cholera bacteria from a variety of sources globally, including one originally isolated from a 1910 saudi arabian outbreak of the disease. she then studied 53 of the samples for their ability to (1) degrade chitin, (2) take up dna from the environment, and (3) kill other bacteria by poking them with a poisoned spear. colonies of each strain were grown in petri plates containing chitin material. the strains able to digest the material produced a clear ring showing that they had broken down the chitin in the agar growth medium. only three of the cholera colonies failed to degrade the chitin. to study their ability to take up dna, bacterial cells were grown on crab shells, then exposed to raw dna containing a gene for antibiotic resistance. the cells were scraped off the shells and placed onto agar plates containing an antibiotic that would normally kill the bacteria. colonies that survived showed they had taken up the genetic material. to study their ability to compete with other bacteria, each cholera strain was placed into contact with a billion or so 
 e. coli 
 cells on petri plates. after a few hours in contact, the researchers counted the number of 
 e. coli 
 remaining. some cholera strains were able to kill nearly all of the 
 e. coli 
 cells, reducing their numbers to a few hundred thousand. "we found a very sharp difference between the clinical isolates and the environmental isolates," hammer said. "for example, most of the isolates that came out of patients either couldn't kill other bacteria, or were carefully controlling that behavior. patient isolates have a very different way of competing inside the human body. they use the virus-encoded toxin to cause the diarrheal disease and remove their competitors from the intestine." with help from cdc scientists, the researchers correlated the behavior of each strain with their unique dna sequences. they also examined the strains for the presence of the toxin used to cause disease. to deduce the rules governing the bacterium's behavior, hammer and his lab have been studying cholera for the last 15 years, starting with a single strain first isolated in peru in the early 1990s. when a cholera outbreak began in haiti after the 2010 earthquake, his lab worked with the cdc to isolate these new strains. in further study, hammer was surprised to find that the 2010 haitian strains were less capable than the 1991 peruvian variety. "we were very surprised to find that most of the haiti strains did not behave like the one we had been studying for years," he said. "this was a reminder to us that we needed to embrace the diversity of the organisms we've been studying. we thought this would be an opportune time to start looking at how diverse vibrio cholerae really is." hammer compared the diversity of the cholera strains to the diversity of humans, who increasingly receive personalized health care. "in humans, one size doesn't fit all for patient care," he said. "for cholera, the behavior is personalized for each strain. understanding this will be useful in the development of future therapeutics, and we're hopeful that knowing how these bacteria interact with other organisms in complex communities will lead us to things that can truly benefit humans." in addition to those already mentioned, the study included maryann a. turnsek and cheryl l. tarr from the cdc. georgia tech undergraduate sarah k. wilson from the hammer lab, another author on the paper, is now a ph.d. student at the university of wisconsin-madison. this material is based upon work supported by the gordon and betty moore foundation and national science foundation grant no. 1149925. any opinions, findings, and conclusions or recommendations expressed in this material are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of the national science foundation or the moore foundation. citation : eryn e. bernardy, et al., "diversity of clinical and environmental isolates of vibrio cholerae in natural transformation and contact-dependent bacterial killing indicative of type vi secretion system activity," (applied and environmental microbiology, 2016).

-0.8543 STEM create dedicated pandemic clinics now to address covid-19 
 covid-19 needs pandemic clinics focused on treating it and keeping it away from non-covid patients. 
 helping teleworkers stay safe. 
 mar 25, 2020 
 - atlanta, ga 
 covid-19 has caught pinar keskinocak well prepared. for years, she has studied how societies manage pandemics, and how outbreaks overtax the health care system and wrack supply chains to worsen pandemics. here she shares her insights. 
 empty classrooms and supermarket shelves marked the beginning of the covid-19 pandemic. but keskinocak expects more signs of the times to come - such as pop-up pandemic clinics and the shortage and rationing of medical supplies beyond masks and ventilators. 
 keskinocak is the 
 director of the center for health and humanitarian systems at the georgia institute of technology , which studies how government and private sectors can cooperate to handle health and humanitarian crises. and she is william w. george chair and professor in georgia tech's h. milton stewart school of industrial and systems engineering. 
 in previous research, keskinocak's team created a model that accurately ran the course of the 1918 spanish flu pandemic, and when covid-19 struck, her team was already in the middle of modeling how special clinics could significantly slow a pandemic. in the meantime, temporary clinics in wuhan, china, appear to have validated her model. 
 healthcare expansion now 
 the surge of covid-19 patients pushed italy's health care system into a very ugly crisis, and the u.s. needs to take measures now to handle similar patient surges. pandemics often strike in two waves or more, and the second is usually the worst, so measures need to be lasting, keskinocak said. 
 even without covid-19, the u.s. healthcare system has been under strain. emergency rooms are often overcrowded; it takes a long time to schedule an appointment, and there is a chronic shortage of nursing staff. 
 [ read keskinocak's guest op-ed in the new york daily news: covid clinics now ] 
 "we need to expand capacity and unleash creative flexibility in our healthcare systems. we should use more telemedicine and create self-service stations for testing. i would particularly like to see specialized covid-19 clinics established now," keskinocak said. 
 "special clinics could be separate spaces in existing facilities or standalone facilities. as covid-19 spreads, we expect a lot more people with cold- and flu-like symptoms to seek testing and care. the healthcare capacities are just not there for a business as usual approach, and taking it could harm patients by delaying care and increasing risk of infection." 
 gathering covid-19 patients in tight spaces like waiting rooms with other patients would increase the coronavirus' spread, and patients with preexisting conditions could face mortal threat. contagion could also spread into hospitals. 
 "dedicated pandemic clinics could implement targeted hygiene, air filtration, and specialized protective equipment beyond masks and gloves for healthcare workers. they can tailor workflows to test and care for patients quickly and effectively and keep them away from other patients and staff," keskinocak said. 
 payment needs to be easy, too, including financing the uninsured. in the middle of a public health emergency, it is vital to not get bogged down by restrictions meant for normal times. 
 potentially dangerous shortages 
 toilet paper will make a comeback in supermarkets, but in its place, life-saving medications could become perilously scarce. countries need to act now to prevent this from compounding the covid-19 crisis. 
 "dwindling availability of hospital beds, ventilators, and personal protective equipment like masks and gloves during a patient surge - those are the obvious things. but we could also see shortages of items like asthma medication or antidepressants. worst case, even food supplies could run low," keskinocak said. 
 [ read keskinocak's guest op-ed in the hill: medical supply chain dangers ] 
 here's how shortages work and can lead to price gouging and also rationing. the latter can have good effects. 
 "shortages are the result of supply-demand imbalance caused by either an unexpected increase in demand or unexpected decrease in supply or both. shortages are common in crises such as natural disasters or health emergencies. but given the worldwide slowdown of economic activity in pandemics, disruptions could get much worse this time," keskinocak said. 
 "supply chains are actually intricate webs of multiple parts that span the globe. pandemics damage many of those parts, and it can take time to recover. this creates a more serious and worrisome imbalance between supply and demand." 
 toilet paper will return because people fear-hoard it in a panic but consume it at normal rates. when the panic runs its course, demand slows back down to the actual rate of consumption and its normal supply chain, which is relatively simple, catches up. 
 "with medicine and healthcare services and supplies, the increase in demand is typically already in line with consumption, so a shortage in supply or increase in demand can create a supply-demand gap that continues for a long time," keskinocak said. "medical supply chains are also very complex and fragile." 
 future vaccine distribution 
 in normal times, most supply chains work at a plodding pace, and when crisis strikes, it is tough to ramp them up due to expensive equipment, complex logistics, and strict regulations, particularly in health care. even temporary shortages of medicines and medical devices can have consequences for patients who need them. 
 "if shortages become serious, rationing - with a priority allocation to those most in need - can help balance demand and supply for critical items like medications." 
 once created and approved, the production of vaccines or antivirals for covid-19 will ramp up slowly and could be in short supply at first. decision-makers need plan investments now in the supply chains necessary for their effective distribution. 
 this will include painful, necessary decisions like prioritizing first doses for healthcare workers, people with pre-existing conditions, and the elderly. the current system of restocking vaccines in the u.s. after initial distribution 
 also has serious gaps that need fixing 
 to save many more lives. 
 in the meantime, social distancing is one of the best ways to protect everyone and reduce the patient surge into clinics. do it if you or anyone in your household has any cold-like symptoms.

-0.9822 STEM critical infrastructure systems are vulnerable to a new kind of cyberattack 
 engineers and computer scientists show how bad actors can exploit browser-based control systems in industrial facilities with easy-to-deploy, difficult-to-detect malware. 
 instead of a dedicated terminal or control pad running custom software specific to the device, manufacturers for industrial and infrastructure systems have turned to web-based management. now, devices often have embedded web servers. the human-machine interfaces - think keypads or control panels like this - are actually mini web browsers rendering a web page with readouts of the current status and digital visualizations of the controls. this web-based architecture is opening the door to a new kind of malware attack that could give bad actors full control of critical infrastructure or other industrial systems. 
 feb 29, 2024 
 in recent years, browser and web-based technology has become a powerful tool for operators of infrastructure and industrial systems. but it also has opened a new pathway for bad actors to seize control of these systems, potentially endangering critical power, water, and other infrastructure. georgia tech researchers have found a way to hijack the computers that control these physical systems. called programmable logic controllers (plcs), they increasingly have embedded webservers and are accessed on site via web browsers. attackers can exploit this approach and gain full access to the system. that means they could spin motors out of control, shut off power relays or water pumps, disrupt internet or telephone communication, or steal critical information. they could even launch weapons - or stop the launch of weapons. "we think there is an entirely new class of plc malware that's just waiting to happen. we're calling it web-based plc malware. and it gives you full device and physical process control," said ryan pickren, a ph.d. student in the 
 school of electrical and computer engineering 
 (ece) and the lead author of a new study describing the malware and its implications. the research team will 
 present their findings feb. 29

 in 2015, nearly 200 countries agreed: they would reduce their emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases to limit warming of the earth's atmosphere to well below 2 degrees celsius. 
 the paris agreement 
 actually aims for 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels to avoid 
 potential catastrophic changes to our climate . but it's become increasingly clear to climate scientists and policymakers that just reducing emissions is not enough. 
 "we now know that we probably should have stopped putting massive amounts of co 2 
 in the air 10, 20, 30 years ago to prevent the climate from getting above 2 degrees c," said 
 chris jones , a chemical engineer at georgia tech. "now we've waited so long to reduce our emissions that we need to develop technologies that are referred to as negative emissions technologies that remove co 2 
 from the atmosphere." 
 jones was one of a handful of scientists who co-authored a 
 landmark national academies report in 2018 that outlined a variety of approaches to negative emissions. 
 agricultural practices and forest management are options - essentially using nature's ability to grab carbon dioxide out of the air and lock it away in plants and soil. but jones said we'll need quicker and more direct approaches. 
 "we could plant billions of trees to do this, but there's not enough available land. and the trees don't grow fast enough for us to do this quickly enough to slow global warming at the rate required," said jones, john f. brock iii school chair in the 
 school of chemical and biomolecular engineering (chbe) . "that's where direct air capture comes in: it's a chemical engineering way of designing a process that takes co 2 
 out of the air."

-0.9951 STEM data detectives shift suspicions in alzheimer's from usual suspect to inside villain 
 it may be high time to refocus alzheimer's research, as a new study strongly points to a biochemical culprit traditionally less pursued. 
 the brain of an alzheimer's sufferer can dramatically lose mass and shrink. in particular, center structures of the brain usually diminish early on. one such region susceptible to early and severe damage is the hippocampus, which can lead to memory loss and disorientation. illustration credit: national institute on aging, national institutes of health 
 feb 19, 2018 
 - atlanta, ga 
 the mass pursuit of a conspicuous suspect in alzheimer's disease may have held back research success for decades. now, a 
 new data analysis 
 that has untangled evidence amassed in years of alzheimer's studies encourages researchers to refocus their investigations. 
 heaps of plaque formed from amyloid-beta that accumulate in afflicted brains are what stick out under the microscope in tissue samples from 
 alzheimer's 
 sufferers, and that eye-catching junk has long seemed an obvious culprit in the disease. but data analysis of the cumulative evidence doesn't support giving so much attention to that usual suspect, according to a 
 new study from the georgia institute of technology . 
 though the bad amyloid-beta protein does appear to be an accomplice in the disease, the study has pointed to a seemingly more likely red-handed offender, another protein-gone-bad called phosphorylated 
 tau 
 (p-tau). what's more, the georgia tech data analysis of multiple studies done on mice also turned up signs that multiple biochemical actors work together in alzheimer's to tear down neurons, the cells that the brain uses to do its work. 
 suspect line-up: p-tau implicated, plaque not so much 
 and the corrupted amyloid-beta that appeared more directly in cahoots with p-tau in the sabotage of brain function was not tied up in that plaque. in the line-up of the biochemical suspects examined, principal investigator 
 cassie mitchell, an assistant professor in the wallace h. coulter department of biomedical engineering 
 at georgia tech and emory university, said the data pointed to a pecking order of culpability. 
 "the most important one would be the level of phosphorylated tau present. it had the strongest connection with cognitive decline," mitchell said. "the correlation with 
 amyloid 
 plaque 
 was there but very weak; not nearly as strong as the correlation between p-tau and cognitive decline." 
 mitchell, a biomedical informaticist, and first author colin huber statistically analyzed data gleaned from 51 existing lab studies in mice genetically augmented with a human form of alzheimer's. they published their analysis 
 in the current edition of the 
 journal of alzheimer's disease . the research was funded by the national institutes of health. 
 the crime: eviscerating the brain 
 one look at an image of an alzheimer's afflicted brain is unflinching testimony to the disease's cruelty: it 
 destroys of up to 30 percent of a brain's mass , carving out ravines and depositing piles of molecular junk, most visibly amyloid plaque. 
 the plaque builds up outside of neurons, while inside neurons, p-tau forms similar junk known as 
 neurofibrillary tangles 
 that many researchers believe push the cells to their demise. but many biochemical machinations behind alzheimer's are still unknown, and the fight to uncover them has vexed researchers for decades. 
 since the 
 first patient was diagnosed by dr. aloysius alzheimer between 1901 and 1906 , little medical progress has been made. though some available medications may mitigate symptoms somewhat, none significantly slow disease progression, let alone stop it. 
 alzheimer's mostly strikes late in life. longer lifespans in industrialized countries have ballooned the caseload, advancing the disease to a major cause of death. 
 meet the syndicate: assassin, accomplices, stooges 
 even though p-tau showed the strongest correlation with cognitive decline, and amyloid-beta only a slight correlation, that doesn't mean that p-tau is committing the crime inside cells all by itself while amyloid loiters in spaces outside of cells in large gangs, creating a distraction. mitchell's data analysis has pointed to dynamics more enmeshed than that. 
 "though the study had clear trends, it also had a good bit of variance that would indicate multiple factors influencing outcomes," mitchell said. and a particular manifestation of amyloid-beta has piqued the researchers' ire. 
 little pieces are water soluble, that is, not tied up in clumps of plaque. the data has shown that these tiny amyloids may be up to no good. after p-tau levels, the study revealed that those of soluble amyloid-beta had the second-strongest correlation with cognitive decline. 
 "lumpy amyloid-beta, the stuff we see, ironically doesn't correlate as well with cognitive decline as the soluble amyloid," mitchell said. "the amyloid you don't see is like the sugar in your tea that dissolves and hits your taste buds versus the insoluble amyloid, which is more like the sugar that doesn't dissolve and stays at the bottom of the cup." 
 some alzheimer's researchers have cited evidence indicating that free-floating amyloid helps produce the corrupted p-tau via a chain of reactions that centers around 
 gsk3 
 (glycogen synthase kinase 3), an enzyme that arms tau with phosphorous, turning it into a potential biochemical assassin. 
 incidentally, mitchell's study also looked at un-phosphorylated tau and found its levels do not correlate with cognitive decline. "that makes sense," mitchell said. "regular tau is the backbone of our neurons, so it has to be there." 
 also, p-tau is a normal part of healthy cells, but in alzheimer's it is wildly overproduced. 
 massive dataset: 528 mice rat out p-tau 
 one advantage of 
 data mining 
 51 existing studies versus doing one new lab experiment, is that the cumulative analysis adds the sample sizes of so many studies together for a whopping grand total. mitchell's analysis encompassed results from past experiments carried out on, all totaled, 528 alzheimer's mice. 
 a previous study mitchell led had already indicated that amyloid-beta plaque levels may not be the most productive target for drug development. separate reports by other researchers on failed human trials of drugs that fought plaque would seem to corroborate this. 
 mitchell's prior analysis examined lab studies that used an alzheimer's lab mouse model that did not allow for the study of p-tau. mitchell's current analysis covered studies involving a different mouse model that did allow for the observation of p-tau. 
 mitchell's latest findings have corroborated the prior study's findings on amyloid, and also added p-tau as a key suspect in cognitive decline. 
 principal investigator: my take on possible treatments 
 to arrive at the 51 studies with data suitable for inclusion in their analysis, mitchell's research team sifted through hundreds of alzheimer's research papers, and over time, mitchell has examined a few thousand herself. she has gained some impressions of how biomedical research may need to tackle the disease's slippery biochemical labyrinth. 
 "when we see multifactorial diseases, we tend to think we'll need multifactorial treatments," mitchell said. "that seems to be working well with cancer, where they combine chemotherapy with things like immunotherapy." 
 also, alzheimer's diagnosticians might be wise to their adopt cancer colleagues' early detection stance, she said, as alzheimer's disease appears to start long before amyloid-beta plaque appears and cognitive decline sets in. 
 above all, basic research should cast a broader net. 
 "i think p-tau is going to have to be a big part," she said. "and it may be time to not latch onto amyloid-beta plaque so much like the field has for a few decades."

 shatakshee dhongde, an assistant professor in the ivan allen college school of economics, presented at the second annual poverty summit on september 21 and 22, 2016. 
 the poverty summit is a two-day conference held each year in atlanta that is a collaboration between seven major metro atlanta organizations, including georgia tech. it is intended to spark a deeper awareness of poverty and to create long-lasting solutions for the poor in our communities. 
 dhongde presented her research on multi-dimensional deprivation in the united states during the great recession. according to her analysis, about 15 percent of the population experiences multidimensional deprivation, exceeding the prevalence of official income poverty. some of the dimensions in which americans were most deprived included lack of education, severe housing burdens, and lack of health insurance. 
 additional findings from dhongde's analysis can be found in her recently published article in the social indicators research journal.

-0.9845 STEM diversity may be key to reducing errors in quantum computing 
 in quantum computing, as in team building, a little diversity can help get the job done better, computer scientists have found. 
 in quantum computing, as in team building, a little diversity can help get the job done better, computer scientists have discovered. a new technique, known as ensemble of diverse mappings, depends on using different qubits to create diversity in errors to mitigate the errors. 
 oct 14, 2019 
 - atlanta, ga 
 in quantum computing, as in team building, a little diversity can help get the job done better, computer scientists have discovered. 
 unlike conventional computers, the processing in quantum-based machines is noisy, which produces error rates dramatically higher than those of silicon-based computers. so quantum operations are repeated thousands of times to make the correct answer stands out statistically from all the wrong ones. 
 but running the same operation over and over again on the same qubit set may just generate the same incorrect answers that can appear statistically to be the correct answer. the solution, according to researchers at the georgia institute of technology, is to repeat the operation on different qubit sets that have different error signatures - and therefore won't produce the same correlated errors. 
 "the idea here is to generate a diversity of errors so you are not seeing the same error again and again," said 
 moinuddin qureshi, 
 a professor in georgia tech's 
 school of electrical and computer engineering , who worked out the technique with his senior ph.d. student, swamit tannu. "different qubits tend to have different error signatures. when you combine the results from diverse sets, the right answer appears even though each of them individually did not get the right answer," said tannu. 
 tannu compares the technique, known as ensemble of diverse mappings (edm), to the game show who wants to be a millionaire. contestants who aren't sure of the answer to a multiple choice question can ask the studio audience for help. 
 "it's not necessary that the majority of the people in the audience know the right answer," qureshi said. "if even 20% know it, you can identify it. if the answers go equally in the four buckets from the people who don't know, the right answer will get 40% and you can select it even if only a relatively small number of people get it right." 
 experiments with an existing noisy intermediate scale quantum (nisq) computer showed that edm improves the inference quality by 2.3 times compared to state-of-the-art mapping algorithms. by combining the output probability distributions of the diverse ensemble, edm amplifies the correct answer by suppressing the incorrect ones. 
 the edm technique, tannu admits, is counterintuitive. qubits can be ranked according to their error rate on specific types of problems, and the most logical course of action might be to use the set that's most accurate. but even the best qubits produce errors, and those errors are likely to be the same when the operation is done thousands of times. 
 choosing qubits with different error rates - and therefore different types of error - guards against that by ensuring that the one correct answer will rise above the diversity of errors. 
 "the goal of the research is to create several different versions of the program, each of which can make a mistake, but they will not make identical mistakes," tannu explained. "as long as they make diverse mistakes, when you average things out, the mistakes get canceled out and the right answer emerges." 
 qureshi compares the edm technique to team-building techniques promoted by human resource consultants. 
 "if you form a team of experts with identical backgrounds, all of them may have the same blind spot," he said, adding a human dimension. "if you want to make a team resilient to blind spots, collect a group of people who have different blind spots. as a whole, the team will be guarded against specific blind spots." 
 error rates in conventional silicon-based computers are practically negligible, about one in a thousand-trillion operations, but today's nisq quantum computers produce an error in a mere 100 operations. 
 "these are really early-stage machines in which the devices have a lot of error," qureshi said. "that will likely improve over time, but because we are dependent on matter that has extremely low energy and lacks stability, we will never get the reliability we have come to expect with silicon. quantum states are inherently about a single particle, but with silicon you are packing a lot of molecules together and averaging their activity. 
 "if the hardware is inherently unreliable, we have to write software to make the most of it," he said. "we have to take the hardware characteristics into account to make these unique machines useful." 
 the notion of running a quantum operation thousands of times to get what's likely to be the right answer at first seems counterproductive. but quantum computing is so much faster than conventional computing that nobody would object to doing a few thousand duplicate runs. 
 "the objective with quantum computers is not to take a current program and run it faster," qureshi said. "using quantum, we can solve problems that are virtually impossible to solve with even the fastest supercomputers. with several hundred qubits, which is beyond the current state of the art, we could solve problems that would take a thousand years with the fastest supercomputer." 
 added qureshi: "you don't mind doing the computation a few thousand times to get an answer like that." 
 the quantum error mitigation scheme is scheduled to be presented on oct. 14 at the 52nd annual ieee / acm international symposium on microarchitecture. the work was supported by a gift from microsoft.

-0.9847 liberal arts ecohorror: learning from mutant monsters and killer plants 
 ecohorror has given modern audiences an imaginative way to grapple not only with our primal fear of nature - but also with our complicated feelings about humanity's impact on the environment. 
 oct 26, 2023 
 since godzilla crawled out of the ocean in 1954, a monstrous consequence of the atomic age, ecohorror has given modern audiences an imaginative way to grapple not only with our primal fear of nature - but also with our complicated feelings about humanity's impact on the environment. 
 this subgenre of horror, in which people face the wrath of nature and its emissaries, has never been more popular - driven in large measure by climate change anxiety and showcase titles such as the hit video game and hbo series  the last of us. 
 for many, ecohorror offers a safe outlet for our tangled and difficult feelings about climate change. the heroine of ecohorror comic  dark fang , for example, sets out to solve the fossil fuel problem - or at least avenge beaches blighted by an oil spill - by attacking oil company ceos, said  brianna anderson , a marion l. brittain postdoctoral fellow in the school of literature, media, and communication. 
 "ecohorror is great at expressing the rage and fear that people have about environmental issues, at the inadequacy of contemporary environmental movements," anderson said. "in the 1980s, we thought everything would be okay if we recycled, right? but now we know that's absurd, that it's not even close."

-0.9971 liberal arts economist's research reveals poverty should be measured by more than income 
 new research from georgia tech economist shatakshee dhongde shows there are multiple components of poverty that more accurately describes a household's economic condition.

 since social scientists and economists began measuring poverty, the definition has never strayed far from a discussion of income. 
 new research from georgia tech economist shatakshee dhongde shows there are multiple components of poverty that more accurately describes a household's economic condition. dhongde looks at "deprivation" more than simply low income, and her work finds that almost 15 percent of americans are deprived in multiple dimensions. 
 "this study approaches poverty in a new way," said dhongde, who recently published "multi-dimensional deprivation in the u.s." in the journal "social indicators research." 
 "we tried to identify what is missing in the literature on poverty, and measure deprivation in six dimensions: health, education, standard of living, security, social connections, and housing quality. when you look at deprivation in these dimensions, you have a better picture of what is really going on with households, especially in developed countries like the united states." 
 co-authored with robert haveman of the university of wisconsin-madison, the study looks at deprivation in the u.s. since the onset of the great recession, roughly 2008 to 2013. the source data for the study came from the american community survey conducted by the u.s. census bureau. 
 dhongde's and haveman's analysis showed that while the official income-based poverty rate averaged 13.2 percent from 2008 to 2013, the multi-dimensional deprivation index averaged 14.9 percent. 
 "lack of education, severe housing burden and lack of health insurance were some of the dimensions in which americans were most deprived in," dhongde said. "even though deprivation did increase during the recession, it began to improve between 2010 and 2013." 
 when placed side-by-side, the multi-dimensional deprivation index was a better reflection of the people's economic state than income alone, and the index was able to detect a more nuanced view of what might be driving people's dissatisfaction. 
 interestingly, the study showed that there was not much overlap between individuals who were income poor and those who were multi-dimensionally deprived. only 6.6 percent of the income poor were also deprived in multiple dimensions. 
 "almost 30 percent of individuals with incomes s lightly above the poverty threshold experienced multiple deprivations," dhongde said. "our analysis underscores the need to look beyond income based poverty statistics in order to fully realize the impact of the recession on individual's well-being." 
 in order for a respondent to qualify as having multi-dimensional deprivation, he or she had to have more than one indicator of deprivation, such as lack of education and severe housing burden. 
 while research on deprivation has been growing in recent years in developing countries, this is the first time such an approach has been taken with poverty in the united states. in this country, the study found the greatest deprivation in education, housing and health insurance, and the greatest prevalence of deprivation was in the southern and western u.s. the study specifically cited asian and hispanic populations as experienced the the greatest prevalence of deprivation among ethnic groups. 
 "from our analysis there are several policy recommendations that can be made," dhongde said. "first, significant reduction of deprivation can be attained by implementing new policies related to health insurance coverage, such as through the affordable care act; improving high school completion rates, especially among hispanics; and constraining housing costs. by looking at a broader set of criteria than just income, policy decisions are clearer and solutions can be more easily identified."

-0.0772 STEM fbi: reset your router or face russian malware 
 reset your router to avoid effects of russian malware. 
 georgia tech research scientist charles lever 
 jun 06, 2018 
 - atlanta, ga 
 it's not every day that the federal bureau of investigation gives you an order. 
 on may 25 the 
 fbi asked members of the public 
 to turn off and turn back on their routers because of the spread of malware called "vpnfilter" created and distributed by the russian hacker network sofacy. 
 georgia tech senior research scientist charles "chaz" lever explained the damage this malware can do: 
 "this malware will affect the average user by using one of the capabilities in the malware to passively collect traffic. this can be used to harvest banking credentials or other sensitive password information that is going over the home network. additionally, your home network could be hijacked to be part of an attack on a remote entity, masking the identity of the original user and potentially putting you in the crosshairs of law enforcement." 
 in addition to just a simple reboot, lever recommended following the manufacturer's instructions on resetting the software in the device, also known as "firmware."

-0.601 liberal arts fears, promises, and emerging tech 
 what can the history of telecom infrastructure teach us about ai? 
 apr 09, 2024 
 when gloria calhoun decided to pursue a ph.d. after a career in telecommunications, she initially planned to explore how the system of overhead telephone wires was moved underground. however, when she began studying how the overhead network was built in the first place, she was surprised to find little information on the topic. "you would almost think that all those wires and poles just appeared by magic," calhoun said. as a student in the school of history and sociology, calhoun researches how the emergence of telecommunications infrastructures shaped the wire and cable industries. while digging into the history of overhead wires, she was struck by the way people created narratives about the "fears" and "promises" of emerging telegraph and telephone infrastructures - and how much they resembled the competing narratives around artificial intelligence (ai) today.   fears, promises, and public discourse    "your viewpoints on the fears and promises of technology are often shaped by what you stand to gain or lose, so they vary from person to person and by time and place," calhoun said. "with telecom infrastructure, some people's wildest hopes were realized, while others' worst fears came true. some made lots of money from the networks, and others died building them."   the fears and promises around emerging technologies range from high expectations to deep skepticism. for example, telegraph technology promised to send messages quickly, annihilating time and space in communication, calhoun explained. but others worried about how the wires degraded urban environments and how people could use the telegraph to distort the free flow of market information. with ai, the discourse is similar. we hope the technology will eliminate mundane tasks or solve problems we haven't yet cracked. however, 
 concerns remain : can we prevent bias in ai algorithms? will job replacement disrupt the labor market?   technology doesn't appear in isolation   just like telegraph debates raged through newspapers in the 1800s, the release of openai's chatgpt language learning model in 2022 unleashed a blizzard of opinions in the media, with even some prominent ai researchers 
 changing their minds 
 about the technology. what factors cause this range of opinions? calhoun explains that the technology's use, its physical presence, its symbolic meanings, and its interactions with other technologies can all affect how we perceive it. new technology is unpredictable because people often co-opt it in ways their inventors didn't intend or anticipate. its physical presence also affects how we perceive it - even if it's invisible, "which can sometimes seem like a good thing, as for urban aesthetics, but can also make it feel more sinister," calhoun said. symbolic meanings also vary, with a typical example being railroads, calhoun explained. were they a symbol of progress or a machine in the garden, as the historian leo marx famously phrased it? and finally, just as technology is often used in unintended ways, it also interacts with other tech in surprising ways. for example, low-voltage telecommunications lines aren't hazardous alone but can be lethal if crossed with high-voltage power lines, calhoun said. in a nutshell, "there is no blank slate. technology doesn't appear in isolation or operate in a vacuum. we don't go overnight from inventing new technology to having it fully deployed and understood," calhoun said. "people's perceptions change as their wants, desires, and expectations change."     the regulatory challenge   and then what? fear and promises anticipate, but regulation reacts, calhoun said. and often, there is a lag between the two.  "no matter how obvious it might be that somebody needs to do something, it's often not at all obvious who that somebody is or what they need to do," she said. calhoun explained that the main challenge for regulators is balancing competing stakeholder interests and dealing with a technology that evolves as they try to regulate it. for example, city leaders in montreal tried to move the wires underground for 30 years. the overhead system was dangerous, with wires blocking firefighters from reaching burning buildings and deteriorating poles posing a safety hazard.   "and they hemmed and hawed and dithered, and finally, the fire insurance underwriters said, 'if you don't move these wires underground, we will no longer offer casualty insurance in the city center.' and that finally moved them to start doing something about it," calhoun said. "that's a long way of saying that when the consequences of doing nothing outweigh the consequences of change, even with all the uncertainties the change may bring, that's when it usually starts to happen."   kranzberg's law   mel kranzberg, the founder of the history and sociology of technology and science program at georgia tech, published 
 kranzberg's laws 
 in 1986. the first states, "technology is neither good nor bad, nor is it neutral." "that view was evolving then, and it's the same thing we're still discussing here," calhoun said. as narratives of fears and promises play out with ai, it's impossible to label the tech itself as good or evil "because the social component of it is not the technology but the use. technologies are human productions, and humans are neither all good nor all bad. so you have to focus on how we use it more than the technology itself."   from telegraphs and telephones to social media and artificial intelligence, deploying new technologies involves a learning process of trial and error. most people will use it for good - "or at least try to," calhoun said - and just like telegraph infrastructure, ai will be another lesson to look back on and dissect when the next society-changing creation comes along. but the history of technology has already taught us at least one thing, she said.   "new tech does not simply follow a predetermined path. it increases the range of possible paths but does not dictate which we follow or what will happen next. that's up to us."

-0.9969 STEM flu vaccine supply gaps can intensify flu seasons, make pandemics deadlier 
 a tweak to our flu vaccine resupply logistics could save thousands of lives

 jan 07, 2019 
 - atlanta, ga 
 more than 50 million people died in the  spanish flu  pandemic of 1918-19. its  100th anniversary  this flu season serves as a reminder to close flu vaccine supply gaps that may be costing hundred to thousands of lives now and could cost many more when  the next "big one" strikes , researchers say. 
 u.s. flu vaccine distribution logistics could use an update, according to pinar keskinocak. the researcher at the georgia institute of technology 
 co-led a recent study 
 that compared the current approach with a proposed allocation method calculated to save many more lives in a pandemic or similarly intense influenza outbreak that taxes vaccine supplies. 
 the study's recommendations, which apply to resupplying vaccine stocks during a running outbreak, boil down to this: to put a bigger dent in the spread of flu, replenish vaccine stocks in regions where they are being used up and don't replenish them in areas where vaccines are just sitting on shelves, because few people are getting flu shots there. 
 a simple tweak 
 the tweak in the supply chain could also save thousands of lives annually in regular flu seasons in the u.s., which can be plenty deadly. a flu season can take more lives than murders in the same time period. 
 "even seasonal flu 
 kills tens of thousands of people 
 each year, so we would benefit immediately," said keskinocak, who is  william w. george chair and professor in georgia tech's h. milton stewart school of industrial and systems engineering and director for the center of health and humanitarian systems . 
 "in a pandemic, nearly no one would have natural immunity, so the death toll could be significantly high if we don't improve vaccine coverage." 
 what makes a pandemic a pandemic? the flu virus represents a mutation that human immune systems have not had a chance to build prior resistance to, thus the lack of natural immunity. when the next one strikes, in addition to the many lives saved, the researchers' recommendations could massively prevent  flu infections, secondary infections like bronchitis, hospitalizations, and unnecessarily high medical costs . 
 keskinocak, co-principal investigator 
 julie swann 
 from north carolina state university, and first author zihao li of georgia tech  published their results in the journal  plos one   in october 2018, around the start of the 2018-19 flu season. the research was supported by the harold r. and mary anne nash junior faculty endowment fund. 
 a logic breakdown 
 when a pandemic hits, or a flu season that taxes the vaccine stocks, vaccine supply may become limited but then catch up over time. when that happens, the vaccine distributors commonly take what's called the population-based approach. 
 "areas with larger populations get more vaccine, proportional to the population. it's a straightforward approach that seems fair," swann said. 
 as more vaccine becomes available over time, restocking follows the same principle, and that is where distribution logic breaks down. in some regions, few people get vaccinated, but under population-based allocation, resupply stocks go there anyway and may go to waste. meanwhile, restocking may fall short of demand elsewhere, where people are lining up for inoculations. 
 a mathematical fix 
 as a result, in a pandemic, people eager for a vaccination might not get one despite adequate vaccine production, and the resulting additional unvaccinated people are more likely to get the flu and also spread it to others. that intensifies the outbreak for the entire population. 
 the wasted vaccine stocks also drain medical finances, and the new model would releave some of that strain even in regular flu seasons. 
 "production, storage, and delivery of vaccine are costly, and unused inventory can't just be thrown away. it costs money to dispose of," keskinocak said. 
 restocking doses where they are actually being used would benefit the entire population by boosting the total number of vaccinated individuals, who would then be less likely to get sick and to infect other people. that would tamp down the flu wave for everybody. 
 a data dearth 
 leftover inventory could be slashed to about 20 percent of current levels, saving considerable costs, and the data about which areas were not resupplied could be used to identify areas where more people need encouragement to get vaccinated. 
 "the data would tell you where you need continued education about the importance of vaccination, and some of the money saved from unnecessary resupplying could be invested in public health campaigns," said swann, who collaborated with the centers for disease control and prevention during the 
 2009-10 h1n1 swine flu pandemic. 
 but the needed data is missing at present in the u.s. vaccine distribution system. 
 "surprisingly few states have systems in place that tell them how much vaccine has been administered where and how much is still left in inventory at provider locations," swann said. 
 the next "big one" 
 the next "big one" flu pandemic will sneak up on humanity someday. 
 ultimately, the best way to cut its death toll by more than half and save possibly hundreds of thousands of lives will be for virtually everyone to get vaccinated against influenza annually. currently,  fewer than 50 percent  of americans do. 
 the 1918-19 outbreak, which may have consisted of multiple concurrent influenzas, killed 678,000 people in the u.s. other " big ones :" the 1957 "asian flu" killed 116,000 in the u.s.; the 1968 "hong kong flu" killed 100,000. the 2009 bird flu pandemic, which was a less contagious virus, killed 12,500 people in the u.s. and hospitalized some 275,000.

-0.9683 STEM georgia tech to dismantle pervasive cyberattacks in 10 seconds or less 
 georgia tech researchers have earned a darpa contract to determine ways of defeating low-volume denial of service attacks on websites. 
 georgia tech assistant professor taesoo kim and a team of researchers here recently earned a $2.9 million darpa contract to study ways of detecting and defending against low-volume distributed denial of service (ddos) attacks on websites. 
 may 03, 2016 
 - atlanta, ga 
 georgia tech researchers have been awarded a $2.9 million contract from the u.s. defense advanced research projects agency (darpa) to develop a cybersecurity method that will identify and defend against low-volume distributed denial of service (ddos) attacks. high-volume ddos attacks that overwhelm servers with large amounts of malicious traffic in order to shut down a particular website have received a significant amount of study. however, low-volume attacks have not. low-volume attacks-while generally receiving less attention from scholars and media outlets-account for a significant percentage of all ddos assaults. they can take down a website and be as damaging, but may use less bandwidth, are often shorter in duration, and may be designed to distract a security team from the aftershocks of follow-on attacks. in fact, according to neustar, inc., around 54 percent of ddos attacks were found to be relatively small at less than 5 gbps, yet 43 percent leave behind malware or viruses. neustar's 
 april 2016 
 report found that 82 percent of corporations were attacked repeatedly. "this has been a 25-year problem with no practical solution," says 
 taesoo kim , lead principal investigator for the study and assistant professor in georgia tech's school of computer science. "our goal is to create a precise and timely detection method that identifies attacks by how they subtly change the resource consumption of a machine. with little to no degradation of system performance, we believe we can mitigate the threat and write a new signature for it inside the hardware within approximately 10 seconds so a network interface card will recognize it again. this effectively puts an anti-virus patch into your hardware in real time." under the project name roki, kim and colleagues propose to first establish a baseline of resource consumption using three intel hardware features. next, they will develop continuous analysis algorithms to compare a packet's effect on system performance against historical consumption under similar scenarios. a new path-reconstruction engine will then produce a sequence of instructions to nullify an attack and encode the finding into the network interface card to stop current or future attack traffic. "roki has the potential to achieve both timeliness and precision," says 
 wenke lee , co-pi on the project and co-director of the 
 institute for information security & privacy 
 at georgia tech. "we don't need to know what an attack looks like, just that it deviates from the baseline. existing defenses against low-volume ddos attacks lack precision and they cannot create a response in a timely manner. this will." the research is part of darpa's 
 extreme ddos defense 
 (xd3) program (awarded under contract # hr0011-16-c-0059) and began in april. first deliverables are expected in approximately 18 months, beginning with a prototype to demonstrate the core idea. the project is expected to be complete in three years. field exercises to mitigate previously unknown ddos attacks will occur in 2019. about the researchers taesoo kim ,

-0.99 liberal arts georgia tech historian co-authors book on sports, war, and pandemic 
 georgia tech historian johnny smith writes about the influence of pandemic flu and war on sports in 1918. 
 in 1918, war and a flu pandemic upended the world of sports. while the war forced the world series between the chicago cubs and the boston red sox, pictured, to be moved from october to september, the event itself likely helped spread the disease throughout the city of boston, according to johnny smith, associate professor in the school of history and sociology. he has co-authored a new book on the era called "war fever" 
 mar 24, 2020 
 - atlanta, ga 
 by michael pearson 
 it's the last week of the 1918 baseball season. the boston red sox are on the cusp of winning the world series on the back of baseball legend-in-making babe ruth. world war i is still raging in europe. and a killer virus is stalking the streets of boston. 
 this is the backdrop for 
 war fever: boston, baseball, and america in the shadow of the great war,  the latest work by georgia institute of technology historian johnny smith -a story that resonates today amid the spread of the coronavirus and its impact on our lives. 
 "we are living in a moment where a global pandemic has disrupted everyday life in ways we have not seen since 1918," said 
 smith , the j.c. "bud" shaw professor of sports history in the school of history and sociology. 
 smith's book with his frequent collaborator, purdue university historian randy roberts, is only partially about the flu pandemic. the book is the interwoven tale of three figures - ruth, boston symphony orchestra conductor karl muck, and an army officer from the boston area named charles whittlesey, who led the "lost battalion" that held off german forces in the argonne forest. it examines the impact of anti-german xenophobia and the flu pandemic on boston in the fall of 1918. 
 the book tells how many of the patriotic rituals we expect at sporting events today - the playing of the national anthem and other patriotic tunes, honors for members of the military - stem from world war i. it also speaks to widespread anti-german sentiment, including sudden doubts about muck, one of many people of german descent whose loyalties were questioned during the war. 
 the effects of the flu also are an integral part of the tale smith and roberts weave, from ruth coming down with a case of the flu during the season and nearly dying from a treatments - presaging the coming epidemic - to the possible effects of the virus on attendance during the decisive sixth game of the series. 
 they also offer a new argument that the series helped further spread the flu throughout boston, which ultimately saw some 4,500 deaths. an estimated 675,000 people in the united states and 50 million people worldwide died as a result of the flu that emerged that year. 
 with all of this going on, the red sox victory "failed to generate celebrations in the streets of boston," smith says, as news from overseas and the flu epidemic stole all the headlines. 
 war and illness led to the biggest disruption in sports until now, smith notes, with hundreds of contests, football games, boxing matches, and other events canceled or postponed. 
 similar cancellations swept through the sports industry a few weeks ago, with every major sports league suspending operations, leaving millions of suddenly homebound americans with no sports to entertain them. of course, the world is different now than it was a hundred years ago. streaming video will help fill the gap left by sports in a way that the early 20 th 
 century communications tools could not, smith said. 
 but he predicts that once the virus' grip on society has eased, sports will return to its place as a unifying diversion, a role it has long filled. 
 "it happened in the ‘20s because the culture shifted to looking for an escape from the war and the flu," smith said. "it happened after 9 / 11. it's as if the stadium serves as a cathedral of normalcy. and there will come a time when we will fill the arenas again and celebrate this return to normalcy. and it will be a very moving moment."

-0.7914 STEM georgia tech professor chairs aaas panel on pandemic emergency response 
 a professor at georgia tech has designed software that combines biological data on the pandemic with demographic data of the at-risk population so that health officials can develop a game plan to limit the pandemic's spread.

 when a pandemic spreads, health officials must quickly formulate a strategy to limit infections and deaths. that requires sifting through massive amounts of data in a short amount of time and organizing medical personnel who may have little information on the pandemic. to help coordinate a rapid response to pandemics, a professor at the georgia institute of technology in atlanta has designed software that combines biological data on the pandemic with demographic data of the at-risk population so that health officials can develop a game plan to limit the pandemic's spread. the software also combs social media sites for real-time information on the pandemic and activities of the population. eva lee, director of the center for operations research in medicine and healthcare at the h. milton stewart school of industrial and systems engineering at the georgia institute of technology in atlanta, talked about her emergency response software at the 2014 aaas annual meeting in chicago. 
 "we have developed a real-time system that will gather the demographics of the region that is being affected, and also pick up on-the-ground-data about who is available and doing what, and about movement of the affected population," lee said. "our work is the first to take demographic information and real-time population behavior and interlace it with the biological information to come up with a decision that health officials can actually use." lee chaired the panel titled "emergency response and community resilience via engineering and computational advances."  lee shared her experience helping federal officials respond to the h1n1 flu in 2009, as well as her experience planning an emergency response to a potential anthrax outbreak. lee was also involved in coordinating a response to the 2010 earthquake in haiti, and the decontamination and health screening effort in japan after the 2011 fukushima radiological disaster. 
 other speakers on the panel include ronald eguchi of imagecat inc. in long beach, calif, who talked about inventory data capture tools to assess risk from natural disasters. yasuaki sakamoto, of stevens institute of technology in hoboken, n.j., spoke about improving social media for disaster response. emergency responders to a pandemic must quickly gather information on the biological agent to assess the characteristics of the pandemic and decide which treatment would be most effective. they also collect data on the risk factors of the individuals in the pandemic, such as the severity of patient's sickness, and if children or pregnant women are infected. 
 "the big challenge in a pandemic is how do you use all of this information to determine the best strategy that will give you the minimum number of total infections and mortality rate," lee said. 
 information from lee's systems approach allows health official to determine where to allocate medical resources and personnel in the best way so that operations will be most successful. through the software developed in her lab at georgia tech, officials can determine, for example, how much vaccine to give at-risk populations and how much to give to the general populations to limit the spread of infection and mortality. officials can also map where to set up medical sites to avoid traffic gridlock and worsening the pandemic as infected patients converge on treatment sites. "we can do a real-time optimization to tell you exactly what are the sites that you should set up and who should be going where," lee said. research news georgia institute of technology 177 north avenue atlanta, georgia 30332-0181 usa @gtresearchnews media relations contacts:

-0.9979 STEM georgia tech researchers identify novel gene networks associated with aggressive type of breast cancer 
 the team used a computational math theory to identify gene-gene interactions that may be good targets for treating basal-like cancers that are resistant to traditional hormone therapies. 
 apr 23, 2024 
 breast cancer is the 
 second-most common cancer diagnosis for u.s. women , and the 
 second-leading cause of female cancer deaths . in recent years, breast cancer treatments have improved significantly, thanks to targeted gene therapy and immunotherapy. however, for the small group of patients diagnosed with the most aggressive basal-like type of breast cancer, such approaches are less successful. 
 recently, scientists in the  georgia tech integrated cancer research center (icrc)  have found that this particular breast cancer displays a unique interactive gene network structure. using a type of mathematics called "graph theory," which models relationships between a pair of objects, the researchers computationally detected changes in gene-gene interactions as 
 this breast 
 cancer occurs and develops. 
 "the discovery of novel gene networks associated with basal-like breast cancers has helped us identify potential new gene targets to treat this very aggressive type of breast cancer," said 
 john mcdonald , icrc founding director, professor emeritus in the 
 school of biological sciences , and the study's corresponding author. "we would not have discovered these possible treatments through analyses of gene expression alone." 
 while causing just 10-20% of breast cancer diagnoses, basal-like breast cancer is much more aggressive than other subtypes - and if not identified early, when it can be treated by surgery and / or radiation therapy, effective anti-cancer drug treatment can be challenging. the basal-like subtype does not respond to traditional hormonal therapies. 
 one theory 
 as 
 to why, advocated by many cancer researchers, is that individual genes do not function autonomously; as such, changes in how genes interact with one another in cancer may be as important as the cancer-driving genes themselves. 
 "the components of any complex system, like the human genome, are certainly important," said mcdonald. "the way in which these independent components interact with one another is also critical." 
 for this study, the researchers analyzed three major subtypes of breast cancer, with particular emphasis on the most aggressive basal-like subtype. 
 the researchers found that gene-gene interactive networks are quite different in the aggressive basal-like subtype, compared to the more prevalent luminal a and luminal b subtypes. 
 many of the genes comprising these unique networks were found to be involved in functions not previously associated with breast cancer. 
 stephen housley , a neurobiology researcher in the school of biological sciences and a co-author on the paper, noted that "an unexpected and intriguing result from our study is that neural processes appear to play a prominent role in distinguishing the highly aggressive basal-like tumors from the less aggressive luminal a and luminal b subtypes." 
 in total, the researchers examined more than 300 million pairs of genes, comparing healthy women to those with breast cancer. study co-author 
 zainab ashard , a computational biologist who recently worked in mcdonald's lab, 
 explained, "differences in the gene network structure between healthy individuals and breast cancer patients allowed us to identify changes in patterns of gene-gene interactions within breast cancer development." [s1] 
 the team's results are detailed in a new paper, " changes in gene network interactions in breast cancer onset and development ," which appeared

-0.6428 STEM how insects evolved to ultrafast flight (and back) 
 many insects fly synchronously, matching the nervous system pulses to wing movement. but smaller insects don't have the mechanics for this and must flap their wings harder, which works only up to a certain point. that's where asynchronous flight comes in. 
 researchers found that hawkmoth flight muscles exhibit delayed stretch activation, a hallmark of asynchronous flight. 
 oct 06, 2023 
 mosquitoes are some of the fastest-flying insects. flapping their wings more than 800 times a second, they achieve their speed because the muscles in their wings can flap faster than their nervous system can tell them to beat. 
 this asynchronous beating comes from how the flight muscles interact with the physics of the insect's springy exoskeleton. this decoupling of neural commands and muscle contractions is common in only four distinct insect groups. 
 for years, scientists assumed these four groups evolved these ultrafast wingbeats separately, but research from the georgia institute of technology and the university of california, san diego (uc san diego) shows that they evolved from a single common ancestor. this discovery demonstrates evolution has repeatedly turned on and off this particular mode of flight. the researchers developed physics models and robotics to test how these transitions could occur.

-0.5995 STEM hydrogel offers double punch against orthopedic bone infections 
 researchers have a developed a hydrogel that both attacks bacteria and encourages bone regrowth.

 - atlanta, ga 
 surgery prompted by automobile accidents, combat wounds, cancer treatment and other conditions can lead to bone infections that are difficult to treat and can delay healing until they are resolved. now, researchers have a developed a double-duty hydrogel that both attacks the bacteria and encourages bone regrowth with a single application containing two active components. 
 the injectable hydrogel, which is a network of cross-linked polymer chains, contains the enzyme lysostaphin and the bone-regenerating protein bmp-2. in a new study using a small animal model, researchers at the georgia institute of technology showed significant reduction in an infection caused by 
 staphylococcus aureus 
 - a common infection in orthopedic surgery - along with regeneration within large bone defects. 
 "treatment for bone infections now often requires two surgeries to both eliminate the infection and heal the injured bone," said 
 andrés j. garcía , executive director of the 
 parker h. petit institute for bioengineering & bioscience 
 at the georgia institute of technology. "our idea was to develop a bifunctional material that does both things in a single step. that would be better for the patient, cost less and reduce hospitalization time. we have shown that we can engineer the hydrogel to control the delivery and release of both the antimicrobial enzyme and the regenerative protein." 
 the hydrogel-based therapy could be used to treat established bone infections, and as a prophylactic during surgery to prevent infection. the study, funded by the national institutes of health, was reported may 17 in the journal 
 science advances . 
 bone infections today are often treated with systemic antibiotics and surgery to clean the injury. if the infection occurs with implants, they often must be removed. once the infection is gone, additional surgery may be required to implant proteins that stimulate bone regrowth and restore the implant. and the dead bacteria can prompt a harmful inflammatory reaction. 
 garcía and his collaborators - including first author christopher johnson - chose lysostaphin, an enzyme that kills the bacteria by cleaving cell walls without generating inflammation. the enzyme keeps working within the hydrogel after it polymerizes. 
 "with this strategy, we can get rid of the bacteria in such a way that the body re-establishes a normal inflammatory environment that allows the bone to heal," garcía said. "use of lysostaphin has been limited by poor stability inside the body, but in the gel, it can maintain stability for at least two weeks. that allows for controlled release over a longer period of time, which is sufficient for what we are trying to do." 
 beyond treating infections, the new technique might be used to prevent infection during surgery. for instance, if a screw was being inserted to repair an injury, the hydrogel might be applied to the screw threads. the soft gel would not affect the repair. 
 the next step in the research would be to repeat the study in large animals, after which clinical trials could be considered if the material proves promising. 
 "the mechanisms used to fight off infection depends on the species," garcia noted. "that's why it's so important to repeat the studies in a large animal after testing in mice or rats. showing efficacy in a large animal model would be a key step toward human trials." 
 the hydrogel material has been used in the human body before, and is designed to quickly leave the treatment site. "the hydrogel breaks down into small building blocks that are excreted in the urine," garcia said. "after several weeks, there is no synthetic material left in the body and it is replaced by normal healing tissue." 
 in addition to those already named, co-authors on the paper included mary caitlin p. sok, karen e. martin, pranav p. kalelkar, jeremy d. caplin, and edward a. botchwey.

-0.3431 liberal arts iran nuclear deal withdrawal "terribly misguided," says sam nunn school of international affairs scholar 
 rachel whitlock, an assistant professor who specializes in lobal nuclear politics and international security , says the decision to pull out gives iran all the leverage 
 rachel whitlark 
 may 09, 2018 
 - atlanta, ga 
 the decision by u.s. president donald trump to withdraw from the iran nuclear deal "is terribly misguided and cedes all the leverage to iran," said rachel whitlark, an expert in global nuclear politics and international security at the georgia institute of technology. 
 "the belief that iran will now be willing to renegotiate a mythical ‘better deal' seems untenable, especially since the united states' european, chinese, and russian partners were opposed to a brand new deal or scrapping the current one," said  whitlark , who specializes in international security and foreign policy decision-making, including nuclear proliferation, counter-proliferation, and military intervention. 
 trump announced tuesday, may 8, 2018, that the united states would pull out of the joint comprehensive plan of action, or jcpoa,  the 2015 culmination of a fevered international effort to halt tehran's progress toward a nuclear weapon. 
 supporters of trump's decision argue it will give the united states more leverage to negotiate a better deal with iran that would permanently end the threat of the country gaining nuclear weapons. whitlark said she doubts this scenario, in part because the united states lacks the political capital to convince international partners to restore sanctions against iran. 
 although the united states could restore secondary sanctions on international entities that do business with iran, those measures would fall well short of the far-reaching global effort that brought iran to the negotiating table in the first place, whitlark said. 
 "reimposing the sanctions regime is going to be incredibly difficult, especially on the scale that it was prior to the jcpoa's negotiation," she said. 
 whitlark also said trump's decision will give iran ammunition to further isolate the united states from its allies, and likely will severely damage u.s. credibility as a negotiating partner ahead of critical upcoming talks with north korea over its nuclear program. 
 "the point of the jcpoa was to take the nuclear issue off the table, to then allow for discussion on the other relevant issues, such as terrorism, regional turbulence, and iran's ballistic missile program," whitlark said. 
 "scrapping the deal makes that all but impossible, given that this action will fuel hardliners in iran, drive a wedge between the u.s. and key international partners, and make the united states look untrustworthy," said whitlark. 
 "this is a lesson to any other current or future proliferant - be incredibly wary of negotiating with the u.s. or freezing or halting your nuclear program," she said. 
 while iran's next steps remain unclear - perhaps attempting to salvage some remnants of the jcpoa with the remaining participants or possibly even resurrecting its nuclear weapons program - the implications for the global non-proliferation regime are alarming, whitlark said. 
 "denuclearizing north korea is already a herculean challenge," she said. "simultaneously combatting an iranian nuclear weapons program and middle east arms race add dizzying nuclear complications." 
 whitlark is an assistant professor in the sam nunn school of international affairs. the school is a unit of the  ivan allen college of liberal arts .

 new research has found almost 25% of people surveyed experienced some form of deprivation due to the coronavirus pandemic. 
 the coronavirus pandemic has triggered an unprecedented economic crisis in the u.s. 
 dec 16, 2020 
 - atlanta, ga 
 new research has found that almost 25% of u.s. respondents experienced two of four types of deprivation due to the coronavirus pandemic. 
 shatakshee dhongde, associate professor of economics in the ivan allen college of liberal arts, analyzed results of the federal reserve board's survey of household economics and decision-making to determine the multiple economic deprivations experienced by respondents. her work was recently published in the open-access journal 
 plos one . dhongde found that significant proportions of u.s. respondents were experiencing economic hardships even early in the covid-19 pandemic, with hispanic citizens being particularly affected. 
 "the paper highlights the plight of americans during the early months of the economic crisis set in motion amid the coronavirus pandemic," dhongde said. "it sheds light on how economic disparities deepened along racial and ethnic lines." 
 the pandemic triggered an unprecedented economic crisis in the u.s. data from the centers for disease control and prevention shows more than 374,000 confirmed u.s. covid-19 cases between april 3 and april 6. the federal reserve board surveyed 1,030 u.s. respondents about their households. the survey compiled data on four indicators of economic deprivation: overall financial condition, loss of employment, reduction in income, and inability to pay bills in full. 
 dhongde found significant deprivation among respondents, with almost 25% reporting hardships in at least two of the four indicators. one quarter of respondents saw their incomes fall compared to the previous month, and 13% were unable to pay their monthly bills. young adults and those without a college education experienced a disproportionate loss of economic well-being. 
 she also found that hispanic respondents were experiencing significantly higher deprivation: over 37% of these respondents faced hardships in at least two of the four indicators, and 8% reported hardships in all four areas. 
 "going forward, it is urgent that we prioritize economic aid to vulnerable populations," dhongde added. "these individuals are experiencing multiple hardships, and, without immediate aid, they will not be able to sustain the economic shock of the pandemic."

-0.1027 STEM a journey to the origins of multicellular life: long-term experimental evolution in the lab 
 over 3,000 generations of laboratory evolution, georgia tech researchers watched as their model organism, "snowflake yeast," began to adapt as multicellular individuals. 
 macroscopic snowflake yeast with elongated cells fracture into modules, retaining the same underlying branched growth form of their microscopic ancestor. 
 may 10, 2023 
 the world would look very different without multicellular organisms - take away the plants, animals, fungi, and seaweed, and earth starts to look like a wetter, greener version of mars. but precisely how multicellular organisms evolved from single-celled ancestors remains poorly understood. the transition happened hundreds of millions of years ago, and early multicellular species are largely lost to extinction. 
 to investigate how multicellular life evolves from scratch, researchers from the georgia institute of technology decided to take evolution into their own hands. led by  william ratcliff , associate professor in the  school of biological sciences  and director of the  interdisciplinary graduate program in quantitative biosciences , a team of researchers has initiated the first long-term evolution experiment aimed at evolving new kinds of multicellular organisms from single-celled ancestors in the lab.

-0.9993 liberal arts marking two years of war in ukraine. what does the future hold in store? 
 ivan allen college of liberal arts experts assess the state of the ukraine war on its second anniversary. 
 ivan allen college of liberal arts experts assess the state of the ukraine war on its second anniversary. 
 feb 21, 2024 
 saturday, feb. 24, marks two years since russian forces invaded ukraine. ivan allen college of liberal arts experts have closely tracked the conflict from the frontlines to potential fault lines in western support for ukraine, as well as the potential impact on the global economy. we asked some of these scholars to offer their insights into how the way the war  has evolved in the past year, and what to look out for going forward. 
 our experts: 
 gen. philip breedlove , former nato supreme commander and distinguished professor of the practice in the sam nunn school of international affairs 
 robert bell , former senior civilian representative of the u.s. secretary of defense in europe and the defense advisor to the u.s. ambassador to nato; also a distinguished professor of the practice in the sam nunn school of international affairs 
 dina khapaeva , professor of russian, school of modern languages 
 nikolay koposov , distinguished professor of the practice, school of history and sociology 
 how has russia responded to developments in the last year? 
 breedlove : i probably said last year that they were failing and that they were not adaptive , 
 and they were rather rigid, and they were. they have had bad planning, bad logistics, bad general officership, bad decisions, and brought the wrong people to the battlefield. it's just been horrible. but that now is changing. mr. putin is having to face up to the fact that he can't keep doing that. he's going into an election. support for what even people in russia are now calling a war is beginning to fall. as we say in america, we're running out of money, now we have to think. well, mr. putin is running out of troops, so now he has to think. and we're now starting to see some adaptations in the use of air power and some better tactics more suited to small-unit warfare. 
 what has ukraine done well? 
 breedlove : ukraine has just absolutely rearranged russia in the black sea. they have essentially made the northern 20% of the black sea untenable for russia, and russia has had to relocate major assets to the south and east. and whenever they're trying to move in and out of crimea, especially, ukraine is making them pay and making them pay dearly. they've adapted small, commercial, over-the-counter drones and made them into a very lethal flighting fleet: russia is still losing tanks to $270 drones. and their surface and under-surface naval drone capability is in the middle of defeating the northern part of the black sea fleet. that is beyond astounding. they are really leading the world in that way, and we are learning from them. 
 what military aid does ukraine most need from the west? 
 breedlove : victory is not about any one bright shiny object. what ukraine needs is what the united states would take to this fight if we were involved militarily. they need air superiority to enable modern maneuver warfare, and they need the sensor capabilities to discriminate targets from friends and to command and control. then we can talk about the thing everybody wants to talk about: the ability to shoot, whether it's a 
 patriot , a 
 thaad , or an f-16. you throw a bunch of f-16s out there in the middle of the battlefield, they'd do some pretty good work, but they would do amazing work if they were hooked to a capability to sense, discern, target, shoot. 
 bell : the two most critically needed enhancements in ukraine's military inventory are modern air superiority fighter aircraft (e.g., the f-16s now being delivered, but in larger numbers) and long-range "deep strike" fires such as the u.s. 
 atacms 
 system already provided, but in the longer-range missile version, as well as the german-made 
 taurus 
 long-range missile. these systems could alter the course of the war in ukraine's favor, especially if their use were to be concentrated on a deliberate strategy of denying russia any military presence on or access to crimea. 
 were that goal to be achieved, it would constitute a "strategic defeat" for putin since russian ambitions have for centuries prioritized control of crimea. that might increase the admittedly long odds that putin might see value in negotiating an acceptable outcome to this conflict. 
 what's the outlook for continued western aid? 
 bell: 
 the eu has just renewed its support for ukraine's economy with a 
 € 54 billion package . whether the u.s. congress can pass the pending supplemental appropriations request from president biden for 
 $60 billion 
 in further military assistance remains to be seen. the domestic argument over securing the u.s. southern border is the primary holdup there. however, u.s. support could also be put at risk if kyiv fails to adequately attack domestic corruption or president zelenskyy begins to rule in an unacceptably autocratic fashion. also, priorities could shift if the u.s. military involvement in the middle east conflicts escalates, or if china were to attempt to reintegrate taiwan by force. 
 koposov : 
 western fatigue is obvious and understandable, but the key thing is that western opinion has not yet appreciated the importance of the problems at stake. we still very much live in a state of post-cold war triumphalism and do not understand that the world has dramatically changed since communism collapsed and that the new challenges to democracy are no less serious than those it had to face in the   20th 
 century. almost all domestic problems should now be postponed, and the west should mobilize all its resources to get rid of putin once and forever. 
 are there any less-often-discussed underlying structural weaknesses in the russian military-industrial complex that could significantly limit its ability to continue fighting? 
 bell : president putin is clearly worried about possible civil disobedience and public resistance were he to order a general mobilization. this is why he has relied on mercenaries, generous pay, and bonus offers to recruits from distant corners of russia, and pardon offers to convicts. nonetheless, if putin must choose between a wider conscription or conceding defeat to ukraine, he will most likely choose the former and amplify his already strong public messaging that suffering and sacrifice for russia are patriotic and good for one's soul. 
 hence no "tipping point" is yet in sight. 
 khapaeva : russian volunteers recruited from the most socially and economically disadvantaged groups can expect to receive a payment for their military service that amounts to a lifetime of earnings. the moment putin's administration is cut off from its oil and gas profits, russians may become much less willing to serve as cannon fodder, creating conditions for changing the general political atmosphere in the country. 
 are sanctions having any impact on russia's war effort or domestic morale? 
 khapaeva : the historical memory of the conditions under which generations lived in this country must be taken into consideration. russian history is one of regular famines, starvation, food shortages, and an economy of deficit, all which are alive in the collective memory. living standards in russia remain far below those of its western neighbors, but current sanctions cannot even approach that historical level of poverty. moreover, many russians consider their memories of misery as testifying to national resilience. this goes well with putin's propaganda, which has been successful in presenting state terror as a matter of national pride and heritage. 
 what role can diplomacy play in bringing an end to the conflict? 
 bell : a western diplomatic effort to persuade china and key global south nations to pressure russia might persuade moscow to swiftly end its pursuit of total victory in ukraine, but such a scenario is unlikely. however, some other avenues do exist to hinder russia's war effort. 
 for instance, the u.s. could work with fellow permanent un security council members france and the uk and incoming members japan and south korea on a "name and shame" campaign to expose and condemn russia's blatant violation of un security council resolutions that imposed strict sanctions on north korea's military exports and imports related to its illegal and dangerous nuclear and ballistic missile programs. that could help isolate russia and delegitimize its actions. 
 koposov : i do not think there is, or should be, any room for diplomacy at this point. do we need another munich? 
 what are the most concerning "wildcard" scenarios you can envision? 
 bell : the assassination of zelenskyy by the russian fsb or his death in a missile strike, or a collapse of morale within the ukrainian military. 
 khapaeva : if the "vertical of power" cracks, leaders of the estimated 30 private armies in russia may start acting as independent warlords, fighting for power and resources inside russia. this could eventually lead to the collapse of the russian federation into several states, helping ukraine and the west to win the war. the decentralization of the federation was avoided in 1991 - not without western help - out of fear that nuclear arms would proliferate into the hands of even smaller and less controllable states. judging from today, that looks like shortsighted politics. 
 breedlove : the big wild card is that mr. putin understands how to yank our chain, and if ukraine started winning, the first thing you'd probably hear are new threats around the nuclear power plant in zaporizhia. we told russia before the war what we were afraid of: we are afraid of nukes and we're afraid of the war widening. mr. putin uses those tools constantly to keep us deterred. but if russia ends up killing a bunch of nato people, that's a big wild card and one that is frankly really unsavory to talk about. 
 how will this all turn out? 
 bell : if president biden is re-elected and congress agrees to continue the delivery of u.s. military weaponry at roughly the same level and in the same categories and types as before, we can expect that neither of the two contesting parties will achieve a decisive breakthrough for the foreseeable future. if president trump is elected in november, we can expect some sort of dramatic u.s. proposal for an immediate halt to the fighting.  assuming that is rejected outright by ukraine and trump cuts off all u.s. military assistance in response, then ukraine's ability to continue to prosecute the war for more than a few more months would be at risk, and its incentives, however unwilling, to seek a negotiated settlement would be increased. 
 breedlove : it is my belief that this war will end exactly how western policy leaders decide it's going to end. if we give ukraine what they need to win, and we are not doing that now, they will win. if we stop supporting ukraine, they will lose. and if that happens the fact of the matter is that russia will again subjugate ukraine, and many tens of thousands of ukrainian soldiers and civilians will die in a guerrilla conflict the likes of which russia has never seen. 
 what are the potential long-term geopolitical ramifications of the war? 
 koposov : if putin wins the war, he will most likely continue with other aggressions, and u.s. leadership in the world will be significantly undermined. china will most likely learn the lesson and imitate him, at least to some extent. and the so-called global south will become even more anti-american than it is now. 
 bell : nato's own security is inextricably intertwined in the outcome of this conflict. 
 as the leaders of the alliance themselves agreed at their summit in madrid in 2022, russia's willingness to prosecute this aggression means that it cannot be excluded that it might also decide to commit aggression against a nato ally, nato's article 5 collective security commitments notwithstanding. 
 khapaeva : if putin wins, the war will not end russia's aggression and put to rest its ambitions to restore the russian empire / ussr. an attack on an eastern european or baltic nato state is already avidly discussed by kremlin propagandists. the west showed a feeble and inconsistent response to russia's war against georgia in 2008 and the 2014 annexation of crimea. after russia invaded ukraine, made-up fear of crossing "putin's red lines" led to rationing the arms to ukraine and enabled russia to buy time and fortify the front line on the occupied territories. it's going to be hard to persuade the russians that they now must obey the international norms they have been violating for the past two decades. hence, putin will seek to compromise nato. if, at that moment, the u.s. decides to instead focus on its "domestic agenda," nato's collapse will become imminent.

-0.9907 STEM this matrix delivers healing stem cells to injured elderly muscles 
 elderly accident victims and duchene muscular dystrophy sufferers could someday benefit from this stem cell hydrogel successfully tested in mice. 
 hydrogel delivered stem cells called muscle satellite cells integrate to form new muscle strands, in green, along with existing muscle tissue, in red. yellow strands may descend from existing muscle cells and from delivered muscs. 
 aug 15, 2018 
 - atlanta, ga 
 a car accident leaves an aging patient with severe muscle injuries that won't heal. treatment with muscle stem cells from a donor might restore damaged tissue, but doctors are unable to deliver them effectively. 
 a new method  may help change this. 
 researchers at the georgia institute of technology engineered a molecular matrix, a hydrogel, to deliver muscle stem cells called muscle satellite cells (muscs) directly to injured muscle tissue in patients whose muscles don't regenerate well. in lab experiments on mice, the hydrogel successfully delivered muscs to injured, aged muscle tissue to boost the healing process while protecting the stem cells from harsh immune reactions. 
 the method was also successful in mice with a muscle tissue deficiency that emulated duchene muscular dystrophy, and if research progresses, the new hydrogel therapy could one day save the lives of people suffering from the disease. 
 inflammatory war zone 
 simply injecting additional muscle satellite cells into damaged, inflamed tissue has proven inefficient, in part because the stem cells encounter an immune system on the warpath. 
 "any muscle injury is going to attract immune cells. typically, this would help muscle stem cells repair damage. but in aged or dystrophic muscles, immune cells lead to the release a lot of toxic chemicals like cytokines and free radicals that kill the new stem cells," said young jang, an  assistant professor in georgia tech's school of biological sciences  and one of the study's principal investigators. 
 only between 1 and 20 percent of injected muscs make it to damaged tissue, and those that do, arrive there weakened. also, some tissue damage makes any injection unfeasible, thus the need for new delivery strategies. 
 "our new hydrogel protects the stem cells, which multiply and thrive inside the matrix. the gel is applied to injured muscle, and the cells engraft onto the tissues and help them heal," said woojin han, a postdoctoral researcher in georgia tech's school of mechanical engineering and the paper's first author. 
 han, jang and andres garcia, the study's other principal investigator, 
 published their results on august 15, 2018, in the journal  science advances . the national institute of arthritis and musculoskeletal and skin diseases of the national institutes of health funded the research. 
 hydrogel: watery nets 
 hydrogels often start out as water-based solutions of molecular components that resemble crosses, and other components that make the ends of the crosses attach to each other. when the components come together, they fuse into molecular nets suspended in water, resulting in a material with the consistency of a gel. 
 if stem cells or a drug are mixed into the solution, when the net, or matrix, forms, it ensnares the treatment for delivery and protects the payload from death or dissipation in the body. researchers can easily and reliably synthesize hydrogels and also custom-engineer them by tweaking their components, as the georgia tech researchers did in this hydrogel. 
 "it physically traps the muscle satellite cells in a net, but the cells also grab onto chemical latches we engineered into the net," han said. 
 this hydrogel's added latches, which bond with proteins protruding from stem cells' membranes, not only increase the cells' adhesion to the net but also hinder them from committing suicide. stem cells tend to kill themselves when they're detached and free-floating. 
 the chemical components and the cells are mixed in solution then applied to the injured muscle, where the mixture sets to a matrix-gel patch that glues the stem cells in place. the gel is biocompatible and biodegradable. 
 "the stem cells keep multiplying and thriving in the gel after it is applied," jang said. "then the hydrogel degrades and leaves behind the cells engrafted onto muscle tissue the way natural stem cells usually would be." 
 stem cell breakdown 
 in younger, healthier patients, muscle satellite cells are part of the natural healing mechanism. 
 "muscle satellite cells are resident stem cells in your skeletal muscles. they live on muscle strands like specks, and they're key players in making new muscle tissue," han said. 
 "as we age, we lose muscle mass, and the number of satellite cells also decreases. the ones that are left get weaker. it's a double whammy," jang said. "at a very advanced age, a patient stops regenerating muscle altogether." 
 "with this system we engineered, we think we can introduce donor cells to enhance the repair mechanism in injured older patients," han said. "we also want to get this to work in patients with duchene muscular dystrophy." 
 "duchene muscular dystrophy is surprisingly frequent," jang said. "about 1 in 3,500 boys get it. they eventually get respiratory defects that lead to death, so we hope to be able to use this to rebuild their diaphragm muscles." 
 if the method goes to clinical trials, researchers will likely have to work around the potential for donor cell rejection in human patients.

-0.9955 liberal arts medicaid ‘unwinding' could lead to eviction crisis, new school of public policy research suggests 
 the study examined tennessee's 23005 trimming of its medicaid rolls and the impact on evictions. 
 evictions substantially rose in tennessee compared to other southern states after the 2005 removal of 190,000 people from medicaid there, school of public policy assistant professor ashley c. bradford found in a new study published in 
 health affairs . the study offers insights into what might happen after current efforts to return to normal medicaid operations nationally following the covid-19 public health emergency. 
 feb 16, 2024 
 the united states may be in for a significant wave of evictions in a year or so, the unintended consequence of work to trim medicaid rolls expanded during the covid-19 public health emergency, according to new research from georgia tech's 
 school of public policy . 
 the 
 study , 
 authored 
 by assistant professor ashley c. bradford and recently published in 
 health affairs, 
 found that evictions in tennessee rose 24.5 percent between 2005 and 2009 relative to other southern states following the state's 2005 decision to remove approximately 190,000 people from its medicaid rolls. 
 more than 
 16.4 million people 
 nationwide - 86 times the tennessee figure from 2005 - have already been taken off medicaid as states react to a federal law requiring them to return to normal operations after years of expanded eligibility meant to blunt the impact of the pandemic, according to 
 kff health news. 
 as many as 24 million people could eventually lose access to medicaid, according to the outlet. 
 however, 
 bradford 
 warns that many aspects of health care administration and the housing market have changed since 2005, so it's hard to say whether that 24.5% figure in her paper will cleanly translate to the economic and policy environment of 2025. the populations involved in tennessee's downsizing and the 
 current national rollbacks 
 are also different, adding more uncertainty. 
 "i think it's safe to say that we will see disruptions in housing, but we are not going to be able to see exactly how large those disruptions will be for a few years," bradford said. 
 https: / / youtu.be / v7ykdwvwgza?si=fwpklp24paa6i4_a 
 t ransformed health care and housing landscapes may shift impact 
 among other things, where tennessee's 2005 medicaid changes primarily affected working-age childless adults, the researchers say that the current medicaid rollback is expected to disproportionately affect immigrants and people with disabilities - populations whose budgets are often more sensitive to economic shocks like the loss of health insurance. 
 on the other hand, according to the researchers, the affordable care act could also reduce financial shocks and evictions for some families. the program first offered health insurance plans - including low- and zero-premium options - in 2013, well after the period bradford 
 and her co-authors 
 studied in tennessee. 
 another group expected to be affected, older adults, may be somewhat sheltered from evictions due to savings or social security income, according to bradford and her co-authors, mir m. ali of the university of maryland, college park and johanna catherin maclean of george mason university. 
 the link between medicaid loss and evictions 
 so, what precisely is the connection between loss of medicaid and eviction? 
 in the tennessee case, the loss of health coverage - which persisted for most families removed from medicaid in tennessee in 2005 - would likely have added more financial stress to already strapped budgets. it also may have led to a higher incidence of preventable health issues or the undertreatment of existing chronic health conditions that could have made it harder for people to keep working, according to the researchers. either situation could be financially devastating, potentially resulting in eventual eviction. 
 evictions, in turn, often force people into housing located in areas with fewer employment opportunities and higher crime, further elevating the financial stress on vulnerable populations, leading to a cycle that can lock people - especially those affected by health issues or substance misuse - into nearly inescapable poverty, according to the study authors. 
 "we know evictions are extraordinarily damaging to families and individuals and can cause generational impacts. so we really need to be able to intervene and help vulnerable people before they get into a cycle where they cannot get out of it on their own," bradford said. 
 bradford said one policy that could help would be a strong, temporary eviction moratorium similar to the one imposed nationally by the u.s. centers for disease control and prevention in response to the covid-19 pandemic in 2021. policymakers could also consider financial assistance to those being removed from the medicaid rolls to help them stay on their feet during the transition, she said. 
 methodology and limitations 
 to reach their conclusions in the recent paper, bradford and her co-authors used data from the eviction lab at princeton university. they examined county-level eviction data from tennessee and compared it to those of alabama, florida, georgia, kentucky, louisiana, maryland, mississippi, north carolina, oklahoma, south carolina, texas, virginia, washington, d.c., and west virginia. 
 after controlling for variables such as whether political factors could have led to weakened rental protection laws, they found that the average annual eviction filings per tennessee county increased by 27.6% as compared to counties in the other states in the u.s. census bureau's south region. eventual evictions increased by the slightly smaller 24.5% figure. 
 that works out to about 1,000 more annual evictions per tennessee county than in other southern states during the same period. 
 the study does have some limitations in addition to how much has changed since 2005, bradford notes. she said the database has some gaps, lacks individual-level data, and does not track eviction notices or evictions overturned on appeal, although the latter is believed to be rare. 
 probing impact of substance abuse, psychiatric care access, on evictions 
 bradford's earlier research has examined the impact of evictions from other angles. in a 
 2019 paper 
 published in 
 health services research , she also found that a 1% increase in the eviction rate is associated with an up to 0.596% chance of substance-related deaths for the average u.s. county. 
 in a 
 2023 study 
 published in the 
 journal of policy analysis and management 
 with co-author johanna catherin maclean, bradford found that having ten additional psychiatric treatment centers in a county was associated with 2.1% fewer evictions. 
 the researchers hypothesized that increased access to psychiatric care improved the management of mental health disorders, which can lead to higher rates of employment and lower rates of activities likely to lead to eviction - such as nuisance behaviors or criminal activity. 
 it was one of the first papers to make a plausible link explaining the relationship between mental health treatment access and eviction, according to the researchers. 
 bradford's most recent paper, "tenncare disenrollment led to increased eviction filings and evictions in tennessee relative to other southern states," was published on feb. 5, 2024, in 
 health affairs . it is available at

-0.9968 STEM metabolic profiles distinguish early stage ovarian cancer with unprecedented accuracy 
 a new study has produced a set of biomarkers that may enable development of an accurate ovarian cancer screening test. 
 georgia tech research scientist david gaul places samples into an ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (uplc-ms) instrument for testing. the uplc-ms technique was used to help identify 16 metabolites associated with early-stage ovarian cancer. the work, utilizing serum samples, could lead to an accurate screening test for the disease. 
 nov 17, 2015 
 - atlanta, ga 
 studying blood serum compounds of different molecular weights has led scientists to a set of biomarkers that may enable development of a highly accurate screening test for early-stage ovarian cancer. using advanced liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry techniques coupled with machine learning computer algorithms, researchers have identified 16 metabolite compounds that provided unprecedented accuracy in distinguishing 46 women with early-stage ovarian cancer from a control group of 49 women who did not have the disease. blood samples for the study were collected from a broad geographic area - canada, philadelphia and atlanta. while the set of biomarkers reported in this study are the most accurate reported thus far for early-stage ovarian cancer, more extensive testing across a larger population will be needed to determine if the high diagnostic accuracy will be maintained across a larger group of women representing a diversity of ethnic and racial groups. the research was reported november 17 in the journal 
 scientific reports , an open access journal from the publishers of 
 nature . "this work provides a proof of concept that using an integrated approach combining analytical chemistry and learning algorithms may be a way to identify optimal diagnostic features," said 
 john mcdonald , a professor in the 
 school of biolog y at the georgia institute of technology and director of its integrated cancer research center. "we think our results show great promise and we plan to further validate our findings across much larger samples." ovarian cancer has been difficult to treat because it typically is not diagnosed until after it has metastasized to other areas of the body. researchers have been seeking a routine screening test that could diagnose the disease in stage one or stage two - when the cancer is confined to the ovaries. working with three cancer treatment centers in the u.s. and canada, the georgia tech researchers obtained blood samples from women with stage one and stage two ovarian cancer. they separated out the serum, which contains proteins and metabolites - molecules produced by enzymatic reactions in the body. the serum samples were analyzed by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (uplc-ms), which is two instruments joined together to better separate samples into their individual components. heavier molecules are separated from lighter molecules, and the molecular signatures are determined with enough accuracy to identify the specific compounds. the georgia tech researchers decided to look only at the metabolites in their research. "people have been looking at proteins for diagnosis of ovarian cancer for a couple of decades, and the results have not been very impressive," said 
 facundo fernández , a professor in georgia tech's 
 school of chemistry and biochemistry 
 who led the analytical chemistry part of the research. "we decided to look in a different place for molecules that could potentially provide diagnostic capabilities. it's one of the places that people had really not studied before." samples from each of the 46 cancer patients were divided so they could be analyzed in duplicate. the researchers also looked at serum samples from 49 women who did not have cancer. the work required eliminating unrelated compounds such as caffeine, and molecules that were not present in all the cancer patients. "we used really high resolution equipment and instrumentation to be able to separate most of the components of the samples," fernández explained. "otherwise, detection of early-stage ovarian cancer is very difficult because you have a lot of confounding factors." the chemical work identified about a thousand candidate compounds. that number was reduced to about 255 through the work of research scientist david gaul, who removed duplicates and unrelated molecules from the collection. these 255 compounds were then analyzed by a learning algorithm which evaluated the predictive value of each one. molecules that did not contribute to the predictive accuracy of the screening were eliminated. ultimately, the algorithm produced a list of 16 molecules that together differentiated cancer patients with extremely high accuracy - greater than 90 percent. "the algorithm looks at the metabolic features and correlates them with whether the samples were from cancer or control patients," mcdonald explained. "the algorithm has no idea what these compounds are. it is simply looking for the combination of molecules that provides the optimal predictive accuracy. what is encouraging is that many of the diagnostic features identified are metabolites that have been previously implicated in ovarian cancer." as a next step, mcdonald and fernández would like to study samples from a larger population that includes significant numbers of different ethnic and racial groups. those individuals may have different metabolites that could serve as biomarkers for ovarian cancer. though sophisticated laboratory equipment was required to identify the 16 molecules, a screening test would not require the same level of sophistication, fernández said. "once you know what these molecules are, the next step would be to set up a clinical assay," he said. "mass spectrometry is a common tool in this field. we could use a clinical mass spectrometer to look at only the molecules we are interested in. moving this to a clinical assay would take work, but i don't see any technical barriers to doing it." the fernández and mcdonald groups have used a similar approach with prostate cancer and plan to explore its utility for detecting other types of cancer. the research was supported by grants from the laura crandall brown ovarian cancer foundation, the ovarian cancer research fund, the ovarian cancer institute, northside hospital (atlanta), the robinson family fund, and the deborah nash endowment fund. citation : david a. gaul, et al., "highly-accurate metabolomics detection of early-stage ovarian cancer," (scientific reports, 2015).

-0.9711 STEM miniature gas chromatograph could help farmers detect crop diseases earlier 
 researchers are developing a micro gas chromatograph for early detection of diseases in crops.

 researchers at the georgia tech research institute (gtri) are developing a micro gas chromatograph (gc) for early detection of diseases in crops. about the size of a 9-volt battery, the technology's portability could give farmers just the tool they need to quickly evaluate the health of their crops and address any possible threats immediately, potentially increasing yield by reducing crop losses. "it's estimated that each year u.s. farmers lose 12 percent of their crops to pests and another 12 percent to diseases," said gary mcmurray, division chief of gtri's food processing technology division. to identify potential threats to crop health, farmers typically look for physical symptoms of disease, such as discolored or wilting leaves. however, in many cases, by the time these symptoms are visible, the plant is already dead or dying. and the culprit pathogen may have already spread to nearby plants, threatening the health of the entire crop. "the key is to give farmers the ability to get early diagnostic results, which allows them to take action before it's too late," said mcmurray. gtri's micro gas chromatograph is a gc-on-chip device. its separation column, where the gas interacts with the polymer coated on the interior walls, is about the size of a quarter, and the thermal conductive detector is about half the size of a penny. when the two are combined, the device itself is about the size of a 9-volt battery. mcmurray said the goal is to be able to fit dozens of micro gcs on a ground robot that a farmer could then use in crop fields to take samples from plant to plant and get results in minutes. "the idea is to have the robot be a mobile chemical laboratory that provides real-time data to the farmer. the robot provides a simple way to collect the data in an unstructured environment like a farm," said mcmurray. because all plants and pathogens emit volatile organic compounds (vocs), these emissions can be used as chemical markers for rapid detection. building the micro gc was the easy part, said jie xu, gtri senior research scientist. the challenge now, she explained, is correlating the vocs emitted from plants to their health status. "it's relatively easy to detect vocs, but we still have a long way to go to interpret changes in plant voc mixtures," said xu. the difficulty lies in understanding how plants react to local environmental conditions. for example, changes in temperature, humidity, and soil moisture and nutrient levels, all have an effect on voc emissions. to determine if the emissions are due to a pathogen, a chemical signature has to be established by studying vocs released under these different environmental conditions. researchers plan to conduct field tests using a benchtop model of the micro gc in summer 2014. working with colleagues at the usda's agricultural research service, they will test peach trees for peachtree root rot disease at the southeastern fruit and tree nut research laboratory in byron, ga. the goal is to collect air and soil samples that can be analyzed to identify the disease's chemical signature. mcmurray said a portion of the collected samples will be retained for additional laboratory tests with a traditional gc-ms to confirm the effectiveness of the micro gc. the team will then pursue efforts to integrate it into an autonomous robotic platform for crop field sampling and voc data analysis. "real-time data from sensing technologies like the micro gc, when used in conjunction with other data collected on the farm, could revolutionize the ability of farmers to identify sick plants before any physical symptoms appear," added mcmurray. earlier detection also means earlier intervention, which could ultimately translate into a boon for america's farmers. "if we could cut in half the 12 percent of crop losses due to diseases, farmers could potentially realize billions of dollars more in revenue each year," said mcmurray. in addition to agricultural applications, the micro gc could potentially be used for homeland security monitoring to detect chemical threats, such as gases in subways and dangerous explosives in vehicles. the micro gc project is being conducted in collaboration with researchers at gtri, georgia tech's george w. woodruff school of mechanical engineering and the parker h. petit institute for bioengineering and bioscience, the department of plant pathology in the university of georgia's college of agricultural and environmental sciences, and the usda's agricultural research service.

-0.9735 STEM new chip could make treating metastatic cancer easier and faster 
 researchers at the georgia institute of technology have found a detection method that could revolutionize cancer treatment by showing how cancers metastasize and what stage they are. 
 fabrication of the microchip. the device is fabricated by injecting a polymer into a micro fabricated mold and the polymer is cured under ultraviolet light to produce low-cost, single-use devices.

 - atlanta, ga 
 cancer spreads via circulating tumor cells (ctcs) that travel through the blood to other organs, and they are nearly impossible to track. now, researchers at the georgia institute of technology have found a detection method that could revolutionize cancer treatment by showing how cancers metastasize and what stage they are. this could lead to earlier and more targeted treatment, beginning with a simple blood test. 
 when a tumor starts metastasizing, it sheds its cell into the blood. an individual cell often doesn't survive the bloodstream on its own, but clusters of cells are much more robust and can travel to other organs, effectively pushing the cancer to a metastatic state. 
 ctcs have proven difficult to study, let alone treat. blood contains billions of cells per milliliter, and only a handful of those cells would be ctcs in a patient with metastatic cancer. such intense filtration has been inaccessible using conventional lab methods. most traditional filtration is too aggressive and would break the cluster back into single cells and ruin the ability to study the effect of a cluster. 
 "that's what got engineers like me interested in this because we are really good at creating sensors, or small devices that actually do sensitive analysis," said 
 school of electrical and computer engineering 
 associate professor 
 fatih sarioglu . "we started developing technologies to catch these precious cells to help manage cancer better." 
 sarioglu presented the research in " high throughput, label-free isolation of circulating tumor cell clusters in meshed microwells ," recently published in 
 nature 
 co mmunications. 
 creating the cluster-well 
 sarioglu's lab invented a new type of chip called the cluster-well, combining the precision of microfluidic chips with the efficiency of membrane filtration to find ctc clusters. using micron-sized features, microfluidic chips can precisely locate each cell in a blood sample and determine if it's cancerous. 
 "microfluidic chips give you more control as a designer to actually ask whatever question that you want to ask those cells," sarioglu said. "it increases the precision and sensitivity, which is what you need for an application like this because you want to find that single cell out of many blood cells." 
 to rapidly process a clinically relevant volume of blood, the researchers relied on membrane filtration to make the chip operation more scalable. in effect, the chip looks like a standard membrane filter, but under an electron microscope the microfluidic chip reveals its delicate structure used to capture clusters while letting other blood cells pass through. 
 practicality was just as important as functionality to the researchers. although the chip is initially fabricated with silicon just like a central processing unit in a computer, it is later transferred to polymers to make it accessible, affordable, and single-use, while still retaining its delicacy and precision. 
 "we really created only the traps that we need to have for recognizing the clusters with the microfluidic chip, and the rest is just a standard filter holder," sarioglu said. "compared to a conventional microfluidic chip, you will get a much more practical assay with orders of magnitude improvement in throughput and a higher sensitivity." 
 analyzing patient tumor cell clusters 
 the researchers used the chip to screen blood samples from patients with ovarian or prostate cancers through a partnership with the emory and northside hospitals. they isolated ctc clusters ranging from two to 100 or more cells from prostate and ovarian cancer patients and used rna sequencing to analyze a subset. 
 the chip's unique design means ctc clusters are filtered in microwells and can later be accessed for further analysis. even a single ctc can contain a significant amount of data on the patient and their specific cancer, which can be critical for managing the disease. for example, the researchers noted hundreds of ctcs in clusters in the blood of ovarian cancer patients, some still alive, a finding that could be consequential to the spread of the disease. 
 also, by sequencing the rna in prostate ctc clusters isolated by the chip, the researchers identified specific genes expressed by these metastasizing cells. importantly, ctc clusters from different patients were shown to express different genes, which can be potentially utilized to develop personalized, targeted therapies. sarioglu envisions cluster-wells as being a routine part of the treatment process to determine what stage the cancer is at from a simple blood draw. 
 "finding these clusters was very elusive," sarioglu said. "but this is a technology that allows these precious circulating tumor cell clusters virtually in any cancer to be accessed with precision and practicality that has not been possible before."

-0.7386 STEM new device captures metastasis-associated circulating tumor cell clusters

 the latest version of a microfluidic device for capturing rare circulating tumor cells (ctcs) is the first designed specifically to capture clusters of two or more cells, rather than single cells. the new device, called the cluster-chip, was developed by the same massachusetts general hospital (mgh) research team that created previous microchip-based devices. recent studies by mgh investigators and others have suggested that ctc clusters are significantly more likely to cause metastases than single circulating tumor cells. the device is described in a 
 nature methods 
 paper that was published online may 18. among the members of the research team is 
 fatih sarioglu , now an assistant professor in the 
 school of electrical and computer engineering 
 at georgia tech. "early theories of cancer metastasis were based on clumps of tumor cells traveling through the bloodstream, but given that ctc clusters are even rarer in the blood than single ctcs, they have attracted minimal attention for several decades," explained mehmet toner, phd, director of the biomicroelectromechanical systems resource center in the mgh center for engineering in medicine, the paper's senior author. "the ability to isolate intact clusters will enable is to investigate carefully their role in the metastatic process, and understanding metastasis really is the ‘holy grail' of cancer research." ctcs are living solid tumor cells found in the bloodstream at extremely low levels - about one in a billion cells. starting in 2007, mgh researchers have developed three microchip-based devices that capture ctcs in ways that preserve molecular information that can help guide clinical treatment. the first two versions used antibodies directed at specific proteins on the surface of tumor cells, which limited the ability to capture cells that may have lost those marker proteins during the process of metastasis. the third version, developed in 2013, uses antigen-independent methods of isolating ctcs, which is also the case for the cluster-chip. "cancer is an extremely heterogeneous disease, and even within the same tumor you can find cells with different surface antigens," said sarioglu, co-lead author of the 
 nature methods 
 paper. "since we are capturing clusters because of their physical properties, this chip is directly applicable to all types of cancer." sarioglu explained that the strategy behind the design of the chip is based on the physical properties of clusters of cells. the 3- by 1 ½-inch plastic chip through which a blood sample is passed consists of rows of triangular microposts arranged in such a way that clusters passing between two posts will become trapped on the apex of a third central post and held in place by the balanced flow of fluid on either side. single ctcs and blood cells will pass right through without being captured. in addition, passing the sample through the device at a slow rate minimizes the possibility that clusters will be broken, distorted or escape. initial testing of the cluster-chip with blood samples to which artificially formed tumor cell clusters had been introduced helped to determine the optimal flow rate to capture the most clusters in the least time. the researchers then compared the new device to the second-generation hbctc-chip, which relies on known cell-surface markers and was the first to isolate ctc clusters. the cluster-chip proved to be 40 to 50 percent better at finding clusters of cells expressing targeted markers and 100 percent better at capturing cells without target antigens. while initial attempts to release captured clusters from the device by simply reversing the fluid flow had limited success, the investigators found that reducing the temperature of the device itself to 4 degrees celsius (39 f) not only released 80 percent of clusters, but also improved the purity of the captured material by reducing the undesired capture of white blood cells. use of the cluster-clip to test blood samples from 60 patients with either breast cancer, melanoma or prostate cancer successfully captured ctc clusters in from 30 to 40 percent of samples. analysis of captured clusters revealed they consisted of cells with significant molecular differences, some actively proliferating and other relatively quiescent, and were often accompanied by immune cells, an observation that could have important implications with the increased attention to immune-system-based cancer therapies. "testing of patient blood samples also revealed that there were significantly more ctc clusters in the blood than was previously believed," said toner. "we now are looking at ways to improve further the release of captured clusters, but we are only at the beginning of our quest to understand the role and biology of ctc clusters. eventually we could develop ways to target clusters therapeutically as well as using them as a source of diagnostic information." toner is the the benedict professor of surgery at harvard medical school. "this new isolation device will be particularly useful in isolating clusters of ctcs, which seem to be the most malignant and metastasis-prone types of cancer cells in the blood," said daniel haber, md, director of the mgh cancer center and a co-author of the nature methods paper. "i'm particularly excited by the way in which the device was created - starting from a clinical and biological observation about the importance of these ctc clusters and then designing a specific microfluidic device to capture these cells, which will make it possible to study them in greater detail." nicola aceto, phd, of the mgh cancer center is co-lead author of the nature methods paper. support for the current study includes grants from the national institutes of health, the national institute of biomedical imaging and bioengineering, a "dream team" grant from stand up to cancer, the howard hughes medical institute, the prostate cancer foundation, the charles evans foundation, and johnson and johnson. the mgh has filed a patent application for the cluster-chip. the

-0.9805 STEM new georgia tech research may help combat abusive online comments 
 researchers at georgia tech have found a more cost-effective way for internet communities to moderate abusive content. 
 may 09, 2017 
 - atlanta, ga 
 researchers at the georgia institute of technology's 
 school of interactive computing 
 have come up with a novel computational approach that could provide a more cost- and resource-effective way for internet communities to moderate abusive content. 
 they call it the 
 bag of communities 
 (boc), a technique that leverages large-scale, preexisting data from other internet communities to train an algorithm to identify abusive behavior within a separate target community. 
 specifically, they identified nine different communities. five, such as the free-for-all of internet communities 4chan, are rife with abusive behavior from commenters; four, like the heavily moderated metafilter, are helpful, positive, and supportive. 
 using linguistic characteristics from these two types of communities, researchers built an algorithm that can learn from the comments and, when a new post is generated within a target community, it can make a prediction of whether or not it is abusive. 
 "metafilter is known around the internet as a good, helpful, supportive community," said 
 eric gilbert , an associate professor in the school of interactive computing and a member of the team of researchers on the project. "that's an example of how, if your post is closer to that, it's more likely that it should stay on the site. conversely, if your post is closer to 4chan, then maybe it should come off." 
 the researchers provide two algorithms. one is a static model, off the shelf with no training examples from the target community, and can achieve roughly 75 percent accuracy. in other words, with access only to posts from the other nine communities, the algorithm can accurately predict abusive posts in the target community roughly three quarters of the time. 
 "a new community that does not have enough resources to actually build automated algorithms to detect abusive content could use the static model," said georgia tech doctoral student 
 eshwar chandrasekharan , who led the team. 
 a dynamic model, one that mimics scenarios in which newly moderated data arrives in batches, learns over time and can achieve 91.18 percent accuracy after seeing 100,000 human-moderated posts. 
 "over time, as new moderator labels come in, when it has seen examples of things that have been moderated from the site, it can learn more site-specific information," chandrasekharan said. "it can learn the type of comments that get moderated, and if there is a level of tolerance that is different from what you see in the static model, it could learn that over time." 
 both the static and dynamic models outperformed a solely in-domain model from a major internet community. 
 anyone who has managed an online community has encountered problems with abusive content from users. from social media to message boards to comments sections in online news publications, regulating what is and isn't allowed has become overly costly and taxing on existing human moderators. 
 founders at social media startup yik yak spent months of their early time removing hate speech, and twitter has stated publicly that dealing with abusive behavior remains its most pressing challenge. a number of major news agencies are buried under the demands of strict moderation, and many have shut down comments sections altogether. 
 prior research into abuse detection and online content moderation has focused on in-domain methods - using data collected from within your own community - but those face challenges in obtaining enough data to build and evaluate algorithms. in a boc-based method, algorithms would leverage out-of-domain data from other existing online communities. 
 gilbert said that the applications from such a model could be widespread. 
 "this is a core internet problem," he said. "so many places struggle with this, and many are shutting comments off because they just don't want to deal with the trouble they cause." 
 this research is presented in a paper ( the bag of communities: identifying abusive behavior online with preexisting internet data ) at the 
 association for computing machinery chi conference on human factors in computing systems 2017 .

-0.9887 STEM new grant award supports research on early detection of ovarian cancer 
 research on the early detection of ovarian cancer will get a boost from a new award from the prevent cancer foundation. 
 the prevent cancer foundation has made a significant grant award to georgia tech to advance research on detecting ovarian cancer. the work is led by john mcdonald, a professor in the school of biological sciences. (credit: rob felt, georgia tech) 
 feb 26, 2019 
 - atlanta, ga 
 promising research toward what could become the first simple and accurate test for the early detection of ovarian cancer could be validated - and expanded - thanks to a significant grant from the prevent cancer foundation. 
 if validated, the general technique for the work could also have a variety of other applications. "in my dream world, a single blood test could be used to screen for multiple diseases," said 
 john mcdonald , the leader of the research and a professor in the 
 school of biological sciences 
 at the georgia institute of technology. 
 ovarian cancer is especially dangerous because women often don't show symptoms until the disease is in an advanced stage and difficult to treat. in contrast, when caught early "about 94 percent of patients live longer than five years after diagnosis," according to the american cancer society. 
 the problem is that there is no good test for detecting the disease at an early stage. 
 about seven years ago mcdonald and colleagues decided to see if they could change that by merging the disparate disciplines of biology, analytical chemistry and computer science. "bringing the computer into it was novel at the time," said mcdonald, who is also director of georgia tech's integrated cancer research center. 
 his georgia tech collaborators on the initial work were professor facundo fernández, the vasser woolley foundation chair in bioanalytical chemistry, and alex gray, an assistant professor of computer science (gray has since left georgia tech to become vp for artificial intelligence science at ibm). they were joined by clinical consultant dr. benedict benigno, a gynecological oncologist and ceo of the ovarian cancer institute in atlanta. 
 promising results 
 the researchers initially analyzed blood samples from 49 healthy women and 46 with early-stage ovarian cancer. they specifically focused on metabolites in those samples. metabolites are molecules like fatty acids that our cells produce through enzymatic reactions. 
 in the molecular equivalent of finding needles in a haystack, they proceeded to analyze some 40,000 metabolites to see if there were any associated with the cancer patients that differed from those in samples from the healthy women. these could be biomarkers for the disease; molecules to screen for in an annual test. 
 through a variety of techniques, the team first pared down the original thousands of metabolites to a collection of 255 candidate biomarkers. they then applied machine learning to that set, asking the computer to find any metabolites that were over- or under-expressed in the cancer samples. 
 "that's what machine learning is all about," mcdonald said. "the computer is simply looking for correlations in very large data sets, then it comes back to you with what it has found." 
 in 2015 the team reported in the journal scientific reports the discovery of 16 metabolites that could distinguish women with ovarian cancer from those without the disease with 100 percent accuracy. "basically we modeled the face of cancer at the metabolic level," mcdonald said. 
 moving forward 
 with the new $100,000 grant, the researchers hope to validate their earlier work with samples from some 1,000 women, as compared to the roughly 100 they originally studied. the new study will also include samples from a much more diverse set of women (the original samples were from caucasian women). 
 they also aim to expand the work to look for biomarkers associated with different types of ovarian cancer. "we want to be able to distinguish between a type ii cancer with high malignant potential - one that's highly likely to spread outside the ovary - and a type i with low malignant potential. a cancer with high malignant potential you'd want to treat right away, while a cancer with low malignant potential might not require immediate surgery," mcdonald said. 
 in conclusion, mcdonald said, "it's exciting because the initial results look like [our approach] might work."

-0.9746 STEM new research gives users another reason to hate unwanted ads 
 cybersecurity researchers show how attackers can see your online ads knowing only your email address 
 nov 10, 2022 
 - atlanta, ga 
 new research released this week reveals the process used by third party advertisers to target online users can be viewed or manipulated by online adversaries using only their target's email address. 
 a four-person team of researchers from the georgia institute of technology, university of illinois chicago (uic), and new york university (nyu) presented their findings wednesday at the acm conference on computer and communications security (ccs), a premier security venue. 
 today, much of the advertising that appears online is specifically tailored to individuals based on their browsing history, location, and a variety of other factors that have been collected by third party advertising networks. 
 this data is collected by tracking cookies, which are sent out by third party ad networks and correlated with unique identifiers like email addresses. these cookies allow advertisers to create extensive profiles of internet users, however as the researchers found, this system can be influenced by bad actors. 
 once an attacker knows a user's email address, they can tap into the information being collected by any third-party advertiser observing a specific user's targeted ad stream. this could allow bad actors insight into to an individual's detailed browsing history, such as online retailers and travel websites. 
 "third party ad networks have no direct relationship with users. thus, if they want to track user activity across devices, they must rely on identity information, such as email addresses, given to them from other various websites," said 
 paul pearce , assistant professor in the 
 school of cybersecurity and privacy 
 (scp) at georgia tech. "our work shows the way that information is passed to the ad networks is both insecure and hard to verify. if an attacker knows a victim's email address, they can lie to the ad network pretending to be a user, leading to very real privacy problems." 
 the researchers describe this susceptibility as advertising identity entanglement and it happens when attackers confuse ad networks into correlating the attacker's tracking cookies with a targeted person's email address, looping them into the data being gathered by third parties. as pearce and his colleagues state in their paper, adversaries can also leverage the process to send ads of any kind to their targets. 
 "when i use the internet on my own private device, like a phone or a laptop, i don't expect that anyone who knows my personal email could manipulate what i see," said 
 chris kanich , associate professor at uic. "this attack is particularly disturbing, and i am relieved that i use ad and tracking blockers in my web browsers." 
 to test the scale of this problem, researchers created an artificial users and profile for their experiment, at no time was a real person targeted. by knowing only, the experimental user's email address, the team was able to identify specific items and websites the victim interacted with. 
 along with shopping habits, the test also showed retargeted advertisements can contain sensitive location information. for example, if a victim interacted with some hotel and travel websites, the attacker could then receive retargeted ads for the specific hotel the victim viewed. 
 "an ad network potentially leaking travel plans to anyone with a target's email address is a significant privacy threat and potentially dangerous to people being stalked," said 
 damon mccoy , associate professor at nyu. 
 the researchers indicate that combatting this problem without the support of ad networks is challenging, but ad blockers provide a reasonable initial option to limit exposing a user's private data. mitigation of this threat shouldn't just fall on the users, however. the team also suggests that if third party ad networks encrypted the process of exchanging identity information and ensured the data was verified and correct it would help mitigate the threat. 
 the research was presented at acm ccs'22. the paper, 
 cart-ology: intercepting targeted advertising via ad network identity entanglement , is co-authored by scp ph.d. student 
 changseok oh , kanich, mccoy, and pearce. in accordance with ethical research guidelines, the threat was disclosed to criteo, one of the largest third-party ad networks on the market, as well as yahoo.

-0.9304 STEM new resource for domestic abuse survivors combines ai, cybersecurity, and psychology 
 cybersecurity master's student sneha talwalkar and gtri principal research scientist courtney crooks are working to build the framework of an ai tool with the goal of providing support and protection to domestic abuse survivors. 
 cybersecurity master's student& sneha talwalkar (left)& and& gtri principal research scientist& courtney crooks& (right) are working to bring relief to survivors of domestic abuse by building on developments recently made in cognitive security.& (photos by kevin beasley / college of computing) 
 sep 27, 2023 
 georgia tech researchers are working to create a new software tool powered by artificial intelligence (ai) to address the under-researched area of digital security and domestic abuse. 
 these areas frequently overlap with abusers often using the internet and mobile technology to extend the reach of their abuse. however, the smaller scale of these online attacks has resulted in less attention from security researchers. 
 by building on developments recently made in cognitive security, principal research scientist  courtney crooks  and graduate student  sneha talwalkar  are working to bring relief to survivors of domestic abuse. 
 the impact of domestic abuse, otherwise called intimate partner violence (ipv), on public health is something that crooks has been studying for several years through research and practice in her role as a licensed psychologist and researcher. 
 after seeing how new technology opened new methods of abuse online, crooks realized she could help fill in the gaps in this research space using her experience working with the georgia tech research institute, the  school of cybersecurity and privacy  (scp) at georgia tech, and the  emory university school of medicine . 
 to get what they want, abusers try to change their victim's state of mind through cognitive manipulation and use different tactics to do so. crooks decided to explore ways to help ipv survivors counteract these enhanced technology-enabled cognitive security risks as they progressed through their recovery. 
 the software crooks and talwalkar are working to develop would alert survivors to these potential or observed abuses by leveraging well-known, developmentally appropriate, psychologically based learning strategies. the tool will focus solely on the unique risks faced by ipv survivors. applying human-centered design principles and ethical standards to the ai design will be a top priority for the team. 
 the team is working to develop ai-assisted interventions that are psychologically informed and made specifically to focus on the unique risks faced by survivors. these interventions will be designed to take place alongside traditional methods of support, such as mental health and community resources. 
 "it's important to understand that abusive relationships are complicated. while some people can escape them, many can't," said crooks. "or they may physically escape, but resources like their phones, online accounts, or finances may still be vulnerable to their abusers. survivors may also need to continue to communicate with their abuser, like in instances in which they share children." 
 regardless of circumstances, it is often difficult for survivors to stop communicating with their abusers once they escape the relationship. this inability to disconnect is because of the psychological connections reinforced while they were with their former partner. 
 the ai technologies crooks and talwalkar propose will not act like a chatgpt chatbot. instead, it will act like a coach, learning from abusive behavior tactics and potential survivor responses. 
 the tool will then make suggestions based on each user's specific recovery progress and goals while factoring in potential risks. to improve its coaching performance and general knowledge base, the ai will continue to learn from the outcome of each incident survivors face. 
 "the model provides the necessary intervention to assist in the recovery of an ipv survivor," said talwalkar. "we want to use artificial intelligence for good, and this project is a step in that direction." 
 the classes in the scp master's program played a pivotal role in shaping talwalkar's research in this area. while exploring internet censorship and language models, she recognized the emerging challenges posed by ai in security. after an insightful conversation with scp professor peter swire, talwalkar gained the confidence to shift her focus towards investigating malicious intent in immersive environments. with crooks' guidance, she began exploring the socio-technical environment of ipv. 
 designing user-centered artificial intelligence to assist in recovery from domestic abuse  was accepted as an extended abstract and presented to the 2023 world congress computer science, computer engineering, and applied computing event this summer. proceedings of the ieee is publishing the work in an upcoming issue. 
 in may, crooks, talwalkar, and others from their research team presented their findings at the health sciences research day hosted on the emory university campus by the emory school of medicine. crooks presented her study of the lived experience of coercive control in domestic abuse, from which this current research is derived, at the february 2023 national meeting of the american psychoanalytic association. 
 october is  national domestic violence awareness month  and national  cybersecurity awareness month . for more information about domestic abuse and resources to help, please visit the  centers for disease control and prevention website .

 magnus egerstedt peers in at his creation: the robotarium. 
 aug 16, 2017 
 - atlanta, ga 
 buliding and maintaining robots, let alone at entire robotics lab, is unaffordable or impractical for many researchers around the world. that's why georgia tech is opening a new lab that allows greater access to everyone. 
 the robotarium , a $2.5 million lab funded by the national science foundation (nsf) and office of naval research, contains nearly 100 rolling and flying swarm robots. researchers can write their own computer programs, upload them, then get the results as the georgia tech machines carry out the commands. they also receive video evidence and data of the experiment. 
 the project is a vision of magnus egerstedt, the julian t. hightower chair in systems and controls and a professor in the school of electrical and computer engineering. the road to this month's ribbon cutting was filled with 
 technological problem-solving, a few near disasters and k-12 theft .

-0.9578 liberal arts new study reveals racial, ethnic disparities in use of increasingly popular prostate cancer test 
 the study found that black men were at least 23.6% less likely than their white counterparts to receive an mri exam following an elevated prostate-specific antigen blood test. 
 nov 08, 2021 
 - atlanta, ga 
 black, hispanic, and asian men whose results on a common prostate cancer screening test indicated a need for additional testing were less likely than their white counterparts to receive an increasingly used follow-up test that can eliminate the need for an invasive biopsy, according to researchers in the 
 health economics and analytics lab 
 (heal) at georgia tech's school of economics. 
 their 
 study , published nov. 8, 2021, in 
 jama network open, 
 found that black men were at least 23.6% less likely than their white counterparts to receive an mri exam following a prostate-specific antigen (psa) blood test, a common initial screening for men between the ages of 55 and 69. the study also found that hispanic and asian men with elevated psa results were significantly less likely to be referred for mri evaluation. 
 while biopsies have long been the next treatment step for some men with elevated psa results, prostate mris are increasingly being used to reduce the need for that invasive procedure. 
 while the reason for the disparities is beyond the scope of the paper, the results are nevertheless concerning, particularly in light of previous research that has shown disparities in how physicians treat patients of color when compared to their white patients, said 
 danny hughes , professor in the ivan allen college of liberal arts 
 school of economics . 
 "we can't say definitively if the reason black, hispanic, and asian men did not receive this particular test is that physicians did not refer them for it, or if the patients opted themselves out of further testing," hughes said. "regardless, these disparities do highlight the need to understand what is happening and how to ensure patients of all races and ethnicities receive the best possible care." 
 the findings are particularly troubling in light of the 
 elevated risk 
 black men face from prostate cancer - previous studies have found black men are 
 more likely 
 to get prostate cancer, often get the disease earlier in life, and are more likely to die from it. 
 black, asian, hispanic men from 23.6% to 67.6% less likely to receive mris 
 the study was conducted as part of a long-term heal research collaboration between hughes and dr. richard duszak, a professor at emory university's school of medicine. former heal postdoctoral researcher nino abashidze, now of the university of wyoming, chad stecher of arizona state university, and dr. andrew b. rosenkrantz of the nyu langone medical center also collaborated on the project. 
 hughes' lab, heal, uses big-data analytics to reveal emerging patterns in healthcare utilization with the aim of benefitting patients and providers. such work is an increasing emphasis in the 
 ivan allen college of liberal arts , of which the 
 school of economics i s a unit. 
 for the study, the authors examined anonymous health insurance claims data covering 50 u.s. states looking for men who took psa blood tests. they identified 794,809 psa tests that had laboratory results available. they then looked for matching records indicating whether or not the men received a follow-on mri based on varying levels of psa identified in each man's blood. higher levels are associated with potential cancer. 
 although medical standards for the use of prostate mris continue to emerge, studies have revealed thresholds that warrant further investigation, and those are the levels the heal study examined. they are 4 ng / ml, historically considered the threshold for recommending prostate biopsy; 2.5 ng / ml, a more recently recognized threshold for the early detection of prostate cancer; and 10 ng / ml, a level that has been associated with higher rates of biopsies and cancer diagnoses. 
 the researchers found that: 
 black patients between the ages of 40 and 54 with a psa above 4 ng / ml were 39.8% less likely to get a prostate mri than white patients. black men between 65 and 74 whose psa results were above 4 ng / ml were 23.6% less likely to get a follow-up mri. those above 10 ng / ml were 43.9% less likely. 
 black men between the ages of 65 and 74 with results above the 4 ng / ml threshold were 23.6% less likely to get an mri when compared to white patients. men in this age group with scores above 10 ng / ml were 43.9% less likely to get the mri exam. 
 asian patients between 55 and 64 with results above 2.5 ng / ml were 57.3 percent less likely to receive a prostate mri as compared to white patients. asian men with scores above 4 ng / ml were 62.9% less likely. 
 hispanic men from 55 to 64 with psa results above 10ng / ml - the level most closely associated with biopsies and cancer diagnoses - were 67.6% less likely to get the mri test. 
 understanding the cause of the disparities 
 hughes and his colleagues are now turning their attention to understanding the cause of the disparities. the data used in the study do not reveal the reasons men did, or did not, receive referrals for mris. 
 it could be that patients who did not get the mris opted out of the tests, including some who may have instead been referred to receive the invasive biopsy test, despite the problems that can be associated with those tests. or, hughes said, the results may be further confirmation of previous studies that have shown significant biases among physicians in how they care for black, hispanic, and asian patients compared to their white patients. 
 previous studies have shown, for instance, that doctors are less likely to discuss treatment options and side effects with black patients when compared to their white counterparts. 
 "we need to understand more about the role of decision-making biases in physicians, as well as other potential factors in the health care system that could account for the disparities we are seeing in this study," hughes said. 
 the study, "racial / ethnic disparities in the use of prostate mri following an elevated prostate-specific antigen test," was published nov. 8, 2021. it is available at http: / / doi.org / 10.1001 / jamanetworkopen.2021.32388.

-0.4767 STEM niaid supports transplant imaging research at georgia tech and emory 
 researchers are exploring non-invasive imaging for the detection of immune rejection. 
 with kidney and liver transplant patients in mind, emory and georgia tech researchers are exploring non-invasive imaging for the detection of immune rejection. with "immunopet," they can see particular types of immune cells infiltrating a transplanted organ. 
 aug 03, 2017 
 - atlanta, ga 
 the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases has awarded emory and georgia tech investigators a $2.4 million, five-year grant to study non-invasive imaging to detect immune rejection of transplanted organs. 
 when transplant recipients see their doctors, they undergo tests to check whether their immune system is damaging their new organs. these are usually blood tests that check for kidney or liver function, at least to begin with. but to diagnose immune rejection, a biopsy is required. 
 andrew adams, md, phd, assistant professor of surgery at emory university school of medicine, and phil santangelo, phd, associate professor in the wallace h. coulter department of biomedical engineering at georgia tech and emory, are proposing to use pet (positron emission tomography) instead. 
 pet is already used to diagnose heart disease and monitor cancer. using a variant called "immunopet," the researchers can see particular types of immune cells infiltrating the transplanted organ. the grant is for work with mice and non-human primates, but adams envisions benefits for transplant medicine: earlier detection of rejection and reduction of risk associated with biopsies. 
 "patients often require multiple biopsies to assess response to treatment, thus putting them at risk of complications each time they undergo a separate procedure," adams says. "in addition, a biopsy only samples a small part of the transplanted organ." 
 santangelo, in collaboration with tab ansari, phd at emory, francois villinger, dvm / phd at the univerity of louisiana at lafayette and researchers from the nih, has used a similar approach to study the persistence of siv infection in non-human primates, which could guide efforts to suppress hiv infection for long periods without antiretroviral drugs. the research also builds upon work by adams on improved post-transplant drug regimens. 
 "immunopet clearly has the potential to characterize immune cell dynamics in the face of allograft rejection.  this work could also open the door to the use of pet in fields such as cancer immunotherapy," santangelo says. written by quinn eastman, emory university

-0.9865 STEM once overlooked, uninitialized-use ‘bugs' may provide portal for hacker attacks 
 new georgia tech research has determined that simple memory errors in linux can be reliably exploited by hackers. 
 mar 01, 2017 
 - atlanta, ga 
 popular with programmers the world over for its stability, flexibility and security, linux now appears to be vulnerable to hackers. 
 according to new georgia institute of technology research, uninitialized variables ­- largely overlooked bugs mostly regarded as insignificant memory errors - are actually a critical attack vector that can be reliably exploited by hackers to launch privilege escalation attacks in the linux kernel. 
 when successful, these intrusions give attackers increasing levels of access to a network's resources. 
 "while other kernel bugs and vulnerabilities have been examined and remedied, uninitialized-use bugs are not well studied, and to date, no practical defense mechanisms have been developed to protect against these attacks," said georgia tech ph.d. student 
 kangjie lu , lead researcher on the project. 
 in fact, despite potentially dangerous consequences, uninitialized-use bugs are seldom even classified as security vulnerabilities. 
 to prove that these bugs do present a security risk, researchers developed a novel approach, known as targeted stack spraying, to attack the operating system (os) kernel. 
 along with a technique that occupies large portions of the memory to control the stack, the automated attack probes the stack to find weaknesses that user-mode programs can exploit to direct kernel code paths and leave attacker-controlled data on the kernel stack. ultimately, the goal of this attack is to reliably control the value of a specific uninitialized variable in the kernel space of a running program. 
 the research findings confirm that hackers using this method can automatically prepare a malicious pointer in the uninitialized variable. when the malicious pointer is used, a privilege escalation attack targeting the linux kernel may occur. 
 "our research shows that utilizing the targeted stack-spraying approach allows attackers to reliably control more than 91 percent of the linux kernel stack, which, in combination with uninitialized-use vulnerabilities, suffices for a privilege escalation attack," said lu. 
 not content to merely identify the vulnerability, lu and his fellow researchers also developed a potential solution to the problem. 
 "our mitigation approach leverages the fact that uninitialized-use attacks usually control an uninitialized pointer to achieve arbitrary read / write / execution," explained lu. "by zero-initializing pointer-type fields that the compiler cannot prove are properly initialized before they are used, we can prevent an adversary from controlling these pointers." 
 to limit any unnecessary performance overhead related to zero-initializing pointer-type fields, the team developed an intra-procedural program analysis that checks whether a pointer field is properly initialized when it is used. only uninitialized pointer fields require zero initialization. 
 a paper titled 
 unleashing use-before-initialization vulnerabilities in the linux kernel using targeted stack spraying 
 is being presented this week at the 
 network and distributed system security symposium 
 being held in san diego, calif.

 a new decision support tool could help clinicians choose the right chemotherapy drugs.

 the selection of a first-line chemotherapy drug to treat many types of cancer is often a clear-cut decision governed by standard-of-care protocols, but what drug should be used next if the first one fails? 
 that's where georgia institute of technology researchers believe their new open source decision support tool could come in. using machine learning to analyze rna expression tied to information about patient outcomes with specific drugs, the open source tool could help clinicians chose the chemotherapy drug most likely to attack the disease in individual patients. 
 in a study using rna analysis data from 152 patient records, the system predicted the chemotherapy drug that had provided the best outcome 80 percent of the time. the researchers believe the system's accuracy could further improve with inclusion of additional patient records along with information such as family history and demographics. 
 "by looking at rna expression in tumors, we believe we can predict with high accuracy which patients are likely to respond to a particular drug," said 
 john mcdonald , a professor in the georgia tech 
 school of biological sciences 
 and director of its 
 integrated cancer research center . "this information could be used, along with other factors, to support the decisions clinicians must make regarding chemotherapy treatment." 
 the research, which could add another component to precision medicine for cancer treatment, was reported november 6 in the journal 
 scientific reports . the work was supported in part by the atlanta-based ovarian cancer institute, the georgia research alliance, and a national institutes of health fellowship. 
 as with other machine learning decision support tools, the researchers first "trained" their system using one part of a data set, then tested its operation on the remaining records. in developing the system, the researchers obtained records of rna from tumors, along with with the outcome of treatment with specific drugs. with only about 152 such records available, they first used data from 114 records to train the system. they then used the remaining 38 records to test the system's ability to predict, based on the rna sequence, which chemotherapy drugs would have been the most likely to be useful in shrinking tumors. 
 the research began with ovarian cancer, but to expand the data set, the research team decided to include data from other cancer types - lung, breast, liver and pancreatic cancers - that use the same chemotherapy drugs and for which the rna data was available. "our model is predicting based on the drug and looking across all the patients who were treated with that drug regardless of cancer type," mcdonald said. 
 the system produces a chart comparing the likelihood that each drug will have an effect on a patient's specific cancer. if the system were to be used in a clinical setting, mcdonald believes doctors would use the predictions along with other critical patient information. 
 because it measures the expression levels for genes, analysis of rna could have an advantage over sequencing of dna, though both types of information could be useful in choosing a drug therapy, he said. the cost of rna analysis is declining and could soon cost less than a mammogram, mcdonald said. 
 the system will be made available as open source software, and mcdonald's team hopes hospitals and cancer centers will try it out. ultimately, the tool's accuracy should improve as more patient data is analyzed by the algorithm. he and his collaborators believe the open source approach offers the best path to moving the algorithm into clinical use. 
 "to really get this into clinical practice, we think we've got to open it up so that other people can try it, modify if they want to, and demonstrate its value in real-world situations," mcdonald said. "we are trying to create a different paradigm for cancer therapy using the kind of open source strategy used in internet technology." 
 open source coding allows many experts across multiple fields to review the software, identify faults and recommend improvements, said 
 fredrik vannberg , an assistant professor in the georgia tech 
 school of biological sciences . "most importantly, that means the software is no longer a black box where you can't see inside. the code is openly shared for anybody to improve and check for potential issues." 
 vannberg envisions using the decision-support tool to create "virtual tumor boards" that would bring together broad expertise to examine rna data from patients worldwide. 
 "the hope would be to provide this kind of analysis for any new cancer patient who has this kind of rna analysis done," he added. "we could have a consensus of dozens of the smartest people in oncology and make them available for each patient's unique situation." 
 the tool is available on the open source github repository for download and use. hospitals and cancer clinics may install the software and use it without sharing their results, but the researchers hope organizations using the software will help the system improve. 
 "the accuracy of machine learning will improve not only as the amount of training data increases, but also as the diversity within that data increases," said evan clayton, a ph.d. student in the georgia tech school of biological sciences. "there's potential for improvement by including dna data, demographic information and patient histories. the model will incorporate any information if it helps predict the success of specific drugs." 
 in addition to those already mentioned, the research team included cai huang, lilya matyunina, and deette mcdonald from the georgia tech school of biological sciences, and benedict benigno from the georgia tech integrated cancer research center and the ovarian cancer institute. 
 support for the project came from the ovarian cancer institute, and equipment used was provided by the georgia research alliance. in addition, the national institutes of health supported a graduate fellowship.

-0.9965 STEM ovarian cancer cells are more aggressive on soft tissues 
 a new study has found that ovarian cancer cells are more aggressive on soft tissues due to the mechanical properties of this environment. 
 professor michelle dawson and graduate student daniel mcgrail used traction force microscopy to measure the forces exerted by cancer cells on soft and stiff surfaces. rob felt, georgia institute of technology

 - atlanta, ga 
 when ovarian cancer spreads from the ovaries it almost always does so to a layer of fatty tissue that lines the gut. a new study has found that ovarian cancer cells are more aggressive on these soft tissues due to the mechanical properties of this environment. the finding is contrary to what is seen with other malignant cancer cells that seem to prefer stiffer tissues. 
 "what we found is that there are some cancer cells that respond to softness as opposed to stiffness," said 
 michelle dawson , an assistant professor in the school of chemical and biomolecular engineering at the georgia institute of technology. "ovarian cancer cells that are highly metastatic respond to soft environments by becoming more aggressive." ovarian cancer cells spread, or metastasize, by a different method than other cancer cells. breast cancer cells, for example, break off from a solid tumor and flow through the blood until they arrest in small blood vessels. the cancer cells then penetrate the vessel surface to form a tumor. because ovarian tumors are in the abdomen, these cancer cells are shed into the surrounding fluid and not distributed through the blood. they must be able to adhere directly to the fatty tissue that lines the gut, called the omentum, to begin forming a tumor. the new study discovered details about how ovarian cancer cells seem to prefer the mechanical properties of this soft tissue. the study was published in a recent advance online edition of the 
 journal of cell science 
 and was sponsored by the national science foundation and the georgia tech and emory center for regenerative medicine. 
 the research team, led by daniel mcgrail, a graduate student in the dawson lab, found that ovarian cancer cells in vitro were more adherent to a layer of soft fat cells than a layer of stiffer bone cells, and that this behavior was also repeated using gels of similar rigidities. 
 "all the behaviors that we associate with breast cancer cells on these more rigid environments are flipped for ovarian cancer cells," dawson said. after adhering to these soft surfaces, metastatic ovarian cancer cells became more aggressive. their proliferation increased and they were less responsive to chemotherapeutics. the ovarian cancer cells were also more motile on soft surfaces, moving nearly twice as fast as on rigid surfaces. the team also found that less aggressive cells that do not metastasize do not exhibit any of these changes. 
 the researchers used techniques that haven't been traditionally used in the study of ovarian cancer. they measured the force exerted by the cells by tracking the displacement of beads in the environment around the cells. the researchers found that the metastatic cells increased their traction forces - used to generate motion - by three-fold on soft surfaces, but no such change was present in the less aggressive cells. 
 "we think the behavior that metastatic ovarian cancer cells exert on these soft surfaces is representative of the mechanical tropism that they have for these softer tissues in the gut," dawson said. in future work, the researchers will investigate whether ovarian cancer cells have some natural inclination towards this uniquely more aggressive behavior in softer environments. 
 "we're trying to find out whether there is some internal programming that leads to this aggressive behavior," dawson said. this research is supported by the national science foundation under award number 1032527, and the georgia tech and emory center for regenerative medicine under award number 1411304. any conclusions or opinions are those of the authors and do not necessarily represent the official views of the sponsoring agencies. citation : daniel j. mcgrail, et al., "the malignancy of metastatic ovarian cancer cells is increased on soft matrices through a mechanosensitive rho-rock pathway."

-0.9987 STEM personalized medicine best way to treat cancer, study argues 
 a new study found evidence that assessing the route to cancer on a case-by-case basis might make more sense than basing a patient's cancer treatment on commonly disrupted genes and pathways.

 if a driver is traveling to new york city, i-95 might be their route of choice. but they could also take i-78, i-87 or any number of alternate routes. most cancers begin similarly, with many possible routes to the same disease. a new study found evidence that assessing the route to cancer on a case-by-case basis might make more sense than basing a patient's cancer treatment on commonly disrupted genes and pathways.  the study found little or no overlap in the most prominent genetic malfunction associated with each individual patient's disease compared to malfunctions shared among the group of cancer patients as a whole. 
 "this paper argues for the importance of personalized medicine, where we treat each person by looking for the etiology of the disease in patients individually," said 
 john mcdonald , a professor in the school of biology at the georgia institute of technology in atlanta. "the findings have ramifications on how we might best optimize cancer treatments as we enter the era of targeted gene therapy." the research was published february 11 online in the journal 
 pancreas 
 and was funded by the georgia tech foundation and the st. joseph's mercy foundation. in the study, researchers collected cancer and normal tissue samples from four patients with pancreatic cancer and also analyzed data from eight other pancreatic cancer patients that had been previously reported in the scientific literature by a separate research group. 
 mcdonald's team compiled a list of the most aberrantly expressed genes in the cancer tissues isolated from these patients relative to adjacent normal pancreatic tissue. 
 the study found that collectively 287 genes displayed significant differences in expression in the cancers vs normal tissues. twenty-two cellular pathways were enriched in cancer samples, with more than half related to the body's immune response. the researchers ran statistical analyses to determine if the genes most significantly abnormally expressed on an individual patient basis were the same as those identified as most abnormally expressed across the entire group of patients. 
 the researchers found that the molecular profile of each individual cancer patient was unique in terms of the most significantly disrupted genes and pathways. 
 "if you're dealing with a disease like cancer that can be arrived at by multiple pathways, it makes sense that you're not going to find that each patient has taken the same path," mcdonald said. 
 although the researchers found that some genes that were commonly disrupted in all or most of the patients examined, these genes were not among the most significantly disrupted in any individual patient. 
 "by and large, there appears to be a lot of individuality in terms of the molecular basis of pancreatic cancer," said mcdonald, who also serves as the director of the integrated cancer research center and as the chief scientific officer of the ovarian cancer institute. though the study is small, it raises questions about the validity of pinpointing the most important gene or pathway underlying a disease by pooling data from multiple patients, mcdonald said. he favors individual profiling as the preferred method for initiating treatment. the cost of a molecular profiling analysis to transcribe the dna sequences of exons - the parts of the genome that carry instructions for proteins - is about $2,000 (exons account for about two percent of a cell's total dna). that's about half the cost of this analysis five years ago, mcdonald said, and a $1,000 molecular profiling analysis might not be far off. 
 "as costs continue to come down, personalized molecular profiling will be carried out on more cancer patients," mcdonald said. yet cost isn't the only limiting factor, mcdonald said. scientists and doctors have to shift their paradigm on how they use molecular profiling to treat cancer. 
 "are you going to believe what you see for one patient or are you going to say, ‘i can't interpret that data until i group it together with 100 other patients and find what's in common among them,'" mcdonald said. "for any given individual patient there may be mutant genes or aberrant expression patterns that are vitally important for that person's cancer that aren't present in other patients' cancers." future work in mcdonald's lab will see if this pattern of individuality is repeated in larger studies and in patients with different cancers. the group is currently working on a genomic profiling analysis of patients with ovarian and lung cancers. 
 "if there are multiple paths, then maybe individual patients are getting cancer from alternative routes," mcdonald said. "if that's the case, we should do personalized profiling on each patient before we make judgments on the treatment for that patient." loukia lili, of georgia tech's integrated cancer research center, school of biology, and parker h. petit institute of bioengineering and biosciences, was the study's first author. co-authors included lilya matyunina and deette walker of georgia tech, and george daneker, md, of the cancer treatment centers of america se regional facility in newnan, ga. this research is supported by the georgia tech foundation and the st. joseph's mercy foundation. any conclusions or opinions are those of the authors and do not necessarily represent the official views of the sponsoring agencies. citation : loukia n. lili, et al., "evidence for the importance of personalized molecular profiling in pancreatic cancer," ( pancreas , february 2014).

-0.9829 liberal arts poor and disadvantaged people sit in the dark longer after a storm outage 
 the research shows that people in lower socioeconomic tiers wait nearly three hours longer on average for their power to be restored. 
 dec 14, 2023 
 hurricanes and other extreme weather events often affect disadvantaged communities more severely, and extended power outages are some of the most harmful effects. concerns over the intensification of hurricanes has led to new environmental justice policies that aim to mitigate the unequal impacts of major storms. now, policy experts and engineers are directing their attention toward illuminating the causes. 
 researchers at the georgia institute of technology sought to investigate whether socioeconomically vulnerable households experienced longer power outage durations after extreme weather events. the team analyzed data from the top eight major atlantic hurricanes between 2017 and 2020 that knocked out power for over 15 million customers in nine states across the southeastern u.s. the team found that people in lower socioeconomic tiers wait significantly longer to have power restored after a major storm - nearly three hours longer on average. 
 the interdisciplinary research team consists of 
 chuanyi ji , an associate professor in the 
 school of electrical and computer engineering ; scott ganz, a policy researcher at georgetown university and a former georgia tech faculty member; and chenghao duan, a ph.d. student in ji's lab. 
 their research paper, titled " socioeconomic vulnerability and differential impact of severe weather-induced power outages ," was published in the journal 
 pnas nexus . 
 "not only do extreme weather events impact disadvantaged communities more harshly, but power disruption can be dangerous and even life-threatening in certain contexts," ji said.  "those with fewer resources are limited in their ability to evacuate from severe weather situations, and for individuals with electric medical equipment, an extended power outage can be disastrous." 
 ji, who specializes in large-scale data analytics for power grid resilience, has done previous work on power restoration procedures involving infrastructure and utility services, but wanted to expand the work into the realm of communities. the team hypothesized that disadvantaged communities likely wait longer for power to be restored, but to get a realistic picture of the mechanisms at play, the team needed to analyze troves of data. 
 they obtained weather data for eight major hurricanes between 2017 and 2020 from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration and additional flood databases. they also examined power failure data for 15 million customers for the same time period, which spanned nine states, 588 counties, and 108 utility service regions in the southeast. 
 the team used spatial data analytics to model weather impact across regions. they then measured customers' socioeconomic status by using the social vulnerability index, a tool produced by the centers for disease control that considers indicators related to poverty, housing costs, education, health insurance, and other factors to determine socioeconomic status. duan and ji designed the models and estimates, and then analyzed the results to reveal the underlying relationship between customers' socioeconomic status and their power outage durations. 
 their results show that, when comparing affluent communities and poor communities given the same kind of impact from weather events, poor communities experienced power outages that average 170 minutes longer. specifically, they found that a one-decile drop in socioeconomic status is associated with a 6.1% longer outage duration. their results indicate that there is a statistically significant relationship between socioeconomic vulnerability and the duration of time that elapses before power is restored. 
 "our study also tries to rule out some possible explanations for why socioeconomically disadvantaged people take longer to get their power back on," ganz said. "for example, our study controls for population density in a county and the peak number of outages in that county, and we still observe that socioeconomically disadvantaged communities experience longer outages." 
 he theorized that the "primary cause is that poorer communities are also likely to be more distant from critical infrastructure or require more significant repairs to power lines, but these are important questions for future research." 
 the results can have important implications for policymakers, pointing to the necessity of reexamining post-storm recovery and resource allocation policies. service and utility providers approach power recovery by adhering to procedures and regulations that are policy-driven. current research shows that the standard procedures for restoring power following big storms, while procedurally fair, may contribute to unequal outcomes. a greater focus on communities could help to correct the issue. 
 "power grid resilience is not just about the infrastructure and utility companies - it's also about the people they serve," ji said. "success in achieving policy goals depends on our ability to identify the features that contribute most to these unequal impacts, which can in turn help us design appropriate interventions to improve outcomes."

-0.7193 STEM portable uv disinfection chambers could help address ppe shortage 
 portable disinfection chambers that use ultraviolet (uv) light to inactivate virus particles could allow ppe to be quickly disinfected. 
 the portable uv disinfection chamber was designed to accommodate at least one face shield, along with multiple face masks. mercury vapor tubes on both sides provide ultraviolet light to disinfect the ppe. (credit: robert harris) 
 aug 10, 2020 
 - atlanta, ga 
 portable disinfection chambers that use ultraviolet (uv) light to inactivate virus particles could allow emergency medical technicians, police officers, healthcare workers, pharmacy technicians, and others to quickly disinfect their personal protective equipment (ppe) as they need it. 
 researchers at the 
 georgia tech research institute 
 (gtri) have built two prototype chambers to evaluate ppe disinfection using different sources of uv-c light: mercury vapor lamps and light-emitting diodes (leds). they used the prototypes to evaluate different power levels and disinfection times with a variety of face shields and face masks used to protect workers from the coronavirus. 
 "there are tradeoffs in terms of cost, lifetime, and potential heat generated," said t. robert harris, a gtri research engineer. "we wanted to evaluate these issues so that when others use uv-c for disinfecting ppe, they will have information to make good choices." 
 the goal was to provide disinfection chambers as small as possible to allow portability. the chambers were built to accommodate face masks and at least one face shield - a curved sheet of clear plastic that covers the entire face and protects against large droplets that could contain coronavirus. the portability of the chambers could allow them to be used anywhere ppe disinfection is needed. 
 "we wanted a box that would fit on an ambulance or in a police car so that public service staff who are coming into contact with a lot of people on a regular basis would be able to disinfect their ppe," harris said. "this method offers an advantage over chemical disinfection because it doesn't require drying time or risk of chemical absorption." 
 originally, the project aimed at disinfecting ppe while it was being worn by having healthcare workers walk past an ultraviolet source while going from one hospital room to another. that idea was dropped because the wavelengths needed to inactivate the virus - 280 nanometers - can cause skin and eye damage in humans. 
 for that reason, the prototype portable disinfection chambers include a safety interlock to prevent the door from being opened while the uv light is on. disinfection takes about eight minutes, depending on the intensity of uv emissions, which vary by the lighting source. the chambers are designed to be cleaned between uses. 
 "healthcare workers would put their face masks and face shields into the box, close the lid, and set the timer," harris explained. "they would swap out one set of ppe while the other set was being disinfected." 
 ultraviolet light can damage plastic items, but harris and his colleagues didn't attempt to evaluate how many disinfection cycles the ppe could withstand. "you would expect uv to ultimately degrade ppe materials in the same way that sunlight slowly degrades polymer materials," he said. 
 the research team designed the chambers to provide the level of uv exposure that earlier studies had shown would inactivate the closely related sars-cov virus by damaging its outer shell and rna. the researchers did not attempt to evaluate the ability of the uv light to inactivate the sars-cov-2 virus that causes covid-19. 
 other engineering considerations included the need for cooling the uv sources, providing consistent exposure of the ppe to uv light using reflective walls in the chambers, and protecting the mercury vapor lamps from damage during use. 
 ultraviolet light is now used in water and wastewater sanitation, food disinfection, killing pathogens in hvac systems, and other purposes. because of the growing number of applications, finding enough mercury vapor lamps and led sources was a challenge for the research program, which was funded by gtri's independent research and development program. 
 harris hopes the project will encourage others to further develop uv-based portable disinfection systems to supplement other methods for protecting people who encounter the coronavirus. 
 "this work is part of a realization that multiple tools - including handwashing, surface disinfection, face masks, uv disinfection, social distancing, and other steps - are important and much more powerful when done together," he said. "we should all use every tool we have at our disposal to combat this virus and really think about things carefully to break every link in the chain of contagious transmission." 
 beyond harris, the research team included roger campbell, ashton hattori, eric brown, christopher hollis, max schureck, howard atchley, john stone, michael grady, and benjamin yang.

-0.9977 STEM predictive model could help guide choices for breast cancer therapies 
 a new technique could give women and their oncologists more personalized information for choosing breast cancer treatment options.

 biomedical engineers have demonstrated a proof-of-principle technique that could give women and their oncologists more personalized information to help them choose options for treating breast cancer. thanks to diagnostic tests, clinicians and patients can already know the type of breast cancer they're up against, but one big question remains: how likely is it that the cancer will invade other parts of the body? answering that question could help guide the choice of treatment options, from aggressive and difficult therapies to more conservative ones. by studying chemical signals from specific cells that are involved in helping cancer invade other tissues in each woman's body, researchers have developed a predictive model that could provide an invasiveness index for each patient. "we want women to have more information to make a personal decision beyond the averages calculated for an entire population," said 
 manu platt , an associate professor in the 
 department of biomedical engineering at georgia tech and emory university . "we are using our systems biology tools and predictive medicine approaches to look at potential markers we could use to help us understand the risk each woman has. this would provide information for a more educated discussion of treatment options." the research, sponsored with funds from the georgia research alliance and the giglio family donation to the department of biomedical engineering, was reported september 9 in the journal scientific reports. beyond breast cancer, the technique could offer similar decision-making assistance for men with prostate cancer, where treatment also requires making difficult choices about the risk of metastasis. platt's research team is examining chemical signals produced by the macrophages that can help aggressive tumors invade new tissues. macrophages normally clean up foreign particles and harmful microorganisms in the body, but aggressive tumors can enlist macrophages in helping them metastasize. tumor associated macrophages contribute significantly to tumor invasion, with cysteine cathepsin proteases - enzymes that break down proteins in the body - important contributors. to develop their predictive index, platt's research team used variability in macrophage expression of four types of cathepsin, the cathepsin inhibitor cystatin c, and kinase activation levels. the model, which has been under development for two years, was produced by studying macrophages from a population of women who didn't have breast cancer. platt and colleagues keon-young park and gande li co-cultured a standard breast cancer cell line (mcf-7) with macrophages produced from monocytes donated by these cancer-free women. next, they measured the level of invasiveness facilitated by macrophages from each individual donor, exposing the cancer cells and macrophages to a collagen gel designed to simulate breast tissue and measuring how many cells invaded it. while the breast is composed of many other tissues, collagen makes up the largest proportion and provided a good measure of how aggressively the cells would invade, platt said. platt's team correlated the level of invasion through the gel to the chemical signals being expressed by the macrophages. the researchers were surprised at the large amount of patient-to-patient variability in macrophage activity - variability that could account for the outcome differences in the patients receiving similar cancer treatments. the signaling levels and related invasion measurements were used to train a computational model developed by platt's team. the researchers next obtained blood samples containing monocytes from nine patients being treated for breast cancer at dekalb medical center, a major atlanta-area hospital. they measured signals from these macrophages and used their model - which had been trained on macrophage signaling and resulting invasiveness - to predict which of the cancer patients would be expected to have more invasive types of cancer. they compared their predications to what the clinician - dr. john kennedy - provided as their initial diagnosis. "based on the cells we got from the clinic, the ones that had been predicted to have the greatest potential for invasion were the ones that had produced the most invasive form of breast cancer in the patients," platt said. while the study could not account for possible differences in the length of time the cancers had been growing, they did correlate well with observations. in future research, platt hopes to follow the women for five years to determine if the model's predictions are related to cancer recurrence. he also plans to expand the model with additional macrophage data, and test it against additional blood samples. "the more information you give the model, the closer you get to the prediction," he said. "we think this is a very big start." the strength of this technique, platt believes, is that it measures what's happening at the level where cancer is metastasizing. "we are measuring at the level of activity of these intracellular enzymes and the ultimate activity of the proteases they produce that are not only the biomarkers of the tumor, but also help the tumor grow," he said. "everything about us is different. our genetics are different and our lifestyles are different, so clinicians have to make decisions in all that variability. all of those differences can be measured and captured in this output." platt believes the technique could one day lead to a simple blood test that would provide information useful in making therapy recommendations. the test might also help determine which women should be monitored more closely to detect the beginnings of a cancer. "together, this establishes proof-of-principle that personalized information acquired from minimally invasive blood draws may provide useful information to inform oncologists and patients of invasive / metastatic risk, helping to make decisions regard radical mastectomy or milder, conservative treatments to save patients from hardship and surgical recovery," he wrote in the paper. citation : keon-young park, gande li and manu o. platt, "monocyte-derived macrophage assisted breasat cancer cell invasion as a personalized, predictive metric to score metastatic risk," (scientific reports 2015).

-0.9986 STEM punching cancer with rna knuckles 
 eye-popping reduction of tumors achieved with help of sirna inside targeted delivery gel.

 - atlanta, ga 
 in the fight against cancer, doctors dish out combination-blows of surgery, chemotherapy and other drugs to beat back a merciless foe. now, scientists have taken early steps toward adding a stinging punch to clinicians' repertoire. 
 with a novel targeted therapy researchers at the georgia institute of technology have purged ovarian tumors in limited,  in vivo  tests in mice. "the dramatic effect we see is the massive reduction or complete eradication of the tumor, when the ‘nanohydrogel' treatment is given in combination with existing chemotherapy," said chief researcher john mcdonald. 
 that nanohydrogel, a type of nanoparticle, is a minute gel pellet that honed in on malignant cells with a payload of an rna strand. the rna entered the cell, where it knocked down a protein gone awry that is involved in many forms of cancer. 
 in trials on mice, it put the brakes on ovarian cancer growth and broke down resistance to chemotherapy. that allowed a common chemotherapy drug, cisplatin, to drastically reduce or eliminate large carcinomas, with very similar speed and manner. the successful results treating four mice with the combination of sirna and cisplatin showed little variance. 
 chink in the armor 
 the therapeutic short interfering rna (sirna) developed by mcdonald and georgia tech researchers minati satpathy and roman mezencev, thwarted cancer-causing overproduction of cell structures called epidermal growth factor receptors (egfrs), which extend out of the wall of certain cell types. egfr overproduction is associated with aggressive cancers. 
 the researchers from  georgia tech's school of biological sciences  published their results on monday, november 7, 2016,  in the journal 
 scientific reports . research was funded by the national institutes of health's imat program, the ovarian cancer institute, the deborah nash endowment fund, the curci foundation and the markel foundation. 
 the new treatment has not been tested on humans, and research  would be required by science and by law  to demonstrate consistent results - efficacy - among other things, before preliminary human trials could become possible. 
 the current  in vivo  success strengthens the idea that knocking out egfr at the rna level may be a worthy goal to explore in the fight against  carcinomas  in general. the same 
 patented nanohydrogel packed with other types of therapeutic rna is currently being tested 
 for the treatment of other types cancers. 
 helper turned killer 
 egfrs are receptors found in epithelial cells, which line organs throughout the body: lungs, mouth, throat, intestines and others. in women, it also lines reproductive organs: ovaries, uterus and cervix. 
 they are long proteins that poke through the cell membrane, connecting the cell's interior with the outside. they look like squiggly worms with tiny mouths on the outside that take up a  messenger protein . 
 in a healthy cell, those messenger molecules cause egfrs to trigger long chains of biochemical reactions that lead to the activation of genes involved in a variety of cellular functions. in carcinoma cells, the number of egfrs present typically skyrockets. 
 "in many cancers, egfr is overexpressed," said mcdonald, who 
 heads georgia tech's integrated cancer research center . "the problem is that because of this overexpression, many cellular functions, including cell replication and resistance to certain chemotherapy drugs, are dramatically cranked up." 
 the cell goes haywire, metabolizes too much sugar, divides too much, and resists chemotherapy. the cancer grows into a tumor and can spread through the body. 
 an overabundance of egfrs found in a biopsy is usually a sign that cancer patient prognosis is poor. "in 70 percent of ovarian cancer patients, egfr is overexpressed at very high levels," mcdonald said. 
 cell suicide: apoptosis 
 egfr overexpression also makes cancer cells resistant to chemotherapy by thwarting a natural defense mechanism. 
 "the platinum-based chemotherapies used to treat ovarian cancers cause dna damage, which switches on apoptosis," mcdonald said. apoptosis is cell suicide. when cells can't repair dna damage, they're programmed to kill themselves to keep the damaged cells from spreading. 
 the primary chemotherapy used to treat ovarian cancer works by coaxing cancer cells to trigger the suicide program, but having too many epidermal growth factor receptors gets in the way. 
 "egfr overexpression hinders apoptosis; they won't die. by knocking down egfr, we make the cell hypersensitive to the drug. apoptosis is reactivated," mcdonald said. 
 existing egfr targeted drugs called tyrosine-kinase inhibitors disrupt an egfr function, but their success in treating ovarian cancer has been limited. "clinicians have tried egfr inhibitors to treat ovarian cancers for some years, and they only get about 20% of patients responding to it," mcdonald said. "apparently, the particular egfr function inhibited by these drugs is not critical to ovarian cancer." 
 guided brass knuckles 
 the short interfering (si) rna designed by the georgia tech researchers attacks the cancer much closer to its root. 
 to make the protein for egfr, rna has to transfer its genetic code from dna. the researchers' sirna binds to the cell's rna and stops it from working. 
 "we're knocking down egfr at the rna level," he said. "since egfr is multi-functional, it's not exactly clear which malfunctions contribute to ovarian cancer growth. by completely knocking out its production in ovarian cancer cells, all egfr functions are blocked." 
 the nanohydrogel that delivers the sirna to the cancer cells is a colloid ball of a common, compact organic molecule and about 98 percent water. another molecule is added to the surface of the nanohydrogel as a guide. it makes the pellets adhere to the cancer cells like sticky cluster bombs. 
 cancerous tissue may also be aiding the nanohydrogel in targeting it. "when you get into a tumor, there are a lot of blood vessels, and many are broken," mcdonald said. "this may help the nanoparticles get passively trapped in the neighborhood of tumorous tissues." 
 in the  in vivo  trials, the sirna, which contained a fluorescent tag, allowed researchers to observe nanoparticles successfully honing in on the cancer cells. fortuitous victory 
 "we originally selected to target the egfr gene because its activity is easily measured, and we wanted to use it simply as an indicator that our nanoparticle sirna delivery system was working," mcdonald said. "the fact that the egfr knockdown so dramatically sensitized the cells to standard chemotherapy came as a bit of a surprise." 
 at first, his team observed how the tumors responded to chemotherapy alone. then they combined it with the nanoparticle treatment. 
 "when we gave the chemotherapy alone, the response was moderate, but with the addition of the nanoparticles, the tumor was either significantly reduced or completely gone," mcdonald said. 
 but he tempered enthusiasm with caution. "further work will be required to see if the treatment completely destroyed every trace of cancer cells in the tumors that disappeared, or if future recurrence is possible." 
 if the researchers' continuing studies further prove to be consistent, the combination of the nanohydrogel with other therapeutic rnas could represent a significant advancement in the treatment of a wide spectrum of cancers.

-0.9594 STEM ransomware threat highlighted during cyber security summit 
 georgia tech experts detail the threat presented by ransomware. 
 sep 29, 2016 
 - atlanta, ga 
 as part of the 14 th 
 annual 
 georgia tech cyber security summit 
 held wednesday, college of computing ph.d. student 
 evan downing , alongside gtri cyber technology and information security lab division chief 
 chris smoak , presented a seminar on ransomware. 
 in a presentation titled, "ransomware: how to respond," the two speakers discussed distinctions between ransomware and typical malware, the goal of those producing ransomware, and how to prevent it and respond to it. 
 ransomware is essentially just malware that holds data for ransom, demanding money in exchange for decrypting critical files. it can affect both individuals and larger networks utilized by entire companies. 
 many individuals opt to pay the ransom, but both smoak and downing recommend the opposite. paying, they said, encourages more of this type of malware and, in addition, the user may not get their files back. 
 "ransomware authors want to give their victims incentive to pay. this is their business model," said downing, who is in his third year pursuing his ph.d. in computer science. 
 "they want to be able to be reliable and trustworthy to decrypt their victims' files so that word will spread to other victims that they should just simply pay the ransom to get their data back. if the ransomware actors did not do this, then they wouldn't be giving their victims any incentive to pay the ransom. the victims would just simply wipe their hard drives, reinstall their operating systems, and continue about their day." 
 downing, a self-described "unrealistic conservative" when it comes to the safety of online networks, said the decision whether to pay or not all comes down to a personal cost-benefit analysis. 
 "you want to decide what you're willing to pay for, literally and figuratively," he said. "what data can your business stand to lose? how quickly can your business recover from losing this data? how much money will an attack cost your company from the lack of the service your company provides? is this all worth the risk of paying the ransom and possibly not getting your data back?" 
 downing warns that regardless of your personal decision, it is never wise to pay the ransom. 
 "either you get your data back and you've aided a criminal financially, encouraging them to continue attacking others, or worse, you don't get your data back at all and you've still financially aided the criminal," downing said. "there's an obvious common denominator here." 
 both smoak and downing recommended a few things to prevent against such an attack in the future. aside from an extreme solution (simply utilizing old, unconnected technology), they advised frequent backups of data and avoiding continual connection of backup volumes, training users on use of email and visiting websites, and classifying data according to its importance (giving backup priority to the most vital information).

-0.9208 STEM reframing antarctica's meltwater pond dangers to ice shelves and sea level 
 there's a speed limit on the damage surface ponds can do to ice shelves, but that doesn't mean the ponds aren't dangerous. 
 before its sudden shattering, numerous meltwater ponds riddled antarctic ice shelf larsen b. they are seen in this 2002 satellite image as a matrix of aquamarine spots. scientists believe that the ponds hydrofractured the kilometer-thick ice shelf, causing its swift destruction. credit: nasa earth observatory 
 oct 29, 2019 
 - atlanta, ga 
 dangers to ancient antarctic ice portend a future of rapidly rising seas, but  a new study  may relieve one nagging fear: that ponds of meltwater fracturing the ice below them could cause protracted chain reactions that unexpectedly collapse floating ice shelves. though pooled meltwater does fracture ice, ensuing chain reactions appear short-ranged. 
 still, massive increases in surface melting due to unusually warm weather can trigger catastrophic ice shelf collapses like that of the  iconic shelf "larsen b," which shattered in 2002 . now, a study led by a researcher at the georgia institute of technology has modeled fracture chain reactions and how much water it would take for a repeat of that rare, epic collapse. 
 larsen b's disintegration was preceded by an atypical heatwave that riddled it with meltwater ponds, focusing researchers' attention on pond fracturing, also called hydrofracturing. they discovered that a melt pond hydrofracturing the ice shelf can prompt neighboring ponds to do the same. concerns grew of possible extensive chain reactions, which the new study addressed. 
 too much meltwater 
 "the chain reactions will not spread that far on the ice shelf," said alex robel,  an assistant professor in georgia tech's school of earth and atmospheric sciences . "normally, it would take many years for the chain reactions to have an effect on the integrity of the ice shelves. but there's a caveat. ponds that are close together and growing rapidly deeper could destroy the ice's integrity." 
 "there is a speed limit in the study that shows that an ice shelf can't collapse ridiculously fast," said co-author alison banwell, a  glaciology researcher at the university of colorado boulder . "however, if it becomes as covered in meltwater ponds very quickly like larsen b was, it can collapse in a similar way." she added, "multiple hydrofracture chains originating in different areas of an ice shelf could also lead to a larger-scale ice shelf breakup." 
 the researchers  published their results in the journal  geophysical research letters  on october 24, 2019. the research was funded by the national science foundation and the cooperative institute for research in environmental sciences at cu boulder. an unrelated,  recent study  reported a record number of meltwater ponds on antarctica. 
 "currently there are not nearly enough ponds on any ice shelf for a repeat of larsen b, but much meltwater is weighing on ice shelves and contributing damage to them," said banwell, who helped pioneer hydrofracture research on ice shelves. 
 q&a 
 broken ice shelves themselves don't add much to sea level. so, why care? 
 ice shelves float in the ocean, where they already contribute to sea level, so when they break up or melt, they don't add much more to it. but many ice shelves push back against glaciers on land that do drive up sea level when they enter the ocean. 
 with the shelf gone, the speed of glacial flow can jump four- to tenfold. glaciologists were not aware of this until larsen b, which was a kilometer (0.62 miles) thick with a surface of 3,250 square km (1,250 square miles), splintered within weeks, and glacial flow behind it surged. 
 "our research field thought ice shelves weren't too important, then larsen b showed us that was incorrect. buttressing by ice shelves really is the thing that stabilizes the glaciers. few issues are more significant than those that this study addresses," said brent minchew, an  assistant professor of geophysics at the massachusetts institute of technology . 
 minchew was not involved in the study but recently co-published another study that relates to it. the mit study rules out one absolutely nightmarish scenario of rapid glacier fracture due to the disappearance of ice shelves. but he and the other researchers reiterated that glacial flow nonetheless speeds up strikingly when ice shelves disappear. 
 also, most antarctic ice shelves probably formed in the last ice age, and it could take another ice age to replace them. 
 [ready for graduate school?  here's how to apply to georgia tech. ] 
 how does hydrofracturing work, and how did the study model its effects? 
 when meltwater ponds on top of cracks in the ice grow heavy, they can hydrofracture the ice. 
 "the water pressure concentrates down to a point called a crack tip. it tries to push the crack apart and make it deeper, and the ice pushes back. when the water gets deep enough, it can win out and propagate the crack to the bottom of the ice shelf," robel said. 
 the water drains down the crack, into the ocean, then the ice hops back up, making new cracks that can trigger neighboring ponds to hydrofracture, too. the study showed that this would encompass only small numbers of ponds. 
 conveniently for robel, who explores ice dynamics with math, physics, and computer science, as ice shelves form, regimented matrices of surface dents appear in them, and that's where the ponds collect. 
 robel could apply computer science modeling called  cellular automata  - known from pixelated matrix-like  video games  - to model hydrofracture chain reactions. the model even outputs animations that the researchers named "minesweeper plots" after the  classic 1990s computer game . 
 does the study mean there is less danger than before of glacial flow accelerating? 
 no, the study simply adds to scientific knowledge, and actually, the flow of some glaciers on antarctica has already sped up a lot. 
 "maybe this mechanism is not something we have to worry as much about. but we shouldn't breathe a sigh of relief because there are plenty of other ways of getting a whole lot of ice out of west antarctica quickly," minchew said. 
 perhaps the greatest potential for glacier loss is instability where glaciers rest on the ground next to seawater. a  study robel published in july  projected that instability to be extremely likely to accelerate sea level rise. 
 how does this study help advance glacier research? 
 it makes it easier to look for harbingers of ice shelf damage. 
 "looking at the volume of water on the surface of the ice is much easier than looking for stress failures within the ice," said banwell, who will visit antarctica in november to study melt ponds on the george iv ice shelf.

-0.8 STEM remote-control shoots laser at nano-gold to turn on cancer-killing immune cells 
 a near-infrared light, similar to that of a tv remote, combines with gold nano-particles to flip a gene switch in t-cells to hyper-activate them inside of tumors.

 a remote command could one day send immune cells on a rampage against a malignant tumor. the ability to mobilize, from outside the body, targeted cancer immunotherapy inside the body has taken a step closer to becoming reality. 
 bioengineers at the georgia institute of technology have installed a heat-sensitive switch into 
 t-cells 
 that can activate the t-cells when heat turns the switch on. the method, tested in mice and 
 published in a new study , is locally targeted and could someday help turn immunotherapy into a precision instrument in the fight against cancer. 
 immunotherapy 
 has made headlines with startling high-profile successes like saving  former u.s. president jimmy carter  from brain cancer. but the treatment, which activates the body's own immune system against cancer and other diseases, 
 has also, unfortunately, proved to be hit-or-miss . 
 "in patients where radiation and traditional chemotherapies have failed, this is where t-cell therapies have shined, but the therapy is still new," said principal investigator gabe kwong. "this study is a step toward making it even more effective." 
 cancer is notoriously wily, and when t-cells crawl into a tumor, the tumor tends to switch off the t-cells' cancer-killing abilities. researchers have been working to switch them back on. 
 laser, gold, and t-cells 
 kwong's remote control has done this in the lab, while also boosting t-cell activity. 
 in 
 the study , kwong's team successfully put their remote-control method through initial tests in mice with implanted tumors (so-called tumor phantoms, specially designed for certain experiments). the remote works via three basic components. 
 first, the researchers modified t-cells, a type of white blood cell, to include a genetic switch that, when switched on, increased the cells' expression of specific proteins by more than 200 times. that ability could be used to guide t-cells' cancer-fighting activities. 
 the t-cells, with the switch off, were introduced into the tumor phantom which was placed into the mice. the tumor phantom also included 
 gold nanorods , just dozens of atoms in size. the researchers shone pulses of a gentle laser in the near-infrared (nir) range from outside the mouse's body onto the spot where the tumor was located. 
 the nanorods receiving the light waves turned them into useful, localized mild heat, allowing the researchers to precisely warm the tumor. the elevated heat turned on the t-cells' engineered switch. 
 hyper-activated t-cells 
 this study honed the method and confirmed that its components worked in living animals. it was not the intention of the study to treat cancer yet, although undertaking that is the next step, which is already on its way. 
 "in upcoming experiments, we are implementing this approach to treat aggressive tumors and establish cancer-fighting effectiveness," said kwong, who is an 
 assistant professor in the wallace h. coulter department of biomedical engineering at georgia tech and emory university . 
 the researchers published their results 
 in the current edition of the journal acs synthetic biology . the study's first author was graduate research assistant ian miller. the research was funded by the national institutes of health, the national science foundation, the burroughs wellcome fund, and the shurl and kay curci foundation. 
 better immunotherapy 
 bioengineers have been able to do a lot with t-cells already when they're outside of the body. 
 "right now, we're adept at harvesting a patient's own t-cells, modifying to target cancer, growing them outside the body until there are hundreds of millions of them," kwong said. "but as soon as we inject them back into a patient, we lose control over the t-cells' activity inside the body." 
 the on-switch changes that. 
 t-cell toxicities 
 having an off-switch is also important. if t-cells were engineered to be always-on and hyper-activated, as they moved through the body, they could damage healthy tissue. 
 "there would be off-target toxicities, so you really want to pinpoint their activation," kwong said. "our long-term goal for them is to activate site-specifically, so t-cells can overcome immunosuppression by the tumor and become better killers there." 
 when the heat remote is turned off, so are kwong's engineered t-cells, because customary body temperatures are not high enough to activate their switch. 
 heat-shock switch 
 the switch is a natural safety mechanism in human cells that has evolved to protect against heat shock and turns on when tissue temperatures rise above the body's normal operating range, which centers on 37 degrees celsius (98.6 f). but the researchers re-fitted t-cells with the switch to make it turn on other functions, and it could be used to hyper-activate the cells. 
 the georgia tech bioengineers found that the switch worked in a range of 40 to 42 degrees celsius (104 - 107.6 f), high enough to not react to the majority of high fevers and low enough to not damage healthy tissue nor the engineered t-cells. 
 "when the local temperature is raised to 45 degrees (113 f), some cells in our body don't like it," kwong said. "but if heating is precisely controlled in a 40 to 42 degrees window with short pulses of the nir light, then it turns on the t-cells' switch, and body cells are still very comfortable." 
 immuno-goals and dreams 
 the researchers want to combine the switch with some additional cancer-fighting weapons they envision engineering into t-cells. 
 for example, secreted molecules called cytokines can boost immune cells' ability to kill cancer, but cytokines, unfortunately, can also be toxic. "our long-term goal is to engineer t-cells to make and release powerful immune system stimulants like cytokines on command locally and sparingly," kwong said. 
 in other studies, 
 gently heated gold nanorods have been shown to kill tumors or hinder metastasis . but t-cell treatments could be even more thorough and, in addition, hopefully, one day give patients treated with them a long-lasting memory immune response to any recurrence of their cancer.

 georgia tech researchers have created a wearable device to accurately measure obstructive sleep apnea - when the body repeatedly stops and restarts breathing for a period - as well as the quality of sleep people get when they are at rest. 
 under conventional methods, people who are suspected of having some sleep issue or disorder must go to a medical facility, where they are monitored overnight and tethered to a series of wired probes that record brain, eye, and muscle activity. 
 the wearable sleep monitor patch developed by a team of researchers and clinicians, led by 
 w. hong yeo , an associate professor and woodruff faculty fellow in tech's 
 george w. woodruff school of mechanical engineering , is made of silicone and fits over the forehead, with a second, smaller silicone attachment that molds to the chin. 
 "a lot of people have this disorder, but they don't know it because it's very hard to diagnose right now," yeo said. "current smartphone apps don't capture the specific data doctors and clinicians study to determine if a patient has apnea, rendering them useless." 
 conventional existing sleep testing is occurring in sleep labs because of device limitations. this at-home wearable device could be the alternative to the more expensive medical procedures at sleep labs. 
 yeo and his team, which included researchers from across georgia tech, emory university school of medicine, the university of texas at austin, the icahn school of medicine at mount sinai in new york, the korea institute of materials science, and the korea advanced institute of science and technology, 
 reported their findings 
 in science advances in may. 
 rising prevalence 
 while there are two additional types of sleep apnea - central and complex - obstructive sleep apnea is the most common, yeo said, explaining that in addition to snoring and arrested breathing episodes, it's generally characterized by waking up suddenly, gasping for air or choking, and high blood pressure. 
 lack of quality sleep can exacerbate other health issues in people with existing illnesses such as heart disease or diabetes, yeo said. but even those who don't have other health ailments can have serious complications from sleep apnea because the longer it goes undetected and untreated, the more it will affect their hearts and brains over time. 
 seeing the toll sleep apnea was taking on the u.s. population, yeo set out to apply his wearable device research to the industry with a wireless sleep monitoring patch system. 
 the patches - which have an accuracy rate of 88.5% for sleep apnea detection - have the thickness of an adhesive bandage. three embedded electronic sensors send signals wirelessly via bluetooth to record brain, eye, and muscle activity. that data is relayed to an app on a smart device such as a phone or tablet for further study and evaluation. 
 the device can be used at home, negating the need to go to a sleep center or medical facility for overnight monitoring. 
 "a lot of people have this type of sleep disorder; they just don't know it," said yeo, whose research is centered primarily in advancing healthcare through the development of biosensors and bioelectronics. "in the u.s., more than 18 million people have this type of sleep apnea. that's basically one out of every 15 americans, and those numbers are increasing over time." 
 underlying health issues are partly behind the increase, he said, but key drivers are the types of food and portion sizes of the modern american diet as well as stress. 
 there's also an economic toll on the country. poor sleep cost the u.s. economy $411 billion in lost productivity in 2015. that figure is projected to exceed $467 billion by 2030. 
 predicting sleep apnea 
 using artificial intelligence and machine learning, the technology behind the wearable device records the data to give a sleep score that determines if the patient has sleep apnea or if they are getting enough quality sleep. 
 in the study, when measured against a controlled group of eight sleep apnea patients whose issues were detected under conventional testing means, yeo's wireless patch detected sleep apnea with an accuracy rate of 88.5%. for comparison, an existing headband device on the market had an accuracy rate of about 71% and cannot measure muscle activities. 
 what's more, the technology yeo and his team developed, and the machine learning algorithms used, can predict the likelihood that a person who doesn't show any symptoms of sleep apnea will develop it at some point. 
 "by looking at the data, we can say that, if you don't change something right now - whether it's diet or sleeping behavior or anything like that - you're likely to develop sleep apnea because your numbers are bad," he said. 
 solving a problem 
 the wireless patch solves a multipronged challenge to conventional testing methodology by addressing current patient issues with comfort, time, access, and cost. 
 the current process - called a psg or polysomnography test - proves uncomfortable for some patients. that's because they must sleep in a fixed position for fear of detaching any one of the 15 wired probes from their skin. having any of those sensors detach from their bodies risks not capturing enough data for proper assessments. 
 it's also time consuming because the patient must go to a sleep center and spend the night being monitored by medical personnel. there can also be a lag to even get tested. patients who don't have severe symptoms or other high-risk, underlying factors such as heart disease or hypertension, often must wait after getting a referral from a doctor to be slotted for a bed at a sleep center, pending availability. finally, the current detection method is costly to patients and insurance systems, tallying roughly $8,000 per person, per night. 
 "so that testing barrier is really high for regular people unless you are already sick, then they will screen you to avoid any severe conditions," yeo said. "but for people who don't show symptoms, you won't know whether you have the sleep disorder until it gets severe. we want to stop sleep apnea before it starts."

-0.9947 STEM researchers hijack cancer migration mechanism to "move" brain tumors 
 researchers are fighting brain cancer by hijacking the mechanism the tumors normally use to spread.

 - atlanta, ga 
 one factor that makes glioblastoma cancers so difficult to treat is that malignant cells from the tumors spread throughout the brain by following nerve fibers and blood vessels to invade new locations. now, researchers have learned to hijack this migratory mechanism, turning it against the cancer by using a film of nanofibers thinner than human hair to lure tumor cells away. instead of invading new areas, the migrating cells latch onto the specially-designed nanofibers and follow them to a location - potentially outside the brain - where they can be captured and killed. using this technique, researchers can partially move tumors from inoperable locations to more accessible ones. though it won't eliminate the cancer, the new technique reduced the size of brain tumors in animal models, suggesting that this form of brain cancer might one day be treated more like a chronic disease. "we have designed a polymer thin film nanofiber that mimics the structure of nerves and blood vessels that brain tumor cells normally use to invade other parts of the brain," explained 
 ravi bellamkonda , lead investigator and chair of the 
 wallace h. coulter department of biomedical engineering at georgia tech and emory university . "the cancer cells normally latch onto these natural structures and ride them like a monorail to other parts of the brain. by providing an attractive alternative fiber, we can efficiently move the tumors along a different path to a destination that we choose." details of the technique were reported february 16 in the journal 
 nature materials . the research was supported by the national cancer institute (nci), part of the national institutes of health; by atlanta-based ian's friends foundation, and by the georgia research alliance. in addition to the coulter department of biomedical engineering, the research team included children's healthcare of atlanta and emory university. treating the glioblastoma multiforme cancer, also known as gbm, is difficult because the aggressive and invasive cancer often develops in parts of the brain where surgeons are reluctant to operate. even if the primary tumor can be removed, however, it has often spread to other locations before being diagnosed. new drugs are being developed to attack gbm, but the atlanta-based researchers decided to take a more engineering approach. anjana jain, who is the first author of this gbm study, is now an assistant professor in the department of biomedical engineering at worcester polytechnic institute in massachusetts. as a georgia tech graduate student, jain worked on biomaterials for spinal cord regeneration. then, as a postdoctoral fellow in the bellamkonda lab, she saw the opportunity to apply her graduate work to develop potential new treatment modalities for gbm. "the signaling pathways we were trying to activate to repair the spinal cord were the same pathways researchers would like to inactivate for glioblastomas," said jain. "moving into cancer applications was a natural progression, one that held great interest because of the human toll of the disease." tumor cells typically invade healthy tissue by secreting enzymes that allow the invasion to take place, she explained. that activity requires a significant amount of energy from the cancer cells. "our idea was to give the tumor cells a path of least resistance, one that resembles the natural structures in the brain, but is attractive because it does not require the cancer cells to expend any more energy," she explained. experimentally, the researchers created fibers made from polycaprolactone (pcl) polymer surrounded by a polyurethane carrier. the fibers, whose surface simulates the contours of nerves and blood vessels that the cancer cells normally follow, were implanted into the brains of rats in which a human gbm tumor was growing. the fibers, just half the diameter of a human hair, served as tumor guides, leading the migrating cells to a "tumor collector" gel containing the drug cyclopamine, which is toxic to cancer cells. for comparison, the researchers also implanted fibers containing no pcl or an untextured pcl film in other rat brains, and left some rats untreated. the tumor collector gel was located physically outside the brain. after 18 days, the researchers found that compared to other rats, tumor sizes were substantially reduced in animals that had received the pcl nanofiber implants near the tumors. tumor cells had moved the entire length of all fibers into the collector gel outside the brain. while eradicating a cancer would always be the ideal treatment, bellamkonda said, the new technique might be able to control the growth of inoperable cancers, allowing patients to live normal lives despite the disease. "if we can provide cancer an escape valve of these fibers, that may provide a way of maintaining slow-growing tumors such that, while they may be inoperable, people could live with the cancers because they are not growing," he said. "perhaps with ideas like this, we may be able to live with cancer just as we live with diabetes or high blood pressure." before the technique can be used in humans, however, it will have to undergo extensive testing and be approved by the fda - a process that can take as much as ten years. among the next steps are to evaluate the technique with other forms of brain cancer, and other types of cancer that can be difficult to remove. treating brain cancer with nanofibers could be preferable to existing drug and radiation techniques, bellamkonda said. "one attraction about the approach is that it is purely a device," he explained. "there are no drugs entering the blood stream and circulating in the brain to harm healthy cells. treating these cancers with minimally-invasive films could be a lot less dangerous than deploying pharmaceutical chemicals." seed funding for early research to verify the potential for the technique was sponsored by ian's friends foundation, an atlanta-based organization that supports research into childhood brain cancers. "we couldn't be more thrilled with the progress that georgia tech and professor bellamkonda's lab have made in helping find a solution for children with both inoperable brain tumors and for those suffering with tumors in more invasive areas," said phil yagoda, one of the organization's founders. "with this research team's dedication and vision, this exciting and exceptional work is now closer to reality. by enabling the movement of an inoperable tumor to an operable spot, this work could give hope to all the children and parents of those children fighting their greatest fight, the battle for their lives."   in addition to those already mentioned, the research team included barunashish brahma from the department of neurosurgery at children's healthcare of atlanta; tobey macdonald from the department of pediatrics at emory university school of medicine, and martha betancur, gaurangkuma patel, chandra valmikinathan, vivek mukhatyar, ajit vakharia and s. balakrishna pai from the wallace h. coulter department of biomedical engineering at georgia tech and emory university. this research was supported by the national cancer institute of the national institutes of health (nih) through eureka award number r01-ca153229. any conclusions or opinions are those of the authors and do not necessarily represent the official views of the nih. citation : anjana jain, et al., "guiding intracortical brain tumour cells to an extracortical cytotoxic hydrogel using aligned polymeric nanofibres," (nature materials, 2014).

-0.9993 STEM researchers leverage ai to develop early diagnostic test for ovarian cancer 
 the georgia tech integrated cancer research center has combined machine learning with information on blood metabolites to develop a new early diagnostic test that detects ovarian cancer with 93 percent accuracy.

 jan 29, 2024 
 for over three decades, a highly accurate early diagnostic test for ovarian cancer has eluded physicians. now, scientists in the 
 georgia tech integrated cancer research center (icrc) 
 have combined machine learning with information on blood metabolites to develop a new test able to detect ovarian cancer with 93 percent accuracy among samples from the team's study group. 
 john mcdonald , professor emeritus in the 
 school of biological sciences , founding director of the icrc, and the study's corresponding author, explains that the new test's accuracy is better in detecting ovarian cancer than existing tests for women clinically classified as normal, with a particular improvement in detecting early-stage ovarian disease in that cohort. 
 the team's results and methodologies are detailed in a new paper, 
 "a personalized probabilistic approach to ovarian cancer diagnostics," 
 published in the march 2024 online issue of the medical journal 
 gynecologic oncology . based on their computer models, the researchers have developed what they believe will be a more clinically useful approach to ovarian cancer diagnosis - whereby a patient's individual metabolic profile can be used to assign a more accurate probability of the presence or absence of the disease. 
 "this personalized, probabilistic approach to cancer diagnostics is more clinically informative and accurate than traditional binary (yes / no) tests," mcdonald says. "it represents a promising new direction in the early detection of ovarian cancer, and perhaps other cancers as well." 
 the study co-authors also include 
 dongjo ban , a bioinformatics ph.d. student in mcdonald's lab; research scientists 
 stephen n. housley , 
 lilya v. matyunina , and 
 l.deette (walker) mcdonald ; regents' professor 
 jeffrey skolnick , who also serves as mary and maisie gibson chair in the school of biological sciences and georgia research alliance eminent scholar in computational systems biology; and two collaborating physicians: university of north carolina professor 
 victoria l. bae-jump 
 and ovarian cancer institute of atlanta founder and chief executive officer 
 benedict b. benigno . members of the research team are forming a startup to transfer and commercialize the technology, and plan to seek requisite trials and fda approval for the test. 
 silent killer 
 ovarian cancer is often referred to as the silent killer because the disease is typically asymptomatic when it first arises - and is usually not detected until later stages of development, when it is difficult to treat. 
 mcdonald explains that while the average five-year survival rate for late-stage ovarian cancer patients, even after treatment, is around 31 percent - but that if ovarian cancer is detected and treated early, the average five-year survival rate is more than 90 percent. 
 "clearly, there is a tremendous need for an accurate early diagnostic test for this insidious disease," mcdonald says. 
 and although development of an early detection test for ovarian cancer has been vigorously pursued for more than three decades, the development of early, accurate diagnostic tests has proven elusive. because cancer begins on the molecular level, mcdonald explains, there are multiple possible pathways capable of leading to even the same cancer type. 
 "because of this high-level molecular heterogeneity among patients, the identification of a single universal diagnostic biomarker of ovarian cancer has not been possible," mcdonald says. "for this reason, we opted to use a branch of artificial intelligence - machine learning - to develop an alternative probabilistic approach to the challenge of ovarian cancer diagnostics." 
 metabolic profiles 
 georgia tech co-author dongjo ban, whose thesis research contributed to the study, explains that "because end-point changes on the metabolic level are known to be reflective of underlying changes operating collectively on multiple molecular levels, we chose metabolic profiles as the backbone of our analysis." 
 "the set of human metabolites is a collective measure of the health of cells," adds coauthor jeffrey skolnick, "and by not arbitrarily choosing any subset in advance, one lets the artificial intelligence figure out which are the key players for a given individual." 
 mass spectrometry can identify the presence of metabolites in the blood by detecting their mass and charge signatures. however, ban says, the precise chemical makeup of a metabolite requires much more extensive characterization. 
 ban explains that because the precise chemical composition of less than seven percent of the metabolites circulating in human blood have, thus far, been chemically characterized, it is currently impossible to accurately pinpoint the specific molecular processes contributing to an individual's metabolic profile. 
 however, the research team recognized that, even without knowing the precise chemical make-up of each individual metabolite, the mere presence of different metabolites in the blood of different individuals, as detected by mass spectrometry, can be incorporated as features in the building of accurate machine learning-based predictive models (similar to the use of individual facial features in the building of facial pattern recognition algorithms). 
 "thousands of metabolites are known to be circulating in the human bloodstream, and they can be readily and accurately detected by mass spectrometry and combined with machine learning to establish an accurate ovarian cancer diagnostic," ban says. 
 a new probabilistic approach 
 the researchers developed their integrative approach by combining metabolomic profiles and machine learning-based classifiers to establish a diagnostic test with 93 percent accuracy when tested on 564 women from georgia, north carolina, philadelphia and western canada. 431 of the study participants were active ovarian cancer patients, and while the remaining 133 women in the study did not have ovarian cancer. 
 further studies have been initiated to study the possibility that the test is able to detect very early-stage disease in women displaying no clinical symptoms, mcdonald says. 
 mcdonald anticipates a clinical future where a person with a metabolic profile that falls within a score range that makes cancer highly unlikely would only require yearly monitoring. but someone with a metabolic score that lies in a range where a majority (say, 90%) have previously been diagnosed with ovarian cancer would likely be monitored more frequently - or perhaps immediately referred for advanced screening.

-0.9778 STEM restoring power during severe storms 
 researchers studied how recovery, guided by common policies from fema and industry, varies with respect to the severity of disruptive events. 
 power lines 
 sep 22, 2021 
 - atlanta, ga 
 with severe weather and natural disasters becoming more intense in a changing climate, a group of georgia tech researchers studied how recovery, guided by common policies from fema and industry, varies with respect to the severity of disruptive events. the study, a collaboration with national grid, used large-scale data analytics to look at nine years of power failure data to gain insight on how quickly energy grids come back online for customers. 
 the study found that 90 percent of customers experience 10 percent of a disruptive event's total downtime during moderate to extreme storms. however, recovery degrades with the severity of the disruptions. large failures that cannot recover rapidly increase by 30% from the moderate to extreme events, while prolonged small failures dominate entire recovery processes. 
 the study from georgia tech's college of engineering looked at 169 weather-induced power failures at two service regions in the states of new york and massachusetts. the failures were induced by a wide range of disruptive events from hurricanes, nor'easters, and thunder and winter storms from 2011-2019, affecting nearly 12 million people. 
 a feature article, " large-scale data analytics for resilient recovery services from power failures ," is published in joule: cell press. 
 "our goal was to use large-scale data from the operational energy grid to better understand resiliency," said lead author amir hossein afsharinejad, a ph.d. student in georgia tech's school of 
 electrical and computer engineering  (ece). "by using such a large dataset that covers nearly a decade, we sought to learn how recoveries respond to the severity of a wide range of weather-induced failure events." 
 the georgia tech analysis finds that the behavior of restoration services follows a "recovery scaling law." this law restores service for the majority of affected customers at the cost of a small fraction of the total interruption time. this prioritization policy, however, becomes less efficient, shown by large power failures that can't be prioritized. this results in customer interruption times that are 47 times longer from moderate to extreme failure events. 
 the study found that the prioritization recovery doesn't optimize restoration of small failures, which dominate delayed recovery during an entire evolution of an extreme event. 
 "these findings tell us that the typical services governed by the prioritized recovery policy is at the cost of the disparity, and the cost is significant when failure events become severe and extreme," said study co-author chuanyi ji, a georgia tech ece associate professor and afsharinejad's thesis advisor. "our analysis shows both the capability and fundamental limitation of recovery under the prioritization policy, where rapid restoration does not sustain to severe and extreme failure events." 
 the research team also explored if other approaches would be more beneficial to speed up recovery from failures. one included distributed generation and storage. their initial study found the approach scales well, as expediting restoration of a small fraction of the large failures in the non-prioritized category can reverse the degraded recovery from the moderate to extreme events. 
 the data used in the study are commonly available to most distribution grid operators in the u.s. and other parts of the world. the researchers hope their work, which took more than four years to analyze, demonstrates that energy service providers have the ability to adopt data science and turn their own data into new knowledge to improve both recovery and infrastructure enhancement. 
 "we are moving in a direction where severe storms are becoming more costly," said robert wilcox, a principal engineer from national grid who co-authored the paper. 
 the team is enthusiastic about the future direction. "this is also an historic time as more consumers need data and machine learning to help enhance energy services and smart infrastructure," wilcox added. "hopefully our study will motivate the industry to use data to better understand the problems we face today and in the decades to come."

-0.9153 STEM ribose-seq identifies and locates ribonucleotides in genomic dna 
 researchers have developed and tested a new technique that allows them to determine the full profile of ribonucleotides -- rna fragments -- embedded in genomic dna.

 jan 26, 2015 
 - atlanta, ga 
 ribonucleotides, units of rna, can become embedded in genomic dna during processes such as dna replication and repair, affecting the stability of the genome by contributing to dna fragility and mutability. scientists have known about the presence of ribonucleotides in dna, but until now had not been able to determine exactly what they are and where they are located in the dna sequences. now, researchers have developed and tested a new technique known as ribose-seq that allows them to determine the full profile of ribonucleotides embedded in genomic dna. using ribose-seq, they have found widespread but not random incorporation and "hotspots" where the rna insertions accumulate in the nuclear and mitochondrial dna of a commonly-studied species of budding yeast. ribose-seq could be used to locate ribonucleotides in the dna of a wide range of other organisms, including that of humans. "ribonucleotides are the most abundant non-standard nucleotides that can be found in dna, but until now there has not been a system to determine where they are located in the dna, or to identify specifically which type they are," said francesca storici, an associate professor in the school of biology at the georgia institute of technology. "because they change the way that dna works, in both its structure and function, it is important to know their identity and their sites of genomic incorporation." a description of the ribose-seq method and what it discovered in the dna of the budding yeast species 
 saccharomyces cerevisiae 
 were reported january 26 in the journal 
 nature methods . the findings resulted from collaboration between researchers in storici's laboratory at georgia tech - with graduate students kyung duk koh and sathya balachander - and at the university of colorado anschutz medical school with assistant professor jay hesselberth. the research was supported by the national science foundation, the georgia research alliance, the american cancer society, the damon runyon cancer research foundation, and the university of colorado golfers against cancer. because of the extra hydroxyl (oh) group in the ribonucleotides, their presence distorts the dna and creates sensitive sites where reactions with other molecules can take place. of particular interest are reactions between the oh and alkaline solutions, which can make the dna more susceptible to cleavage. ribose-seq takes advantage of this reaction with the hydroxyl group to launch the process of identifying the genomic spectrum of ribonucleotide (rnmp) incorporation. researchers first cleave the dna samples at the ribonucleotides, then take the resulting fragments through a specialized process that concludes with generation of a library of dna sequences that contain the sites of ribonucleotide incorporation and their upstream sequence. high-throughput sequencing of the library and alignment of sequencing reads to a reference genome identifies the profile of rnmp incorporation events. "ribose-seq is specific to directly capturing ribonucleotides embedded in dna and does not capture rna primers or okazaki fragments formed during dna replication, breaks or abasic sites in dna," storici noted. "for this reason, ribose-seq has application for rnmp mapping in any genomic dna, from large nuclear genomes to small genomic molecules such as plasmids and mitochondrial dna, with no need of standardization procedures," she said. "it also allows mapping rnmps even in conditions in which the dna is exposed to environmental stressors that damage the dna by generating breaks and / or abasic sites." the extra hydroxyl group found in the ribonucleotides is key to the ribose-seq technique, said koh, the paper's first author. "the oh group is specific to the ribonucleotides," he explained. "that allowed us to build a new tool for recognizing specifically where the ribonucleotides are located." the high-throughput sequencing and initial data analysis were done in the hesselberth laboratory in the department of biochemistry and molecular genetics at the university of colorado anschutz medical school. to validate their method, the researchers tested ribose-seq on the much-studied yeast species. the analyses revealed a strong preference for the cytidine and guanosine bases at the ribonucleotide sites. "the ribonucleotides are not randomly distributed, and there is some preference for specific base sequences and specific base composition of the ribonucleotide itself," said koh. "by looking at the non-random distribution, we found several hotspots in which the ribonucleotides are incorporated into the genome." knowledge of where the ribonucleotides cluster could help identify areas of greatest potential for genome instability and lead to a better understanding of how they affect the properties and activities of dna. "the fact that we see biases in the base compositions of the ribonucleotides allows us to tell which base is more likely to be incorporated into the dna," koh explained. "if there are specific signatures of genomic instability that are caused by the ribonucleotides, this will allow us to narrow down the locations and know where they are more likely to be found." a next step will be to test ribose-seq on other dna, koh said. "our technique could potentially be applied to any genome of any cell type from any organism as long as genomic dna can be extracted from it," he added.

-0.978 STEM robotic submarine snaps first-ever images at foundation of notorious antarctic glacier 
 these are the first-ever images taken at the foundations of the glacier that inspires more fear of sea-level rise than any other - thwaites glacier.

 - atlanta, ga 
 during an unprecedented scientific campaign on an antarctic glacier notorious for contributions to sea-level, researchers took first-ever images at the glacier's foundations on the ocean floor. the area is key to thwaites glacier's potential to become more dangerous, and in the coming months, the research team hopes to give the world a clearer picture of its condition. 
 the images, taken by a robotic underwater vehicle, were part of a broad set of data collected in a variety of experiments by an international team. the  international thwaites glacier collaboration  (itgc)  announced the completion of this first-ever major research venture  on the glacier coincident with the 200-year anniversary of the discovery of antarctica in 1820. 
 already, thwaites accounts for about four percent of global sea-level rise. researchers have had concerns that a tipping point in the stability at its foundations could result in a run-away collapse of the glacier and boost sea levels by as much as 25 inches. by studying multiple aspects of thwaites, the itgc wants to understand more about the likelihood that the glacier the size of florida may reach such instability in the coming decades. 
 line of concern 
 the area of concern that the underwater vehicle visited is called the grounding line, and it is important to the stability of thwaites glacier's footing. it is the line between where the glacier rests on the ocean bed and where it floats over water. the farther back the grounding line recedes, the faster the ice can flow into the sea, pushing up sea-level. 
 "visiting the grounding line is one of the reasons work like this is important because we can drive right up to it and actually measure where it is," said britney schmidt, an itgc co-investigator from the georgia institute of technology. "it's the first time anyone has done that or has ever even seen the grounding zone of a major glacier under the water, and that's the place where the greatest degree of melting and destabilization can occur." 
 the underwater robot,  icefin, was engineered by schmidt's georgia tech lab . the georgia tech team was part of a greater collaboration between researchers from the u.s. and the british antarctic survey (bas), who lived and worked on thwaites in december and january. a bas hot water drill melted a hole 590 meters deep (1,935 feet) to access the ocean cavity for icefin. 
 "icefin swam over 15 km (9.3 miles) round trip during five missions. this included two passes up to the grounding zone, including one where we got as close as we physically could to the place where the seafloor meets the ice," said schmidt, who is  an associate professor in georgia tech's school of earth and atmospheric sciences . "we saw amazing ice interactions driven by sediments at the line and from the rapid melting from warm ocean water." 
 [ready for graduate school?  here's how to apply to georgia tech. ] 
 historic research venture 
 in the coming months and years, the itgc team made up of researchers from multiple universities and research institutions in the u.s. and the uk will publish studies with thorough findings based on the unprecedented data collected during the field campaign. 
 the array of research the scientists carried out research included seismic and radar measurements and using hot water drills to make holes between 300 and 700 meters (985 and 2,300 feet) deep down to the ocean and glacier bed below thwaites' ice. researchers also took cores of sediment from the seafloor and under parts of the glacier grounded on the bed to examine the quality of the foothold that it offers thwaites. 
 "we know that warmer ocean waters are eroding many of west antarctica's glaciers, but we're particularly concerned about thwaites. this new data will provide a new perspective of the processes taking place, so we can predict future change with more certainty," said keith nicholls, an oceanographer from the british antarctic survey. 
 nicholls is a co-principal investigator on the project that involved schmidt along with david holland of new york university. the research is funded by the national science foundation, the uk natural environment research council, the u.s. antarctic program, and the british antarctic survey. 
 antarctica sea-level background 
 over the past 30 years, the amount of ice flowing to the sea from thwaites and its neighboring glaciers has nearly doubled. 
 "while greenland's contribution to sea level has already reached an alarming rate, antarctica is just now picking up its contributions to sea level," schmidt said. "it has the largest body of ice on earth and will contribute more and more of sea-level rise over the next 100 years and beyond. it's a massive source of uncertainty in the climate system."

 it's called mental imbalance for a reason. sanity hangs, in part, in the gentle balance of chemicals strung together within regions of the brain in an intricate matrix. in schizophrenia, the matrix is sharply jarred, debilitating the mind and triggering hallucinations. now, researchers at the georgia institute of technology have created an interactive model of that matrix to fast-track research and treatment of the tormenting disorder. working memory disruptions paralyze the mental coherence of schizophrenia sufferers, yet there is a stark lack of medical treatment for it. researchers zhen qi and eberhard voit hope their new, very accurate computational simulator built around this symptom will help change that to curb anquish for many patients. learn more about the simulator , which puts this brain dysfunction into a virtual setting.

 people with weakened immune systems are at constant risk of infection.  pseudomonas aeruginosa , a common environmental bacterium, can colonize different body parts, such as the lungs, leading to persistent, chronic infections that can last a lifetime - a common occurrence for people with cystic fibrosis. 
 but the bacteria can sometimes change their behavior and enter the bloodstream, causing chronic localized infections to become acute and potentially fatal. despite decades of studying the transition in lab environments, how and why the switch happens in humans has remained unknown.

-0.9924 STEM scientists work to engineer an injectable therapy for rotator cuff injuries 
 researchers are attempting to engineer an injectable therapy for the shoulder's supraspinatus tendon, a rotator cuff tendon that is commonly torn in sports. 
 johnna temenoff, an associate professor in the wallace h. coulter department of biomedical engineering at georgia tech and emory university, has been awarded a $1 million grant to develop an injectable therapy for rotator cuff injuries. credit: rob felt.

 for a baseball pitcher, a rotator cuff injury often means an extended stay on the disabled list for surgery and rehabilitation of the damaged tendons. but a new technology under development may stop this shoulder injury from becoming so severe that surgery is required.  a research team is attempting to engineer an injectable therapy for the shoulder's supraspinatus tendon, a rotator cuff tendon that is commonly torn in sports. when the tendon is damaged, the body makes things worse by activating enzymes that further break down the tendon. the scientists hope to develop an injectable compound that would deliver an inhibitor capable of blocking these enzymes, thereby reducing the severity of the injury or even healing the tissue. "normally people focus on treating tendon injuries after the tear has occurred, but we're focusing on a much earlier stage in the disease," said johnna temenoff, an associate professor in the wallace h. coulter department of biomedical engineering at georgia tech and emory university. "this is the first time that an injectable therapy specifically designed to interact with tissue at an early disease state has been attempted for this particular tendon injury." temenoff's work is supported by a $1 million grant from the 
 national institute of arthritis and musculoskeletal and skin diseases (niams) 
 for five years of research, which began in september 2013. collaborating on the research is manu platt, an assistant professor in the same department. temenoff's previous work on tendon injuries, which focused on quarterbacks in football, was sponsored by the nfl charities. shoulder tendon injuries are common overuse injuries for athletes and also for industrial workers whose repetitive overhead motion put them at risk. the rotator cuff is a collation of four tendons, and the tendons are made of collagen. overuse of the tendons damages the collagen, and people feel stiff and sore in their shoulders as the area becomes weaker. once a tendon is damaged, the body accelerates the damage by activating enzymes that eat at the tendon, worsening the condition over time. "the interesting thing about this disease is that we don't know exactly what causes it," temenoff said. "we're studying enzymes that are known to chew up the collagen, and we're looking at then delivering inhibitors to those enzymes in a local injection in the tendon to try to stop the degradation." in their research, the team will use an animal model to characterize when these collagen-destroying enzymes are the most active. this will give researchers a good idea of when to inject inhibitors. so that patients won't need multiple shots, the scientists are working on a drug delivery material that will release the inhibitors over time once inside the body. one idea is to control the interactions between the inhibitors and small amounts of the blood thinner heparin. the team will also study the histology and mechanics of the tendons after healing. temenoff said that the injectable therapy could, in theory, work on other kinds of tendon injuries, not just in the shoulder. "we're studying the disease in the shoulder, but it's the same disease that causes tennis elbow, achilles injuries, and jumper's knee," temenoff said. "it's the same process, just in different tendons in the body." this research is supported by the national institute of arthritis and musculoskeletal and skin diseases (niams) under award1r01ar063692-01a1 .

-0.8768 STEM in search of the goldilocks of black holes 
 analysis of gravitational waves data by hundreds of scientists so far reveals no collisions from mid-sized black holes. 
 may 22, 2017 
 - atlanta 
 black holes can be divided into three classes according to mass. on the low end are those with masses 10 times that of the sun. examples are the two black holes whose merger generated the 
 first gravitational wave to be detected , by 
 the ligo scientific collaboration 
 (lsc), an international team including researchers in the school of physics' 
 center for relativistic astrophysics 
 (cra). ligo stands for laser interferometer gravitational-wave observatory, a facility based in the u.s. 
 on the high end are black holes that are a million times as massive as the sun. 
 evidence for them comes from nasa images . 
 for the goldilocks black holes, with masses in between, no hard proof exists to date. 
 indirect evidence 
 has been offered, but nothing unambiguous so far. a single detection can transform our understanding of the first stars in the universe. 
 as it happens, ligo has been designed to detect gravitational waves arising from collisions of midsize black holes. a 
 recent study 
 suggests that the goldilocks of black holes may be uncommon. analysis of ligo data collected from september 2015 through january 2016 found no evidence for midsize black holes. however, the work enables scientists to estimate more accurately than ever before the abundance of such black holes. 
 the paper reports a "survey of the universe for midsize-black-hole collisions up to 5 billion light years ago," says 
 karan jani , a former georgia tech ph.d. physics student who participated in the study. that volume of space contains about 100 million galaxies the size of the milky way. nowhere in that space did the study find a collision of midsize black holes. 
 "clearly they are much, much rarer than low-mass black holes, three collisions of which ligo has detected so far," jani says. nevertheless, should a gravitational wave from two goldilocks black holes colliding ever gets detected, jani adds, "we have all the tools to dissect the signal." 
 the study was undertaken by hundreds of scientists worldwide belonging to lsc and 
 the virgo collaboration , another international team observing gravitational waves from a facility in italy. georgia tech scientists worked on 
 the paper 
 in close collaboration with colleagues from the 
 albert einstein institute hannover , in germany; hillsdale college; kenyon college;  massachusetts institute of technology; pennsylvania state university; 
 radboud university , in the netherlands; 
 université paris diderot , in france; and the 
 university of birmingham , in england. 
 jani received a 
 ph.d. in spring 2017 . he worked with cra director 
 deirdre shoemaker , 
 lsc deputy spokesperson laura cadonati , and cra colleagues 
 juan calderon bustillo , 
 james clark , 
 claudia lazzaro , and 
 pablo laguna . all of them participated in the first detection of a gravitational wave, on sept. 14, 2015.

-0.7068 STEM seise tool uses semantic gaps to detect website promotional attacks 
 researchers have developed a new technique for identifying promotional infections of websites operated by government and educational organizations.

 by detecting semantic inconsistencies in content, researchers have developed a new technique for identifying promotional infections of websites operated by government and educational organizations. such attacks use code embedded in highly-ranked sites to drive traffic to sketchy websites selling fake drugs, counterfeit handbags and plagiarized term papers - or installing drive-by malware. the new technique, known as semantic inconsistency search (seise), uses natural language processing to spot the differences between a compromised site's expected content and the malicious advertising and promotional code. using seise, the researchers found 11,000 infected sites among non-commercial top-level sponsored .edu, .gov and .mil domains worldwide, and are working to extend the method to other domains. the research was supported by the u.s. national science foundation and natural science foundation of china. it will be described in a presentation may 25, 2016 at the ieee symposium on security and privacy in san jose. seise was developed by researchers from the georgia institute of technology, indiana university and tsinghua university in china. "the basic idea behind promotional infection is to attack websites that are highly-ranked and to leverage their importance to promote various things, most of them illegal," explained 
 raheem beyah , who is the motorola foundation professor in georgia tech's 
 school of electrical and computer engineering . "the bad content is nested into the prominent site to leverage the traffic of that domain. that gives the attackers a doorway to whatever they are promoting." essentially, said beyah, the attackers are stealing the site's good name, even if they don't install malware or otherwise inflict harm on web visitors. "the attackers essentially become part of the prominent website's brand and share in the ranking they have," he added. "it's like setting up operations inside a well-known coffee shop chain. the attacker leverages the brand by becoming co-located with it." the promotional attacks can be difficult to detect, especially if they don't contain malicious computer code. but the semantic differences between the host site and the attacker's code can tip off the seise algorithm. once it has characterized the content expected on a website - educational information on an .edu page, for example - the pitches for gambling or inexpensive prescription drugs become obvious. "if you are visiting the website for a prestigious university, you don't expect to see information promoting casino gambling," said beyah. "if we expect one thing from the website and see something significantly different, there is a huge semantic gap that we can detect." seise doesn't have to review an entire site to determine what should be there; it can sample the pages to learn context that makes attacker terms stand out. because their domain purposes are clear and well established, the researchers began with education and government websites. they now hope to extend the automated approach to commercial and other domains whose intended purposes may be less consistent. "we are trying to figure out how to get the context right for these domains so we can help companies detect these infections," beyah said. "there's no reason to believe that the commercial domains are any less attractive to attackers than the non-commercial ones." beyah and georgia tech ph.d. student xiaojing liao began the work by using google searches to find sites with known "bad words" denoting illicit products. they then utilized natural language processing to find terms associated with these known bad words, which were then used to train the seise before it was sent out to analyze 100,000 domains for the presence of the illicit terms. the approach identified 11,000 infected sites with a false detection rate of just 1.5 percent and coverage of more than 90 percent. seise found promotional infections on the websites of top u.s. universities and government agencies, though the problem was truly worldwide, with three percent of .edu and .gov sites infected. of the infected websites noted, 15 percent were in china and six percent were in the united states. sites are infected using proven attack techniques such as sql injection, url redirection and phishing to compromise the credentials of users, beyah said. though central websites of the organizations may be secure, pages of individual users and units may be more vulnerable - and still provide the prestige of the overall domain. existing techniques for detecting promotional infections rely on examining redirects and following links, or observing how sites change over time. but those techniques aren't scalable and can't be automated in the same way as the new semantic gap approach, beyah said. the researchers want to share their technique with the larger security community, and are discussing how best to make the algorithm available. "our study shows that by effective detection of infected sponsored top-level domains (stlds), the bar to promotion infections can be substantially raised," the authors wrote in their paper. about those 11,000 compromised webpages? the researchers are attempting to contact the operators of all 11,000 of them to share the bad news. "we have spent a lot of time contacting those folks and letting them know what we have found," beyah said. "we're still in the process of doing that because there are so many." this work was supported by the national science foundation through grants cns-1223477, cns-1223495 and cns-1527141 and by the natural science foundation of china through grant 61472215. any opinions, findings, and conclusions or recommendations expressed in this material are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of the sponsors. research news georgia institute of technology 177 north avenue atlanta, georgia 30332-0181 usa media relations contact s: john toon ( jtoon@gatech.edu ) (404-894-6986) or ben brumfield ( ben.brumfield@comm.gatech.edu ) (404-385-1933). writer : john toon

 "hairy" nanoparticles made with light-sensitive materials that assemble themselves could one day become "nano-carriers" providing doctors a new way to simultaneously introduce both therapeutic drugs and cancer-fighting heat into tumors. that's one potential application for a new technology that combines water-repelling yet light-sensitive and water-absorbing materials into polymeric nano-reactors for creating photo-responsive gold nanoparticles. 
 light of specific wavelengths causes the nanoparticles to assemble and disassemble on demand, allowing the dynamic organization of the nanoparticles for smart in vitro drug release. by including chemotherapy molecules in the nanoparticle structures when they are assembled, the molecules could be drawn into tumors - and then released with the application of a light at a shorter wavelength that triggers disassembly through photo-cleavage. 
 in addition to such a dynamic self-assembly and disassembly, the encapsulation and release of chemotherapy molecules could also be achieved by reversible covalent bonding of anticancer drugs to the polymeric "hairs" situated on the surface of nanoparticles. and by absorbing the same light that triggers the drug release, the gold nanoparticles could also heat the cancer cells, providing a double punch. 
 in a broad range of other applications, the nanoparticle self-assembly process could also be triggered by environmental factors including temperature, ph or solvent polarity by rationally designing the polymeric hairs. in this study, gold nanoparticles were used, but the process could also make self-assembled nanoparticles from a variety of metals and metal oxides. by tailoring the surface of nanoparticles with water-absorbing polymers containing near-infrared responsive components, the drug release could be performed 
 in vivo . 
 the spherical gold nanoparticles can be replaced with more complex shaped nanomaterials - such as hollow nanoparticles, nanorods, or nanotubes - to render a better absorption of near-infrared light to penetrate biological tissues. no testing of these nanoparticles has been done so far in living cells or organisms. 
 the research was supported by the air force office of scientific research and the national science foundation, and was reported january 31 in the early edition of the journal 
 proceedings of the national academy of sciences . materials scientists from the georgia institute of technology and south china university of technology co-authored the paper. 
 "we envision that these photo-responsive polymer-capped gold nanoparticles could one day serve as nano-carriers for drug delivery into the body using our robust and reversible process for assembly and disassembly," said 
 zhiqun lin , a professor in the georgia tech 
 school of materials science and engineering . "used in cancer therapy, this process could increase the impact of a treatment by heating the cancer cells while introducing the drug compound into the tumor." 
 under light, the assemblies of photo-sensitive nanoparticles separate over a period of hours at a rate that can be controlled by the intensity and wavelength of the light. "because the disassembly can be turned on and off at will, we could provide a timed release of the drug by controlling the short-wavelength light exposure," lin added. 
 the hairy nanoparticles are fabricated around a tiny core of beta-cyclodextrin from which polymer chains of poly(acrylicacid)-block-poly(7-methylacryloyloxy-4-methylcoumarin) (paa-b-pmamc) are grown. that material attracts water-soluble metal precursors, which use the space within the polymer hairs as nano-reactors to form gold nanoparticles. 
 to these inner structures - which are hydrophilic paa polymers - the researchers add hairs made from the hydrophobic monomer mamc. these materials are sensitive to light, and cause the nanoparticles to self-assemble through a photo-dimerization process - crosslinking - when subjected to light at a wavelength of 365 nanometers. 
 the assembly process can be reliably reversed on demand using a shorter wavelength at 254 nanometers. 
 "once the polymer chains from adjacent gold nanoparticles begin to photo-crosslink, they bring nanoparticles together via a self-assembly process to generate large assemblies of nanoparticles," said lin. "this process is completely reversible and can be repeated in many cycles." 
 the research team incorporated dye molecules into the self-assembled nanoparticles to simulate what might be done to incorporate and then release chemotherapy agents. a magnetic oxide material incorporated into the nanoparticles could allow the assemblies to be directed to a tumor site by an external magnet, and could also support diagnostic imaging. 
 beyond the activity of the drugs, the plasmonic effects of the gold nanoparticles could heat the nanoparticles when they are subjected to light, attacking the cancer cells through a second route. 
 in addition to the potential medical uses, the self-assembly technique could have applications in optics, optoelectronics, magnetic technologies, sensing materials and devices, catalysis and nanotechnology. the technique could also lead to new basic research in crystallization kinetics, using the self-assembly process to create "artificial crystals" held together by polymer chains. 
 lin's lab has worked on the amphiphilic star-shaped block polymers for several years, adding new features and exploring new capabilities for the nanoparticle systems. 
 "our work provides a design strategy that allows the manipulation of both the outer block and the inner block of a star-shaped block co-polymer," he said. "our fundamental contribution in this work is to judiciously prepare a star-shaped block co-polymer in which the inner block has the capability to coordinate with metal precursors while the outer block allows photo-responsive materials to interact, which in turn renders the crafting of photo-responsive gold nanoparticles for light-enabled reversible and reliable self-assembly."

 at least half of veterans with spinal cord injuries will develop sores on their skin from the unrelieved pressure of sitting for long periods of time in a wheelchair. it's a constant worry, because these skin ulcers can greatly limit patients' mobility. 
 "pressure injuries directly impact the veteran's quality of life, because the medical provider will order the veteran to bed rest for weeks and potentially months," said kim house, a physician and medical director of the spinal cord injury clinic at the atlanta veterans administration healthcare system. "at every clinic visit, i provide education for pressure injury prevention." 
 house could one day have a new tool to offer her patients, thanks to researchers in the georgia tech college of engineering, and wheelchair-bound veterans are just the beginning. 
 materials engineers are developing new fabric sensors and a customized wheelchair system that assesses and automatically eases pressure at contact points to prevent injuries from developing in the first place. 
 "we have three key issues happening: first, continuous pressure. second, moisture, because when you're sitting in the same spot, you tend to sweat and generate moisture. and third is shear. when you try to move somebody, the skin shears. that perfect combination is what causes pressure injuries," said 
 sundaresan jayaraman , professor in the 
 school of materials science and engineering 
 (mse). "we believe we have a solution to the perfect storm of pressure, moisture and shear, which means the user's quality of life is going to get better."

-0.9854 STEM simulated ransomware attack shows vulnerability of industrial controls 
 cybersecurity researchers have developed a new form of ransomware that was able to take over control of a simulated water treatment plant.

 cybersecurity researchers at the georgia institute of technology have developed a new form of ransomware that was able to take over control of a simulated water treatment plant. after gaining access, the researchers were able to command programmable logic controllers (plcs) to shut valves, increase the amount of chlorine added to water, and display false readings. 
 the simulated attack was designed to highlight vulnerabilities in the control systems used to operate industrial facilities such as manufacturing plants, water and wastewater treatment facilities, and building management systems for controlling escalators, elevators and hvac systems. believed to be the first to demonstrate ransomware compromise of real plcs, the research is scheduled to be presented february 13 at the rsa conference in san francisco. 
 though no real ransomware attacks have been publicly reported on the process control components of industrial control systems, the attacks have become a significant problem for patient data in hospitals and customer data in businesses. attackers gain access to these systems and encrypt the data, demanding a ransom to provide the encryption key that allows the data to be used again. 
 ransomware generated an estimated $200 million for attackers during the first quarter of 2016, and the researchers believe it's only a matter of time before critical industrial systems are compromised and held for ransom. 
 "we are expecting ransomware to go one step farther, beyond the customer data to compromise the control systems themselves," said david formby, a ph.d. student in the georgia tech school of electrical and computer engineering. "that could allow attackers to hold hostage critical systems such as water treatment plants and manufacturing facilities. compromising the programmable logic controllers (plcs) in these systems is a next logical step for these attackers." 
 many industrial control systems lack strong security protocols, said 
 raheem beyah , the motorola foundation professor and associate chair in the 
 school of electrical and computer engineering 
 and formby's faculty advisor. that's likely because these systems haven't been targeted by ransomware so far, and because their vulnerabilities may not be well understood by their operators. 
 formby and beyah used a specialized search program to locate 1,400 plcs of a single type that were directly accessible across the internet. but most such devices are located behind business systems that provide some level of protection - until they are compromised. once attackers get into a business system, they could pivot to enter control systems if they are not properly walled off. 
 "many control systems assume that once you have access to the network, that you are authorized to make changes to the control systems," formby said. "they may have very weak password policies and security policies that could let intruders take control of pumps, valves and other key components of the industrial control system." 
 in the past, control systems weren't designed for connection to the internet, and many users of the systems assume they aren't on the public network and therefore not susceptible to attack. control systems may also have connections that are unknown to operators, including access points installed to allow maintenance, troubleshooting and updates. 
 "there are common misconceptions about what is connected to the internet," said formby. "operators may believe their systems are air-gapped and that there's no way to access the controllers, but these systems are often connected in some way." 
 to launch the research, the researchers identified several common plcs in use at industrial facilities. they obtained three different devices and tested their security setup, including password protection and susceptibility to settings changes. the devices were then combined with pumps, tubes and tanks to create a simulated water treatment facility. in the place of chlorine normally used to disinfect water, the researchers used iodine. they also added starch to their water supply, which turned bright blue when a simulated attack added iodine to it. 
 "we were able to simulate a hacker who had gained access to this part of the system and is holding it hostage by threatening to dump large amounts of chlorine into the water unless the operator pays a ransom," formby said. "in the right amount, chlorine disinfects the water and makes it safe to drink. but too much chlorine can create a bad reaction that would make the water unsafe." 
 vulnerabilities in control systems have been known for more than a decade, but until the growth of ransomware, attackers had not been able to benefit financially from compromising the systems. as other ransomware targets become more difficult, beyah believes attackers may turn to easier targets in the industrial control systems. 
 "it's quite likely that nation-state operators are already familiar with this and have attacks that they could use for political purposes, but ordinary attackers have had no interest in these systems," he said. "what we hope to do is bring attention to this issue. if we can successfully attack these control systems, others with a bad intention can also do it." 
 in addition to improving password security and limiting connections, beyah says operators of these devices need to install intrusion monitoring systems to alert them if attackers are in the process control networks. beyah and formby have launched a company to make their strategies for protecting systems broadly available to control system operators.

 john edgar browning owes his love of dracula - and much of his scholarly career - to his family's vcr. growing up in tennessee during the 1980s, he watched the movies his family taped off television. horror was his favorite. he was likely one of the few kindergarten students familiar with the oeuvre of freddy krueger and jason from "friday the 13 th ." today browning is a marion l. brittain postdoctoral fellow in the school of literature, media and communication who is an internationally recognized vampire and horror scholar. he has published nearly a dozen books and his latest, "the vampire in europe: a critical edition," comes out this month. this semester browning teaches "fashioning monsters, preserving normalcy," which examines the way we construct monsters and otherness in literature, film and society. for example, his class discussed why leatherface from "texas chainsaw massacre" became more horrifying after putting on lipstick. "monsters tell us a lot about society," browning said. "in a way, monsters are just like politicians. they show us who is powerful, who should have power and who is powerless." of all the monsters out there, dracula captured browning's fascination. he watched the 1979 movie starring frank langella over and over again. but it was the 1992 version directed by francis ford coppola that made a lasting impact. "i stopped thinking of dracula as this fictional thing," browning said. "he was 
 vlad 
 dracula, a person who had a real history. the movie turned some switch on, and i really honed in on vampires and dracula." he sometimes wears a replica of the silver ring dracula wore in the movies in the 1940s. the center of the ring is a blood cornelian stone about the size of a half dollar. on top of the stone sits a crest containing a crown, a bat and the letter "d." the 34-year-old cuts an imposing figure at 6'4", but his soft-spoken nature and quick smile reveal an easygoing, scholarly side.  a film theory course during his junior year at florida state university showed he could have an academic career because of his love of dracula. for part of his doctoral dissertation, browning conducted ethnographic studies of people who identify themselves as real-life vampires. for his book 
 dracula in visual media , browning documented more than 700 dracula films, television programs, documentaries, animations and video games. next semester he'll teach "vampires and zombies across history and culture." "i was always someone who liked to ask questions and notice changes," he said. "you can see culture evolve by looking at dracula." when society goes through economic crises movie studios turn to horror, especially vampires, so villains can get their comeuppance. "what's strange now is that we want our vampires to 
 live ," he said. "we're rooting for the monsters, while it's normalcy or the people who created the monsters who are being killed off."

-0.9993 STEM skewing the aim of targeted cancer therapies 
 the aim of targeted gene-based cancer therapies could be skewed from the start more often than not, a new study shows.

 [note to researchers: mrna-protein level disparities found in metastatic ovarian cancer in more than 60% of measurements across 4,436 genes; evidence of micro rna regulation] 
 headlines, of late, have touted the successes of targeted gene-based cancer therapies, such as immunotherapies, but, unfortunately, also  their failures . 
 broad inadequacies in a widespread biological concept that affects cancer research could be significantly deflecting the aim of such targeted drugs,  according to a new study . a team exploring genetic mechanisms in cancer at the georgia institute of technology has found evidence that a prevailing concept about how cells produce protein molecules, particularly when applied to cancer, could be erroneous as much as two-thirds of the time. 
 prior studies by other researchers have also critiqued this concept about the pathway leading from genetic code to proteins, but this new study,  led by cancer researcher john mcdonald , has employed rare analytical technology to explore it in unparalleled detail. the study also turned up novel evidence for regulating mechanisms that could account for the prevailing concept's apparent shortcomings. 
 rna concept incomplete 
 the concept stems from common knowledge about the assembly line inside cells that produces protein molecules. it starts with code in dna, which is transcribed to messenger rna, then translated into protein molecules, the cell's building blocks. 
 that model seems to have left the impression that cellular protein production works analogously to an old-style factory production line: that the amount of a messenger rna encoded by dna on the front end translates directly into the amount of a corresponding protein produced on the back end. that idea is at the core of how gene-based cancer drug developers choose their targets. 
 to put that assumed congruence between rna production and protein production to the test, the researchers examined -- in ovarian cancer cells donated by a patient -- 4,436 genes, their subsequently transcribed messenger rna, and the resulting proteins. the assumption, that proverbial factory orders passed down the dna-rna line determine in a straightforward manner the amount of a protein being produced, proved incorrect 62 percent of the time. 
 rna skews drug cues 
 "the messenger rna-protein connection is important because proteins are usually the targets of  gene-based cancer therapies ," mcdonald said. "and drug developers typically measure messenger rna levels thinking they will tell them what the protein levels are." but the significant variations in ratios of messenger rna to protein that the researchers found make the common method of targeting proteins via rna seem much less than optimal. 
 mcdonald,  mengnan zhang  and ronghu wu published their results  on august 15, 2017 in the journal  scientific reports . the work was funded by the ovarian cancer institute, the deborah nash endowment, atlanta's northside hospital and the national science foundation. the spectrophotometric technology needed to closely identify a high number of proteins is not widespread and is quite costly but is  available in wu's lab at georgia tech . 
 whereas many studies look at normal tissue versus cancerous tissue, this new study focused on cancer progression, or  metastasis, which is what usually makes cancer deadly . the researchers looked at primary tumor tissue and also metastatic tissue. 
 hiding drug targets 
 "the idea that any change in rna level in cancerous development flows all the way up to the protein level could be leading to drug targeting errors," said  mcdonald, who heads georgia tech's integrated cancer research center . drug developers often look for oddly high messenger rna levels in a cancer then go after what they believe must be the resulting oddly high levels of a corresponding protein. 
 taking messenger rna as a protein level indicator could actually work some of the time. in the mcdonald team's latest experiment, in 38 percent of the cases, the rise of rna levels in cancerous cells did indeed reflect a comparable rise of protein levels. but in the rest of cases, they did not. 
 "so, there are going to be many instances where if you're predicting what to give therapeutically to a patient based on rna, your prescription could easily be incorrect," mcdonald said. "drug developers could be aiming at targets that aren't there and also not shooting for targets that are there." 
 rna muted or magnified 
 the analogy of a factory producing building materials can help illustrate what goes wrong in a cancerous cell, and also help describe the study's new insights into protein production. to complete the metaphor: the materials produced are used in the construction of the factory's own building, that is, the cell's own structures. 
 in cancer cells, a mutation makes protein production go awry usually not by deforming proteins but by overproducing them. "a lot of mutations in cancer are mutations in production levels. the proteins are being overexpressed," said mcdonald, who is also a  professor in georgia tech's school of biological sciences . 
 a bad factory order can lead to the production of too much of a good material and then force it into the structures of the cell, distorting it. the question is: where in the production line do bad factory orders appear? 
 according to the new study, the answer is less straightforward than previously thought. 
 micro rna managing 
 the orders don't all appear on the front end of the assembly line with dna over-transcribing messenger rna. additionally, some mutations that do over-transcribe messenger rna on the front end are tamped down or canceled by regulating mechanisms further down the line, and may never end up boosting protein levels on the back end. 
 regulating mechanisms also appear to be making other messenger rna, transcribed in normal amounts, unexpectedly crank out inordinate levels of proteins. 
 at the heart of those regulating systems, another rna called micro rna may be micromanaging how much, or little, of a protein is actually produced in the end. 
 "we have evidence that micro rnas may be responsible for the non-correlation between the proteins and the rna, and that's completely novel," mcdonald said. "it's an emerging area of research." 
 micro rna, or  mirna , is an extremely short strand of rna. 
 no one at fault 
 mcdonald would like to see tissues from more cancer patients undergo similar testing. "right now, with just one patient, the data is limited, but i also really think it shows that the phenomenon is real," mcdonald said. 
 "many past studies have looked at one particular protein and a particular gene, or a particular handful. we looked at more than 4,000," mcdonald said. "what that brings up is that the phenomenon is probably not isolated but instead genome-wide." 
 the study's authors would also like to see currently less accessible, advanced protein detecting technology become more widely available to biomolecular researchers, especially in the field of cancer drug development. "targeted gene therapy is a good idea, but you need the full knowledge of whether it's affecting the protein level," mcdonald said. 
 he pointed out that no one is at fault for the possible incompleteness of commonly held concepts about protein production. 
 as science progresses, it naturally illuminates new details, and formerly useful ideas need updating. with the existence of new technologies, it may be time to flesh out this particular concept for the sake of cancer research progress.

-0.9284 STEM smartphone apps may connect to vulnerable backend cloud servers 
 cybersecurity researchers have discovered vulnerabilities in the backend systems that feed content and advertising to smartphone applications. 
 a portion of the four-phase process used by skywalker to vet backend systems that support mobile apps. 
 aug 12, 2019 
 - atlanta, ga 
 cybersecurity researchers have discovered vulnerabilities in the backend systems that feed content and advertising to smartphone applications through a network of cloud-based servers that most users probably don't even know exists. 
 in research to be reported august 15 at the 2019 usenix security symposium, researchers from the georgia institute of technology and the ohio state university identified more than 1,600 vulnerabilities in the support ecosystem behind the top 5,000 free apps available in the google play store. the vulnerabilities, affecting multiple app categories, could allow hackers to break into databases that include personal information - and perhaps into users' mobile devices. 
 to help developers improve the security of their mobile apps, the researchers have created an automated system called skywalker to vet the cloud servers and software library systems. skywalker can examine the security of the servers supporting mobile applications, which are often operated by cloud hosting services rather than individual app developers. 
 "a lot of people might be surprised to learn that their phone apps are communicating with not just one, but likely tens or even hundreds of servers in the cloud," said 
 brendan saltaformaggio, 
 an assistant professor in georgia tech's 
 school of electrical and computer engineering . "users don't know they are communicating with these servers because only the apps interact with them and they do so in the background. until now, that has been a blind spot where nobody was looking for vulnerabilities." 
 the air force office of scientific research and the national science foundation supported the research. 
 in their study, the researchers discovered 983 instances of known vulnerabilities and another 655 instances of zero-day vulnerabilities spanning across the software layers - operating systems, software services, communications modules and web apps - of the cloud-based systems supporting the apps. the researchers are still investigating whether attackers could get into individual mobile devices connected to vulnerable servers. 
 "these vulnerabilities affect the servers that are in the cloud, and once an attacker gets on the server, there are many ways they can attack," saltaformaggio said. "it's a whole new question whether or not they can jump from the server to a user's device, but our preliminary research on that is very concerning." 
 the researchers identified three types of attack that could be made on the backend servers: sql injection, xml external entity and cross-site scripting, explained omar alrawi, a georgia tech graduate research assistant and co-first author with chaoshun zuo at ohio state. by taking control of these machines in the cloud, attackers could gain access to personal data, delete or alter information or even redirect financial transactions to deposit funds in their own accounts. 
 to study the system, alrawi and zuo ran applications in a controlled environment on a mobile device that connected to backend servers. they then watched the communications between the device and servers, and repeated the process for all of the applications studied. 
 "we found that a lot of applications don't encrypt the communications between the mobile app and the cloud service, so an attacker that is between the two points or on the same network as the mobile could get information about the user - their location and user name - and potentially execute password resets," alrawi said. 
 the vulnerabilities were not easy to spot. "you have to understand the context through which the app communicates with the cloud server," he said. "these are very deep bugs that cannot be identified by simply scanning and using traditional tools that are used for web application security." 
 the operators of vulnerable systems were notified of the findings. concerns about who is responsible for securing those backend servers is one of the issues to come out of the study. 
 "it's actually a significant problem because of how many different software developers may have their hands in building these cloud servers," saltaformaggio said. "it's not always clear who is responsible for doing the patching and who is responsible for the vulnerabilities. it's tough to track down these vulnerabilities, but it's also tough to get them patched." 
 to save app developers from having to do the security research they did, the researchers are offering skywalker, an analysis pipeline to study mobile backends. developers will be able to submit their apps to skywalker at 
 https: / / mobilebackend.vet 
 and get a report on what it finds. 
 "skywalker will watch how the application communicates with those cloud servers, and then it will try to communicate with the servers to find vulnerabilities," said alrawi. "this information can give an app developer a heads-up about potential problems before they make their application public." 
 the researchers studied only applications in the google play store. but applications designed for ios may share the same backend systems. 
 "these servers provide backend services for mobile apps that any device could use," alrawi said. "these cloud services are essential components of modern mobile apps. they are part of the always-connected world." 
 for the future, the researchers hope to study how the vulnerabilities could affect smartphone users, and to check on whether the problems they identified have been addressed. 
 "we are going to keep doing these sorts of studies and will revisit them later to see how the attack landscape has improved," said saltaformaggio. "we will keep looking for more blind spots that need to be studied. in the new world of smartphones and mobile applications, there are unique problems that need to be rooted out." 
 in addition to those already mentioned, the research team included ruian duan and ranjita pai kasturi from georgia tech and zhiqiang lin from ohio state.

-0.9417 liberal arts the social media profile of the black lives matter movement 
 study examines 29 million tweets surrounding four recent black lives matter events. 
 jun 07, 2016 
 - atlanta, ga 
 researchers at the georgia institute of technology looked at nearly 29 million tweets surrounding four recent black lives matter (blm) events to identify the social media patterns of its activists. they found that the community is unlike many other social movements because of its ability to bond over the course of many months. more than a third of those who participated via social media for the first time continued their participation during the next blm event. the study also found being from a state with historically high rates of black victimization due to police violence, especially in the south and midwest, was linked to peoples' response on social media even if the state wasn't the scene of the current blm event. the researchers also found a change in tone on twitter the day before protests sprung up around the nation. the georgia tech study is among the first to examine the online language of the blm movement. it collected tweets surrounding four major events: the shooting of michael brown in ferguson, missouri (august 2014); the decision not to indict ferguson police officer darren wilson (november 2014); protests and the shooting deaths of two new york city police officers (december 2014); and the death of freddie gray while in custody of baltimore police officers (april 2015). the team also plugged in data of more than 10,000 deaths due to police shootings since 2000. from that, it outlined which states, based on their african-american population, had the highest rates of deaths. missouri, kansas, oklahoma and new mexico were among the highest in the mainland united states. "these were the same states where we found very negative language on twitter during black lives matter events," said munmun de choudhury, the georgia tech assistant professor who led the study. "other areas, especially in the south and midwest, used words about death to express their feelings. potentially, twitter users in states with historically higher rates of fatal police shootings of blacks tend to interact with others to seek and provide psychosocial support around issues of racial inequality." however, much of that negativity disappeared on the immediate eve of protests. language changed. the researchers noticed that tweets about death, anger and first person singular nouns transformed into more posts about family, friends and first person plural pronouns. "we saw more sadness but lower anger and anxiety the day before protests," said benjamin sugar, a georgia tech master's student who co-authored the study. "it doesn't mean they weren't angry or anxious. but in 140 characters, people showed thoughts of moving forward and making a difference." blm was born on facebook in 2013 following the acquittal of george zimmerman in the shooting death of florida's trayvon martin. during each subsequent event, the movement has contradicted typical twitter stereotypes. the study found that on average 36 percent of first-time blm users participated again. "other hashtag movements have helped spread awareness about important issues, but many of them quickly lose their momentum," said shagun jhaver, a georgia tech ph.d. student and co-author. "the black lives matter movement realizes it's part of a long-term social transformation and shows continual engagement. and it continues despite having no formal hierarchal structure."   the research, " social media participation in an activist movement for racial equality ,"  won best paper when it was presented last month at the international aaai conference on web and social media in germany. it was funded, in part, by the national institutes of health ( # 1r01gm11269701). any opinions, findings, and conclusions or recommendations expressed in this material are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of the national institutes of health.

-0.8564 liberal arts social media study identifies mental health culture at top-ranked campuses 
 using social media, researchers create a mental health index for country's top-ranked colleges. 
 munmun de choudhury is an assistant professor in the school of interactive computing. 
 jun 01, 2017 
 - atlanta, ga 
 using information gleaned from social media, researchers from the georgia institute of technology have created a mental health index for the nation's highest-ranked colleges and universities. their study looked at five years of data on reddit, scanning it for comments about issues that included depression, financial and academic anxiety and thoughts of suicide. schools were given a score based on the frequency of those threads and robustness of the conversations. 
 the research found that students at higher-ranked schools have better mental health than those at lower-ranked colleges. the well-being index is also better at universities with higher tuition. it's lower at large public schools with a majority of female students. 
 the study doesn't identify schools individually for privacy reasons. 
 "online conversations about mental health issues are definitely increasing," said munmun de choudhury, georgia tech's assistant professor, from the school of interactive computing, who led the study. "we saw it rise 16 percent from 2011 to 2015, even after we took into account that reddit has become more popular in recent years." 
 the study focused on the top 150 universities as ranked by 
 u.s. news & world report , gathering data from the 109 of them with active reddit accounts. 
 de choudhury suggests that the reason there are less posts about tuition anxiety at more expensive colleges is because their students tend to be more affluent than the average public school attendee. therefore, the stresses of paying for college or going into debt aren't as great. de choudhury also thinks that the wider variety of backgrounds at large public schools likely lends itself to a more robust sharing of stress and anxiety issues. 
 "as for more posts about mental health at universities with more females, i don't think it's necessarily because women have more anxiety," de choudhury said. "research has traditionally shown that females are more likely to express their emotions and feelings whether in an offline setting or social media. it's not that they have poorer mental health - it's that they're more likely to talk about their troubles while online." 
 the study also found an overall increase in mental health posts as the academic year progressed. it peaked in the fall in november and was even higher in may. it gradually decreased each summer. 
 the georgia tech team used a method called transfer learning to mine the data. first, they created a model to scan subreddit threads about depression, bipolar disorder and other issues to learn patterns of what is written when people discuss mental health. then the model was used on the higher education subreddit communities. 
 the algorithm scanned the five years of discussions, day by day, looking for clues. once it found keywords and phrases, it measured the breadth of the conversations. the more frequent the posts and depths of the discussions, the lower the respective mental health indexes. 
 overall, three percent of the threads on the 109 sites were about mental health topics. 
 de choudhury has previously done similar social media research to help identify expressions of 
 eating disorders , 
 postpartum depression 
 and 
 suicide . 
 "i've always wondered if there are things about college students and mental health that we could learn by using these same social media research tactics," de choudhury said. "we wanted to see if we could do something more collectively at the campus level before digging deeper to understand the challenges individuals might be facing. perhaps this data can be used to help campus administrators as they create policies in real-time to benefit student bodies dealing with stress and anxieties." 
 the paper, " a social media-based index of mental well-being in college campuses ," was presented this month at the 2017 acm conference on human factors in computing systems (chi 2017) in denver.

-0.7556 STEM sticking to the schedule was difficult for apollo astronauts 
 new report finds that apollo astronauts often fell behind schedule while on the moon. 
 jan 18, 2018 
 - atlanta, ga 
 no one plans like nasa, and when it came to exploring the moon, the apollo program was no different. however, even despite their best efforts, the astronauts consistently demonstrated the challenges of keeping to schedule. 
 georgia tech researchers analyzed the archived mission reports from the apollo moonwalks to see how well moonwalkers were able to stick to their expected timelines. 
 on almost every walk or drive on the lunar surface, astronauts fell behind - sometimes as much as an hour, forcing them to drop specific tasks from the schedule. 
 the report could held guide officials as they plan for crewed missions to mars.

-0.9894 STEM study finds "lurking malice" in cloud hosting services 
 a study of 20 major cloud hosting services has found that as many as 10 percent of the repositories hosted by them had been compromised.

 oct 19, 2016 
 - atlanta, ga 
 a study of 20 major cloud hosting services has found that as many as 10 percent of the repositories hosted by them had been compromised - with several hundred of the "buckets" actively providing malware. such bad content could be challenging to find, however, because it can be rapidly assembled from stored components that individually may not appear to be malicious. 
 to identify the bad content, researchers created a scanning tool that looks for features unique to the bad repositories, known as "bars." the features included certain types of redirection schemes and "gatekeeper" elements designed to protect the malware from scanners. researchers from the georgia institute of technology, indiana university bloomington and the university of california santa barbara conducted the study. 
 believed to be the first systematic study of cloud-based malicious activity, the research will be presented october 24 at the acm conference on computer and communications security in vienna, austria.  the work was supported in part by the national science foundation. 
 "bad actors have migrated to the cloud along with everybody else," said 
 raheem beyah , a professor in georgia tech's 
 school of electrical and computer engineering . "the bad guys are using the cloud to deliver malware and other nefarious things while remaining undetected. the resources they use are compromised in a variety of ways, from traditional exploits to simply taking advantage of poor configurations." 
 beyah and graduate student xiaojing liao found that the bad actors could hide their activities by keeping components of their malware in separate repositories that by themselves didn't trigger traditional scanners. only when they were needed to launch an attack were the different parts of this malware assembled. 
 "some exploits appear to be benign until they are assembled in a certain way," explained beyah, who is the motorola foundation professor and associate chair for strategic initiatives and innovation in the school of electrical and computer engineering. "when you scan the components in a piecemeal kind of way, you only see part of the malware, and the part you see may not be malicious." 
 in the cloud, malicious actors take advantage of how difficult it can be to scan so much storage. operators of cloud hosting services may not have the resources to do the deep scans that may be necessary to find the bars - and their monitoring of repositories may be limited by service-level agreements. 
 while splitting the malicious software up helped hide it, the strategy also created a technique for finding the "bad buckets" hosting it, beyah said. many of the bad actors had redundant repositories connected by specific kinds of redirection schemes that allowed attacks to continue if one bucket were lost. the bad buckets also usually had "gatekeepers" designed to keep scanners out of the repositories, and where webpages were served, they had simple structures that were easy to propagate. 
 "we observed that there is an inherent structure associated with how these attackers have set things up," he explained. "for instance, the bad guys all had bodyguards at the door. that's not normal for cloud storage, and we used that structure to detect them." 
 the researchers began by studying a small number of known bad repositories to understand how they were being used. based on what they learned, they created "barfinder," a scanner tool that automatically searches for and detects features common to the bad repositories. 
 overall, the researchers scanned more than 140,000 sites on 20 cloud hosting sites and found about 700 active repositories for malicious content. in total, about 10 percent of cloud repositories the team studied had been compromised in some way. the researchers notified the cloud hosting companies of their findings before publication of the study. 
 "it's pervasive in the cloud," said beyah. "we found problems in every last one of the hosting services we studied. we believe this is a significant problem for the cloud hosting industry." 
 in some cases, the bad actors simply opened an inexpensive account and began hosting their software. in other cases, the malicious content was hidden in the cloud-based domains of well-known brands. intermingling the bad content with good content in the brand domains protected the malware from blacklisting of the domain. 
 beyah and liao saw a wide range of attacks in the cloud hosted repositories, ranging from phishing and common drive-by downloads to fake antivirus and computer update sites. "they can attack you directly from these buckets, or they can redirect you to other malicious buckets or a series of malicious buckets," he said. "it can be difficult to see where the code is redirecting you." 
 to protect cloud-based repositories from these attacks, beyah recommends the usual defenses, including patching of systems and proper configuration settings. 
 looking ahead, the researchers hope to make barfinder available to a broader audience. that could include licensing the technology to a security company, or making it available as an open-source tool. 
 "attackers are very clever, and as we secure things and make the cloud infrastructure more challenging for them to attack, they will move onto something else," he said. "in the meantime, every system that we can secure makes the internet just a little bit safer."

-0.9872 STEM study shows cellular rna can template dna repair in yeast 
 scientists have shown that rna from within cells of a common yeast can serve as a template for repairing dna.

 sep 03, 2014 
 - atlanta, ga 
 the ability to accurately repair dna damaged by spontaneous errors, oxidation or mutagens is crucial to the survival of cells. this repair is normally accomplished by using an identical or homologous intact sequence of dna, but scientists have now shown that rna produced within cells of a common budding yeast can serve as a template for repairing the most devastating dna damage - a break in both strands of a dna helix. earlier research had shown that synthetic rna oligonucleotides introduced into cells could help repair dna breaks, but the new study is believed to be the first to show that a cell's own rna could be used for dna recombination and repair. the finding provides a better understanding of how cells maintain genomic stability, and if the phenomenon extends to human cells, could potentially lead to new therapeutic or prevention strategies for genetic-based disease. the research was supported by the national science foundation, the national institutes of health and the georgia research alliance. the results were reported september 3, 2014, in the journal 
 nature . "we have found that genetic information can flow from rna to dna in a homology-driven manner, from cellular rna to a homologous dna sequence," said francesca storici, an associate professor in the school of biology at the georgia institute of technology and senior author of the paper. "this process is moving the genetic information in the opposite direction from which it normally flows. we have shown that when an endogenous rna molecule can anneal to broken homologous dna without being removed, the rna can repair the damaged dna. this finding reveals the existence of a novel mechanism of genetic recombination." most newly-transcribed rna is quickly exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm of cells to perform its many essential roles in gene coding and expression, and in regulation of cell operations. generally, rna is kept away from - or removed from - nuclear dna. in fact, it is known that annealing of rna with complementary chromosomal dna is dangerous for cells because it may impair transcription elongation and dna replication, promoting genome instability. this new study reveals that under conditions of genotoxic stress, such as a break in dna, the role of rna paired with complementary dna may be different, and beneficial, for a cell. "we discovered a mechanism in which transcript rna anneals with complementary broken dna and serves as a template for recombination and dna repair, and thus has a role in both modifying and stabilizing the genome," storici explained. dna damage can arise from a variety of causes both inside and outside the cell. because the dna consists of two complementary strands, one strand can normally be used to repair damage to the other. however, if the cell sustains breakage in both strands - known as a double-strand break - the repair options are more limited. simply rejoining the broken ends carries a high risk of unwanted mutations or chromosome rearrangement, which can cause undesirable effects including cancer. without successful repair, however, the cell may die or be unable to carry out important functions. beginning in 2007, storici's research team showed that synthetic rna introduced into cells - including human cells - could repair dna damage, but the process was inefficient and there were questions about whether the process could occur naturally. to find out whether cells could use endogenous rna transcripts to repair dna damage, she and graduate students havva keskin and ying shen - who are first and second authors on the paper - devised experiments using the yeast 
 saccharomyces cerevisiae , which is widely used in the lab for genetics and genome engineering. the researchers developed a strategy for distinguishing repair by endogenous rna from repair by the normal dna-based mechanisms in the budding yeast cells, including using mutants that lacked the ability to convert the rna into a dna copy. they then induced a dna double-strand break in the yeast genome and observed whether the organism could survive and grow by repairing the damage using only transcript rna within the cells. the dna region that generates the transcript was constructed to contain a marker gene interrupted by an intron, which is a sequence that is removed only from the rna during the process of transcription, explained keskin. following intron removal, the transcript rna sequence has no intron, while the dna region that generates the transcript retains the intron; thus they are distinguishable. only the repair templated by the transcript devoid of the intron can restore the function of a homologous marker gene in which the dna double-strand break is induced, she added. the researchers measured success by counting the number of yeast colonies growing on a petri dish, indicating that the repair had been made by endogenous rna. testing was done on two types of breaks, one in the dna from which the rna transcript had been made, and the other in a homologous sequence from a different location in the dna. the research team, which also included scientists from drexel university, found that proximity of the rna to the broken dna increased the efficiency of the repair and that the repair occurred via a homologous recombination process. storici believes that the repair mechanism may operate in cells beyond yeast, and that many types of rna can be used. "we are showing that the flow of genetic information from rna to dna is not restricted to retro-elements and telomeres, but occurs with a generic cellular transcript, making it more of a general phenomenon than had been anticipated," she explained. "potentially, any rna in the cell could have this function." for the future, storici hopes to learn more about the mechanism, including what regulates it. she also wants to learn whether it takes place in human cells. if so, that could have implications for treating or preventing diseases that are caused by genetic damage. "cells synthesize lots of rna transcripts during their life spans; therefore, rna may have an unanticipated impact on genomic stability and plasticity," said storici, who is also a georgia research alliance distinguished cancer scientist. "we need to understand in which situations cells would activate rna-dna recombination. better understanding this molecular process could also help us manipulate mechanisms for therapy, allowing us to treat a disease or prevent it altogether." in addition to storici, the paper's authors include alexander mazin, a professor in the department of biochemistry and molecular biology at drexel university; postdoctoral fellow fei huang and graduate student mikir patel, also from drexel; havva keskin, a georgia tech graduate student; ying shen, a ph.d. graduate from georgia tech who is now a postdoctoral fellow at boston university school of medicine; and graduate student taehwan yang and undergraduate student katie ashley from school of biology at georgia tech. this research is supported by the national science foundation under award number mcb-1021763, by the national institutes of health under award numbers ca100839 and p30ca056036, and by the georgia research alliance under award number r9028. any conclusions or opinions are those of the authors and do not necessarily represent the official views of the sponsoring agencies. citation : havva keskin, et al., "transcript-rna-templated dna recombination and repair," nature 2014.

 the georgia institute of technology is at the forefront of developing technologies and solutions related to cancer detection and treatment, thanks to support from the 
 advanced research projects agency for health 
 (arpa-h). 
 president joe biden's cancer moonshot initiative aims to cut the cancer death rate by half in 25 years. three projects connected to georgia tech, which have collectively received $119 million from arpa-h, are doing just that. 
 with a grant worth up to $50 million, georgia tech will lead development of a new generation of cancer tests capable of detecting multiple types of tumors earlier than ever. led by biomedical engineer 
 gabe kwong , the project will map the unique cellular profiles of cancer cells and leverage that knowledge to build new bioengineered sensors to detect those profiles. the goal is to create a new kind of multi-cancer early detection test that would allow oncologists to start treating the tumors sooner, when they're still small and most responsive. 
 the project is the third with ties to georgia tech received in recent weeks. professor philip santangelo, professor in the wallace h. coulter department of biomedical engineering at georgia tech and emory university, 
 received the first tranche of funding from the agency 
 - $24 million - for a project building a toolbox of mrna drugs to activate or shut off specific genes to help the immune system fight cancer and other disorders. 
 josiah hester in the school of interactive computing 
 is co-principal investigator of a $45 million rice university-led effort to develop an implant to help the body better respond to cancer treatments. 
 celine lin , associate professor in the school of computer science, is working with hester to develop ultra-energy-efficient chips for signal processing and embedded control. together, they will develop a robust platform that is energy-efficient enough to last for months. 
 "at arpa-h, we recognize the urgency of the health challenges facing cancer patients and their families." said arpa-h director renee wegrzyn, "and we are committed to funding truly transformative research that can improve health outcomes for everyone."

-0.9951 STEM thwarting metastasis by breaking cancer's legs with gold rods 
 metastasis virtually halted in human in vitro cultures via gold nanorod photothermal therapy

 - atlanta, ga 
 "your cancer has metastasized. i'm sorry," is something no one wants to hear a doctor say. 
 cancer cells 
 kill most often 
 by crawling away from their original tumors to later re-root in vital parts of the body in a process called 
 metastasis . now, a research team led by the georgia institute of technology 
 has developed a new treatment 
 to thwart cancer's spread through the body by, in a sense, breaking cancer cells' legs. 
 cancer cells often cover themselves with bristly leg-like protrusions that enable them to creep. the researchers have used minuscule gold rods heated gently by a laser to mangle the protrusions, 
 according to a new study . the treatment prevented cell migration, a key mechanism in metastasis, in experiments on common laboratory cultures ( in vitro ) of cancerous human cells. 
 the method could potentially, in the future, offer clinicians going after individual tumors a weapon to combat cancer's deadly spread at the same time. the medical field is currently less than well-equipped to stop metastasis. 
 "if cancer stays in a tumor in one place, you can get to it, and it's not so likely to kill the patient, but when it spreads around the body, that's what really makes it deadly," said lead researcher 
 mostafa el-sayed, julius brown chair and regents professor 
 at georgia tech's 
 school of chemistry and biochemistry. 
 the treatment can also easily kill cancer cells, but in this experiment, it was vital to specifically show that it greatly slowed cell migration. the method is not scheduled for human testing. 
 halting cancer softly 
 the experimental treatment also spared healthy cells, in these and in prior experiments, making the method potentially much less 
 taxing on patients than commonly used chemotherapy . in past tests in animal models, the researchers have uncovered no toxic side effects from the gold used in the treatment, and have found no observable damage to healthy tissue from the low-energy laser. 
 and they did not see recurrence of the treated cancer. 
 "the method appears to be very effective as a locally administered treatment that also protects the body from cancer's spread away from the treated tumors, and it is also very mild, so it can be applied many times over if needed," el-sayed said. 
 el-sayed, 
 co-lead author ronghu wu , and first authors yue wu and moustafa ali published the results of their current 
 in vitro 
 experiments, a new development in 
 photothermal gold nanorod therapy , on june 26, 2017, in the 
 proceedings of the national academy of sciences. 
 the research was funded by the national science foundation and the national institutes of health. 
 how it works: icky legs 
 to understand how the treatment works, let's take a close-up look at a cell and some things that happen to it in malignant cancer. 
 many people think of cells as watery balloons -- fluid encased in a membrane sheath with organelles floating around inside. but that picture is incomplete. cells have support grids called 
 cytoskeletons 
 that give them form and that have functions. 
 the cytoskeletons also form bristly 
 protrusions called filopodia, which extend out from a weave of fibers called lamellipodia 
 that are on the cell's fringes. the protrusions normally help healthy cells shift their location in the tissue that they are part of. 
 but in malignant cancer, normally healthy cell functions often lunge into destructive overdrive. lamellipodia and filopodia are wildly overproduced. 
 "all these lamellipodia and filopodia give the cancer cells legs," said yue wu, a graduate student in bioanalytical chemistry. "the metastasis requires those protrusions, so the cells can travel." 
 how it works: sticky rods 
 the 
 gold nanorods 
 thwart the protrusions in two ways. the rods are comprised of a small collection of gold atoms - nano refers to something being just billionths of meters (or feet) in size. 
 first, el-sayed's nanorods are introduced locally, where they encumber the leggy protrusions on cancerous cells. the rods are coated with molecules ( rgd-peptide s) that make them stick specifically to a type of cell protein called 
 integrin . 
 "the targeted nanorods tied up the integrin and blocked its functions, so it could not keep guiding the cytoskeleton to overproduce lamellipodia and filopodia," said yan tang, a postdoctoral assistant in computational biology who worked on the study. the binding of the integrin alone slowed down the migration of malignant cells. 
 but healthy cells were not targeted. "there are certain, specific integrins that are overproduced in cancerous cells," said moustafa ali, one of the study's first authors. "and you don't find them so much in healthy cells." 
 how it works: gentle laser heating 
 in the second phase, researchers hit the gold nanoparticles with a low-energy laser of near-infrared (nir) light. it brought the migration of the cancer cells to an observable halt. 
 "the light was not absorbed by the cells, but the gold nanorods absorbed it, and as a result, they heated up and partially melted cancer cells they are connected with, mangling lamellipodia and filopodia," ali said. "it didn't kill all the cells, not in this experiment. if we killed them, we would not have been able to observe whether we stopped them from migrating or not." 
 if desired, the treatment can also be adjusted to kill the cells. 
 early experiments in animal models 
 in vivo 
 with hotter lasers didn't work as well.  "that caused inflammation, which made it possible to heat one time only," ali said. "as a result, that high temperature would wipe out many cancer cells, but not all of them. some hidden ones might have survived, and also still been able to migrate." 
 "this gentle laser didn't burn the skin or damage tissue, so it could be dosed multiple times and more thoroughly stop the cancer cells from being able to travel," said researcher ronghu wu. 
 medical possibilities 
 the researchers presently envision treating head, neck, breast, and skin cancers with direct, local nanorod injections combined with the low-power near-infrared laser, which can hit the gold nanorods 2-3 centimeters (a bit under or over an inch) deep inside tissue. "but it could go as deep as 4-5 centimeters," ali said. 
 deeper tumors could conceivably be treated with deeper injections of nanorods. "then you'd need to go in with a fiber optic or endoscopic laser," el-sayed said. injecting the nanorods directly into the bloodstream as a broad treatment would not currently be a viable option. 
 el-sayed's group has previously published 
 in vivo  experiments in mice 
 in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences together with emory university school of medicine . that study showed no observable toxicity from the gold in mice 15 months after treatment. 
 "a lot of it ended up in the liver and spleen," el-sayed said. "but the functions of these organs appeared intact upon examination, and treated mice were alive and healthy over a year later." 
 presidential honors 
 mostafa el-sayed is one of the world's most highly decorated and cited living chemists, and a pioneer of nanoscience and technology. among his many recognitions are 
 the president's national medal of science, awarded by president george w. bush , and the 
 priestley medal , the american chemical society's highest honor. 
 president barack h. obama appointed el-sayed to the president's national medal of science committee . el-sayed also participated in the nomination of chemistry 
 nobel laureate ahmed zewail. 
 el-sayed is known throughout physical chemistry for " el-sayed's rule ," which handles complexities of electron spin orbits, and which has found a lasting place in photochemistry textbooks. after losing his wife to cancer in 2005, el-sayed dedicated his knowledge and research to ending the scourge.

 for most people, the drip, drip, drip of a leaking faucet would be an annoyance. but for georgia institute of technology ph.d. candidate alexandros fragkopoulos, what happens inside droplets is the stuff of serious science. 
 in the laboratory of 
 alberto fernandez-nieves 
 in georgia tech's 
 school of physics , fragkopoulos is studying how toroidal droplets - which initially take the shape of a donut - evolve into spherical droplets by collapsing into themselves or breaking up into smaller droplets. 
 work with droplets has implications for the life sciences, where biological materials, including cells, undergo shape changes reminiscent of droplet behavior. and the findings could improve industrial processes ranging from fuel injectors to chemical processes that depend on droplet formation. in the work, researchers in the fernandez-nieves lab have developed a new understanding of the processes that control the evolution of unstable, donut-shaped droplets, helping them clarify the complex interplay of forces relevant to the problem. 
 "surface tension drives the evolution of the droplets," said fragkopoulos. "fluids tend to minimize their surface area for a given volume because that minimizes the energy required to have an interface between different fluids. spherical shapes minimize that energy, and as a result, toroidal droplets want to evolve to become spherical. we're studying how that transition occurs." 
 using a sheet of laser light to observe the scattering from polystyrene particles placed into droplets formed within thick silicone oil, the researchers have observed in detail how droplets change shape - and which factors set the droplets on the path to either collapse or breakup. the research, which was supported by the national science foundation, was reported march 1 in the journal 
 proceedings of the national academy of sciences . 
 "the viscous forcing as the torus collapses exerts stress on the interface, which causes it to both have a circulation inside the torus and deform its surface," said fragkopoulos. "we need to take into account these stresses to completely understand the evolution of the droplets." 
 the impetus for the experimental work was inconsistencies between theoretical predictions and computer simulation of toroidal droplet transitions. what the georgia tech researchers found tends to back up the simulation results. "however, the earlier theoretical work was essential in guiding the theory efforts and in illustrating what the problem was in order to correctly describe the experimental results," said fernandez-nieves. 
 "parameters such as the aspect ratio - the overall dimension of the torus divided by the dimensions of the tube - determine whether the toroidal droplet can break up, or if it will simply collapse into itself," said fragkopoulos. "we found that the toroidal droplet deforms a lot from the donut shape as it collapses. it flattens as it develops, which was initially unexpected. we had expected the torus to be symmetrical and nicely circular, which is not what we found." 
 the breakup or collapse of ordinary raindrops is known to involve the formation of a donut-like rim. however, the process is rather uncontrolled and takes place quickly, so quickly that only high-speed cameras could see it. to allow detailed study of the transition and imaging the flow field within the drops, fragkopoulos dramatically slowed down the evolution by creating droplets within a type of silicone oil that is six times more viscous than honey. instead of ordinary water, he used distilled water into which polyethylene glycol has been mixed to further slow the dynamics. 
 the water is introduced into a rotating bath of the silicone oil using a tiny needle injector. by controlling the pumping rate and where the needle inserts the water, the researchers can control the geometrical parameters of the toroidal droplets, specifically the thickness of the ring and the relative size of the hole inside it. the droplets they study range in size up to about a centimeter in diameter. "this simple strategy affords exquisite control," said fernandez-nieves. 
 polystyrene beads in the water allow the researchers to use particle image velocimetry (piv) to see the flow fields within the droplets, showing how the cross section deviates from circular over time. 
 "we are using the difference in viscosity to generate the torus," fragkopoulos explained. "we are using viscous forces to generate the droplets, because it's important to slow down the dynamics of the torus collapse so we can have enough time and resolution to see the flow fields developing inside it." 
 research into droplet formation has tended to be applications-focused. now fragkopoulos and fernandez-nieves are using their experimental and theoretical work to address other science problems. 
 "we are now using the methods for creating toroidal objects made from different materials to study problems in condensed matter and bioengineering," said fernandez-nieves. "we started working on toroidal droplets with the idea of studying how topology and geometry affected how ordered materials are affected by these aspects, and later to address how curvature affects cell behavior. we wanted to make nontrivial geometries so we could study how this affects behavior," added fragkopoulos. 
 the next step in the work is to study electrically-charged droplets, which are widely used industrially. the electrical charges add a new wrinkle to the flow fields and change how the toroidal droplets transform. in addition to those already mentioned, the research included former graduate and undergraduate students in the fernandez-nieves lab, ekapop pairam and eric berger, and prof. phil segre at oxford college, georgia.

-0.9929 STEM unique bacterial chemist in the war on potatoes 
 a bacterial warrior the only one of its kind? this enzyme is "wacko" in the ways it breaks down a poison related to tnt. 
 a bacterial warrior the only one of its kind? this enzyme is "wacko" in many ways in its breakdown of a poison related to tnt. on top of that, 5naa-a is known so far only to exist in a single living organism on earth. could it be the lone master of a rare bacterial enzymatic kung fu, in the war on potatoes? or does a genomic clue point to its existence in one other solitary case? 
 oct 03, 2016 
 - atlanta, ga 
 in fertile farm soils where potatoes grow, 
 streptomyces scabies 
 bacteria wage war using chemicals related to explosives and pesticides. 
 but a microbial spoiler defuses one of 
 s. scabies ' poisons. researchers at the georgia institute of technology have gained new insights into a one-of-a-kind mechanism it employs, which could someday contribute to the development of new agents to degrade tough pollutants and help rescue crops. 
 when 
 s. scabies 
 infects potatoes, it spews poisons called thaxtomins, which riddle potatoes with familiar dark scabs. perhaps a trifle to the potato connoisseur excising them with a paring knife, on a global scale, the blemishes add up to a slash in agricultural production. 
 unprecedented moves 
 scientists investigating potato soil found that bacteria of the species 
 bradyrhizobium sp. js329 
 run interference. though their tough enzymes don't break down thaxtomins, they do render innocuous another 
 s. scabies 
 toxic secretion called 
 5-nitroanthranilic acid 
 (5-naa). 
 still, understanding how it is broken down could prove useful to agriculture. "the 5naa molecule is similar enough to thaxtomin that studying its degradation might inspire future work to engineer an enzyme or bacterium, or even the plant itself, to detoxify thaxtomin," lieberman said. 
 one enzyme in particular uses seemingly unprecedented and spectacular chemical tricks to tear apart 5-naa's otherwise ironclad chemical structure. 
 researchers uncovered them and published the results in the 
 journal nature chemical biology on monday, october 3, 2016 . the research was funded by the national science foundation, pew charitable trusts, georgia internship for teachers, and the u.s. department of energy. 
 chemical warfare 
 s. scabies 
 bacteria are masters of chemical warfare, and not just against potatoes. 
 "this family of bacteria is known for the ability to synthesize lots of different molecules, including ones that humans use as antibiotics," said senior researcher 
 raquel lieberman, an associate professor 
 at georgia tech's 
 school of chemistry and biochemistry . 
 "they're good at killing other organisms," she said. though the thaxtomins they secrete are well-known for marring potatoes, little is known about toxin 5naa. 
 enzymatic kung fu 
 5naa has met its match in bacterium bradyrhizobium sp. js329, which we'll call "brady" for short. 
 "brady" produces enzymes that can combat 5naa, the first of which is called 5naa-a. the added "a" after the dash stands for "aminohydrolase," a term that means it uses water to alter part of toxin 5naa. 
 the "substitution reaction" that enzyme 5naa-a carries out is common in organic synthesis, but extremely rare in living things. "there's only one other known enzyme confirmed to utilize this particular chemical mechanism," lieberman said. 
 lieberman's team, which specializes in making protein crystals of enzymes like 5naa-a, observed the moment of the ensuing reaction.  "we were able to capture the critical step (hydrolysis) in the crystal for this paper," she said. 
 "it does this wacko chemical reaction," lieberman said. 5naa-a helps destroy toxin 5naa in two ways that are like outlandish kung fu moves. 
 breaking the wrong arm 
 toxin 5naa enters the "brady" bacterium with a deadly weapon. a nitro group, or no2, is part of its structure, which makes 5naa a nitroaromatic compound. 
 "basically, all these nitroaromatics are either explosive or toxic," lieberman said. " tnt 
 is not that different from this compound." 
 plenty of bacteria have evolved enzymes to tackle synthetic nitroaromatics -- pollutants like dyes, pesticides or explosives that have been dumped in our environment. the enzymes tend to use the same strategy. "the nitro groups are typically the first target of any degrading enzyme, because they are so toxic," lieberman said. 
 not so for enzyme 5naa-a. 
 it goes after another group on the toxic molecule, the amine, which is innocuous. it's like a kung fu master breaking the arm opposite of the one with the weapon. but it works. 
 by hydrolyzing the amine, enzyme 5naa-a sets up toxin 5naa for destruction by other enzymes.  "the fact that it does it without removing the nitro is the weird part. it's an unexpected move," lieberman said. 
 kryptonite suicide 
 then there's the weirdness around metal. 
 5naa-a is a metalloprotease, an enzyme that needs a metal ion to do its work.  but unlike other metalloproteases, it doesn't have one embedded in it.  it can operate with one of four different metals, but 5naa-a can't seem to find the metal on its own. 
 "it relies on 5naa to bring it to the party," lieberman said. 
 in other words, poison 5naa seems to tow a metal ion up to enzyme 5naa-a, which then takes it away and uses it to destroy the poison. it's like superman handing off kryptonite to an arch enemy. 
 "at least that's very much what we think is happening," lieberman said.  "we're going to investigate the details further." 
 solitary master 
 the sum of 5naa-a's weird ways led lieberman's team to check an enormous genome database for matches of the gene sequence that can produce an enzyme like 5naa-a.  they found only one single known other example on earth. 
 "that enzyme gene sequence comes from sediment in yellowstone national park," lieberman said. it is not yet confirmed that bacteria housing it actually detoxify 5naa, though it's likely. 
 even if it does, enzyme 5naa-a remains uncommonly rare, given the myriad microbes on earth producing an even higher number of enzymes. "the fact that there may just be one other is mind-boggling," lieberman said. 
 high school researchers 
 in another rarity, a high school science teacher is one of the authors on the research paper. 
 casey bethel , who was named 
 georgia teacher of the year for 2017 , helped the other researchers break through a barrier that was holding up progress. 
 "we use so-called tags to identify the enzyme we're interested in when we go to harvest it. we suspected the tags were interfering in the crystallization process," bethel said. so, he cloned the proteins with removable tags, which significantly helped the project move forward. 
 bethel participates in georgia tech's 
 main k-12 outreach, ceismc , which, among other things, boosts stem education among underserved populations in georgia public schools. and for three years, ceismc has helped him improve his teaching skills. 
 bethel has also 
 brought high school students to work in lieberman's lab with him . he's thrilled that he -- and they -- could be a part of the study. "fantastical! unimaginable! who'd think that a high school teacher would be published in a nature journal?" bethel said. 
 since starting with georgia tech's outreach, bethel has seen at least 60 of his former students choose stem studies and careers. "whereas before, the number was close to zero," he said. "it's indescribable. it's momentous, magnificent and impactful. i'll never be able to measure the impact."

-0.9984 STEM urine test detects organ transplant rejection, could replace needle biopsies 
 new nanoparticle makes urine glow as soon as t cells initiate an attack on transplanted organs 
 a t cell, here in purple, makes contact with a transplant organ cell, here in reddish brown. the t cell secretes the enzyme granzyme b, here in gray, which attacks the organ cell. but granzyme b also severs fluorescent signal molecules, in green, from the rejection detecting nanoparticle, in light pink. the signal molecules make their way into the urine, where they give off a fluorescent cue. georgia tech  / ellamaru studio (work for hire, all rights gt, free for distribution). 
 feb 19, 2019 
 - atlanta, ga 
 too often, it's only after a transplanted organ is seriously damaged that a biopsy reveals the organ is in rejection. a new screening method using sensor particles and a urine test could catch rejection much earlier, more comprehensively, and without a biopsy needle. 
 when the body's immune system has just begun attacking cells of a transplanted organ, the new method's particles send a fluorescent signal into the urine. in a  new study , researchers at the georgia institute of technology and emory university validated the method in a mouse model, and they have engineered the sensor with highly biocompatible components, which could make the path to potential future trials easier. 
 a patient may feel fine, and a biopsy may look deceptively clean when t cells have already begun attacking a transplanted organ. the sensor particle, a  nanoparticle , detects a t cell weapon, an enzyme called granzyme b, that pushes a transplanted organ's cells into the self-destruction process called  apoptosis . 
 earliest detection 
 "before any organ damage can happen, t cells have to produce  granzyme b , which is why this is an early detection method," said gabe kwong, a co-principal investigator in the study and an  assistant professor in the wallace h. coulter department of biomedical engineering at georgia tech and emory university . 
 "this is sensitive enough to possibly detect budding rejection before you see significant injury to the transplanted organ and that could help clinicians treat early to prevent damage," said dr. andrew adams, co-principal investigator and  an associate professor of surgery at emory university school  of medicine. "right now, most tests are aimed at organ dysfunction, and sometimes they don't signal there is a problem until organ function is below 50 percent." 
 kwong and adams published the study's results  in the journal  nature biomedical engineering  on february 18, 2019 . the research was funded by the national institutes of health, the national science foundation and the burroughs wellcome fund. 
 bristly nanoball 
 the nanoparticles are put together with iron oxide in the middle like a ball. it is double-coated with  dextran , a sugar, and  polyethylene glycol , a common ingredient in laxatives, to keep the body from disposing of it too quickly. 
 bristles made of amino acids stick out from the iron ball with fluorescent "reporter" molecules attached to their tips. 
 the particles are injected intravenously. they are too big to accumulate in native tissue or to pass through the kidneys and out of the body but small enough to accumulate in the tissue of struggling transplanted organs, where they keep a lookout for rejection. 
 exploiting rejection 
 once t cells start secreting granzyme b, it severs amino acid strands in the transplanted organ's cells, triggering the cells to unravel and die. 
 "the nanoparticles' bristles mimic granzyme's  amino acid targets  in the cells, so the enzyme cuts the bristles on the nanoparticle at the same time," said kwong who directs the laboratory for synthetic immunity in the coulter department. "that releases the reporter molecules, which are so small that they easily make it through the kidney's filtration and go into the urine." 
 in the experiment, the animals' urine glowed and could be seen in their bladders in near-infrared images. 
 [ready for graduate school? 
 here's how to apply to georgia tech. ] 
 comprehensive method 
 the researchers plan to augment their new sensor to detect the other major cause of transplant rejection,  attacks by antibodies , which are not living cells but proteins the body creates to neutralize foreign entities. 
 "antibodies kill their target cells through similar types of enzymes. in the future, we envision a single sensor to detect both types of rejection," kwong said. but there is even more potential. 
 "this method could be adapted to tease out multiple problems like rejection, infection or injury to the transplanted organ," adams said. "the treatments for all of those are different, so we could select the proper treatment or combination of treatments and also use the test to measure how effective treatment is." 
 outdoing biopsies 
 biopsies are currently the gold standard in detection but they can go wrong, and the wide, long  needle  can damage tissue. 
 "the biggest risk of a biopsy is bleeding and injury to the transplanted organ," adams said. "then there's the possibility of infection. you're also just taking a tiny fraction of the transplanted organ to determine what's going on with the whole organ, and you may miss rejection or misdiagnose it because the needle didn't hit the right spot. " 
 the urine test gets a more global reading on the whole organ, and it has other advantages over biopsies. 
 "the biopsy is not predictive. it's a static snapshot. it's like looking at a photo of people in mid-jump. you don't know if they're on their way up or on their way down. with a biopsy, you don't know whether rejection is progressing or regressing," kwong said. 
 "our method measures biological activity rates, and that tells us where things are going." 
 immunosuppressant medications 
 that could also allow clinicians to carefully dose powerful  immunosuppressant medications  that the vast majority of transplant patients receive. 
 "adjusting the dose is very difficult but very important because heavy immunosuppression increases occurrence of infections and patients who receive it also get cancer more often," kwong said. 
 for this experiment, the researchers used small skin grafts on mice and got a very clear, timely signal from the nanoparticle sensor. since organ transplants represent a lot more tissue, the researchers believe that any occurrence of organ rejection would trigger a much larger signal from the sensor.

 new immunotherapies can dramatically defeat cancer. but more often, cancer evades them, and doctors need to know quickly when that happens, so they can adjust treatment. an experimental urine test to detect immunotherapy effectiveness very early has received a major funding boost. 
 the national institutes of health has granted $1.8 million to a research project at the georgia institute of technology, where 
 the lab of gabe kwong 
 has already established a platform to detect complex disease and immune activity. kwong will use the new funding from the nih's national cancer institute to advance the platform to evaluate immunotherapy progress. 
 the platform uses an intravenous injection of "activity sensors," nanoparticles that detect early enzyme activity of immune cells attacking cancer. the sensor confirms the attack with a fluorescent signal in the urine. 
 shifty resistance 
 cancer's defenses are crafty and can thwart treatment from the start or disrupt initially successful treatment later on, so progress must be continually monitored, which kwong's lab is engineering the particle to do. early resistance to therapy looks very different from later resistance. 
 "we need to be able to classify different forms of resistance, so we can combat them better," said kwong, an  assistant professor in the wallace h. coulter department of biomedical engineering at georgia tech and emory university . 
 he plans to adapt the sensing technology to profile those subtleties. it is already engineered to have advantages over other tests that have recently entered the market, which look for signals that come later, such as dead cancer cells shedding their dna into the bloodstream. 
 "these tests can be quite effective, but some issues limit them, particularly in early detection: you have five liters of blood. whatever the cells shed gets diluted significantly in your bloodstream," kwong said. 
 that makes these signals harder to detect in blood tests. 
 enriched signals 
 "our sensors' signals get concentrated in the urine, so, not only are they not diluted in the blood, but we usually see a hundred- to thousandfold signal enrichment." 
 kwong's lab has already developed the sensors, which are biocompatible nanoparticles, refined them as a reliable platform, and engineered variations that experimentally sense blood clots, liver fibrosis, 
 organ transplant rejection , and cancer. kwong has 
 published multiple papers 
 on activity sensor urine test successes. 
 kwong's endgame ambitions: "in five to ten years, we want to expand the platform to detect most all major complex diseases and progress in treating them." 
 q & a 
 what is the activity sensor and how does the urine test work? 
 the sensors are nanoscale balls with bristles made of short amino acid strands that have fluorescent "reporter" molecules attached to their tips. the sensors tend to accumulate in compromised tissue like cancer. 
 when immunotherapy -- which can be engineered t cells or the body's own t cells aided by medication -- attack cancer cells, the t cells secrete an enzyme called granzyme that severs 
 target amino acid strands 
 in the cancer cells, triggering their death. the activity sensor's bristles mimic those strands, so granzymes cut the bristles at the same time. 
 "that releases the reporter molecules, which are so small that they easily make it through the kidney's filtration and go into the urine," said kwong who directs the laboratory for synthetic immunity in the coulter department. 
 then the urine turns a fluorescent color that can be analyzed to determine the intensity of the immunotherapy's attack on cancer. 
 [thinking about grad school?  here's how to apply to georgia tech. ] 
 is there a need for this kind of test? 
 "many patients, especially those with solid tumors, are not responding to this treatment," kwong said. "the non-responders need to be detected very quickly." 
 there are also diagnostic pitfalls the experimental sensor is devised to overcome: for example, a current measure of treatment success is tumor shrinkage, but when t cells initially cram into a tumor, it can swell. that sometimes leads doctors to believe that a therapy that is actually very effective is not working, and they may discontinue it. 
 "this test does not measure size; it measures activity," kwong. "if those swelling tumors are very high in granzyme activity, that's a great sign, and we will be able to pick that up." 
 how is the dream of detecting most known complex diseases even feasible? 
 quite conveniently, the human genome produces "only" 550 proteases, a particular type of enzyme relevant to detecting and combating disease. kwong believes researchers can adapt this platform to detect any of them and that there's a need for that. 
 "granzymes are also activated by other things like an infection, so detecting granzyme alone risks getting interference when you're looking at cancer treatment effectiveness. we're developing a panel of sensors that gives us the specificity of t cell activity in tumors over the possible activity of t cells fighting, say, a cold," kwong said. 
 "we want to build 550 different protease-detecting probes, and depending on what disease you have, they would expose a profile of the proteases in varying ratios." 
 the probes could be combined into a cocktail to detect budding cancer, immunotherapy effectiveness or infections, and machine learning would analyze their respective fingerprints in the urine signals.

-0.9706 liberal arts voice team expands on-call services with rainn 
 georgia tech voice is expanding their services by partnering with rainn, a national sexual assult hotline service with trained staff that will provide additional service to the georgia tech community. 
 apr 13, 2022 
 - atlanta, ga 
 voice , georgia tech's sexual violence prevention and victim-survivor support program, has been available 24 / 7 for several years. they are now expanding their services by partnering with rainn, a national sexual assault hotline service with trained staff that will provide additional service to the georgia tech community. this expansion centralizes the support service to a single phone number (404.894.9000) instead of calling one number during the day and the georgia tech police department (gtpd) after hours. 
 "victims and survivors of sexual violence come from a diverse range of backgrounds, experiences, and identities. in order to effectively support them, we have to offer an array of options for them to reach out for assistance and support at georgia tech. this partnership with rainn helps us expand beyond gtpd and other existing avenues for seeking help," said luoluo hong, vice president for student engagement and well-being, who is herself a campus rape survivor. 
 rainn has a national reputation for its 24 / 7 / 365 hotline that is used by peer institutions as a university-branded service. rainn volunteers responding to calls will identify themselves as representatives of the voice hotline. they receive extensive training in the areas of sexual violence, trauma, and crisis intervention. they also receive training about georgia tech and atlanta-specific resources. if students need to access additional services such as transportation to a rape crisis center or police department, assistance with a time-sensitive academic accommodation, or resolution of safety concerns, rainn will convey those needs to the voice advocate. 
 as part of georgia tech health initiatives, 
 voice 
 is a confidential resource, independent from law enforcement or the title ix office. during the summer of 2020, voice moved to enhance its system so that all students would feel safer and more comfortable accessing voice services. 
 voice will continue to provide the same services to students who experience any form of sexual violence, including sexual assault, sexual harassment, intimate partner violence, or stalking. classmates, friends, family members, and others who support survivors can also reach out for services and information on how to help. 
 voice commemorates sexual assault awarness month (saam) in april with teal ribbon day today, april 14. all yellow jackets are invited to pick up a teal ribbon on tech green and wear it on april 14 in honor of all sexual violence victims and survivors.

 follows the preservation and translation of a lost, ancient epic through the points of view of three different characters across time. one is a young orphan growing up in constantinople in the early 1400s, another a librarian in the modern-day united states, and the third a young girl on a ship flying through outer space. while taking place centuries apart, each story is intricately connected to weave a beautiful tale of love, loss, and perseverance as the story of 
 cloud cuckoo land 
 is passed down generation after generation."

 the blind assassin 
 by margaret atwood, anchor (2000) 
 " the blind assassin 
 is a beautiful piece of historical fiction that takes place in a fictional town in canada during the 1900s. it follows three storylines. the first is about a woman named iris and her deceased sister, laura, who published a book called 
 the blind assassin 
 posthumously. iris details their lives during the great depression. the second story is that of laura's book, which describes meetings between an unnamed man and woman. in these meetings, the man spins the woman a tale about a blind assassin from another planet. this is the third story, which is a science fiction tale that reflects the life of its teller. the novel is intriguing from start to finish, and the switch between stories makes every new piece of information feel fresh as you put together the pieces of laura's story."

 "forget the 
 communist manifesto 
 - this was the book at the heart of the russian revolution, and other revolutions of the time. lenin named a pamphlet for it. nabokov and dostoevsky savaged it. yet it holds up marvelously, 150 years later: the narrative of vera pavlovna's rise to class consciousness and the founding of a successful sewing cooperative; the interwoven essayistic passages of materialist philosophy and utopian socialist theory; and the many, many divagations. keep an eye out for rakhmetov, especially. it's even written in that affected, impossible-to-explain, quintessentially russian style that some find quite difficult not to love. among the most influential novels, and loads of fun, too."

 malina 
 by ingeborg bachmann, translation by philip boehm, new directions (2019) 
 "i have a soft spot for prose by poets. barnes' 
 nightwood, 
 the prose-poetry of jacob, mallarme, and baudelaire - this is the best of those. like every postwar austrian novel, it's about fascism - its direct effects on body and psyche; its infiltration into even innocent social relations; the collective guilt those from collaborating countries assumed - but in a hitherto-unexplored, all-encompassing sense. this is an uncomfortably intimate portrait of a woman trapped in an aestheticized, insincere, 
 violent 
 world; her foundering, her mental-physical-intellectual collapse, her, well, erasure. be warned: it's incredibly dark. and while no actual sexual assault occurs (probably), its narrator does relive past trauma in that realm."

-0.9933 STEM while promoting diseases like cancer, these enzymes also cannibalize each other 
 finding a drug to inhibit cathepsins could treat a litany of diseases. this study is a new beginning to understanding them.

 like motley bandits, certain enzymes implicated in cancer and other diseases also annihilate each other. a new study reveals details of their mutual foils in the hopes that these behaviors can be leveraged to fight the enzymes' disease potential. 
 the bandits are cathepsins, enzymes that normally dispose of unneeded protein in our cells. but in unhealthy scenarios, cathepsins can promote illnesses like cancer, atherosclerosis, and sickle cell disease. many experimental drugs that inhibit them, while effective, have failed due to side effects that could not be well explained, so researchers at the georgia institute of technology abandoned the common focus on single cathepsins to model three key cathepsins as a system. 
 the researchers found that the cathepsins, denoted by the letters k, l, and s, not only degrade extracellular structures - proteins outside of cells that support cells - but also cannibalize, distract, and deactivate each other. cathepsins are proteases, enzymes that degrade proteins, and since the cathepsins are themselves proteins, they can degrade each other, too. 
 cathepsin  three stooges 
 "auto-digestion is my personal favorite. think about it: you take a group of cathepsin ks, and they eat each other. why? because they're just closer to each other than to what they would otherwise eat," said the study's principal investigator manu platt,  an associate professor in the wallace h. coulter department of biomedical engineering at georgia tech and emory university . 
 in disease, cathepsins appear to be like  the   three stooges  in a porcelain shop, tearing the shop down while they torment each other. as a result, early on, when the georgia tech researchers tried to influence a single cathepsin in the group, outcomes were puzzling, and the researchers felt they might be onto something relevant to past mysterious drug failures. 
 through lab experiments and mathematical calculations, they arrived at a computational model that showed how single influences ripple through the system. they published the  model as a tool online  that other researchers can use to jigger the three cathepsins in group settings, their levels of available targets, and inhibitor chemicals. the tool contrasts cathepsin bungling with cathepsin effectiveness. 
 the researchers publish their research results in the journal the  proceedings of the national academy of sciences  in the week of january 20, 2020. the research, which took a systems biology approach, was funded by the national science foundation and the national institutes of health. 
 q&a 
 how do cathepsins go wrong? 
 the three cathepsins in this study are best known for their activity in cell organelles called lysosomes under healthy conditions, where they work like molecular woodchippers to cut protein down to amino acids. 
 "they also serve functions in specific cell types, such as  cathepsin s  helping the immune system to recognize what to attack and what not to," platt said. 
 "problems happen when cathepsins get overexpressed and end up in the wrong places. they're crazy powerful and degrade the structural proteins elastin and collagen that make up arteries, tendons, the endometrium, and many tissue structures." 
 "in healthy settings,  cathepsin k  breaks down old bone to recycle calcium. but when breast cancer comes, those cancerous cells make cathepsin k to destroy collagen around the tumor. and that allows the cells to escape and metastasize to the bone," platt said.

 how is this research relevant to drug development? 
 "i study cathepsins in illnesses like tendinopathy, endometriosis, atherosclerosis, cancer, and sickle cell disease," platt said. "so, having a drug on the market to handle cathepsins would be a big deal." 
 "many cathepsin inhibitor drugs that have failed clinical trials were very finely targeted but caused big side effects, and some of those cathepsin inhibitor drugs did not even cross-react with other cathepsins they were not targeting - which is usually a good thing - so the cause of the side effects was a mystery," platt said. "by modeling a system of cathepsins, we think we have a good start toward uncovering that mystery." 
 "if we don't know how these cathepsins are working with and against each other in complex systems, similar to how they exist in our bodies, then we are going to have a hard time getting anything into the medicine cabinet to inhibit them." 
 the study floats ideas on new approaches to drug research. for example, cathepsin s could be strategically boosted in situations where it is not the culprit to break down cathepsins k and l. 
 what can other researchers expect from the online model? 
 "they can set up their own experiments and make predictions, including what inhibitors will do, so they can test inhibitors at varying strengths in this system," platt said. "they can ask questions that they can't answer yet experimentally then test the model's predictions in the lab." 
 the model processes varying inputs into resulting changes in cathepsin levels and outcomes of degradation and indicates whether they have been deactivated or demolished. scenarios can be exported as a report and a data spreadsheet.
